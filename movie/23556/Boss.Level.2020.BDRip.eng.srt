PRESS START

00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,777
EXPERIMENT 139

4
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,838
Get up. Watch your head.

5
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:34,758
Shoes, trousers .... Fold, shirt.

6
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,720
On the left. I'll take this.

7
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:43,726
Block, punch. Knife replacement.

8
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,978
Catch, flip.

9
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,107
Okay. Can anyone have coffee?

10
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,985
You can imagine getting up every day

11
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,404
with a bastard like Mr. Goodbye,

12
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:58,240
what are you trying to chop you with a machete?

13
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:59,742
Seriously.

14
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:04,747
It could be fun for a while.

15
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,998
You're dead!

16
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,752
Once the shock subsided,

17
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:12,254
as soon as i realized what the hell was going on,

18
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,007
almost for the fortieth,

19
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,009
it started to get pretty annoying.

20
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:19,261
And I wanted it to stop.

21
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,639
And I knew it wouldn't stop.

22
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,060
You know how to say, "I can do it with my eyes closed,"

23
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,229
and do you think what the hell is that?

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,147
But ... That's bullshit.

25
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,732
So watch out.

26
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,282
I'm sorry, man, they mistaken you for me.

27
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:53,420
Every time I saw this happening in my apartment, I thought:

28
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,298
"Damn, I'm renting!"

29
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,760
The owner is already such a nice bastard

30
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,763
and that's how I can say goodbye to bail.

31
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:21,574
It wasn't always like that.

32
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,077
I used to be happy. Really.

33
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,080
I used to have a woman I loved

34
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,667
but now I'm really fucked up.

35
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,980
Shit. I have to jump.

36
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:07,620
I hadn't hit that truck exactly twenty-two times before.

37
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:11,332
Do you know what it's like to fall out of a fourth floor window?

38
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,339
So that fucking hurts.

39
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:35,105
The guy in that Dodgi always yelled like they were taking him on knives.

40
00:04:35,147 --> 00:04:38,776
-They're stealing my car! -So you write that.

41
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,113
Another bunch of bastards tried to kill me in that minivan.

42
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,741
-Can't you get out of that traffic jam? -Don't teach me to drive.

43
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:49,119
-I don't teach. - Esmeralda's driver with her mother Pam.

44
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,831
I didn't have a couple, if that's their real name,

45
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,207
there was no time for greetings.

46
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,323
After that bus, it's pretty cool and I can ...

47
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,827
Wait. Have I gotten on that bus yet?

48
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,289
Born.

49
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,124
Prokristap .na.

50
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,250
God!

51
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,547
Don't worry about me.

52
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:43,507
EXPERIMENT 079

53
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,468
This crap happens every day.

54
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:49,471
I used to complain about how it looks the same every day.

55
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,015
Then came May 9

56
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,601
and every day is the same now.

57
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:04,069
Every time you are awakened by screaming, the same bastard with a machete,

58
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,072
all the same ... with minor variations.

59
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,284
To the dog ...

60
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,211
Only one thing never changes.

61
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:23,964
And that is that ...

62
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,759
I die every day.

63
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:29,929
Every time.

64
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,223
A small recap.

65
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:36,644
To be honest,

66
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,354
I have no idea why they want to kill me

67
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:41,357
or what I deserve, but there are clouds.

68
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:42,900
You already know Pam.

69
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:47,863
She took care of me fourteen times before I revealed the timing.

70
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,741
EXPERIMENT 069

71
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,745
This angel bastard is Guan-Jin.

72
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,749
How come I know her name?

73
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,252
I'm Guan-Jin!

74
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:03,671
And Guan-Jin is over.

75
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,798
Her name means Goddess of Mercy.

76
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:07,174
Pretty ironic, isn't it?

77
00:07:07,716 --> 00:07:09,760
EXPERIMENT 088

78
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:14,431
I call this little guy Bumprásk.

79
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:20,145
-How are you, handsome? -What are you doing, you nut?

80
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:23,649
I don't like this approach.

81
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,653
I gave them all nicknames: Pam, Smiley,

82
00:07:27,695 --> 00:07:29,780
German twins, Roy number 2,

83
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:33,325
which is a bastard that looks exactly like me.

84
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:35,327
EXPERIMENT 104

85
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,329
Sometimes I can kill them.

86
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,543
But that's not the point.

87
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:47,506
They always find me and eventually take me down.

88
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,966
I'm Guan-Jin!

89
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,927
And that's what Guan-Jin did.

90
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:55,347
I don't know how it's possible, or why I keep repeating the same day.

91
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,141
There was never time to find out.

92
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,685
It's been crazy since I open my eyes.

93
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,353
EXPERIMENT 048

94
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:02,479
IN PROGRESS

95
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,524
Jemma, the only woman I've ever loved,

96
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,485
and the only person who knows the answers I'm looking for.

97
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:16,702
-Hello? -I'm looking for Dr. Jemma Wells.

98
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:17,745
Who is it?

99
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,956
This is her husband ... her boyfriend Roy.

100
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:24,919
Renowned Captain Roy Pulver, the Delta Force.

101
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:26,670
Who are you?

102
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:30,966
-Colonel Clive Ventor. -Jemmin's boss.

103
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,677
-Until recently. -Is he there?

104
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:38,516
-No, unfortunately he's not here. -Do you know when he'll be back?

105
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:43,479
I will have to leave this question to force majeure.

106
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:48,776
-She is dead. -What?

107
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,779
I don't like to bring bad news,

108
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,741
but Miss Wells broke her neck last night.

109
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,577
It was an accident in the laboratory,

110
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,247
she worked overtime, probably exhausted.

111
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,331
Born...

112
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,169
May I ask you where you are?

113
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:13,259
-One two...

114
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,135
It wasn't an accident.

115
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:16,345
Three!

116
00:09:19,849 --> 00:09:22,142
Why is she dead? Who killed her?

117
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:25,062
I've never lived long enough to find out.

118
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,148
Okay, where did we end up? Yeah, that bus.

119
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,861
TRIAL 140 IN PROGRESS

120
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,239
Bitch!

121
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:58,345
-She looks pretty determined. -Honey, we have cowboys here.

122
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,472
I'll probably have to start taking it seriously.

123
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:05,436
What the hell?

124
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,355
Naser yes!

125
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,364
Shit!

126
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:16,799
I think they deserved it.

127
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:33,065
-Hey, Roy. -Hello, Jake.

128
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,778
You look like you've dug out of a grave. What happened?

129
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,864
I got up with my left foot. I'm fine.

130
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:44,076
It still is now. Would you give me a good bottle of brandy?

131
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,038
You know what? Give me two now.

132
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,207
Two! Jesus Christ!

133
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:55,045
Long live the liver! But not for long.

134
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,172
I'm kidding.

135
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:59,049
Non-anonymous alcoholics, huh?

136
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:03,637
-You have to live today, don't you? -Because no one will guarantee you tomorrow.

137
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,473
That's what you write, man. You write that.

138
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,935
This guy's on write-off.

139
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,395
How can you get drunk like that?

140
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,110
-How can you not get drunk? -You know,

141
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:22,865
a lot of security experts think, and remember, I'm one of them,

142
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,577
he thinks that next September 11 will go against our distilleries.

143
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,540
The percentage of alcoholism in our country is someone around 38,

144
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,542
so when you delete ...

145
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,419
This pablb is called Dave.

146
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:38,422
He's a security specialist at a private company

147
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:43,135
and it doesn't matter what I tell him, how can I get drunk like that,

148
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:46,847
because he always starts talking like that stupidly.

149
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,101
I can repeat it word for word.

150
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:54,897
I know exactly what will happen as soon as I enter.

151
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:58,442
At 11:05, this famous Chinese fencer will enter.

152
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:00,319
She has been world champion twelve times.

153
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,029
Sakra. Dai Feng!

154
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:05,783
-Do you know that she is one of the most famous ... -Chinese sword masters?

155
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,160
- Twelve times ... - World Champion.

156
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:10,704
-Did I tell you about her? -Three times.

157
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,706
Fact? I do not remember.

158
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:16,377
-I do. -Pedro, prepare a table for Sifu Feng.

159
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:18,879
Hello. Please sit down.

160
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:23,634
Sifu Feng is the reason why I have to squeeze into the bar.

161
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:27,179
As soon as I arrive at eleven, he occupies the last free spot at the bar.

162
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,561
Shit. She looked at me.

163
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,605
-Have you ever had a woman? -I'm sorry?

164
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:43,696
-Have you ever had a woman? -I threw a fishing rod, you know?

165
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,700
It's more like a bird growing on your forehead.

166
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,538
So around noon ...

167
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:56,333
Okay. From what comes, I feel a little silly.

168
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,547
But I just like the way he whips himself. I'm sorry.

169
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:04,383
I should probably warn him, but it's just funny

170
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,927
and I'm not laughing much right now.

171
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:10,723
You're going to play it at work, Pedro! No one will believe you!

172
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:14,810
At 12:20, Dave finally drops to work.

173
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:20,024
Hope terrorists don't start spending the world's supplies of liquor.

174
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:22,860
But first he makes this witty remark.

175
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:26,363
I really hope so.

176
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,574
-That's too much. - Sit down, Dave.

177
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:32,703
-What? -I want to tell you a story.

178
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a jerk today. A small twist in the war story.

179
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,087
I started talking about how I died when I had too much to drink.

180
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,507
Have you ever been shot in the face, Dave?

181
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,886
Me.

182
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,723
An interesting thing happened to me before I died.

183
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:55,476
It's been a while.

184
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,395
The bullet was a .45 ACP.

185
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,234
She flew in here, clean.

186
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,986
It flew through my mouth, almost untouched

187
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:09,365
and I remember feeling the taste of steak.

188
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:14,161
Yeah, like a really nice rib.

189
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:20,000
And in a moment, when I was alive again,

190
00:15:21,126 --> 00:15:22,127
I say, "Damn,

191
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:27,424
that was my tongue as the bullet baked it for me. "

192
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,760
I could feel the taste. My tongue.

193
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:33,013
Would you believe that? This is absolutely fascinating.

194
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,061
That story is true, Dave.

195
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,079
That was good, man.

196
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,832
Wouldn't you need a bed?

197
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:01,917
I understand.

198
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,921
Exactly at 12:47 ... no,

199
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,673
I'll get to that in a moment.

200
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:12,636
About a quarter of an hour before, I really like the booze

201
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,930
and I feel damn good.

202
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,560
Once I get to this bar,

203
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,604
I can drink until they find me.

204
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,483
I can break down completely to shit

205
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,363
and don't even feel shit.

206
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:39,872
12:47. I never got over that point. Never at all.

207
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,668
Why do I allow it?

208
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,086
Well, why not?

209
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:51,217
Because outside this bar, wherever I run and fight the way I want,

210
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,427
I never survived 12:47.

211
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,638
He always got me.

212
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,975
A bunch of nuts I didn't even know killed me because

213
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,519
which remained a mystery to me.

214
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,111
And she's dead. My girl.

215
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,282
She died a moment farther than I can go.

216
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:19,411
Caught here in a loop of a never-ending day.

217
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:23,541
I know I can't drink,

218
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,919
not when every day doesn't end like this.

219
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:31,382
I need a plan now. Someone has to pay for it.

220
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:35,135
They have an army. I only have time.

221
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:38,055
Yesterday was many months ago.

222
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:41,183
YESTERDAY

223
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,573
Great.

224
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:59,702
Yeah, it's good.

225
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:14,508
-Would you give me a second, please? -Sure.

226
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,222
My God, woman.

227
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:23,642
Look at you.

228
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:28,898
-Hi. -Hi.

229
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:38,699
Have you developed a phone allergy?

230
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:42,995
No, I'm back now. My cell phone is turned off and I didn't stand a chance

231
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,872
set up a landline, so ...

232
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:47,541
-So they turned it off too? -Yeah.

233
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,129
-I'm lucky to stay in touch with me at all. -Yeah.

234
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:57,760
Finding you at the bar on the ground floor of your house takes a lot of luck.

235
00:18:58,469 --> 00:18:59,637
What was the chance?

236
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,517
Welcome, sarcasm. How have you been, stranger?

237
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,727
I have not heard about you for a long time.

238
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,272
-What is it? -I brought a resume.

239
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:18,030
The printer was running low on ink, that part of the Delta Force is hard to read.

240
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,701
Does it reduce my chances?

241
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:29,375
Come here.

242
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:35,214
Uniforms are worn here.

243
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:36,298
Yeah, that's great.

244
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,260
-I need ... -They're not ... Wow!

245
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,847
They're not the burgundy security guards at the mall, I can't stand that.

246
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,851
Burgundy, like ... my dress?

247
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:50,354
Not like your dress, because it would be sexy.

248
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:51,939
-I'm just saying. -Okay.

249
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:56,026
However, what is the salary here?

250
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,028
Do you have any idea? And health supplements?

251
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,240
Because I have, from before, special units.

252
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,827
What are you doing here? It's pretty big.

253
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:08,205
-Do you work on it for a long time? -I hope long enough.

254
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,250
What is it, anyway?

255
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:16,172
Five years of sleepless nights and continuous research.

256
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:19,758
And it means more to me than you can imagine.

257
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,803
-What is he doing? -What is he doing?

258
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:26,015
If used incorrectly,

259
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:30,728
it cancels time and space and destroys the integrity of the planet.

260
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:35,858
Damn it. Something like Judgment Day?

261
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,570
You have to be pretty stressed out.

262
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,660
Wow, let's look at Joe.

263
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,247
God, he grew that way, Jemma.

264
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,001
Would you mind if I took him?

265
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,507
That picture. Photo. Do you have another one?

266
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:02,426
Sure, take her. How much do you weigh?

267
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:09,934
I keep fit, about eighty.

268
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,271
-Are you still drinking? -Yeah. -I'm writing 85.

269
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,151
Did you think you'd tell him?

270
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:23,531
It would mean a lot to me, Jemma.

271
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:29,411
What good would that do him? You've been gone most of his life.

272
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:35,292
Why do you say that like it's not worth me to know him now?

273
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,840
-My job took me away from you. -Your job? -Yes.

274
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:47,304
Your work? You loved that life more than the thought of sharing it with us.

275
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:51,642
The shooting was more exciting than diapers and station wagons.

276
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,270
Clearly. And we have your eternal excuse.

277
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:58,566
I'm the bastard who didn't stay, was I?

278
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:00,651
What else does it matter?

279
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:05,156
We both decided, we moved on, and Joe admires you anyway.

280
00:22:05,573 --> 00:22:07,449
-He admires me? -Yes.

281
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:10,327
What does he say about me?

282
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,169
What do you want, Roy?

283
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,257
I lost you.

284
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:27,720
I know I screwed up. I came to terms with it.

285
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,183
Please don't let my son do that either.

286
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:34,059
I'm not asking for anything more.

287
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:38,355
He's our boy, Jemma.

288
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:43,068
-Doctor Wells. -Just a minute.

289
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,820
I'm sorry, Brett.

290
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:46,822
This is Roy. Roy, Brett.

291
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:49,200
He's the head of security here.

292
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,994
Your office is in a restricted area, Dr. Wells

293
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,039
-and is therefore inaccessible. -I clearly explained to the colonel

294
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,542
that I will accept the visit if I deem it appropriate.

295
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:01,962
I just brought my resume.

296
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:08,177
We are not currently accepting ...

297
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:11,096
- Captain Powder. -Tell him I'll be right there.

298
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,517
The colonel is waiting.

299
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,105
Nice bastard.

300
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:26,028
-Didn't you say you were hiring? -They're recruiting. We're recruiting.

301
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,157
I'm recruiting.

302
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,327
What are you talking about?

303
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,872
This is a very specific security detail.

304
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:39,166
Something secret, like a black backpack?

305
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,919
-More. -Really?

306
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,421
When do I start?

307
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:47,591
Earlier than you think.

308
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:52,388
I read the man's biography and I see cause for concern.

309
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:53,931
It doesn't look like much.

310
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:59,770
No one notices flies until they swim in the soup.

311
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,440
I don't like something about him.

312
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:06,819
He has that ... feature.

313
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,697
What feature?

314
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:14,201
A striver who tries to make up for a lack of talent with exaggerated diligence.

315
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:17,329
That's how I learned to hate.

316
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:22,084
Check his service history. If he's sitting, I want to watch him.

317
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,838
If he makes trouble, we'll deal with him.

318
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,842
And extend it beyond the ordinary,

319
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:34,180
so that no one can connect it with us. The more random the assets, the better.

320
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:36,307
Find something really exotic.

321
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:40,311
Okay, so I'm falling out of here, I'll have wine, maybe ...

322
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:42,229
-Wait, I'll fix your hair. -Oh, Jemmo!

323
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:46,942
I am bleeding.

324
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:51,155
-Did you get my birthday present? -What are you doing here? You are acting strange.

325
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,032
Did you get it? I sent it to you.

326
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:56,494
-I do not know. I didn't look. -Do it. I sent it a few days ago.

327
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,246
So yeah. Of course I'll take a look.

328
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:02,875
Dr. Wells, can I meet you?

329
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:08,589
-I'll have to go to the hospital. -I'll be there in a moment, Colonel.

330
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:12,176
- You spilled my blood. -Listen to me carefully now, Roy.

331
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,679
I know we haven't seen each other much lately

332
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,431
and I know our paths have parted.

333
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,975
-I know, but when I ... -Listen! It's important!

334
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,894
-Good good. Speak. -Okay.

335
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,146
I forgot how difficult it is.

336
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:30,486
I see a lot of you in Joe, really.

337
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,657
His determination, his will to succeed no matter what.

338
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,869
It has your best qualities, but also your selfishness

339
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:42,206
and your ability to disappear when it suits him.

340
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:44,917
-I thought it was over. -And escape from responsibility.

341
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:48,254
Okay, fine. What do you want from me? Say it to me.

342
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:52,591
I want a man I fell in love with a long time ago,

343
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,552
the one who gave me a son

344
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,555
your strong, confident version,

345
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,560
not Roy, who breaks down every night to run another barbie.

346
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:18,826
Remember this: Osiris. Osiris.

347
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,178
Look, like the Frišten brothers.

348
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,349
Carbohydrates are not your friends.

349
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:50,441
-Doctor Wells, are you okay? -Yes.

350
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:55,070
-Do you mind the smoke? -No, not at all.

351
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:04,622
That Spindle.

352
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:10,252
Well, there's a slight delay at the moment.

353
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:13,881
Define the change.

354
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,592
A week, a maximum of two.

355
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:22,973
-And why? -Research and development is not an exact science.

356
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:27,978
But that's exactly what we want, exact science.

357
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,775
Your friend, Captain Pulver.

358
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:37,112
-Yes, he brought a resume. -What did it occur to him?

359
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:42,618
Well, maybe I've mentioned a military presence in the lab in the past.

360
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,495
And did it occur to you?

361
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:50,793
The security protocol of this device should not be the subject of an intimate conversation.

362
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,671
I can assure you he is not.

363
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,549
-Roy and I are not ... -You are the mother of his child.

364
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:06,016
Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

365
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:09,270
I don't want it to look like an interrogation.

366
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:21,073
I'm not into long stories. I am always pleased with brevity.

367
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,242
The shorter the better. However,

368
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:27,663
I myself have one story to tell again and again

369
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,082
and I will share it with you now,

370
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,709
if you give it to me.

371
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:36,422
-I like long stories. -Then we're both lucky.

372
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:43,679
So, in 1979, I worked for the CIA in Burma,

373
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,348
I smuggled opium into the country to suspend it

374
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,642
a very bloody military coup, which we then

375
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:50,394
staged ten years later.

376
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,980
All this is usually top secret. Most.

377
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:56,275
Anyway, I was

378
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,903
in the jungle near Rangoon,

379
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:01,864
shelled soldiers of the Karen National Union

380
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:06,452
during the three days of fighting that cost me an entire unit.

381
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:13,083
I was on the verge of being rolled over by a gang of rebels waving their machete,

382
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,878
with crazy attitudes and even worse hygiene

383
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,465
and I only had one repeating rifle with a telescope

384
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,760
and 36 hours without sleep in which I was to win.

385
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:26,680
And then I heard it.

386
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:32,394
That piercing scream,

387
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,855
as when steam is whistling.

388
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,068
Wild boar.

389
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,530
You can make it into your pants.

390
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:46,408
The sound itself dispelled the rebels.

391
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,661
Nobody wanted to play with those canines.

392
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:53,165
And that son of a bitch felt me ​​and went right after me.

393
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:58,379
I'd rather shoot ten guys than kill an animal, but than I would

394
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,967
He got a choice, she came down from the six-meter banana

395
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,514
dark python and wrapped it in a roaring pig like Christmas ham.

396
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,059
I've never seen anything like it.

397
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,980
And for the next few hours, I watched in amazement,

398
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:18,816
how the snake swallows and the pig digests it.

399
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:22,778
There was a sudden silence, so I heard everything.

400
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,491
How his bones are broken, his bellows whistling, his lungs ruptured

401
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,035
which made a sound as if the snake was laughing.

402
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:38,586
It remains the most amazing act of violence I have ever seen.

403
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:41,672
But I was most impressed,

404
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:47,094
that even though the python spread its jaws to devour its victim,

405
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:53,100
she had calm and a cold calculation in her eyes.

406
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,399
And only later, when she moved her middle part,

407
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,443
now the arched outlines of the boar,

408
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,612
I saw a dozen eggs.

409
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:06,447
Python eggs.

410
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,743
The boar almost trampled on her nest.

411
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:14,997
So what I originally thought was an act of aggression,

412
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,249
it was, in fact, an act of love.

413
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,504
The serpent killed the boar not out of resentment,

414
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:27,635
but to preserve his future generations.

415
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,601
I enjoyed the story.

416
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,522
And I enjoyed his story. And I consider it apt.

417
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,526
-As? -No more visitors in the lab.

418
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:48,113
No ex, flares or shadows from the past,

419
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,992
if the work is delayed.

420
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,289
-I want to be informed immediately, okay? -Of course.

421
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,667
Thank you, doctor. Great.

422
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,808
Be careful where you step.

423
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:36,078
-Will you have more? -Other what?

424
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,668
You're sweet.

425
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,715
How long have you two known each other?

426
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,134
We met today.

427
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,554
-He's my new best friend. -Yeah, I am.

428
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:59,810
-Alice is a dental hygienist. -What's gone because I hate my teeth completely.

429
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:02,605
Only that of their structure makes me sick.

430
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:07,026
-Then a career in dentistry looks like ... -As the last thing I should do?

431
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:11,906
Yes, I know, I know. But I am for every challenge.

432
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:16,118
I like to push out of the comfort zone.

433
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:20,664
- That's the only way to really grow up. -The gospel truth.

434
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:24,460
She's so pretty, isn't she? Beautiful.

435
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,047
How long have you two known each other?

436
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:31,717
With Gabrielle? As long as I go to drink at this bar.

437
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:37,181
-What came back from overseas. -Danger. Tell me!

438
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,809
Ladies, there's almost nothing to tell.

439
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:46,232
-Then tell us almost nothing. -But can you wait? Because...

440
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,860
I have to go pee. I'll be right back.

441
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,618
You should take her home, Roy.

442
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,747
You should take her home.

443
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,962
You have to ask:

444
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,674
"Why shouldn't I take you home, Gabrielle?"

445
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,509
And I will say ...

446
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:18,305
Maybe other time.

447
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,893
You're starting to get broken.

448
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,145
But that night will never come.

449
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:32,403
We can have fun, Roy, but we'll never make love.

450
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:35,906
-But, love. -No. -Why?

451
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,741
-Why? -Yeah.

452
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,831
Because you still love ... someone else.

453
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,168
I can see it in your eyes.

454
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,963
In that sadness.

455
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,220
You long for a woman, but I'm not.

456
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:03,350
And not even our dear hygienist.

457
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:14,361
Bar, hello? Yeah.

458
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,657
-It is for you. -Who can call me now?

459
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,328
-I do not know. -Hello?

460
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:26,248
-Roy, can you hear me? -Come on? What...

461
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:29,084
Are you still in the lab? It's almost three in the morning.

462
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,086
Jemma, are you okay?

463
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,796
-Are you OK? -Yeah, I am, but ...

464
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,841
-What's happening? Listen ... -You listen to me.

465
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,095
Maybe I did something crazy

466
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:43,265
and if something happens, promise me you'll do what you're doing ...

467
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:48,354
-I can not hear you. -I'll need your help.

468
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,564
What's happening? Are you okay?

469
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,526
I can't explain it to you, you still wouldn't understand ...

470
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,489
I think I lost you.

471
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:01,408
Jemma, call me, okay?

472
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:06,497
-Who was that? -My ex ...

473
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,917
And she looked pretty overworked.

474
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,429
Our dear doctor seems to be a villain.

475
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:25,766
Find her.

476
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,605
What did I miss?

477
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,190
Hi.

478
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:38,779
We talked about the sexiest people on the planet and your name came up.

479
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,976
I should have called Jemma, but I was drunk and horny and I didn't care.

480
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,687
I didn't know how important it was.

481
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,941
I didn't know it was the last time I could hear her voice.

482
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,569
There is nothing to undo.

483
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,617
And you're forced to do something over and over again.

484
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,119
EXPERIMENT 141

485
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,001
I know all this leads back to her.

486
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,421
I just had no idea what this was all about.

487
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,256
Did you get my birthday present?

488
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,342
Did you get it, the present?

489
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,013
-I do not know. I didn't look. -Do it. I sent it a few days ago.

490
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:52,019
Remember this: Osiris.

491
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,777
"Happy birthday, Roy. Always live your life forward and remember:"

492
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,029
"Time is not waiting for anyone."

493
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,659
No to mi poser!

494
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,207
Let's do it again.

495
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,291
EXPERIMENT 142

496
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,548
They're stealing my car!

497
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,605
Damn!

498
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,029
Come on, come on, let's go.

499
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,701
-Dude, damn it, finally come on. -It's in my way!

500
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,411
Finally.

501
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,412
EXPERIMENT 143

502
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,541
They're stealing from me ...

503
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,174
Don't read while you're driving, idiot.

504
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,036
How come I don't notice it?

505
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,710
Damn, I missed the descent to China.

506
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,671
The last time I went elsewhere, I ended up really bad.

507
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,714
EXPERIMENT 051

508
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,593
For obvious reasons, I call this Smiley.

509
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,020
Being shot is at least as simple and clear as a slap.

510
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,066
Yeah, I got him!

511
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:04,026
Who would have thought of such shit?

512
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,486
I got him!

513
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:13,702
TRIAL 144 IN PROGRESS

514
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,914
I've been running from my life all this time.

515
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:20,543
Now, for the first time, I had a clue as to what could happen.

516
00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:25,673
Now I need a moment's peace of arms and a quiet place to read.

517
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,556
Osiris and Isis were faithful couples.

518
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,935
She was an Egyptian high priestess, an ideal mother and wife,

519
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,312
protector of the dead,

520
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,067
proficient in all incantations for the journey through the afterlife.

521
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,197
Osiris was his enemies

522
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,951
eventually chopped into 14 pieces and distributed throughout Egypt.

523
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,621
What kind of gift is this?

524
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,878
Happy birthday, Roy. Always live life ahead and remember:

525
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:07,089
Time is not waiting for anyone.

526
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:17,933
Joe. What the hell is he doing?

527
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,194
Damn.

528
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,573
He didn't know his mom was dead and now he was completely alone,

529
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,869
I'm his only family now.

530
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,006
-How's it going, man? -Admission is ten dollars.

531
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,091
Five per round, double elimination.

532
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,969
What do you get when you come here?

533
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,140
-Tourning tournament. -And what is this?

534
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,226
Video game competitions.

535
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,229
We mostly make retro games from the eighties.

536
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,981
Double Dragon, Altered Beast, Street Fighter.

537
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,527
We are purists, bro. Devoted to the golden age of video games.

538
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,864
Analog or death. Osmibit is shit.

539
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,119
-How old are you? -Four one. It's flying.

540
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,871
-Forty-one? -Yeah.

541
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:25,000
-Do you have a son here? -I'm childish on purpose, bro.

542
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,336
By whom?

543
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,589
Keep it.

544
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,969
Joe, hi.

545
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,141
-Hi dude. -Roy, hi. What is?

546
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,727
Let's look at you, you're out.

547
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,564
The last time I saw you, you were like that.

548
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,735
-I didn't know you were steaming. -I don't steam.

549
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:38,365
-So what are you doing here? -I wanted to ask you the same thing. Don't you have to be in school?

550
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,868
She dropped us.

551
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,746
Come on, man. You don't need that.

552
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,207
Well, I couldn't go.

553
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:51,462
These are my favorite games. And Mom would be upset that I was here.

554
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,464
Mom would be upset.

555
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,842
You know what? I won't tell her if you tell me one thing.

556
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:01,013
-Okay ... -What did you buy from the guy upstairs? The older one?

557
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:05,226
-I didn't buy anything. -Joe, I saw you.

558
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,652
This is an RPG card game. I exchanged it with him.

559
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,489
You can be any killer, mercenary and such.

560
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,158
-It's really cool. -I bet.

561
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,287
Did you get this from him?

562
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,040
Did you think I was buying drugs or something?

563
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:32,002
-Or something like that. -I'm eleven, I can't do this.

564
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:38,008
-You can never do that, okay? -Yes? -Yeah.

565
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,513
Okay. Come on, let's jump on the candle, I want to talk to you, okay?

566
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,058
-The screen is just as broken. -It's a scumbag. Come.

567
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,478
-Are you hungry? -Yeah.

568
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,440
-Yeah? And what do you like best? -Pizza.

569
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,027
Pizza? So let's have pizza. What about sushi?

570
00:44:57,153 --> 00:45:00,197
-I don't like sushi. -No? As?

571
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,826
-Because it's sushi. -Yeah, that makes sense.

572
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,164
I should have told him now.

573
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:13,335
Tell him his mom is dead. That he would never see her again,

574
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,963
-Tell him that ... -You know, Mom says you're thick.

575
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Hustej.

576
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,427
-Is that what he says? -She didn't use that word,

577
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:25,681
but he says you're like a Marine or a soldier.

578
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,352
-Dom's talking about me? -Yeah, pretty much.

579
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,604
Lots of?

580
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:40,446
Look, are you like that guy, the one from 96 hours who has special abilities?

581
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,657
-Liam Neeson? -Jo.

582
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,578
No, he's a fictional tough guy. I'm real.

583
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,164
-Fact? -I'm not kidding you.

584
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,624
That is great.

585
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,090
Hi, Joe.

586
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,640
I have to tell you something, buddy.

587
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,769
But it won't be easy to listen to, okay?

588
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,481
But there is no easy way to say it.

589
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,699
Twelve fifty.

590
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,452
Three minutes longer than I've ever lived.

591
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,913
How is that?

592
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,627
The interior is all metal.

593
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,422
Then I got under the surface.

594
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,055
They're watching me.

595
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,909
What did you want to tell me, Roy?

596
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,472
Joe...

597
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,729
I'm your father.

598
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,482
With all that fear

599
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,359
I saw my son's love for a split second.

600
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,070
And it was wonderful.

601
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:50,743
Please, let this death be the last.

602
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,332
Son of a bitch!

603
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,506
-How are you watching me? -You're screwed!

604
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,925
Should I get angry? Where is the device?

605
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,511
-In your ass. -You're full of ideas!

606
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:13,140
-Shit on you. - Fine, sir.

607
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,648
Hi dude!

608
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,484
Good. If you have to, you have to!

609
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,486
Where's the tracker?

610
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,156
It must be here somewhere. But where?

611
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,158
Shit.

612
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,287
Pedro, don't you want to help me look?

613
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,460
And then I said, "I see your counterintelligence expert

614
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,463
and I'll train you with a surveillance prevention specialist, my friend. "

615
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:47,883
-You should have seen their expression. -You are a fool!

616
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,135
-Dave. -Hi, Roy. -Hi.

617
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,889
-Sorry I'm interrupting. -I just told Jake about those bastards ...

618
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,767
I see, great. Dave, you know something about surveillance devices.

619
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,311
I don't know anything about these things, Roy.

620
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,815
I know absolutely everything about those things!

621
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,152
-What equipment? A traditional transponder? -What is given to people.

622
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,946
-For the body or the implant? -What is better?

623
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,323
If you don't want him to know he's being watched.

624
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,617
Then the implant is far more suitable.

625
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,037
-The other one puts on clothes. -Where is it implanted? Where would you put him?

626
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,584
-Most people think it's just under the skin. -Where would you put him?

627
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,336
-You mean me, personally? -You, personally.

628
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,213
Daveova specials.

629
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,968
What does that stupid term mean? Yeah. Yeah.

630
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:36,182
He understands that. Teeth, Roy. Ideally a chair.

631
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,560
You're doing your ass off.

632
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,230
You look very pretty in that mask.

633
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,236
You don't have to be afraid of anything. Just take a deep breath.

634
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,322
It will be over soon.

635
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,621
In addition, your mouth acts as a natural carrier.

636
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,622
-Dave? -Ano?

637
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,751
Would you look at your teeth and see if I have the device there?

638
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,045
Well, not if he's in someone's mouth.

639
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,714
-I could find out if the tooth was removed. -Jaku,

640
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,258
a good bottle of brandy and two tongs.

641
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:20,643
No no no! Damn wounds of God!

642
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,020
Don't worry, Dave, he'll grow up again.

643
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,815
Have you lost your mind? No, you need help!

644
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,067
You could help me. So, what do you think?

645
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,778
-No. -Are you sure? -Absolutely. -What time is it?

646
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,823
-Hell. It's 12:45. -Shit. Just two minutes.

647
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,535
It's time to stop tearing your teeth out of your mouth. Are you crazy?

648
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:42,665
Shit. No no no! God!

649
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,126
I was supposed to sit fucked at home.

650
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,295
Look. Look!

651
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,800
-God. -What is? -Yeah. That tooth.

652
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,886
-There's an irregularity on that tooth. -Fact? -Yes.

653
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,932
God. I'll have to look inside.

654
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:04,687
-Roy? -Yeah. -Carefully. Good?

655
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,774
Carefully. No, that's not careful!

656
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,409
-She son of a bitch. -God.

657
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:23,205
Roy? Someone dumped a sea of ​​money to watch you.

658
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,292
-Seriously? -Yes. A lot. I have never...

659
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,212
See you soon, Dave.

660
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,006
EXPERIMENT 145

661
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:42,433
-Who put the tracking device in my mouth? -A guy named Brett.

662
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,935
Mr. Vejtaha, sown bald man,

663
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:49,523
two-meter Dynow security chief with colored beards.

664
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:50,566
Well.

665
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,611
He makes a big hole in my chest.

666
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,321
-How are you? -Jaku.

667
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,326
I need a bottle of brandy and two tongs. Brown.

668
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:09,627
I've died forty-four times today,

669
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:15,007
but this particular day I was finally able to do something about it.

670
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,532
Let it go.

671
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,785
-What, that tooth? -No, not that tooth.

672
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,831
No, I won't let her go.

673
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,875
Either you let her go or I let her into you.

674
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:54,797
This is a handmade Walther PPK that cost me almost half a million at auction.

675
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,299
Did you buy a banger for half a mega?

676
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:02,972
And she had her personal rifleman equip her with a classic SD-22 silencer,

677
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:07,518
of which there are only six in the world, for another $ 250,000.

678
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,605
-750,000 bucks. -Exactly.

679
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,317
Why would you, Pam, do anything like that at all?

680
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:20,322
-Pam? -I don't know your name, so I'm just calling you Pam.

681
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,201
- Have we met before? -Many times, many times in the past.

682
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,037
I want to look. Slowly.

683
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,790
Hold her by the bow.

684
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,712
Treat it like porcelain, please.

685
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,715
Gently like a spider web.

686
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:46,348
-AH? -Adolf Hitler.

687
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,519
-What? -Personal gift from Carl Walther.

688
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,062
Hitler had it on his desk in Munich.

689
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,316
Have you been killing me with Hitler's all the time?

690
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,152
-Stolled by an American soldier in 1945. -Jesus Christ.

691
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:00,362
-What is the matter with you? -Preserved to the present.

692
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,824
-She was behind every penny. -I thought it couldn't be worse, but it is.

693
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,829
-Who sent you? -You don't want to know.

694
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,956
-I insist. -Never.

695
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,044
-Will you kill me now? -No, Pam, I'll shoot you.

696
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,257
This is for the Jews.

697
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,180
This too.

698
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:46,492
I have got him! Come on, boy!

699
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,910
I got him!

700
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:51,914
Jemma got me here for a reason. I don't know how, I don't know why.

701
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:56,001
He must have had a good reason. Damn, he must have been great.

702
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,796
Look, you lost your phone.

703
00:54:58,838 --> 00:54:59,839
But she's gone now.

704
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,883
I won't get that far to save her,

705
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,386
so none of this matters now.

706
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,430
There was only one piece left of the business.

707
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,267
Retribution.

708
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,441
It's getting hot in here.

709
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:23,404
-Did you liquidate the asset? -You mean assets. Plural.

710
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,531
-Marshall. -Hi, Brett.

711
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,492
Don't ask who it is, you know exactly.

712
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,911
-Where's Marshall? -Which one is the one with the bomb?

713
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,037
What do I call him Bumprásk?

714
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,499
Well, he's on a big barbecue together now.

715
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,086
We only have two members left. You and the bastard who ordered it.

716
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,967
-You assume there's someone above me. -You're a dog, you have to have a lead.

717
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,719
I want the one holding him.

718
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,096
I want the one who killed Jemma.

719
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,973
I think it's Ventor.

720
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:57,313
-But you know where we are, you cannon. -Yeah, and I know how to get there.

721
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,732
I'll meet you in a minute, son of a bitch.

722
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,406
The big boss probably has a rooftop view,

723
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:11,327
but I no longer want to die in that vile, inconspicuous way.

724
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:15,206
Let's take care of it. By opening the front door.

725
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,348
That was a good plan.

726
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,895
I'll gouge out his eyes.

727
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,356
EXPERIMENT 146

728
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,923
State!

729
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:10,928
Back!

730
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,145
I can do it all day, asshole.

731
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,814
EXPERIMENT 147

732
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,697
Hi, Roy number 2!

733
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,420
Goodbye, Roy No. 2.

734
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,405
Roy number 2 was unarmed and I know for sure

735
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,616
that I won't carry a gun around these guys.

736
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,130
Pane?

737
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:35,888
Oh, yes, of course. Sorry.

738
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,851
Access denied.

739
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,234
This ... My fault.

740
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,198
EXPERIMENT 148

741
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:58,786
How are you?

742
00:59:07,837 --> 00:59:09,129
Hi, Roy.

743
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:14,510
Am I playing a little on Butch with Sundance here?

744
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:15,803
Born.

745
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,179
Hope dies last.

746
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:22,810
That was weird.

747
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,020
EXPERIMENT 149

748
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,235
Zkurvysyn fucking.

749
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:43,247
EXPERIMENT 150

750
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,600
Hi, handsome.

751
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:06,687
In a few dozen cases, you cut off my head.

752
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,231
Someone must be the diligent bee.

753
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,863
What are you going to do about it?

754
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,410
What should you cancel a little?

755
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:28,584
Do you remember in the Conquerors the guy who kept spinning his sword and thinking how cool he was?

756
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,795
Indy shot him because he was annoyed, impatient

757
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,132
-and it just pissed him off. Do you remember? -Yeah.

758
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,012
Damn.

759
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:47,269
Maybe you don't know anything about sword killing, because with the exception of experiment 15

760
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,981
sword killing hurts far more than a shot.

761
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:54,652
And one lesser known fact about swords.

762
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,491
When they come out, it hurts many times more.

763
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,244
Fun fact: Harrison Ford needed shit,

764
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,912
that's why he shot the guy.

765
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:06,831
EXPERIMENT 151

766
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:15,506
I am Guan-Jin.

767
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,758
And Guan-Jin is over.

768
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:19,802
EXPERIMENT 152

769
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,313
I am Guan-Jin.

770
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,649
And Guan-Jin is over.

771
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,317
EXPERIMENT 153

772
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,323
I am Guan-Jin.

773
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:43,534
And Guan-Jin is over.

774
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,286
EXPERIMENT 156

775
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,972
I'm Guan-Jin and I'm done.

776
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,058
And this isn't even the worst part.

777
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:11,562
That's this. Ventor.

778
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:13,606
The man who killed Jemma.

779
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,443
The idiot who had me killed one hundred and fifty times.

780
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,447
Captain, the first impression is that this is a first-class commodity.

781
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,784
The way you destroyed these first-class professionals,

782
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:27,495
is truly remarkable.

783
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:30,873
You should be pleased with your efforts, regardless of the result.

784
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,835
As someone who bears the same scars from the fight I hope

785
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:38,506
that this defeat, however bitter, is a consolation.

786
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:45,471
He had to memorize the crap, because it was the same word for word.

787
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:50,017
And every one that I watched died, and rested, and there were many,

788
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,019
I see one thing in common.

789
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,522
They have it in their eyes.

790
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,483
Their view is the same at that moment.

791
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:00,152
Remorse, regret.

792
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,739
What could I do? What didn't I do?

793
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,661
All our good intentions are bleeding with us.

794
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,375
But what if we could remake our world and erase our mistakes?

795
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:18,003
What if the ability to rewrite history was real?

796
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:23,217
-Adolf Hitler, Pearl Harbor. -I never survived this moment,

797
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:25,010
so all this shit is new.

798
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:30,266
In whose hands would you entrust an instrument as powerful as Osiris' spindle?

799
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,269
I have your answer, Captain.

800
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,229
To mine.

801
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:38,649
A man who knows the burden of human suffering

802
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:41,277
a man who understands, like you, the horrors of war.

803
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,530
Who else should oversee and operate such a tool?

804
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,450
Exactly.

805
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,413
I'm sorry, Dr. Wells.

806
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:56,542
She has led us as far as her flawed ideology has allowed her.

807
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,252
Sweet girl.

808
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,965
When you came here, you wanted blood on your hands.

809
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,594
And you have blood too.

810
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,096
Just not mine.

811
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:17,229
He is really sharp. There's no blood on it either.

812
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:20,608
-Is that a katana? -Catana? That's Japanese.

813
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:24,487
-This is a Chinese sword. -Let's not make races out of it. It's a sword.

814
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,071
Fold?

815
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,325
Now I know three things. First:

816
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,994
The next time I see this guy, I'll turn with him.

817
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,581
Second: I'm stuck in something called Osirid's spindle.

818
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:38,626
And third: Ventor has no idea it's working.

819
01:04:39,335 --> 01:04:43,756
Jemma somehow got me into this and started it, but why?

820
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,761
She resurrected her dead husband, Osiris.

821
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,931
Osiris became the ruler of the dead

822
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:55,267
and the afterlife.

823
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:01,273
I 'm Osiris.

824
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:19,792
Jemma sent me to the Spindle to stop them, stopping Ventor.

825
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,796
She needed me to repeat it as long as I could.

826
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,006
She had ... She believed me.

827
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:29,510
Shit, she still believed in me.

828
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,054
She knew I could beat them.

829
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:43,983
Hello. I need to learn to fight with a sword.

830
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:46,694
I have no idea what you just said.

831
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:52,950
I need to learn to fight with a sword.

832
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,413
There's something fascinating about you that I like.

833
01:05:58,497 --> 01:06:00,666
I fly home to Shanghai in the morning.

834
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:05,713
-I'll only have one day. -It can be done in one day.

835
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:08,841
EXPERIMENT 158

836
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:19,059
EXPERIMENT 161

837
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,733
I'm a beginner, but I'm learning fast.

838
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:29,320
The one holding it makes him a weapon, Roy.

839
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:33,491
The sword is no more an improvement on you than a set of keys.

840
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,744
I have some training behind me, but I want to work hard.

841
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:40,039
In the secondary hands, the Jian sword is nothing more

842
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,458
than a low-quality piece of hardened steel.

843
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:47,630
But in the most determined grip and under the supervision of the most penetrating eyes

844
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:51,091
becomes a tool of extermination.

845
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:55,137
I had a very good teacher, but I need to learn more.

846
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:57,014
EXPERIMENT 174

847
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:02,269
EXPERIMENT 198

848
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,573
EXPERIMENT 200

849
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:20,371
Hi, handsome.

850
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,918
Are you giving up?

851
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:34,426
You're not going to fight a sword, are you?

852
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,515
I like your confidence.

853
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,811
Normally I tend to be more clever.

854
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,106
I have one thing on my tongue.

855
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:49,817
But it will wait.

856
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:53,654
Shit pretends to be made of steel.

857
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:15,217
You zkurvysyne.

858
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:05,768
I wanted to say this:

859
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,396
I'm Roy. And Roy's done it.

860
01:09:24,912 --> 01:09:25,830
Mrs.

861
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:28,499
Fold?

862
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,044
I smell muffins. Can you feel them too?

863
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:41,428
I'm breaking up.

864
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:43,556
And now I'm blind.

865
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:49,603
-Looks like a two-foot-tall unicorn. -You slick bastard.

866
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:55,234
-Are you going for that gun? -I'm not going.

867
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:57,319
-And do you know why? -No.

868
01:09:57,403 --> 01:10:00,281
Because it will be a great satisfaction for me to beat my soul out of you.

869
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:21,469
How is that?

870
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,054
If you say so?

871
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:29,810
-Spindle. She activated it. -And she sent me in, man.

872
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,979
She sent me inside to stop you,

873
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:35,983
then you killed her because she knew what you were, Ventor.

874
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:40,154
Wannabe dictator, determined to remake the whole world.

875
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:42,615
Fucking liberals.

876
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:46,118
Before releasing her Doll Maria, she bothered to mention

877
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:49,872
that a spindle reaction, if it lasts too long, can destroy an entire planet?

878
01:10:49,914 --> 01:10:53,042
Don't worry, moron. When the world is over, you won't see it.

879
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,336
The spindle gives us the power of God

880
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:58,631
to transform our whole world, without tragedy.

881
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:02,510
-Adolf Hitler, September 11th. -Close your beak with the speech.

882
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:06,764
The past is the past, Ventor. She was created to stay behind us.

883
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:09,308
We live and learn from it.

884
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,353
Says an absent husband and a failing father.

885
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:19,026
I don't think you'll have any extra interest in transforming things.

886
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:24,615
-What about your son? -My son?

887
01:11:24,657 --> 01:11:25,908
Little Joe, right?

888
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,870
If you came here to kill me,

889
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:32,164
so who will save his?

890
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:40,381
It never occurred to me that Joe was in danger.

891
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:44,885
In a million years, I wouldn't have thought to focus on him.

892
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:50,558
I'll kill Ventor and all those bastards a thousand times if they hurt him.

893
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:56,313
Sir, sir, behind the roadblock, sir. You can't go there.

894
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:01,986
Look, buddy, you have to get a roadblock.

895
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:19,461
How many times have I let him die?

896
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:22,840
My son!

897
01:12:34,643 --> 01:12:37,688
This is my son! I have to save my son!

898
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,233
Born!

899
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,246
And here it is.

900
01:12:56,081 --> 01:12:57,291
End of the world.

901
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:58,751
Why not?

902
01:12:59,585 --> 01:13:00,669
Mine is over anyway.

903
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:06,342
I feel it. Not just death,

904
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:10,054
but how I fall apart. Every bit of mine splits on and on,

905
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,555
along with everything else.

906
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:15,893
There is nowhere to run and the only person who can help is dead.

907
01:13:16,227 --> 01:13:18,229
What if I avenged her?

908
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:21,732
I'm the one who killed her. Not Ventor, me. I did it.

909
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:23,943
I killed her by fleeing our relationship.

910
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:26,612
Before raising our son. I killed her ...

911
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:28,781
When I didn't call her back.

912
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:32,660
I'm the reason she's dead.

913
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:35,037
I'm the reason Joe is dead.

914
01:13:36,831 --> 01:13:38,666
I am the reason for the end of the world.

915
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:40,125
EXPERIMENT 205

916
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,585
What is this for?

917
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:44,755
Why should I even try?

918
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:47,550
Nothing will ever matter again.

919
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,138
Not when you lose everything you've ever loved.

920
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:58,686
Not if you are responsible for the end of the human race.

921
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:01,021
Good job, you bastard.

922
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:13,826
Can't you let me sleep well at least once?

923
01:14:17,288 --> 01:14:18,664
So that's how it is.

924
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:20,958
That's how it is.

925
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:25,379
Will you just feel sorry for yourself? Forever, day after day?

926
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:29,925
Won't you do shit even if you can't do shit?

927
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,052
Born.

928
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:33,762
You will.

929
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:36,056
You will do something.

930
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:59,663
Time means nothing now. He no longer works against you.

931
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:00,706
They're stealing my car!

932
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,251
You never knew your son, so ...

933
01:15:04,668 --> 01:15:06,128
If nothing else remained ...?

934
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:09,965
It's more than you ever deserved.

935
01:15:16,347 --> 01:15:17,389
Hi, Joe.

936
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:22,561
Roy, what are you doing here? What happened?

937
01:15:22,603 --> 01:15:24,104
I fell out of the barracks.

938
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:25,981
Will you lock up the school?

939
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:32,154
-I'll guess. Sports tournament. -How do you know?

940
01:15:32,947 --> 01:15:35,241
-Where do you think I'm going? -Are you a steamer?

941
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:36,992
Hundred percent.

942
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:40,371
I saw you on the X-box every time I stopped, but I didn't want to

943
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:41,914
reveal to mom, you know?

944
01:15:42,498 --> 01:15:45,793
I like the classic games of the eighties,

945
01:15:45,835 --> 01:15:48,838
-jako Altered Beast a Double Dragon. -A Street Fighter?

946
01:15:48,879 --> 01:15:50,506
I like that best.

947
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,384
-I also. -Yes? -Yeah.

948
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:56,887
-But I also like new things. -Hello, Roy,

949
01:15:57,471 --> 01:16:00,182
do you think mom will be upset that i went to school?

950
01:16:01,976 --> 01:16:05,271
You know what? She will be upset.

951
01:16:07,148 --> 01:16:10,693
But I'll cover for you, okay?

952
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:14,071
-Good. -But no more squabbling, okay? -Okay.

953
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,324
-Good? -Clearly.

954
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:22,538
So let's play Street Fighter.

955
01:16:23,581 --> 01:16:25,541
-You'll die. -You will die.

956
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,710
You will die and lose.

957
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,298
I screwed up. But I'm still alive!

958
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:35,676
This game is so old! What's his name? Glaca?

959
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,012
Galaga. Galaga.

960
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,722
Right in the face!

961
01:16:40,848 --> 01:16:42,600
-I won anyway. -Of course.

962
01:16:45,227 --> 01:16:46,228
K.O.

963
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:50,191
-You won! -Why do you like the game so much?

964
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:53,569
There are a lot of people chasing you and you have to kill them.

965
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:56,113
-To byl power boost. -Super arugula.

966
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:58,449
-Byla to arugula? -Arugen.

967
01:16:58,491 --> 01:17:00,075
I shot you again!

968
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:03,496
Arugen!

969
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:06,415
-How did you ...? -You won!

970
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:10,544
-This is where it starts to be a force. -Yeah, get the girl. That girl.

971
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:16,217
You know what? I'll show you how.

972
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:18,511
He still comes here.

973
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:20,596
You have no idea.

974
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:24,642
-I'm not afraid of them. -You're smart for a boy who doesn't go to school very well.

975
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:27,019
I have my ways.

976
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,897
You got me again.

977
01:17:30,523 --> 01:17:32,107
After all, I'm also a master.

978
01:17:32,817 --> 01:17:37,655
I wanted back all the years I had missed.

979
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,369
Jemma had an expression

980
01:17:44,036 --> 01:17:46,163
her acumen, sense of humor.

981
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:48,040
Thank God.

982
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,044
Then I saw him laugh and I saw myself.

983
01:17:52,253 --> 01:17:53,254
Just a flash.

984
01:17:53,379 --> 01:17:55,923
Watch my own face laugh at me

985
01:17:56,799 --> 01:17:58,008
it breaks my heart.

986
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:08,936
I would do this all the time. And I could too.

987
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:18,445
We've ended the day like this more than a dozen times.

988
01:18:19,155 --> 01:18:20,573
It never gets tired.

989
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:24,201
I like how he falls asleep when it's all over.

990
01:18:24,285 --> 01:18:26,203
He doesn't even shake.

991
01:18:34,336 --> 01:18:38,424
I want to tell him that I'm his father, as I did, but I'm scared.

992
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:41,844
I'm afraid he won't look at me like that again.

993
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:44,346
I don't want to see what I saw in his eyes again,

994
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,098
I'm so silent.

995
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:49,727
EXPERIMENT 249

996
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:57,067
I want to have a ship once and take my mom on it.

997
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,237
She doesn't go anywhere at all.

998
01:19:00,613 --> 01:19:03,115
I would like to hire one.

999
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:06,577
-Najmeme si ji? -Loď?

1000
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:08,829
Yeah. And we 'il export mom.

1001
01:19:09,705 --> 01:19:11,832
-Why not? -And when?

1002
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:13,876
Anytime. We can ...

1003
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:17,838
I'll tell him here this weekend.

1004
01:19:18,214 --> 01:19:21,592
Then he sends a message to my mom that we will all go sailing.

1005
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:23,385
This usually happens.

1006
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:24,386
Joey...

1007
01:19:26,597 --> 01:19:29,058
-You know, your mom ... -Yeah?

1008
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:36,232
-Do you know what your mom is working on? -Osiride spindle?

1009
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,610
Do you know what it does?

1010
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:43,364
He can't talk about it, it's super secret or something.

1011
01:19:43,531 --> 01:19:46,826
But I heard her say it could wipe it all out,

1012
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:49,036
like the whole world if they are not careful.

1013
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:50,788
Do you believe that?

1014
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:53,999
Yes I believe.

1015
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:57,127
I wish I didn't believe it.

1016
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:02,299
My mom believed in something and I let her down.

1017
01:20:03,968 --> 01:20:05,177
What do you mean?

1018
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:11,433
-Last night, your mom ... -She didn't come home.

1019
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:16,814
-I know. -Does he have a new boyfriend?

1020
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,444
No. No new friends.

1021
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:25,072
Did she learn I went to school?

1022
01:20:26,282 --> 01:20:28,909
-Looks like you were watching me. -Granted but...

1023
01:20:29,118 --> 01:20:30,911
Not for this reason.

1024
01:20:31,162 --> 01:20:34,248
-So why? -I do not know.

1025
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:38,377
I saw you and I wanted to talk to you. We didn't say much.

1026
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:44,175
Why do you think I was watching you?

1027
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:47,136
Because Mom said something in the morning.

1028
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:51,015
-Wait, what? -In the phone. It was weird.

1029
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:54,226
I'm told if I have a problem, I'll find you.

1030
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:57,980
Joe, it's Mom. Pick up the phone, please.

1031
01:20:58,022 --> 01:21:01,233
-I didn't know what he was talking about. -Did you talk to Mom today?

1032
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:05,070
If something weird happens today, I want you to call Roy, okay?

1033
01:21:05,446 --> 01:21:07,990
-What time was it? -I do not know.

1034
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:11,577
I'll write you his number, but call me again. Hi honey.

1035
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,455
Dude, show me your phone.

1036
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,169
Mom 7:03 in the morning

1037
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:22,213
She was still alive when I woke up.

1038
01:21:22,421 --> 01:21:24,131
Ventor didn't kill her.

1039
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:29,011
She wasn't dead yet.

1040
01:21:37,186 --> 01:21:40,147
Don't worry, son. I'll be back for you.

1041
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:43,359
I'm coming back for both of you.

1042
01:21:56,747 --> 01:21:57,873
You killed her.

1043
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:03,629
-How the hell did you get here? -Where is? Where is?!

1044
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:46,046
-Did you try to erase the evidence? -I was trying to find out what he was doing,

1045
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:49,550
-How she managed to lower the Spindle ... -Shut up, Brett!

1046
01:22:51,385 --> 01:22:53,804
Keep going. Keep going!

1047
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:59,810
We didn't find out how Osiride's spindle worked.

1048
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:05,441
We can't control the chain reaction she started.

1049
01:23:06,609 --> 01:23:10,446
Somehow she sabotaged it and now it's not answering.

1050
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:12,573
Fuck work.

1051
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:15,201
This spindle works.

1052
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:18,996
It's you. She made the missing part of you.

1053
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:22,374
How else would you get into a device?

1054
01:23:24,001 --> 01:23:25,002
How...

1055
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:28,255
How many times have you done this before?

1056
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:32,468
-Many times. -It works.

1057
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,726
She was alive for at least 14 minutes after I woke up.

1058
01:23:42,228 --> 01:23:43,896
I have time to save her.

1059
01:23:52,947 --> 01:23:55,991
Okay. Ok lets go.

1060
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:02,373
Jemma alone can stop this, and I have 14 minutes to get to her.

1061
01:24:02,498 --> 01:24:04,333
Well, let's go.

1062
01:24:14,218 --> 01:24:16,470
The bastard just jumped out.

1063
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:26,939
Leť, you fucking hell. Leť!

1064
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:34,155
I have twelve and a half minutes. Let the shop move.

1065
01:24:34,947 --> 01:24:35,948
Do it!

1066
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:43,914
Have a nice flight, bitch.

1067
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:01,599
And now I want a real KO

1068
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:05,436
Donnybrook. Battle Royale.

1069
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:14,111
Here with them, with everyone, so I can blow them out and I don't waste time.

1070
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:26,373
Because I've been waiting a hell of a long time for this.

1071
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:31,253
Maybe for too long.

1072
01:25:42,473 --> 01:25:45,601
I mean, you know, I don't have all day.

1073
01:26:46,412 --> 01:26:47,454
Hey, Brette!

1074
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:04,388
You came for me.

1075
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:06,807
You did it.

1076
01:27:08,267 --> 01:27:09,393
You came for me.

1077
01:27:13,355 --> 01:27:16,859
-How many attempts did it take? -Only one.

1078
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,989
I do not have much time. Come on.

1079
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,869
I couldn't tell you. They were watching me.

1080
01:27:27,244 --> 01:27:29,455
I had to sneak through the lab all night.

1081
01:27:29,497 --> 01:27:31,373
I barely got the book to you.

1082
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:32,791
It was just right.

1083
01:27:37,463 --> 01:27:39,715
I think Ventor sent someone to Joe.

1084
01:27:40,257 --> 01:27:42,885
No one left, Jemma. It's nothing, everyone.

1085
01:27:45,513 --> 01:27:46,555
Joe receives her.

1086
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:50,392
He went to school for video games, but he's fine.

1087
01:27:51,268 --> 01:27:52,394
How do you know?

1088
01:27:57,149 --> 01:28:00,611
He likes a class girl named Camille,

1089
01:28:00,653 --> 01:28:03,155
who showed all the buses to school,

1090
01:28:03,197 --> 01:28:05,616
but he's afraid to ask her out.

1091
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:10,204
He and his friend Wyatt lied a few weeks ago

1092
01:28:10,246 --> 01:28:13,541
about their age to get to a paintball tournament.

1093
01:28:13,582 --> 01:28:16,001
Remember those bruises on your neck?

1094
01:28:16,502 --> 01:28:18,379
He said something bit him.

1095
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:25,427
He broke his wrist on a skateboard last month

1096
01:28:25,553 --> 01:28:29,515
-and now it's making such a weird sound. -Clearly.

1097
01:28:31,642 --> 01:28:34,311
She loves dogs, especially pugs

1098
01:28:35,229 --> 01:28:37,314
and thinks you should save someone.

1099
01:28:39,066 --> 01:28:41,902
About your birthday about a year ago

1100
01:28:41,944 --> 01:28:44,029
drew Van Gogh's Starry Night with watercolors,

1101
01:28:44,071 --> 01:28:46,699
because he knew it was your favorite picture.

1102
01:28:48,868 --> 01:28:52,621
She thinks Mom works hard and smiles a little.

1103
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,294
But the boy loves you so much.

1104
01:29:04,091 --> 01:29:05,968
How can I stop this, Jemma?

1105
01:29:10,723 --> 01:29:14,602
It's not a stop, Roy. This is a restart.

1106
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:21,984
I used your DNA as the missing part inside the Spindle

1107
01:29:22,234 --> 01:29:26,489
-What does it mean? -That you have to enter the core of the Spindle,

1108
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,115
then, in theory,

1109
01:29:28,782 --> 01:29:33,120
the space-time continuum should be reset and restarted.

1110
01:29:33,746 --> 01:29:37,124
-Theoretical. -I do not know.

1111
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,585
Honestly, I don't know, Roy.

1112
01:29:39,627 --> 01:29:43,506
The whole thing is repaid terribly hastily. I tried to stop Ventor.

1113
01:29:43,798 --> 01:29:46,592
I didn't even know if it worked until you showed up.

1114
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,263
Realize I only saw you yesterday.

1115
01:29:52,223 --> 01:29:54,600
And I haven't seen you in eternity before.

1116
01:29:56,936 --> 01:30:00,272
I didn't know what else to do, where else to turn.

1117
01:30:03,317 --> 01:30:07,154
I knew the man you were.

1118
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,991
I know the man you are.

1119
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:15,871
But I don't know what will happen to you if you go there.

1120
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:21,585
But I know what happens if I don't go.

1121
01:30:27,383 --> 01:30:30,219
Did you see that. End of the world.

1122
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:35,432
-Yeah. -What was it?

1123
01:30:37,393 --> 01:30:42,273
Like everything you can imagine, but a million times worse.

1124
01:30:47,236 --> 01:30:51,157
Will it start if I go through it?

1125
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:53,951
Is it reset? Will you and Joe be safe?

1126
01:30:55,703 --> 01:30:58,664
If you return your matter to the core, it should.

1127
01:30:59,206 --> 01:31:00,958
Maybe you can't do it.

1128
01:31:01,584 --> 01:31:03,043
Maybe you will cease to exist.

1129
01:31:04,086 --> 01:31:05,254
In that case...

1130
01:31:07,006 --> 01:31:09,091
kiss me and tell me you love me.

1131
01:31:19,977 --> 01:31:21,687
I love you.

1132
01:31:35,242 --> 01:31:40,247
-Wait for me, okay? -I'll wait.
