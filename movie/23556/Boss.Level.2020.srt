1
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,550
最後    一關

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,980
按開始按鈕

3
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,980
第139次嘗試

4
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,550
起床 抬頭
Wakey Wakey. Heads up!

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,460
穿鞋 穿褲子…彎腰 T恤
Shoes, pants... Low bridge! Shirt...

6
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,420
左側襲來 刀我收下了
On your left. I'll take that.

7
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,420
擋一招 拍一招 他的刀換手
Block, slap. Knife switch.

8
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,670
扭住他 翻他個狗吃屎
Grip him, flip him.

9
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,800
好了 能喝杯咖啡了嗎
Okay. Coffee anyone?

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,670
你能想像每天醒來
Can you imagine waking up every day

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,090
都有一個不知道哪裡來的混蛋
with some random asshole like Mr Good Morning here

12
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,920
想用一把操蛋的砍刀來砍你
trying to hack you up with a fucking machete.

13
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
真的假的
Seriously.

14
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,420
看來得有一陣子好玩了
This might have been fun for a while.

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,670
你死定了
You're fuckin' dead!

16
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,420
一旦震盪平息
Once the shock wore off,

17
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,920
一旦我意識到了究竟發生了什麼
once I realised what the hell was happening,

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,670
差不多一百四十次了
after nearly a hundred and forty times

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,670
這真的很煩人
it just fuckin' got annoying.

20
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,920
我想要這一切停下來
And I want it to stop.

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,300
但我知道不可能
But I know it won't.

22
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,710
你知道有些人會吹牛 說什麼“我閉著眼都能做到”之類的
You know how people say say, "Oh, I can do that with my eyes closed",

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,880
這他媽都是些屁話
and you always think they sound like assholes

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,800
不過…
But... whatever.

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,380
看我的
Watch.

26
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,920
抱歉 夥計 他們把你錯當成我了
I'm sorry, pal, they've mistaken you for me.

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,050
每次看到我的公寓裡發生這種事 我就想
As many times as I've seen this happen to my apartment, I still can't help but think:

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,920
該死 這房子是租來的
"Fuck, man this is a lease..."

29
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,380
房東本來就是個混蛋
The landlord is already an asshole anyway and...

30
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,380
我的押金肯定是拿不回來了
I'm never ever getting my security deposit back.

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,170
事情並不總是這樣
It wasn't always like this.

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,670
我以前很幸福 真的
I was happy once. I really was.

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,670
我曾經有一個深愛的女人
I had a woman that I loved

34
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,250
但如今我是真的搞砸了
but now I'm just pissed off.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,550
臥槽 我還得跳樓
Ah shit, gotta jump.

36
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,170
之前的輪回裡我有22次錯過了這輛卡車
I missed this truck exactly twenty two times before

37
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,880
你知道從四樓窗戶掉下來是什麼感覺嗎
Know how it feels, falling four storeys to the street below?

38
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,880
真他媽的疼
It fuckin' hurts is how it feels.

39
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,630
在這輛道奇車裡的那個人每次總是大喊大叫
Mr Man's Man in the challenger here screams at date-rape volume every single time

40
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,300
-有人要搶我的車！ -大實話 沒毛病
- I'm being car-jacked! - Yes, you are.

41
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,630
另一批想要殺我的混蛋坐在那輛小車裡
The next set of assholes trying to kill me are in that minivan.

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,250
-你來開這段路行不行 -不用你來教我開車
- Could you get through this traffic, please? - Don't tell me how to drive.

43
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,630
-我不是在教你 -司機是埃斯梅拉達 另一個是帕姆
- I'm not telling you how to drive. - Esmeralda the chauffeur and Pam.

44
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,340
我不知道他們的真名叫什麼
I have no fuckin' idea if those are their real names because

45
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,710
反正也沒有時間打招呼
I never stop to say hello.

46
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,800
經歷公車之後就爽歪歪了我可以……
Now, after the bus it's pretty much smooth sailing and I can...

47
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,300
等等 我已經遇上公車了嗎
Wait a second, did I... Oh shit, did I get to the bus yet?

48
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
不
Nope

49
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,710
看在上帝的份上
God?

50
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,000
別擔心我
Don't feel bad for me.

51
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,920
這些破事每天都會發生
This kinda shit happens every day.

52
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,920
我以前總是抱怨 因為每天看起來都一個樣
I used to complain that every day it felt the same.

53
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,460
然後是5月9日
And then May 9th came

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,050
如今每天都一模一樣了
and now every day is the same.

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,500
每次你一尖叫 就有同一個拿著砍刀的混蛋出現
The same wake-up scream, the same machete-wielding asshole.

56
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,500
一切都一樣，只是略有不同
The same everything, with slight variations.

57
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,710
真他媽的
Motherf... Agh!

58
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,630
只有一件事永遠不會改變
One thing that never changes.

59
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,380
每一天
Is I die.

60
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,170
我都會死
Every single day.

61
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
我又死了
I die.

62
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,630
這裡有一點要注意一下
Here's a little highlight reel.

63
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,050
說句實話
Now, truth be told

64
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,750
我完全不知道他們為什麼要殺我
I don't even know why they want to kill me

65
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,750
難道是我罪有應得 屎話屎說
or what I've done to deserve getting killed, but there's a shit-tonne of 'em.

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,300
你們已經認識帕姆了
You've met Pam.

67
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,250
在我終於找到絕佳的降落時機前 她幹掉了我十四次
She did that to me fourteen times before I finally got the timing down.

68
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,130
這個天屎傻逼就是觀音
This little angel-faced asshole is known as Guan-Jin.

69
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,130
她的名字我是怎麼知道的呢
How do I know her name?

70
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,630
我叫觀音
I am Guan-Jin!

71
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,050
觀音完成任務
And Guan-Jin has done this.

72
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,170
她的名字的意思是慈悲女神
Her name means Goddess of Mercy.

73
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,550
相當諷刺不是嗎
I think she digs irony.

74
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,800
這個矮個子我叫他卡布姆
I call this cocky little motherfucker Kaboom.

75
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,620
-你好呀 帥哥
What's up pretty boy?

76
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,530
你他媽在幹啥 矮冬瓜？
You fuckin' weird old dwarf, what are you doing?

77
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,000
我不喜歡你這個態度
Oh, I don't like that attitude.

78
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,000
我給他們都起了外號 帕姆 笑臉
I gave them all nicknames: Pam, Smiley,

79
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,130
德國雙胞胎 羅伊2號
the German twins, Roy number 2,

80
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,130
是個碰巧長得跟我一模一樣的混蛋
Who just happens tobe some asshole who looks exactly like me.

81
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,670
有時候我能殺掉他們
Sometimes I manage to kill them.

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
但這不是重點
But it doesn't matter.

83
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,840
他們總會找到我最後幹掉我
They always find me and eventually they take me out.

84
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,300
我是觀音
I'm Guan-Jin!

85
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,250
觀音完成任務
And Guan-Jin has done this.

86
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,670
我不明白這是怎麼回事 為什麼我總是在重複同樣的一天
I don't know how this is possible, or why I keep repeating the same day.

87
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,460
我也沒有時間去查明
I've never had time to figure it out

88
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
自從我睜開眼 一切就瘋狂了起來
It's a shit show from the second I open my eyes.

89
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,040
正在進行中

90
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,840
傑瑪 我唯一愛的女人
Jemma, the only woman I've ever loved,

91
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,800
唯一一個知道我要找尋的答案的人
and the one person who has the answers I'm looking for.

92
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,000
-你好 -我要找傑瑪威爾斯博士
- Hello? - Uh... I'm looking for Dr. Jemma Wells.

93
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,050
你是誰
Who's this?

94
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,250
我是她丈...她男朋友 羅伊
This is her husb... her boyfriend Roy.

95
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,210
著名的羅伊普勒上尉 三角洲部隊的那個
Ah, Captain Roy Pulver, he of Delta Force fame.

96
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
你是誰
Who's this?

97
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,250
-克萊夫文托上校 -你是傑瑪的老闆
- This is Colonel Clive Ventor. - Jemma's boss.

98
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,960
-之前是 -她在嗎
- Until recently. - Is she around?

99
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,800
-不 很不幸她不在 -你知道她什麼時候回來嗎
- Well no, unfortunately she's not. - Do you know when she'll be back?

100
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,750
我不得不把這件事歸咎於不可抗力
Now that is more of a cosmic question that I'd have to hand over to a higher power.

101
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,050
-她死了 -什麼？
- She's dead. - What?

102
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,050
我不喜歡告訴別人壞消息
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but

103
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,000
但威爾斯小姐昨晚摔斷了脖子
Miss Wells took a nasty spill and snapped her neck last night.

104
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
是在實驗室發生的意外
An accident in the lab,

105
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,500
加班時她可能已經很疲憊了
working late, likely very fatigued.

106
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,590
不…
No...

107
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,420
我可以問問你在哪兒嗎
Can I ask where you are?

108
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,500
-一 -二
- One. - Two.

109
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,380
這不是場意外
That was no fucking accident.

110
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,590
三
Three!

111
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,380
她為什麼會死？誰殺死的她？
Why is she dead? Who killed her?

112
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,300
我還沒能活得足夠久去查明真相
I've never lived long enough to find out.

113
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,380
好吧 我們在哪兒結束的來著？對了 那輛公車
Okay so, where were we? Oh yeah, the bus.

114
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,460
賤人
Fuck!

115
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,250
-看來他很堅持嘛  -親愛的 遇到牛仔啦
Oh honey, we've got ourselves a cowboy.

116
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,670
我得開始認真對待了
I think I'm gonna have to get serious here.

117
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,630
什麼鬼…
What the f...

118
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,550
我操
Fuck me!

119
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,550
臥…操！
Oh... Fuck!

120
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,920
活該倒楣
Nah, I think they deserved it.

121
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,170
-你好羅伊 -你好傑克
- Hey, Roy. - Hi, Jake.

122
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,880
你看起來像是剛從墳墓裡挖出來 怎麼搞的
You look like death taking a dump. What happened to you?

123
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,960
我只是醒錯了地方 我沒事
I just woke up wrong. I'm fine, Jake.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,170
無所謂這都是常有的事了 你能給我一大瓶白酒嗎
It happens all the time. Can I get a large bottle of that Baijiu, please?

125
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,130
傑克，要不還是給我來兩大瓶
You know what, Jake? Make it two large bottles.

126
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,300
兩瓶 老天爺
Two! Jesus Christ!

127
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,240
我為你的肝默哀
Hear ye, hear ye! Sir Osis of Liver.

128
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
開玩笑的
I'm kidding.

129
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,130
酒鬼所見略同嘛
Alcoholics unanimous, am I right?

130
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,710
今朝有酒今朝醉，明日愁來明日愁
- You know you got today, right Jake? - Because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

131
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,550
好詩啊好詩
Fuckin' A, pal. Fuckin' A.

132
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,000
這傢伙就快廢了
This kids is all about to shut down.

133
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,460
你怎麼能這樣喝酒啊
How can you drink like that?

134
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,170
-你怎麼不能呢 -不能
- How can you not? - You know,

135
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,920
很多國內的安全方面的專家 提醒你一下 我就是這樣的專家
a lot of expert internal security pundits, and mind you, I'm one of 'em

136
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,400
我告訴你 恐怖分子的下一個目標就是我們的釀酒廠了
think that next 9/11 will target our distilled spirits.

137
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,890
就在當下 全國的醉鬼加起來
Now, you have got a country where the rate of alcoholism

138
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,310
酗酒率高達38%
and binge drinking is somewhere in the 38th percentile

139
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,590
如果幹掉了這個國家的酒廠…
so should you wipe out...

140
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,460
這個傻逼叫戴夫
This douchebag's named Dave.

141
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,460
他是一家私人公司的安全專家
Dave is a security specialist at some private firm

142
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,170
無論我回答什麼 “你怎麼能這樣喝酒啊”
and it doesn't matter what my answer is to him asking "how can you drink like that?"

143
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,880
它總是用這麼愚蠢地話來開頭
he always launches into this exact same fucking speech.

144
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,130
我都可以逐字重複了
I know what he's gonna say word for word.

145
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,920
我一進來就知道會發生些什麼事
I know everything that's gonna happen from the second I walk in.

146
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,460
這個著名的中國擊劍運動員將在11:05到達
At 11:05, this famous Chinese swordfighter comes in.

147
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,340
她曾12次獲得世界冠軍
She was a twelve-time world champion.

148
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,050
我去！馮黛
Shit! Dai Feng.

149
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,800
-你知道這是最著名的… -中國劍術大師嗎
- You know she's one of the most famous... - Chinese sword masters?

150
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,170
-12次… -世界冠軍
- Twelve times... - World Champion.

151
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,710
-我跟你提到過她嗎 -快一百次了
- Have I told you about her? - A hundred times.

152
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,710
真的嗎我不記得了呀
Really? I don't remember.

153
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,380
-我記得 -佩德羅給馮師父準備桌子
- I do. - Pedro, prepare a table for Sifu Feng.

154
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,880
你好請坐
Hi. Please, sit.

155
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,630
馮師父就是我要擠進這家酒吧的原因
Sifu Feng, here, is the reason I have to bust my ass to get to the bar every day.

156
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,170
只要我在十一點之後到這 她都會坐在酒吧最後一個空位上
If I get here any later than eleven, she takes the last seat at the bar.

157
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,550
我去 她看我了
Shit. She just stared at me.

158
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,590
-你交過女朋友嗎 -你說什麼
- Have you ever been with a woman? - Excuse me?

159
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,180
你有沒有交過女朋友？
Have you ever been with a woman?

160
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,690
我這是姜太公釣魚 你懂的
I think I'm catching a fish, if you know what I mean.

161
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,670
我看你還不如頂著個小鳥在頭上 別人至少還能看你一眼 兄弟
I think you have a better chance of growing a penis on your forehead, Jake.

162
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,500
大約到中午
At around noon...

163
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,300
好吧 雖然我知道我這麼想是不對的
Okay. I feel a little bit bad about this next thing.

164
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,500
但我就是喜歡看到他滑倒 真抱歉
But I just love seeing him wipe out. I'm sorry.

165
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,340
我應該警告他的 但真他媽好笑
I know I should probably warn him, but it's just so fuckin' funny

166
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,880
我如今可很難有機會笑出來了
and it's not like I got a lot to laugh about these days.

167
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,670
你別在上班的時候給我搞事情 佩德羅 這可不算工傷
You can't file workman's comp. Pedro, no one will believe you.

168
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,750
12點20分 戴夫終於要回去工作了
At 12:20, Dave the pant loaf finally goes back to work.

169
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,340
你最好希望恐怖分子們不會開始對
You better hope the terrorists don't decide to

170
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,760
世界各地的白酒下毒了 羅伊
start poisoning the world's Baijiu supply, Roy.

171
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,800
那也等他們把那個小炸彈送走先
But not before delivering that little gut-buster.

172
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,500
-我給的太多了 -坐下戴夫
- That's too much. - Sit down, Dave.

173
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,630
-什麼 -我想跟你講個故事
- Excuse me? - I want to tell you a story.

174
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,920
我今天被炸了 說個小故事轉個場輕鬆一下
Okay, I'm bombed today. A little twist on the war story.

175
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,000
我開始談論有一次喝多了之後死了的情況
I start talking about the other times I've died when I've had too much to drink.

176
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,420
戴夫 你臉上中過槍嗎
Have you ever been shot in the face, Dave?

177
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,800
我中過
I was shot in the face.

178
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,630
我死前發生在我身上的趣事
A funny thing happened to be right before I died.

179
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,380
已經有一段時間了
This was a while back.

180
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,300
是一顆口徑0.45ACP的子彈
It was a .45 ACP round.

181
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,130
它飛過來 乾淨俐落
Enters here, clean.

182
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,880
穿透我的嘴再飛出來 幾乎完好無損
Bullet winds up in my mouth, almost intact

183
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,250
我記得我能感覺到烤牛排的味道
and I remember tasting steak.

184
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,050
是啊 就像一份美味的肋排
Yeah, like a really, really good rib-eye.

185
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,880
不一會兒 當我又活過來的時候
And it wasn't until much later, when I was alive again,

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
我說 “我去
I said, "Shit,

187
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,300
是我的舌頭被子彈的熱度烤熟了”
that was my tongue being cooked by the heat of the bullet."

188
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,630
我嘗到了自己的舌頭的味道
That's what I tasted. My tongue.

189
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,880
你能相信嗎 太他麼過癮了
Can you believe that shit? That's fuckin' wild.

190
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,920
這是個真實的故事 戴夫
That is a true story, Dave.

191
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,920
好故事啊夥計
Good stuff, buddy.

192
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,670
需要給你張沙發清醒清醒嗎
You ever thought about getting a sober coach?

193
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,750
懂了
Copy that.

194
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,750
就在12點47分不
At exactly 12:47... no,

195
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,500
要我說 在那一個瞬間
let me get to that in a second.

196
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,460
應該說是這十五分鐘，我是真的，真的很興奮
Let's say a quarter 'til, I've usually got a really, really good buzz,

197
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,750
我感覺真的很爽
and I'm feeling fuckin' good.

198
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,380
我一到酒吧
You see, as long as I make it to this bar,

199
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
直到他們找到我前我都可以暢飲
I can drink until they find me.

200
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,300
我可以和喝到完全崩潰
I can get absolutely shit-faced,

201
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,170
不省人事
and not feel a thing.

202
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,670
我從來沒有撐過12點47分這個點
12:47 PM. I've never, not once made it a minute past this point

203
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,460
為什麼我要放棄呢
Why do I let it happen.

204
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
為什麼不呢
Why not?

205
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,390
因為在這個酒吧外 無論我跑到哪裡 戰鬥到哪裡
Because outside this bar, no matter what direction I run

206
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,420
我從未活到過12點47分
and no matter how hard I fight, I have never lived past 12:47 PM.

207
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,420
他們總能幹掉我
They always get me.

208
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,750
一群我甚至都不知道為何要殺我的瘋子
A bunch of asshole I've never met, killing me for reasons

209
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,300
這對我來說是個謎
that remain a mystery.

210
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,880
而我的妹子 她死了
And she's dead. My girl.

211
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,050
她在離我很遠的地方死掉了
Gone in a moment further back than I can ever go.

212
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,170
我陷入了一個迴圈裡 永不停歇
Stuck here in the death loop of a never-ending day.

213
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,300
我知道我不應該讓自己醉成這樣
I know I can't keep drinking my way through it

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,670
不應該每次都以這種方式結束
not when every day ends like this.

215
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,130
我需要的是一個周全的計畫 我需要有人為此付出代價
I need a plan now. I need to make somebody pay.

216
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,880
但他們有一整支軍隊 而我只有時間
They have an army. All I have is time.

217
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,800
昨天就像是幾個月前的事
Yesterday was months ago.

218
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,300
很好
Great.

219
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,420
好很好
Yeah, that's good.

220
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,210
-請回避一下好嗎 -當然可以
- Guys, would you give me a second, please? - Sure.

221
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,920
我的天? 女人
My God, woman.

222
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
看看你
Look at you.

223
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,590
-嗨 -嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

224
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,380
你是對電話過敏了嗎
Have you developed some allergic reaction to phones?

225
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,670
不 我剛回來 我的手機還是關機狀態
No, I just got back. My cell phone is shut off and I didn't get a chance to

226
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,550
也還沒來得及弄座機電話 所以
square away my landline, so...

227
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,210
-所以他們也都關掉了 -是的
- So they shut that off too? - Yeah.

228
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,630
我是說 我真的很幸運
I mean, it's really just luck

229
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,120
-你能和我聯繫上  -是的
- that you got in touch with me at all. - Yeah.

230
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,990
在你公寓樓底部的酒吧裡找到你
The amount of luck it took to find you

231
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,440
真的需要很多運氣
in the bar at the bottom of your apartment building

232
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,300
有多大的可能性呢
What were the odds?

233
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,170
諷刺得真好 你過得怎麼樣 陌生人
Well hello there sarcasm. How you been, stranger?

234
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,380
我很久沒聽到你的消息了
Haven't heard from you in a while.

235
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,920
-這是什麼 -我帶了一份簡歷
- What's that? - I brought a resume.

236
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,670
印表機墨不夠了 三角洲部隊那部分看不太清
The printer I used was low on ink so the Delta Force section is hard to read.

237
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,340
這會降低我的機會嗎
That gonna hurt my chances?

238
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
過來
Come here.

239
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,840
這裡要穿制服
They wear uniforms here. So just...

240
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
是啊這很好啊
Alright cool, yeah.

241
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,880
-我需要 -他們不是 哇喔
- I need to just... - I mean, it's not those...

242
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,460
但願他們不是商場裡 那種穿褐紅色衣服的保安 我可受不了
Those maroon things, like mall security because I can't rock them.

243
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,460
褐紅色 像我的裙子這樣？
Maroon, like... my dress?

244
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,960
不像你的裙子 因為那樣就太性感了
No, not like your dress, because that would be sexy.

245
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,550
-我就那麼一說 -行吧
- No, I'm just saying. - Fine.

246
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,630
不過 這裡的待遇怎麼樣
Anyway, I... What is the salary here?

247
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,630
具體情況你清楚嗎 這裡有那種健康補助嗎？
Do you have any idea? Is there a medical co-pay

248
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,840
因為我以前在特種部隊裡的時候有
because I have pre-existing-- You know with the combat stuff.

249
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,420
話說回來 你們在這裡做什麼 這兒可真大
Anyway, what are you doing here? It looks really big.

250
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,800
-你已經做了很長時間了嗎 -我希望是夠長了
- Been working on it a while? - Just long enough, I hope.

251
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,840
到底是多少
What is that thing, anyway.

252
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,750
五年不眠不休的持續研究
That's five years of sleepless nights and round-the-clock research.

253
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,340
這對我來說比你想像的更重要
And it means more to me than you can possibly imagine.

254
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,380
-它是做什麼的 -它是做什麼的
- What does it do? - What does it do?

255
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,590
如果使用不當
It unmakes all of time and space.

256
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,300
它將摧毀時間和空間 毀滅整個地球
And destroys the planet in its entirety if improperly used.

257
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,420
真的假的？ 就像電影“審判日”那種情形嗎
No shit? Like "doomsday" destroy?

258
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,130
你一定壓力很大
You must be really stressed.

259
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,210
哇喔 看看喬
Wow, look at Joe.

260
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,800
天? 他長大了 傑瑪
Jesus, he's getting so big, Jemma.

261
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,550
你介意我取出來嗎
Hey, you mind if I swap this out?

262
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,050
這張照片照片你還有嗎
This picture, you got another one of these?

263
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,960
當然拿走這張吧 你有多重
Oh yeah sure, you can take it. What's your weight?

264
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,460
我很健康大約80公斤吧
I'm doing a special paleo thing so it's like 175

265
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,220
你還喝酒嗎
Still drinking?

266
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,820
-喝呀 -我寫82公斤吧
- Yeah. - I'll put 180.

267
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,670
你有想過要告訴他嗎
Have you thought about telling him?

268
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,050
這對我來說很重要 傑瑪
It would mean a lot to me if we could tell him, Jemma.

269
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,920
那對他有什麼好處呢 你已經離開了他大半輩子了
Honestly, what would he gain? You've been absent for most of his life.

270
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,550
你為什麼把我現在去瞭解他
Why do you have to say it like that?

271
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,120
說得好像不值一提似的
Like it wouldn't be worth it if I got to know him now.

272
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,140
-是工作把我從你身邊帶走了
My work took me away from you guys.

273
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,340
-你的工作嗎 -是的
- Your work? - Yeah

274
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,980
你的工作嗎
Your work?

275
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,820
你更喜歡那種生活 而不是與我們一起分享
You loved that life a lot more than you loved the idea of sharing one with us.

276
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,130
射擊比尿布和顧家更讓你興奮
Getting shot at is way more exciting than diapers and minivans.

277
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,750
很明顯 對我你永遠都有理?
Right right right, there's your go-to argument and you know that.

278
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,050
我就是那個沒留下來的混蛋是嗎
I'm just the asshole who didn't want to stick around, right?

279
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,130
還有什麼關係呢
What does it matter any more, Roy?

280
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,630
我們倆做的決定 我們向前看 喬還是很崇拜你的
We both moved on, we've made our decision, and Joe adores you anyway.

281
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,920
-他崇拜我嗎 -對
- He adores me? - Yeah.

282
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,800
他怎麼說我的
What'd he say about me?

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,630
你想要什麼羅伊
What do you want, Roy?

284
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,710
我失去了你
I lost you, okay?

285
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,170
我知道我搞砸了我接受
I know that I blew it. I made my peace with it.

286
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,630
我不想這種事發生在我兒子身上
Please don't let that happen with my son.

287
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,500
我不敢渴望更多了
That's all I'm asking.

288
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,800
他是我們的孩子 傑瑪
He's our boy, Jemma.

289
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,500
-威爾斯博士 -等一會兒
- Doctor Wells. - Just a minute.

290
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,250
抱歉 佈雷特
Oh, sorry Brett.

291
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
這位是 羅伊 羅伊 這位是佈雷特
This is Roy. Roy, Brett.

292
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,630
他是這裡的安保主管
Brett's head of security here at Dynow.

293
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,420
你的辦公室是限制區域 威爾斯博士
Your office is in a restricted area, Dr. Wells

294
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,460
-因此不能隨意進出 -我清楚地向上校解釋了
- and is therefore off limits. - I made it clear to the Colonel

295
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,960
我會在我認為合適的時候接待來訪者
that I would accept visitors when I deemed it appropriate.

296
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,380
我只是帶簡歷來 大個子 別激動
I was just dropping off my resume, big guy. It's all good.

297
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,590
我們目前不對外招聘
We're not hiring right now.

298
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,500
-普勒上尉 -告訴他我馬上就到
- Captain Pulver. - Tell him I'll be there in a moment.

299
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,920
上校在等
The Colonel's waiting.

300
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,500
真是個混蛋
What a dick.

301
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,420
-你不是說你們在招人嗎 -他們是在招人 我們正在招人
- I thought you said you were hiring. - They are. We are.

302
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,550
是我在招人
I am.

303
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,710
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,250
是一個專項細緻的特種安保工作
It's a very specific security detail.

305
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,550
是什麼秘密的東西比如黑匣子之類的嗎
Black bag stuff? Like covert?

306
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,300
-不止 -真的嗎
- Beyond. - Really?

307
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,800
我什麼時候開始
When do I start?

308
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,960
比你想的要早
Sooner than you think.

309
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,750
我讀過那個人的生平 我覺得有必要擔心一下
I read the man's resume and I see cause for concern.

310
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,300
看起來沒什麼大不了的
He doesn't look like much.

311
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,130
沒人會注意到蒼蠅 除非他把一碗好湯弄爛了
No one ever notices the housefly until he fucks up a good bowl of soup.

312
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,800
我不喜歡他
There's something I don't like about him.

313
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,170
他有那種 特性
He has that... trait.

314
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,050
什麼特性
What trait is that?

315
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,550
雖天資尚佳，卻懂勤能補拙
The overachiever who makes up for a lack of talent with hustle.

316
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,670
我一直都討厭這樣的人
The guy on the playground I grew up hating.

317
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,420
查一下他的服役記錄 如果他留下了 我想時刻關注著他
Vet his service history. If it's accurate, I want him tracked and monitored.

318
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,170
如果他惹麻煩 我們會處理的
If he becomes problematic, we'll deal with him.

319
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,170
找一些週邊的人員
And reach outside the normal ranks,

320
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,500
這樣就沒人能把他的事和我們聯繫起來了 越隨機越好
no one that could connect back to us. The more random the assets, the better.

321
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,630
找些怪胎來做這個事
Find some real freaks.

322
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,630
行了我要離開這裡去喝點酒 也許…
Okay, I'm gonna get out of here, grab a little vino, maybe some--

323
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,550
-等等 我要修修你的頭髮 -哦 傑瑪
- Just let me fix your hair. - Ow, Jemma!

324
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,250
我在流血
I'm bleeding.

325
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,250
-你收到我送的生日禮物了嗎
Did you get my birthday present, Roy?

326
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,360
-你在這裡是做什麼的 你表現得很奇怪
What are you doing here? You're acting so weird.

327
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,340
你收到了嗎 我寄給你的
Did you get it? The present. I sent it to you.

328
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,800
-我不知道 我沒看 -看看吧 我幾天前寄給你的
- I don't know. I haven't checked. - Well please do. I sent it a few days ago.

329
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,550
好吧 當然我會看一看
I will. Of course I will.

330
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,170
威爾斯博士 我能見一下你嗎
Dr. Wells, could I see you for a moment.

331
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,880
-我得去醫院了 -我馬上 上校
- I'll have to go to the hospital. - I'll be there in a moment, Colonel.

332
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,460
-你取了我的血 -現在仔細聽我說 羅伊
- You drew blood. - Listen to me now, Roy.

333
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,960
我知道我們最近沒見過多少面
Okay look, I know we haven't seen much of each other lately

334
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,710
我知道我們已經分道揚鑣
and I know we've gone down very different paths.

335
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,250
-我知道 但當我 -聽著 這很重要
- I know, but when I... - It's important that you listen. Just listen!

336
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,170
-好 好 說吧 -行
- You talk. You talk. - Okay.

337
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,420
我忘記了 這有多難
I forgot how trying this can be.

338
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,750
我在喬身上看到了很多你的影子 真的
I see a lot of you in Joe, I do.

339
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,920
他有決心 還有無論如何都要成功的意志
His determination, his willingness to succeed no matter what.

340
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,130
他有著你最好的品質 但也有你的自私
He has some of your best qualities, but he also has your selfishness

341
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,460
你玩消失的能力和你一樣的厲害
and your ability to just disappear when it suits him.

342
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,170
-我以為一切都已經結束了 -逃避責任
- Just when I thought we were turning a corner. - And run from responsibility.

343
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,500
好吧很好你想從我這裡得到什麼告訴我吧
Okay, alright. What do you want from me? Just tell me. Just tell me!

344
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,840
我想要那個我很久以前就愛上了的男人
I want the man I fell in love with a long time ago,

345
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,800
帶給我一個兒子的男人
the one who gave me a son

346
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,800
強大自信的你
the strong, confident version of you,

347
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,800
不是那個每晚都在外面 和不同的婊子亂搞的羅伊
not the Roy who's out every night getting hammered and banging a different bimbo.

348
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,850
-記住這個 歐西裡斯 歐西裡斯 -好的
- Remember this: Osiris. Osiris. - Okay.

349
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,380
看啊 好一對吃飯不花錢兄弟
Look, it's Roid and Rage.

350
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,550
吃那麼多小心三高啊 朋友
You know carbohydrates are not your friend, fellas.

351
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,630
-威爾斯博士 你還好嗎 -是的
- Doctor Wells, are you well? - Yes.

352
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,250
-你介意我吸煙嗎 -不 一點也不
- Does cigar smoke botther you? - No, not at all.

353
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,800
主軸怎麼樣了
The Spindle.

354
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,420
那個 進度目前有點耽擱
Well, we're experiencing a minor delay at the moment.

355
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,050
明確一下時間
Define minor.

356
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,750
一周最多兩周
A week, two weeks at the most.

357
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,130
-為什麼 -研發不是一門精確的科學
- And why? - R&D is never an exact science.

358
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,130
但這正是我們想要的精確科學
But that's exactly what we're after; exact science.

359
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,920
你的朋友 普勒上尉
Your friend, Captain Pulver.

360
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,250
-是的 他來了一份簡歷 -你對他提起過這裡嗎
- Yes, he dropped off a resume. - And whatever possessed him.

361
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,750
那個也許我以前跟他提到過實驗室裡的軍事力量
Well, I may have mentioned in passing the military presence here at the lab.

362
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,630
你有提起過嗎
And whatever possessed you?

363
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,920
此設施的安全協定不應成為私密對話的主題
The security protocols of this facility should not be the subject of pillow talk.

364
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,800
我可以向你保證 你擔心的事情不會發生
I can assure you, they're not.

365
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,670
-羅伊和我不是 -你是他孩子的母親
- Roy and I are not... - You are the mother of his child, no?

366
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,130
請坐 隨意一些
Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

367
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,380
我不想讓這看起來像是審問
I don't want this to seem like an interrogation.

368
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,170
我不想長篇大論
I'm not one for long stories,

369
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,190
我是個喜歡簡潔的人
I'm someone who's always appreciated brevity in any form.

370
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,340
無論何種形式 越短越好 然而
The shorter the better. However,

371
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,750
我自己也有一個故事 我不斷重複的敘述過
I do have one story that I've told and retold

372
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,170
現在要分享給你
and it's a story that I'd like to share with you now,

373
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,800
如果你願意的話
if you'll indulge me.

374
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,500
-我喜歡長故事 -那正好
- I happen to like long stories. - Oh good, then we're both in luck.

375
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,750
1979年我在緬甸為中情局工作
So, Burma 1979, I was doing skunk work for the CIA,

376
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,420
我們足足花了十年的時間
smuggling enough opium into the country to backstop

377
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,460
利用走私大量的鴉片到這個國家 來支持並發動了一場血腥的軍事政變
a very bloody military coup that we would eventually stage a decade later.

378
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,050
所有這些通常都是最高機密
This is all mostly declassified, mostly.

379
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,340
不管怎樣
At any rate, I find myself

380
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,960
我在仰光郊外的叢林裡
in the jungle outside Rangoon,

381
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,920
在一場持續三天的交火中狙擊克倫民族聯盟解放陣線的士兵
sniping soldiers from the KNU Liberation Front in a three-day running firefight

382
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,500
這讓我損失了整個團隊
that cost me my entire team.

383
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,910
最後，我面臨的
So there I am,

384
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,130
是一群骯髒的 瘋狂的
on the verge of being overrun by a bunch of machete-wielding rebels

385
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,920
揮舞著彎刀的叛亂分子
who have terrible attitudes and even worse hygiene

386
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,500
而我只能在36個小時不眠不休的情況下
and all I have is a Remington Buckmaster with a shot-out scope

387
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,800
用一杆帶狙擊鏡的刺刀步槍去苛求勝利
and 36 sleepless hours in which to squeeze out a win.

388
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,710
然後我聽到了
And then I hear it.

389
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,420
刺耳的尖叫聲
This piercing squeal,

390
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,880
就像水壺燒開 水蒸汽的哨聲
like a steam whistle.

391
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,090
一頭能讓你嚇得尿褲子的
Wild boar.

392
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,550
大野豬
Make you piss your pants.

393
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,420
光是聲音就足以讓叛軍四散
The sound alone is enough to make the rebels scatter.

394
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,670
沒人敢去觸碰那些鋒利的獠牙
No one wants to fuck with the tusks.

395
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,170
而那頭那個狗娘養的畜生聞到了我的味道 直奔我而來
So now this son-of-a-bitch gets a sniff of me and comes at me straight away.

396
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,750
我寧肯對付十個兇惡的敵人 也不願面對這一隻野獸
Now I'd rather put a bullet in ten men than kill an animal,

397
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,380
但我還沒來得及現身
but before I'm even presented

398
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,960
一條近6米長的緬甸蟒蛇從榕樹上竄下來
with the do-or-die of it all, an 18 foot Burmese Python

399
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,500
把這頭狂暴的野豬像聖誕火腿一樣纏繞起來
comes down from a banyan tree and wraps up this raging hog like a Christmas ham.

400
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,050
我從沒見過這樣的情形
I've never seen anything like it.

401
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,860
接下來的幾個小時 我就驚奇地看著
And for the next few hours, I watch in wonder as this

402
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,700
黑蟒如何吞咽 豬如何被消化
snake slowly suffocates and devours this pig.

403
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,750
周圍一片寂靜 我什麼都能聽見
It was oddly quiet so I could hear everything.

404
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,460
野豬的骨頭啪啪作響 當它的肺崩潰時
The boar's bones snapping, the bellow's-like wheeze as its lungs collapsed

405
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,000
風箱般的喘息聲使它聽起來像蛇在笑
that made it sound like the snake was laughing.

406
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:36,550
這仍然是我所見過的最令人驚詫的暴力行為
It remains the most awe-inspiring act of violence I have ever seen.

407
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,630
但我印象最深刻的
But what struck me most

408
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,050
是即使巨蟒張開了它的嘴 要吃掉它的獵物
even as the python extended its jaws a full two feet to devour its prey,

409
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,050
她的眼睛裡仍透著鎮靜和冷酷的算計
was the calm and calculation in its eyes.

410
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,340
直到後來當它移動身體中部
And wasn't until later, when it finally moved its mid-section

411
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
透過野豬的拱形輪廓
now distended with the outline of that boar

412
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,550
我看到了一窩蛋
that I saw a dozen eggs.

413
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,380
蟒蛇蛋
Python eggs.

414
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,670
野豬幾乎踩爛了它的巢
The boar was about to trample its nest.

415
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,920
所以我最初認為這是一種侵略行為
So what I had first perceived as an act of aggression,

416
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,170
事實上這是一種愛的行為
was actually an act of love.

417
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,420
蟒蛇殺死野豬不是出於怨恨
The snake killing the boar not out of malice,

418
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,550
而是為了保護它們的後代
but out of necessity to prevent its future from being obliterated.

419
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,500
我很喜歡這個故事
I enjoyed that story.

420
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,420
我很高興能講給你我也覺得很合適
Oh and I enjoyed telling it. I also thought it apt.

421
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,420
-為什麼呢 -實驗室裡不會再有訪客
- How so? - No more visitors to the lab.

422
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,000
沒有前男友 舊情人或什麼過去的影子
No ex-boyfriends, old flames or shadowy figures from the past,

423
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,880
如果工作要延期
if there's a delay in the work

424
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,310
-我想要立刻得到通知
I want to be apprised of it post-haste.

425
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,590
好嗎 -當然
- Yes? - Of course.

426
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,550
謝謝你 博士 很好
Thank you, doctor. That's wonderful.

427
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,670
小心腳下
Do watch your step.

428
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,920
-你要再來點嗎 -還有什麼
- You want another one? - Another one what?

429
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
你真可愛
You are sweet.

430
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,550
你們倆認識多久了
How long have you two known each other?

431
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,960
我們今天才認識
We only met today.

432
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,380
-他是我最好的新朋友 -是啊 我是
- He is my newest best friend. - Yes I am.

433
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,630
-愛麗絲是個牙科保健師 -說起來奇怪 我其實無比討厭牙齒
- Alice is a dental hygienist. - Which is weird 'cuz I totally hate teeth.

434
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,420
它們的構造就讓我噁心
I mean, just the texture of them grosses me out.

435
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,840
-牙醫職業看起來 -就像我最不該做的事嗎
- Then a career in dentistry seems like... - Like the last thing I should be doing?

436
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,710
是啊 我知道 我知道 但我願意接受每一個挑戰
Yeah, I know, I know. But I'm all about the challenge.

437
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,920
我喜歡走出舒適區
I like to push myself out of the comfort zone.

438
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,460
-這是真正成長的唯一途徑 -宇宙真理
- It's the only way to grow, really. - So true.

439
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,250
他很可愛不是嗎
He's so pretty. Isn't he pretty?

440
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,840
你們倆認識多久了
How long have you guys known each other?

441
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
跟加布裡埃爾嗎 太久了 就像我在酒吧裡喝的東西一樣久
With Gabrielle? For as long as I've been drinking in this bar.

442
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,960
-自從他從海外回來 -危險的經歷 告訴我嘛
- Since you got back from overseas. - Oh, danger. Do tell!

443
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,590
女士們 真沒什麼好說的
Ladies, there's really almost nothing to tell.

444
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:44,000
-所以什麼都不告訴我們咯 -不過你能等一下嗎 因為
- Then tell us almost nothing. - Can you wait? Because...

445
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,630
我要去撒尿 馬上回來
I've gotta pee. I'll be right back.

446
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
你該帶她回家 羅伊
You should take her home, Roy.

447
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,500
你該帶她回家
You should take her home.

448
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,710
你得問
You have to ask:

449
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,420
我為什麼不能把你跟她都帶回家呢 加布裡埃爾
"Why not take you home too, Gabrielle?"

450
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,250
我會說
And I will say...

451
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,050
也許下次吧
Maybe another night.

452
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,630
你開始說胡話了
I'm starting to wear you down.

453
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,090
但那個夜晚永遠不會到來

454
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,130
我們可以玩得很開心 羅伊 但我們永遠不會相愛
We'd have fun, Roy, but we'd never be in love.

455
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,820
-但是 愛
Oh, love.

456
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,050
-不 -為什麼
- No. - Why?

457
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,960
-為什麼 -是啊
- Why? - Yeah.

458
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,550
因為你仍然還愛著其他人
Because you're still in love... with someone else.

459
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,880
我能從你的眼睛裡看出來
It's in your eyes.

460
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,670
在那抹哀傷之中
In the sadness I see there.

461
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,920
你渴望著一個女人 但不是我
There is a woman you long for, but it's not me.

462
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,050
也不是我們親愛的牙科保健員
And it's not our lovely hygienist.

463
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,050
酒吧 你好 是
Bar, hello? Yeah.

464
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,340
-找你的 -誰會現在給我打電話
- It's for you. - Who wants to call me now.

465
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,000
-我不知道 -你好
- I don't know. - Hello?

466
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,920
羅伊你能聽到我嗎 -傑瑪 怎麼
- Roy, can you hear me? - Jemma? What...

467
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,750
你還在實驗室嗎 現在都接近淩晨3點了
Are you still at the lab? It's almost 3AM.

468
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,750
傑瑪 你還好嗎
Jemma, are you okay?

469
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,460
-你還好嗎 -是的 我沒事 但是
- You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine, but...

470
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,500
-怎麼回事 聽著 -你聽我說
- What's going on? Listen... - Yeah, listen to me.

471
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,750
我也許做了瘋狂的事
I think I might have to do something drastic

472
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,920
如果發生什麼事答應我你去做你該做的
and if anything happens, promise me you'll do what you do--

473
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,000
-我聽不到你講話了 -我需要你的?明
- I can't-- I can't hear you. - I'm gonna need your help.

474
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,210
怎麼回事你還好嗎
Wait, what's going on? Are you okay?

475
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,170
我不能解釋給你聽 你還不明白
I can't explain it right now, but you wouldn't understand anyway.

476
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,130
我想是斷線了
Hey, I think I lost you.

477
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,050
傑瑪 給我回電話 好嗎
Jemma, call me back, okay?

478
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,130
-是誰 -我前任
- Who was that? - It was my ex...

479
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,550
她看起來有些工作過度了
and she was... she sounded pretty worked up.

480
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,050
看起來我們親愛的博士是個壞人
It seems our dear doctor has gone rogue.

481
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,380
找到她
Find her.

482
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,210
我錯過了什麼
What did I miss?

483
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,800
你好
Oh, hi.

484
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,380
我們剛剛討論了這個星球上最性感的人 你的名字出現了
We were talking about the hottest people on the planet and naturally your name came up.

485
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,220
我應該打電話給傑瑪的
I should have tried to call Jemma back when

486
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,770
但我喝醉了 性欲旺盛 我並不在乎
I was drunk and horny and I didn't give a shit.

487
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,250
我不知道那有多重要
I didn't know how important it was.

488
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,500
我不知道 這會是我最後一次聽到她的聲音
I didn't know it would be the last time that I'd ever hear her voice.

489
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,130
有些事是無法挽回的
Some things you can't re-do.

490
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,170
你就不得不一次又一次地做一些事情
And some things you're forced to do over and over again.

491
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,550
我知道這一切都跟她密不可分
I know this whole thing leads back to her.

492
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,960
我只是不知道這是怎麼回事
I just have no idea what "this whole thing" actually is.

493
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
你收到我的生日禮物了嗎
Did you get my birthday present?

494
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,880
你收到禮物了嗎
Did you get it, the present?

495
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,550
-我不知道我沒看 -看看吧 我幾天前寄給你的
- I don't know, I haven't checked. - Well please do, I sent it a few days ago.

496
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,550
記住這個 歐西裡斯
Remember this: Osiris.

497
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,300
生日快樂 羅伊 永遠向前看 記住
"Happy birthday, Roy. May you always live your life forward and remember:"

498
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,550
時間不等人
"Time waits for no man."

499
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,170
好吧該死
Fuck me.

500
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,710
再來一遍
Let's do that again.

501
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,050
有人要搶我的車！
I'm being car-jacked!

502
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,090
臥槽
Fuck!

503
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,500
快點快點我們走
Come on, come on, let's go.

504
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,170
-老兄 見鬼 終於 -擋住我的路了
- Dude, die already, god damn it! - He's in my way.

505
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,880
他媽的時間到了
About fuckin' time.

506
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
有人要搶我的啊！
I'm being car-jacked!

507
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,630
開車的時候別看東西 你個白癡
Don't read and drive, moron.

508
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,460
我怎麼會沒注意到呢
How did I never notice this?

509
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,130
該死 我錯過了去中餐館的路口
Shit, I missed the exit to the chinese restaurant.

510
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,090
上次我去別的地方 結果真是糟透了
The last time I went anywhere else, it ended up really bad.

511
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,000
很明顯 我把這位叫做笑臉
I call this guy Smiley, for obvious reasons.

512
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,420
被射中就像一記耳光一樣簡單明瞭
At least getting shot is simple. Straight-forward stuff.

513
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
對 我抓到他了

514
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,420
誰會想到他這麼垃圾啊
Who the hell thinks up shit like this?

515
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,090
我抓到他了

516
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,300
我一直在逃避我的生活
All I've been doing is running from my life this entire time.

517
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,920
現在我第一次清楚明瞭的有了方向
Now I've got my first real clue to what the fuck might be happening to me.

518
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,280

我翹課了
I ditched.

555

你以為我在買毒品什麼的嗎
Did you think I was buying drugs or something?

-或者類似的東西
Or something.

-我不喜歡壽司 -不喜歡嗎

580
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,920

我現在應該告訴他

告訴他媽媽死了 他永遠也見不到她了
Tell him his mother is gone. That him that he was never gonna see her again.

583
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,050
-告訴他 -你知道嗎 媽媽說你很混蛋耶
- Tell him that... - You know, Mom says you're a badass.

584
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
混蛋
Badass?

585
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,500
-她是這麼說的嗎 -她倒沒用這個詞
- She says that? - Well, she doesn't use that word,

586
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,750
但她說你就像個海軍陸戰隊員或者士兵
but she says you're like a SEAL team guy or something, like a soldier.

587
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,420
-媽媽提到過我嗎 -是啊說過好多
- Mom talks about me? - Yeah, she mentions you a lot.

588
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,670
很多嗎
A lot?

589
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,500
嘿 你就像颶風營救裡的那個人 有什麼特殊能力來著
Are you like that guy, the one from Taken, who has a particular set of skills

590
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,710
-連姆尼森嗎 -對

00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,510
好吧 他就像是假的硬漢 我可是真漢子
Well, he's like a fake tough guy. I'm really guy.

592
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,210
-真的嗎 -我不騙你
- Really? - I'm not kidding you, that's real.

593
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,670
這很好啊
Oh, that's so cool.

594
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,130
嘿 喬
Hey, Joe.

595
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,670
我得跟你說點事夥計
I gotta tell you something, bud.

596
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,800
但這並不會發生 聽著 好嗎
And it's gonna be pretty hard to hear, okay?

597
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,500
但是 又很難把它用簡單的方式表達出來
I don't have an easy way to say this.

598
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,710
12點50分
Twelve fifty.

599
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,460
比我活時間長了三分鐘
Three minutes longer than I've ever lived.

600
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
怎麼回事
How?

601
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,630
裡面是全金屬的
The inside is all metal.

602
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,420
然後我進到了地下
Then I went below ground.

603
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,050
他們在監視著我
They're tracking me.

604
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,880
你想告訴我什麼啊羅伊
What did you want to tell me, Roy?

605
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,420
喬
Joe...

606
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,670
我是你的父親
I'm your father.

607
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,420
帶著滿滿的恐懼
In all that fear

608
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,300
我一瞬間看到了兒子對我的愛
I saw my son's love for me for a split second.

609
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,000
這太美好了
And it was beautiful.

610
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,670
請讓這次的死亡成為最後一次吧
Please. Please, let this death be the last.

611
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,250
狗娘養的
Motherfucker!

612
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,420
-你們是怎麼監視我的 -操你媽
- How are you tracking me? - Fuck you!

613
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,840
敢玩我 設備在哪裡
Fuck me? Where's the device?

614
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,420
-在你的屁眼裡 -你想得太多了
- Up your ass. - Oh, you're full of ideas!

615
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,050
-操你媽 -好吧 就這樣吧
- Fuck off. - Okay, fuck off!

616
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,550
嗨夥計
Hey, buddy!

617
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,380
好吧如果你想用你就用吧
Okay. When you gotta go, you gotta go.

618
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,380
追蹤器在哪兒呢
Where's this tracker?

619
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,050
它一定在這裡的某個地方 但在哪裡呢
I know it's here...

620
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,050
該死
Fuck.

621
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,170
佩德羅你不能幫我看一下嗎
Pedro, you want to help me look?

622
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,340
然後我說 我看到你的反情報專家了
And then I said, "I will see your counter-intelligence expert

623
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,340
我會教你一個專門的預防監控方法 朋友
and raise you a counter-surveillance specialist, my friend."

624
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,750
-你應該看看他們的表情 -你真是個白癡
- You should have seen the look on his face. - You... you're crazy!

625
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,000
-戴夫 -嗨 羅伊 -嗨
- Dave. - Hey, Roy.

626
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,750
-抱歉打斷你 -我剛告訴傑克那些混蛋
- Sorry to interrupt. - I was just telling Jake about this loudmouth...

627
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,630
我明白太好了 戴夫 你懂一些監控設備
Got it, great. Dave, you know something about tracking devices.

628
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,170
我對這些東西一無所知 羅伊
I don't know anything about that kind of thing, Roy.

629
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,670
我的確對這些東西瞭若指掌
I know everything about that kind of thing.

630
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,660
-什麼樣的設備
What are we talking?

631
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,000
-傳統的應答器嗎 -用來追蹤人的東西
- Traditional transponder? - The kind you put on a person.

632
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,800
-是附在身體上的還是植入體內的 -哪種更好
- A body-based or an implantable device. - What's better?

633
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,170
當你不想讓被監視人意識到自己在被監視的話
If you don't want the person to know they're being tracked.

634
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,460
那麼植入物就更合適了
Well, an implantable version is loads more reliable.

635
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,240
-另一種是附著在衣服上
A body-based device would be attached to clothing--

636
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:13,880
-一般植入到哪裡 你會把它放哪兒呢
Where would you implant it? Where would you do it?

637
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,210
-大多數人認為只是
Well, most people think subcutaneously,

638
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,640
-在皮膚下 -那你會把它放哪兒
- just underneath the skin - Where would you it?

639
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,170
你是說我 個人習慣嗎 -你 你的個人習慣
- Oh, you mean me, personally? - You, personally.

640
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,050
戴夫的專長啊
A Dave special.

641
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,800
-那個愚蠢的詞是什麼意思 -對 對
What does that stupid face mean? Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,540
他明白了 是牙齒 羅伊 你的牙齒
He gets it. Your teeth, Roy. Your teeth!

643
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,030
最好是臼齒
Ideally a molar.

644
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,380
我勒個去的
You gotta be shitting me.

645
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,050
你戴著面罩很帥氣
You look so handsome with the mask on.

646
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:46,050
你什麼都不用害怕 深呼吸
You have nothing to worry about. Just keep breathing deeply.

647
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,130
很快就結束了
It'll all be over soon.

648
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,420
另外 你的嘴是一個天然的載體

-戴夫 -怎麼

你能幫我看看我的牙齒
Would you be able to look at a tooth

651
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,570
找找我有沒有這個裝置嗎
and detect if there was a tracking device in it?

652
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
如果在別人嘴裡就不行
I mean, not while it's inside someone mouth

653
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,500
-我可以查出牙齒是否被拔掉過 -傑克
- If that tooth were removed I could check it out. - Jake.

No no no! God damn!

656
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,800
別擔心 戴夫 會再長好的
Don't worry, Dave, it'll grow back.

657
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,790
你瘋了嗎 不你需要幫助
Have you lost your mind? No, you need some damn help!

658
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,840
你就能幫到我 所以 你覺得怎麼樣
Not while your being so helpful. What do you think?

659
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,780
-不會 -是嗎
- No. - You sure?

660
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,570
-當然 -現在幾點了
- I'm positive. - What time is it?

661
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,590
-該死12點45分了 -見鬼 還剩2分鐘
- Shit. It's 12:45. - Oh shit. Only two minutes.

662
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,410
不要再從嘴裡拔牙了
It's time for you to stop snatching your damn teeth out of your mouth.

663
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,300
你瘋了嗎
Are you crazy?

664
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:39,420
見鬼 不 不 不 天?
- Fuck this shit. - No no no! God!

665
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,880
我本該在家裡坐著的
I should have stayed my black ass at home.

666
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,050
看快看
- Look. Look! - No!

667
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,110
-天吶 -有什麼嗎
- Oh my God. - What?

668
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,570
-有 這顆牙
Yeah. That tooth.

669
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,870
-這顆牙有點不規則
There's an irregularity in that tooth.

670
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,050
-真的嗎 -是的
- There is? - Yeah.

671
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:56,670
天? 我得看看裡面
Oh my God. I would need to see inside of it.

672
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,420
羅伊 -是

673
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,440
-小心好嗎 -好
- Carefully. - Yeah...

674
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,500
小心不這可不能小心
Carefully. No, that's not careful!

675
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,130
-狗娘養的 -我的天
- Son of a bitch. - Oh my God.

676
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:20,220
羅伊 有人為了監視你花了一大筆錢
Roy? Someone paid a lot of money to keep track of you.

677
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,300
-真的嗎 -是的 真的 我從來沒
- They did? - Yeah. A whole lot. I've never...

678
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,920
回頭見戴夫
I'll see you soon, Dave.

679
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:39,130
-是誰讓你把追蹤裝置放到我嘴裡的 -一個叫佈雷特的傢伙
- Who put the tracking device in my mouth? - A guy named Brett.

娘炮先生 肥肉男
Mr. Frat Boy, fake-bake bald

681
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:46,210
染過鬍子的400斤的高個安保主管
four hundred pound "I dye my beardhair black" douchebag head of Dynow security.

682
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,250
佈雷特
Brett.

683
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,300
我要在他胸口打個大洞
I'm gonna punch a giant fucking hole in his chest.

684
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,220
-你好嗎 -傑克
-what's up bro. -jack.

685
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,000
我需要一大瓶白酒和兩把鉗子
I need a large bottle of Baijiu and a pair of pliers, now.

686
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,300
我到今天為止已經死掉144次了
I have died one hundred and forty four times as of today,

687
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,670
但在這個特殊的日子裡 我終於能做點什麼了
but this particular day, I finally get to do something about it.

688
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,170

689
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,420
-什麼這顆牙嗎 -不 不是這顆牙

690

不 我不會放下槍的
I'm not dropping it.

691
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,500
要不你放下槍 要不我就讓你中槍
Well it drops or you drop.

692
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,460
這是一把手工打造的沃爾特PPK
This is a custom handmade Walther PPK

693
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,440
在拍賣會上花了我將近50萬
that cost me nearly half a million dollars at auction.

694
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,920
你花了半百萬買了個炮仗嗎
You bought a handgun for half a million dollars?

695
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,590
還從一個私人槍手那裡 買到了經典SD-22消音器
And had my personal pistolsmith fit it with a vintage SD-22 SpielWaffen suppressor

696
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,130

700
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,040
-我不知道你的名字 所以就叫你帕姆了

-我們以前見過嗎 -許多次 過去見過許多次
- We've met? - Many, many times. In passing.

702
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,630
我想看看 慢慢地給我
Let me see it. Slow.

703
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,380
用關節挑著它

705
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:34,300
像蜘蛛網一樣溫柔
Soft as a whisper.

706
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,920

00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,930
希特勒把它放在了慕尼克的辦公桌上
Hitler kept it in his desk in Munich.

709
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,880
殺死我的一直是希特勒的槍嗎
You've been killing me with fuckin' Hitler's gun this whole time?

710
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,710
-1945年被一名美國士兵偷走了 -上帝啊
- It was stolen by an American serviceman in 1945. - Jesus Christ.

-你有什麼毛病 -保存至今
- What is wrong with you? - Fast forward to the present day.

- It cost me a very pretty penny. - I didn't think this could get any worse.

713
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,380
-誰派你來的 -你不會想知道的
- Who sent you? - Wouldn't you like to know.

714
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,500
-我堅持要知道 -不要
- Hint hint. - Never.

715
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,590
-你現在打算要殺掉我嗎 -不 帕姆 我會朝你開槍
- Are you going to kill me now? - No, Pam, I'm gonna shoot you.

716
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,800
那是給猶太人的
That's for the Jews.

717
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,710
那些也是
Those too.

718
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,900
我抓到他了 怎麼樣 小夥子
Come on, boy!

719
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,420
傑瑪 讓我來這裡是有原因的 我不知道怎麼做 也不知道為什麼
Jemma put me here on purpose. I don't know how, I don't know why.

720
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,500
一定有充分的理由 該死 她一定很棒
There's gotta be a good reason. Shit, there's gotta be a great one.

721
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,300
看你搞丟了你的手機
Look, you lost your phone, little fella.

722
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,340
但她如今已經不在了
But she's gone.

723
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,380
我無法回去那麼遠的地方去救她
I can't get back far enough to reach her,

724
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,880
所以現在這些都不重要了
so none of this matters now.

725
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,920
整件事就剩下最後一部分了
There's only one real piece of business left.

726
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,750
復仇

727
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,920
這裡越來越熱了
Things are getting warm, now.

00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,880
-你清算人員了嗎 -你指的是人員們吧 複數
- Did you eliminate the asset? - You mean assets. Plural.

729

-馬歇爾 -你好 佈雷特
- Marshall. - Hello, Brett.

730
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,960
別問我是誰 你很清楚的
Don't ask who this is, because you know exactly who it is.

731
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,380
-馬歇爾在哪兒 -是哪個 炸彈男嗎
- Where's Marshall? - Who's that? Bomb boy?

732
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,500
我叫他卡波姆什麼的
The one I call Kaboom?

733
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,960
那個他現在和我在一起吃燒烤呢
Well, he's at a big company barbeque at the moment.

734
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,550
我們還缺兩個人 你和那個下命令的混蛋
We're only missing two members: You and the shithead calling the shots

735
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,850
-你以為還有人在我之上嗎
You assume there's someone above me.

736
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,440
-你是條狗 必須得有人牽著
You're a lapdog, pal, so there's gotta be a leash.

737
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,170
我要那個掌控一切的人
I want who's holding it.

738
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,550
我要那個殺死傑瑪的人
I want who killed Jemma.

739
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,420
我猜是文托吧
I think it's Ventor.

740
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:53,750
-你知道我們在哪兒 山炮 -是的 我知道怎麼過去
- Well, you know where we are, hotshot. - Yeah, and I know how to get there.

741
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,170
我馬上就會見到你了狗娘養的
I'll see you in a minute, motherfucker.

742
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,840
大老闆可能會有大觀景台
I'm guessing the big boss man has a penthouse view,

743
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,750
但我不想再以那種卑鄙 不引人注意的方式死去
but I'm about sick to death of all the sneaky stealth behind the scenes bullshit.

744
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,630
我們來解決這一切吧 撞開前門
Let's go old-school and just kick the fucking front door down.

745
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,750
這可真是個好主意
That was a good plan.

746
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,300
我要把他的眼睛挖出來
I'm gonna gouge his eyes out.

747
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,300
報告
Hold!

748
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,300
後退
Fall back!

749
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,500
我一整天都能跟你玩的 混蛋（美國隊長梗）
I can do this all day, dick.

750
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,050
你好羅伊2號

751
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,750
再見羅伊2號
Goodbye, Roy number 2.

752
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,710
羅伊2號沒帶武器 我很肯定
Roy number 2 was unarmed and I'm positive

753
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,920
我要穿過這些傢伙不能拿著武器
I'm not getting a weapon past these guys.

754
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,620
先生
Sir.

755
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,170
哦 是的 當然 對不起
Oh, yeah, sorry.

756
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,130
拒絕訪問
Access denied.

757
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,500
這是我的錯
Oh, it's uh... It must be me.

758
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,050
你好嗎
Sir!

759
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,380
嗨羅伊
Hi, Roy.

760
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,750
我可不想跟布奇和聖丹斯玩了
So do I do a "Butch and Sundance" blaze of glory bit here?

761
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,050
絕不
Nah.

762
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,420
希望死最後一次
Never say die.

763
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,050
好詭異
That was weird.

764
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,460
操他媽的狗娘養的
You big motherfucker.

765
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,800
嗨 帥哥
Hello, handsome.

766
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,880
你把我的頭砍掉了幾十次
You cut my head off a couple of dozen times.

767
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,420
一定有人是勤奮的小蜜蜂
Someone's been the busiest little beaver.

768
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,050
你打算怎麼辦
What are you gonna do with that?

769
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,590
我在思考著把你搞死
I was thinking about fucking you up.

770
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,450
你還記得《征服者》裡的那個人 拿著劍
You remember in "Raiders", that asshole who was

771
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,780
在轉圈 然後想 他有多酷啊
twirling the sword around and around thinking he was all cool and shit?

772
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,670
因迪開槍打他 是因為他很生氣 沒耐心
Indy just shot him because he was exhausted and impatient

773
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,440
-這讓他很生氣
and just couldn't take the bullshit any more.

774
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,280
你還記得嗎 -是
- You remember that? - Yeah.

775
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,170
見鬼
Fuck!

776
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:41,250
也許你對刀劍殺人一無所知
Something you might not know about getting killed with a sword.

777
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
除了在第15次嘗試的時候
With the exception of attempt number 15.

778
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,130
被劍殺死比被槍殺更痛苦
Getting killed with a sword hurts worse than a gunshot.

779
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,800
還有一個關於劍的鮮為人知的事實
Another lesser known fact about swords.

780
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,630
當它們拔出來的時候 會痛很多倍的
They hurt a hell of a lot more coming out.

781
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,380
有趣的事實哈里森福特需要去大便
Fun fact: Harrison Ford had the shits,

782
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,050
所以他開搶打了那個人
and that's why he shot that guy.

783
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,630
我是觀音
I am Guan-Jin.

784
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,880
觀音完成任務
And Guan-Jin has done this.

785
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,420
我是觀音
I am Guan-Jin.

786
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,750
觀音完成任務
And Guan-Jin has done this.

787
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,420
我是觀音
I am Guan-Jin.

788
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,630
觀音完成任務
And Guan-Jin has done this.

789
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,050
我是觀音 任務完成
I'm Guan-Jin and I've done this.

790
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,130
這還不是最糟糕的部分
And this isn't even the worst part.

791
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,630
這才是文托
That's this. Ventor.

792
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,670
殺死傑瑪的人
The man who killed Jemma.

793
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,500
那個讓我死了一百五十次的白癡
The same bozo that's had me killed a hundred and fifty fucking times.

794
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:17,500
上尉 第一印象告訴我 你是一流的好手
Captain, as first impressions go this is truly stand-out stuff.

795
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,920
你對待這些一流的專業人士的方式
How you were able to despatch the elite level of

796
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,790
真讓人印象深刻
high speed professionals we threw at you is really remarkable.

797
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,920
不管結果如何 你都應該對你的努力感到滿意
You should be pleased with the effort, regardless of its outcome.

798
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,880
作為一個同樣收到過戰爭創傷的人
As someone who bears the same fraternal scars of battle I hope

799
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,550
我希望這種失敗 無論多麼苦澀 對你都是一種慰藉
that this defeat, however bitter, holds some solace.

800
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:41,500
他一定是把這些胡扯的東西都背下來了吧 每次都是一字不差的
He must that bullshit memorized, because it's word for word the same every time.

801
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,050
每一個在我眼前死去並安息的人，在這群人裡
All the men I've watched die and lain to rest, in their multitudes

802
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,050
我看到了一個共同點
I see a singularity.

803
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,550
在他們的眼中
It's in the eyes.

804
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,500
他們當時的情緒是一樣的
Their gaze is identical in this moment.

805
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,170
遺憾 悔恨
Remorse, regret.

806
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,750
我能做什麼 我沒做什麼
What could I have done? What didn't I do?

807
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,670
讓他們與我們一起流血 是我們所有的善意
All our best intentions left to bleed out with the rest of us.

808
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:10,380
但如果我們能讓世界重塑 並抹去我們犯過得錯誤呢
But what if we could remake our world whole and erase our mistakes?

809
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,000
如果改寫歷史的能力是真的呢
What if the ability to rewrite history was real?

810
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,360
-阿道夫希特勒 珍珠港 -等等 我好像從來沒活到過這一刻
- Adolf Hitler, Pearl Harbor. - Wait a minute, wait a minute,

811
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,040
所以這些扯淡都是新玩意
I never lived past this point, so all this crap is new.

812
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:26,250
你會把這個歐西裡斯的主軸這樣強大的工具交給誰呢？
In whose hands would you entrust a tool as powerful as the Osiris spindle?

813
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,250
我有你要的答案上尉
I have your answer, Captain.

814
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,210
我自己
Mine.

815
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,630
他深知人類苦難的重擔
A man brought to heel by the brunt of human misery,

816
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:37,250
像你一樣明白戰爭的恐怖
a man who understands, as you do, the horrors of war.

817
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,500
還有誰更適合來監督和實施這樣的工具呢
Who better to oversee and implement such a tool?

818
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,420
正是我本人
Exactly.

819
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,380
對於威爾斯博士 我很抱歉
I am sorry about Dr. Wells.

820
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,500
她帶著我們走了這麼遠 即是這是在她有所缺陷的思想的範疇內
She took us as far as her flawed ideology allowed her.

821
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,210
可愛的女孩
Sweet girl.

822
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,920
你來到這裡的目的 不過就是想要雙手沾滿鮮血罷了
Blood on your hands is what you wanted when you came here, Captain.

823
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,550
而現在你已經渾身浴血了
And blood is what you have.

824
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,050
只不過不是我的
Just not mine.

825
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,170
這真的很犀利 上面甚至沒留下血跡
That's really sharp. Not even any blood on it.

826
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,550
-這是把武士刀嗎 -武士刀嗎 那是日本的東西
- Is it a katana? - Katana? That's Japanese.

827
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,460
-這是一把中國劍 -別太較真
It's a Chinese sword. - Let's not make this about race.

828
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,840
就是把劍嘛
It's a sword.

829
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
佈雷特
Brett, um...

830
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,250
現在我知道三件事了 第一
I know three things now. One:

831
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,920
等下次我見到這傢伙我搞死他
I'm gonna fuck that guy up next time I see him.

832
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,500
第二 我被一種叫做歐西裡斯主軸的東西卡住了
Two: Whatever I'm stuck in is called the Osiris spindle.

833
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,550
第三 文托並不知道它開始運行了
And three: Ventor has no idea that it's working.

834
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,670
傑瑪不知怎的 把我捲進這一切 但為什麼呢
That somehow, Jemma put me inside this thing and started it up. But why?

835
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,670
她復活了她死去的丈夫歐西裡斯
She resurrected her dead husband, Osiris.

836
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,840
奧西裡斯成了死亡以及來世的
Osiris became the Lord of the Dead

837
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:51,170
統治者
and the afterlife.

838
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,170
我就是歐西裡斯
I'm Osiris.

839
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:15,670
傑瑪把我送進了主軸中 為了阻止他們 阻止文托
Jemma put me in the Spindle to stop them, to stop Ventor.

840
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,670
她需要我盡可能多的重複一切
She needs me to keep repeating this day until I do.

841
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
她擁有著信心
She had... She had faith.

842
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,380
該死 她還相信我
Son of a bitch, she still believed in me.

843
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,920
她知道我能打敗他們
She knew I could beat them.

844
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,840
你好 我想要學會用劍來戰鬥
Hi. I need to learn how to fight with a sword.

845
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,550
我不明你剛才說的是什麼
I have no idea what you just said.

846
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,800
我想要學習用劍戰鬥
I need to learn to fight with a sword.

847
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,250
你身上有些很迷人的東西我喜歡
There's something intriguing about you that I like.

848
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,500
我明早要坐飛機回去上海
I fly home to Shanghai in the morning.

849
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,550
-我只有一天時間 -一天可以做很多事
- I would only have a day. - I thinik we can get a lot done in a day.

850
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,550
我是初學者但我學得很快
I'm a beginner, but I'm a quick learner.

851
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,130
是那個揮舞它的人使它成為武器 羅伊
It is the one who wields it that makes it a weapon, Roy.

852
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,300
劍不僅是一把像車鑰匙的工具 更是身體的延伸
That sword is no more an extension of you than a set of car keys.

853
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:32,550
我受過一些訓練 而且我保持勤學苦練
I've had some training, but I'm willing to work hard.

854
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,840
在二流劍客手中劍不過是一塊
In lesser hands, the Jian blade is just a

855
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,250
劣質的硬鋼
flimsy piece of forged steel.

856
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,420
但在最堅定抓握和最敏銳眼神的掌控下
But within the most determined grip and under the keenest eyes

857
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,880
會成為一種致命的武器
it becomes a weapon of annihilation.

858
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:50,920
我有過一位非常厲害的老師 但我想學得更多
I've had a very good teacher, but I need to learn more.

859
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,130
嗨 帥哥
Hello, handsome.

860
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,670
你要放棄了嗎
Are you surrendering?

861
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,170
你不是真的想用劍來戰鬥 是吧
You're not really going to fight with a sword, are you?

862
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,250
我喜歡你的勇氣
I do like your confidence.

863
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,550
通常我是比較聰明的
Normally I'm a little more chatty.

864
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,840
我有件事要說
I do have one thing to say.

865
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,550
但得先等等
But I think it'll wait.

866
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,380
就這狗屎玩意兒 還假裝是鋼做的呢
Shit's about to get steel.

867
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,920
狗雜種
Motherfucker.

868
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,420
我想要說
I wanted to say was:

869
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,050
我叫羅伊 羅伊任務完成
I'm Roy. And Roy has done this.

870
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,460
哇嗚
Woah.

871
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:24,130
佈雷特
Brett...

872
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,670
我聞到了松餅的味道 你也能聞到嗎
I smell muffins. Do you smell muffins?

873
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,050
我要裂開了
I'll just walk it off.

874
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,170
而現在我什麼也看不到了
And now I'm blind.

875
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,210
-他看起來像一隻兩英尺高的獨角獸 -你這個狡猾的混蛋
- Looks like a four hundred pound unicorn. - You slippery son of a bitch.

876
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,840
-你要拿那把槍嗎 -我不想
- You gonna go for that gun? - I'm not.

877
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,920
-你知道為什麼嗎 -不知
- And do you know why? - No.

878
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,880
因為打你會讓我爽到爆
Because I'm gonna get great satisfaction from beating the shit out of you.

879
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,050
怎麼可能？
How?

880
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,630
你覺得呢
How do you think?

881
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:25,380
-主軸 她啟動了它 -她讓我進來的 夥計
- Spindle. She activated it. - Jemma. She put me inside, pal.

882
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,550
她把我送了進去 來阻止你
She put me inside to stop you,

883
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,550
然後你殺了她 因為她知道你要做什麼 文托
then you killed her because she knew what you were, Ventor.

884
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,710
想重塑整個世界的獨裁統治
A wannabe dictator, bent on a worldwide re-do.

885
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,170
該死的自?主義者
Fucking liberals.

886
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:41,670
在她放出她的洋娃娃瑪麗亞之前 她有費心地提到
Before she launched her little Hail-Mary, did she bother to mention

887
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,420
主軸反應如果太長時間 會摧毀整個星球嗎
that a spindle reaction, if maintained too long, can destroy the entire planet?

888
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,590
別擔心白癡 你是看不到世界終結時了
Don't worry, dickhead. If the world comes to an end, you won't be around to see it.

889
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,880
主軸賦予我們上帝的力量
The spindle gives us the power of God

890
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,170
來改變我們的整個世界不走向災難
to re-create our whole world, minus the tragedy.

891
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,050
-阿道夫希特勒 911 -別再扯淡了
- Adolf Hitler, 9/11... - Shut up with this bullshit speech.

892
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,300
過去就是過去 文托 這是為後人發明的東西
The past is the past, Ventor. It's designed to be left behind.

893
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,840
我們在生活中學習
We live and we learn from it.

894
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,880
這些話出自一個失蹤的丈夫和一個失敗的父親
And this from an absentee husband and a failed father.

895
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,550
我還以為你會更想要去做那些曾經未及之事
I would have thought you'd have more than a passing interest in re-doing things.

896
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:20,130
-比如你的兒子 -我兒子 怎麼了
- What about your son? - My son?

897
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,420
小喬 是吧
Young Joe, isn't it?

898
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,380
如果你跑這麼遠 來殺我
If you've come all this way to kill me,

899
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,670
誰去救他呢
well then who's saving him?

900
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,880
我從未想到喬會有危險
It never thought Joe would be in danger.

901
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,380
我沒有想到他會成為目標
I never thought in a million years that they'd ever target him.

902
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,170
如果他們傷害他的話 我要將文托
I'll kill Ventor and every one of those motherfuckers

903
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,070
和所有的雜碎碎屍萬段
a thousand times if they hurt that kid.

904
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:51,800
先生 先生 留在路障後面 先生 你不能過去
Sir, sir, behind the barricade, sir! You can't go that way, sir!

905
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,460
聽著夥計你得去路障後面
Pal, I need you behind the barricade. Pal!

906
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,920
我讓他死去多少次了
How many times have I let him die?

907
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,300
我的兒子
My son!

908
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:33,130
那是我的兒子我得去救他
It's my son! I need to save my son!

909
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,670
不
No!

910
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,670
在這
And there it is.

911
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,710
世界末日
The end of the world.

912
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,170
為什麼不會呢
Why not?

913
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,090
我的使命已經結束
Mine's already over.

914
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:01,750
我能感覺到不僅僅是死亡
I can feel it. Not just death,

915
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,460
我四分五裂 我的每一個部分
being unravelled, every part of me splits and splits again

916
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,960
都在一點點分崩離析
along with everything else.

917
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:11,300
我感到無能為力 唯一有能力改變一切的人卻已經死了
There's nowhere left to run and the one person who can help is dead.

918
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,630
我為她報了什麼仇
So what if I avenged her?

919
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,130
是我殺了她 不是文托 是我 我做的
I'm the one that killed her. Not Ventor, me. I did it.

920
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,340
我逃離了我們的感情 從而殺死了她
I killed her when I ran from relationship.

921
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,000
我沒有擔負起養育孩子的責任 我就已經殺了她
I killed her when I ran from raising our son. I killed her...

922
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,170
當我不給她回電話的時候
When I didn't call her back.

923
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,050
我就是她死亡的原因
I'm the reason she's gone.

924
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,420
我就是喬死亡的原因
I'm the reason Joe's gone.

925
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,050
我就是世界末日到來的原因
I am the reason the world ends.

926
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,960
有什麼意義呢
What the hell is the point?

927
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,130
我為什麼要去做嘗試呢
Why the hell should I even bother trying?

928
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:42,920
什麼都不重要了
Nothing will ever matter again.

929
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,500
你鍾愛的一切都已失去
Not when you've lost everything you've loved.

930
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:54,050
當你對人類的末日負有責任的時候
Not when you're responsible for the loss of all human life as we know it.

931
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,380
幹得好 你個混蛋
Nice job, asshole.

932
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:09,170
不能讓我至少睡一次好覺嗎
Can't you ever let me sleep in just once?

933
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,000
所以就是這樣
So this is it, then.

934
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,300
事情就是如此
This is it, huh?

935
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:20,710
你會後悔嗎 永遠 日復一日嗎
Are you just gonna feel sorry for yourself forever? Day in, day out?

936
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,630
你他媽的什麼都不做
You're not gonna do a god damn thing?

937
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:25,280
即使你什麼都做不了
Even if there isn't a god damn thing you can do?

938
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,380
不
No.

939
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,090
你是
You are.

940
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,380
你得做點什麼
You're gonna do something.

941
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,960
現在時間已經沒有任何意義了 不會有什麼再跟你作對
Time means nothing now. It's no longer counting against you.

942
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
-有人要搶我的車！
- I'm being car-jacked! 

943
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,550
你也不會認識你兒子
You never got to know your son, so...

944
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,420
如果沒有遺漏下什麼的話
if that's all that's left,

945
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,250
這會比你應得的還要多
it's more than you ever deserved.

946
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:12,670
嗨 喬
Hey, Joe.

947
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:17,840
羅伊你在這裡做什麼發生了什麼事
Roy, what are you doing here? What happened to you?

948
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,380
我從營房裡跑出來了
I fell off a building.

949
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,250
翹課出來的嗎
Skipping school?

950
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,420
-我猜是吧 有電子競技比賽 -你怎麼知道的
- Let me guess: pop-up e-sports tournament. - How'd you know?

951
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:30,500
-我什麼都知道 -你是玩家嗎
- Where do you think I'm going? - You're a gamer?

952
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,250
我當然是玩家
Absolutely I'm a gamer.

953
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:35,630
我在X -BOX上看到了你 我就過來了
I knew you were on your X-Box every time I came over, but I didn't want to

954
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:37,170
我不會跟你媽媽說的 你知道嗎
blow it with your mom, you know.

955
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:41,050
我喜歡80年代的經典遊戲
I'm into like the old eighties vintage side-scroller games

956
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:44,090
-就像巨獸和雙龍那種 -街頭霸王
- like Altered Beast and Double Dragon. - Street Fighter?

957
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,750
我最喜歡這個了
It's my favourite.

958
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:48,630
-我也是 -是嗎 -是啊
- Mine too. - Yeah?

959
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:52,130
-但我也喜歡新遊戲 -嘿 羅伊
- I like the new stuff, too, though... - Hey, Roy,

960
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,420
我翹課出來 媽媽會生氣嗎
do you think mom will be pissed that I bailed on school.

961
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,500
你知道嗎 她會很生氣的
You know what? She'll be pissed.

962
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,920
但我會替你打掩護的好嗎
But I'm gonna cover for you, okay?

963
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,300
-好 -但不要再翹課了 好嗎 -好
- But no more skipping school, okay? - Cool.

964
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,550
-一言為定嗎 -當然
- Cool? - Cool.

965
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,750
那我們就去玩街頭霸王吧
So let's go play some Street Fighter.

966
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,750
-你死定了 -你死定了
- You're gonna die. - No, you're gonna die.

967
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,920
你會被幹死輸掉的
You're gonna die and fail...

968
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,500
我搞砸了但我還活
Oh, my bad! But I'm still alive!

969
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,880
這個遊戲太老了 叫什麼名字來 格拉卡嗎
This game is so old! What's it called? Glaca?

970
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,210
加拉加加拉加
- This game's broken. - Galaga. Galaga.

971
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,920
重擊面門
Right in the face!

972
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,800
-反正我贏了 -當然
- I still won. - I got it!

973
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,420
直接擊倒
K.O.

974
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,380
-你贏了 -你為什麼這麼喜歡這個遊戲
- You win! - Why do you like this game so much?

975
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,750
有很多人在追你 你必須殺掉他們
Well, there's a lot of people that chase you and you get to kill them.

976
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,300
-那是一次力量提升 -超級芝麻菜
- That was a power boost. - Oh, that was Aku- Arugula?

977
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,630
-是芝麻菜嗎 -阿魯根
- Was that the Arugula? - Hadouken!

978
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:55,250
阿魯根再來
Haru-gen again!

979
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,670
阿魯根
Haru-gen!

980
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:01,590
-你是怎麼 -你藏了
- How did you ...? - You win!

981
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,710
-這變得越來越難了 -對 抓住那個女孩 那個女孩
- This is where it it gets hard. - Yeah, get the girl. Get the girl.

982
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,380
你知道嗎 我來給你展示怎麼玩
You know what? Let me show you how its done.

983
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,670
那個人不斷地出現
Man, these guys keep coming.

984
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,750
我不知道
You have no idea.

985
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,820
-我不怕他們 -對一個不會騎自行車的人來說 你已經很聰明了
For a kid who doesn't go to school that much you're pretty smart.

986
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,170
我有我自己的玩法
I have my ways.

987
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,050
你又打敗我了
You beat me again.

988
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,250
我也是個大師啦
Of course, because I'm the master.

989
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,800
我想回到過去 我曾經搞砸了的那些年
All the years of this that I missed.

990
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,500
他擁有傑瑪的外表
He has Jemma's looks,

991
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,300
她的敏銳性 幽默感
her smarts, her sense of humor.

992
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:43,170
謝天謝地
Thank God.

993
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,170
然後我看到他笑了我看到了我自己
Then I see that kid laugh and I see myself.

994
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,380
只是一瞬間
Just a flash.

995
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,050
就像我在看我自己的笑臉
I see my own face smiling back at me

996
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,130
這讓我心碎
it breaks my heart.

997
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,050
我可以永遠這樣下去 我就是這麼想的
I could do forever, and I just might.

998
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,690
下去我就是這麼想的

999
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,270
我可以永遠這樣下去 我就是這麼想的

1000
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:13,550
我們過了超過十幾次這樣的日子
We've ended this day just like this over a dozen times now.

1001
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,670
永遠不會變老
It never gets old.

1002
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,300
我喜歡在一切終結時 他睡著的樣子
I like that he's sound asleep when it all ends.

1003
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,300
甚至都不會有一絲顫抖
I like that he never stirs once.

1004
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,500
我想像以前那樣告訴他 我是他的父親 但是我害怕
I want to tell him that I'm his father, like I did before, but I'm scared.

1005
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,920
害怕他不會再像那樣看著我
I'm scared he won't look at me that way again.

1006
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:39,420
害怕無法再從他的眼睛裡看到我想看到的東西
I won't see what I saw in his eyes.

1007
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,170
所以我什麼也沒有說
So I say nothing.

1008
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,130
有朝一日 我想要有一艘船 載著媽媽
I want to get a boat one day. Take mom out in it.

1009
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,300
她其實哪兒也不想去
She never gets out at all.

1010
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,170
我想要租一艘
I just wish I could rent one.

1011
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:01,630
-我該租一艘嗎 -一艘船嗎
- Could we rent one? - A boat?

1012
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,880
對 帶媽媽出海
Yeah. Take mom out in it.

1013
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,880
-為什麼不呢 -什麼時候
- I don't see why not. - When?

1014
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:08,920
隨時我們可以
Whenever, I... We could...

1015
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:12,880
我想告訴他 這個週末 我們就可以
This is when I tell him we can do it this weekend.

1016
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,630
然後給媽媽留言 說我們要去航海了
Then he send his mom a text telling her that we're all going sailing.

1017
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,420
這種情況經常發生
This is what usually happens.

1018
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,820
喬
Joey...

1019
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,090
-你知道 你媽媽 -怎麼
- You know, your mom... - Yeah?

1020
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,250
-你知道你媽媽在做什麼嗎 -歐西裡斯的主軸
- Do you know what your mom is working on? - The Osiris spindle?

1021
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,300
歐西裡斯主軸
Osiris spindle.

1022
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,630
你知道這是做什麼的嗎
You know what that does?

1023
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,380
她不能講 說是頂級機密什麼的
She can't talk about it because it's like super secret and whatever.

1024
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,840
但我聽她說過 這個可以毀滅一切
But I overheard her say it could wipe out everything,

1025
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,050
我是說全世界 如果他們稍不小心的話
like the world, I guess, if they weren't careful.

1026
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:45,800
你相信嗎
Do you believe that?

1027
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
是我信
Yeah, I do.

1028
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,130
我希望我不信
I wish I didn't.

1029
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:57,300
你媽媽信任我而我讓她失望了
Your mom trusted me with something and I let her down.

1030
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,170
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

1031
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:06,420
-昨晚 你媽媽 -她沒回家
- Last night, your mom... - She didn't come home.

1032
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:11,800
-我知道 -她有新男朋友了嗎
- I know. - Does she have a new boyfriend?

1033
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,420
不不是新男朋友
No. There's no new boyfriend.

1034
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,050
她知道我翹課了嗎
Did she know I was ditching school?

1035
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,880
-看上去 你一直在跟著我 -是 不過
- It felt like you were following me. - Yeah, I was,

1036
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,880
倒不是這個原因
but not for that reason.

1037
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,210
-那為什麼 -我不知道
- Why then? - I don't know.

1038
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:33,340
我看見你了 我就想和你聊聊 我們之前沒怎麼交流過
I saw you and I wanted to talk to you. Catch up, we haven't spoken to each other.

1039
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,130
你為什麼覺得我在跟著你
Why did you think I was following you?

1040
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,090
因為媽媽早上說過些事情
Just something Mom said this morning.

1041
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,960
?等等 什麼 -在電話上 很奇怪
- Wait, what? - On the phone. It was weird.

1042
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,170
她說如果我遇到了什麼麻煩 就去找你
She said if I got into any trouble, that I should find you.

1043
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,920
喬 是媽媽 快接電話 拜託
Joe, it's Mom. Pick up the phone, please.

1044
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,170
-我不明白她在說些什麼 -你今天跟你媽媽說過話嗎
- I didn't know what she was talking about. - You spoke to mom today?

1045
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:00,000
當今天發生一些奇怪的事情時 我想要你打電話給羅伊 好嗎
If anything strange happens, I want you to call Roy, okay?

1046
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,920
-那是幾點 -我不知道
- What time? - I don't know, um...

1047
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,500
我會把他的電話號碼發給你 但現在快給我回電話 再見寶貝
I'm gonna text you his number, but call me back. Bye baby.

1048
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,380
嘿 夥計 讓我看看你的手機
Hey bud, let me see your phone.

1049
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:17,130
我醒來的時候 她還活著
She was still alive when I woke up.

1050
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,050
文托還沒有殺她
Ventor hadn't killed her.

1051
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,920
她還沒有死
She wasn't dead yet.

1052
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,050
別擔心 兒子 我會回來找你的
Don't worry, son. I'll come back for you.

1053
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,250
我會回來找你們兩個的
I'm coming back for both of you.

1054
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,750
你要殺死她
You killed her.

1055
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:58,500
-你他媽的怎麼到這兒來的 -她在哪兒 她在哪兒
- How the hell did you get in here? - Where is she? Where is she?!

1056
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:40,880
-你想要毀掉證據嗎 -我想要搞清楚 她做了什麼
- You trying to erase the evidence? - Trying to figure out what she was doing.

1057
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,380
-她打算如何運行 -閉嘴 佈雷特
- How she was able to initiate the spindle... - Shut your mouth, Brett!

1058
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,630
繼續繼續
Continue. Continue!

1059
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,630
我們沒有搞清楚 歐西裡斯的主軸 是如何工作的
We can't get the Osiris spindle to function.

1060
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:00,250
她引發的連鎖反應 我們無法控制
Whatever she did started a chain reaction that we can't control.

1061
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,250
不知何故 她對它進行了破壞 現在已無法匹配
She sabotaged it somehow and it's not responding.

1062
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,380
狗娘養的
You son of a bitch.

1063
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,000
主軸在工作
The spindle is working.

1064
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:13,800
是你她讓你變成了缺失的部分
It's you. She made you the missing mass.

1065
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,170
否則你怎麼會進入設備呢
Otherwise, how could you have broken into this facility?

1066
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,800
多少
How...

1067
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,050
你嘗試了多少次了
How many times have you done this?

1068
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:27,250
-很多次了 -成功了
- A lot. - It works.

1069
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,500
我醒來後 她至少還活了14分鐘
She was alive at least 14 minutes after I woke up.

1070
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,670
我有時間去救她
I have time to save her.

1071
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:50,750
好吧 就這麼做
Okay. Lets do this.

1072
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,650
只有傑瑪能阻止這一切
Jemma is the only one who can stop this,

1073
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:56,730
我還有14分鐘去找她
and you have at least 14 minutes to reach her.

1074
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,090
去他媽的開始吧
What the hell. Here we go.

1075
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,210
那個混蛋剛剛跳了出來
The fuckin' asshole just jumped.

1076
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,670
走啊混蛋快走啊
Fly, motherfucker.

1077
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,880
我只有十二分半鐘 給我盡可能快的飛
I've got twelve and a half minutes. Make this thing go faster.

1078
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,670
快點
Move!

1079
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,630
飛得不錯白癡
Nice flying, dick.

1080
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,300
現土	要一場真正的大殲滅
I want the big knock down, drag out now...

1081
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:00,130
多尼布魯克 皇家戰役
A Donnybrook. The Battle Royale.

1082
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:08,800
他們過來了 而我可以群滅他們不浪費一點時間
Bring 'em all on, every last one of 'em so I can light 'em up and lay waste...

1083
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:21,050
為了這一幕我等了很久
Because I've been waiting for this for a long fucking time.

1084
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,920
不需太久
Maybe too long.

1085
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,250
所以你知道 我可沒一整天時間陪他們玩
I mean, you know, I don't have all day.

1086
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,050
嘿 佈雷特
Hey, Brett!

1087
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,960
你來救我了
You came for me.

1088
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:01,380
你做到了
You did it.

1089
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,260
你來救我了
You came for me.

1090
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,420
-你嘗試了多少次 -就一次
- How many times did it take? - Just one.

1091
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,550
我時間不多快點
We don't have much time. Come on.

1092
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:21,420
我不能直接告訴你 他們在監視著我
I couldn't tell you. They were watching me.

1093
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,000
我不得不整晚潛入實驗室
I had to sneak around the lab all night.

1094
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,920
我只好把書帶給你了
I barely got that book to you.

1095
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,340
剛剛夠用
It was just enough.

1096
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,250
我覺得文託派了什麼人 去找喬了
I think Ventor sent men after Joe.

1097
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,420
一個人也沒落下 傑瑪 都幹掉了
There's no one left. They're all gone, Jemma.

1098
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,090
喬是安全的
Joe's fine.

1099
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,920
他為了電子遊戲逃了學 但他沒事的
He's skipping school for a gamer con, but he's okay.

1100
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,920
你是怎麼知道的
How do you know that?

1101
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:55,130
他喜歡他們班一個叫卡米爾的女孩
He's got a crush on a girl in his class named Camille.

1102
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,670
他和她坐同一輛公車上學
He showed her all the bus routes to school

1103
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,130
但他不敢約她出去玩
but he's afraid to ask her to be his girl.

1104
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:04,710
幾周前 他和他的朋友懷亞特為了參加
He and his friend Wyatt, they lied about their age

1105
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:08,050
彩彈錦標賽而謊報了自己的年齡
a couple of weeks ago to enter a paintball tournament.

1106
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:10,500
你還記得他脖子上的瘀傷嗎
You asked him about a welt on his neck.

1107
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,880
他說他那裡被蟲子咬了
He said he got it from a bug bite.

1108
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,920
他上個月玩滑板時摔斷了他手腕
He fractured his wrist last month skateboarding

1109
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:24,000
現在那裡能發出相當奇怪的聲音 -當然
- and now it makes this weird clicking sound. - Clicking

1110
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:28,800
他喜歡狗 尤其是哈巴狗
He loves dogs, especially pugs

1111
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,800
他覺得你們應該養一隻
and he thinks you two should rescue one.

1112
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:38,500
大約一年前他用水彩畫了
梵古的星空之夜給你 祝你生日快樂
He did a watercolor version of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' about a year ago

1113
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:41,170
因為他知道 那是你最喜歡的畫
for your birthday because he knew it was your favourite painting.

1114
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:47,090
他覺得媽媽工作太多 微笑太少
He thinks mom works too much and doesn't smile enough

1115
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,750
但這個男孩真的非常愛你
But that boy loves you so much.

1116
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,420
我怎樣才能終止這玩意兒 傑瑪
How do I stop this, Jemma?

1117
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:09,050
這不是終止 羅伊 是重置
It's not about stopping, Roy. It's about restarting.

1118
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:16,420
我用你的DNA作了主軸內缺失的部分
I made your dimensions, your DNA specific to the missing mass within the spindle.

1119
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:17,850
-這是什麼意思
What does that mean?

1120
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,550
-你必須進入主軸的核心
It means you have to enter the Spindle's core, then theoretically

1121
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:27,550
接著 理論上 時空將會連續重置並恢復到正常
the time-space continuum should reset and resume.

1122
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:31,550
-理論上？ -我不知道
- Theoretically? - I don't know.

1123
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,000
說實話我不知道羅伊
I honestly don't, Roy.

1124
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,920
整件事都是匆忙中決定的 我只是想阻止文托
This whole thing's so cobbled together. I was just trying to stop Ventor.

1125
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:41,000
我甚至都不知道 它是否會有效 直到你出現
I didn't even know it worked until you showed up.

1126
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:45,670
我只記得 我昨晚剛剛見過你
You have to remember, I just saw you yesterday.

1127
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:49,000
而我已經很久都沒見過你了
And I haven't seen you in forever.

1128
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:54,670
我不知道還能做什麼還能去哪裡
I didn't know what else to do, where else to turn.

1129
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:01,550
我知道你是誰
I just knew the man you were.

1130
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,380
我知道你是什麼樣的人
I know the man you are.

1131
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:10,250
但我不知道如果你去了機器裡面你會怎麼樣
But I don't know what will happen to you if you go in there.

1132
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,960
但我知道如果我不去的話會發生什麼
But I know what happens if I don't.

1133
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,590
你見過了世界的終結
You saw it? The end of the world?

1134
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:29,800
-對 -是什麼樣子
- Yeah. - What was it like?

1135
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:36,630
它比你能想像到最不可思議的還要糟糕一百萬倍
It was everything you imagine it to be, only a million times worse.

1136
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:45,500
如果我走進這個機器 那什麼都會正常嗎
Will it go forward? If I walk through this thing

1137
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:48,300
它會重置嗎 你和喬是不是就安全了
Is it gonna reset? Are you and Joe gonna be safe?

1138
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:53,000
如果你讓你的部分品質回歸到機器的核心 它就會重置
If you return your mass to the core, it should.

1139
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,300
但有可能會失敗
You may not make it.

1140
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,380
你可能會不復存在
You may cease to be.

1141
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,590
那
Well then...

1142
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:03,420
親我一下 說你愛我
Give me a kiss and tell me you love me.

1143
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,000
我愛你
I love you.

1144
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:34,550
-等著我 好嗎 -我會的
- Wait for me, huh? - I will.

1145
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:41,420
媽了個巴子 老子要上了
What the hell. Here we go.
