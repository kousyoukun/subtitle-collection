“水晶湖营地1958年”

2
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,392
杰呢？
Where's Jay?

3
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:37,102
马铃薯烤了多久？
你是怎么做到的？
How long were those potatoes under the fire?
How'd you do that?

4
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,287
- 会被别人看到的
- 不可能
-Somebody will see!
-No way.

5
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,060
玛丽安的吻功和我的一样高明吗？
-Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?
-How would I know?

6
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,222
我怎么知道？

7
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,526
你哦…

8
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:18,271
- 你说我们的感情很特别
- 我说的是真心话
-You said we were special.
-I meant everything.

9
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,989
- 不可以这样
- 别这么保守
-That's not allowed.
-Come on.

10
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,669
别这样，男人又不是石头做的
Come on. A man is not made out of stone.

11
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,607
有人来了
Somebody's there!

12
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:37,683
我们什么都没做，我们只是玩玩…
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing a--

13
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,597
拜托

14
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:50,670
拜托，不要！
Please, don't!

15
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,785
不！
No!

16
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:25,833

“6月13日
星期五，现代”

20
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:21,755
嗨，小女生…
对不起，你是小男生
Hi, girl. Excuse me! Hi, boy.

21
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,191
你会讲英文吗？
You speak English?
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?

22
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,524
这里离水晶湖营地有多远？

23
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,154
有这么远吗？
That far?
Okey-dokey. See you later.

24
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,529
好，回头见

25
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:43,374
现在是6月13日星期五
七点零一分
It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.

26
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:48,247
我是大维
各位懒骨头，可以起床了
This is Big Dave and it's time for you
lazybones to get out of bed.

27
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,946
今天是水晶湖的黑猫日
It's black-cat day in Crystal Lake.

28
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,224
“高杰奇案录”
我大概看了82遍
I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.

29
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,392
请问一下，水晶湖营地离这里有多远？
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake from here?

30
00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:14,645
有多远，伊诺斯？差不多20英里吧
What is it, Enos? About 20 miles?

31
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:16,780
- 差不多
- 血腥营地？
-About that.
-Camp Blood?

32
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:20,907
- 那个地方又重新开放啦？
- 祝你好运
-They're opening that place again?
-Lots of luck.

33
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,449
- 我可以坐公车去吗？
- 不太可能
-Can I get a bus or something?
-Not likely.

34
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,751
伊诺斯，你不是要去十字路口吗？
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?
What about a lift? That would be halfway.

35
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,918
你可以载她一程，反正差不多在半路上

36
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:33,930
没问题，楚蒂
小妹，咱们走吧
No sweat, Trudy. Okay, kid, let's move it.

37
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,363
- 我叫安妮
- 好，安妮，咱们走
-Name's Annie.
-All right, Annie, let's go.

38
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,742
营地其他的女生也像你一样漂亮吗？
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?

39
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,904
我不知道
I don't know.

40
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:55,143
- 你要去血腥营地，对吧？
- 劳夫，该死的，滚开
-You're going to Camp Blood, ain't you?
-Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!

41
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:58,518
- 别烦她了
- 你此番有去无回
-Leave people alone!
-You'll never come back!

42
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,988
闭嘴，劳夫
Oh, shut up, Ralph!

43
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:04,194
那里被诅咒了
It's got a death curse!

44
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,259
这小子真是个末日先知，对吧？
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

45
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:12,096
上车吧，小姐
Climb up, miss.

46
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,650
他的胡言乱语让你的老板伤透脑筋
He's causing problems enough
for your boss with all that talk.

47
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,052
这家伙真是个讨厌鬼
Goddamn nuisance.

48
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,881
- 他有没有跟你说了些什么？
- 谁？
-He tell you anything?
-Who?

49
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,824
你老板，史帝夫克斯帝
Your boss. Steve Christy.

50
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,794
他说我要帮50个小孩和十个工作人员烧菜
I'll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.

51
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,632
来这里露营的多半是贫民区的小孩
-Campers will mostly be inner-city children.
-No, I mean about what happened.

52
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,759
不，我说的是当年发生的事

53
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,368
没有
No.

54
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:32,312
你一定有事瞒着我
Come on. There's something
you're not telling me.

55
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,480
我劝你现在就辞职
-Quit. Quit now.
-Quit? Why would I want to quit?

56
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:39,681
辞职？为什么？

57
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,689
水晶湖营地被诅咒了
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

58
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:45,285
连你也说这种话
Terrific. Not you too. You sound
like your crazy friend back there.

59
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,455
你和刚刚那个疯子劳夫差不多嘛

60
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,261
也许吧
克斯帝有没有告诉你
Well, maybe. Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

61
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:53,269
58年那两个年轻人被杀的事？

62
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:58,434
57年那个男孩淹死的事？
还有当年那些火灾？
Boy drowning in '57? A bunch of fires?

63
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:00,636
警方根本查不出是谁干的好事
Nobody knows who did any of them.

64
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:05,440
1962年他们打算再度开张，结果水有问题
In 1962, they were going to open up.
The water was bad.

65
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,381
克斯帝迟早会落得像他爸妈一样
Christy will end up like his folks:
Crazy and broke.

66
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,782
变成个一文不明的疯子

67
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:14,051
他用了一整年整修那个地方，
至少花了两万五千元
He's been up there a year fixing up that
place. Must have dropped $25,000.

68
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:17,525
他这是何苦？你去问问别人就知道
And for what? Ask anybody.

69
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:22,190
- 辞职吧！
- 我不能
-Quit!
-I can't.

70
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,233
你们这些傻小孩自以为无所不知
Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

71
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:29,329
就像我的┡一样，脑袋里都装石头
Just like my nieces. Heads full of rocks.

72
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,532
你真是个典型的美国人
-You're an American original.
-I'm an American original.

73
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,043
我真是个典型的美国人

74
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:40,680
傻孩子，至少我不怕鬼
-Dumb kid.
-At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

75
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:06,372
- 孩子，保重
- 没问题，谢谢你载我一程
-Take care of yourself.
-No sweat. Thanks for the lift.

76
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:42,538
玛西，你说水晶湖营地
Hey, Marcie. You really think
there'll be other gorgeous women...

77
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,979
会不会有其他像你这样标致的妞儿？
...at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

78
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,180
奈德，你满脑子只有性爱吗？
-Is sex all you ever think about, Ned?
-Hey, no. No. Absolutely not.

79
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,846
不…绝对不是

80
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:53,446
有时候我会想到跟女生接吻
Sometimes I just think about kissing women.

81
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:32,086
“欢迎光临水晶湖营地”

82
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,882
- 过来帮个忙吧
- 没问题
-You wanna give me a hand over here?
-Sure.

83
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,917
艾莉丝！我要把这棵树桩挖起来
Alice! I wanna get this tree stump out.

84
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:07,429
你们过来拉这边，艾莉丝！
Get on this side, you pull
on that side. Alice!

85
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:08,760
我来了
Coming.

86
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:15,470
- 好极了，我是史帝夫克斯帝
- 我是杰克
-That's great. I'm Steve Christy.
-Jack.

87
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,336
- 我叫玛西
- 我是奈德鲁宾斯坦
-Marcie
-Ned Rubinstein.

88
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,144
欢迎来到水晶湖营地
这是艾莉丝
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.

89
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:22,540
史帝夫，二号小木屋已经准备好了
Hi. Steve, Cabin B is all ready.

90
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,309
比尔呢？他把船屋整理好了吗？
-Where's Bill? Cleaning out the boathouse?
-Haven't seen him in half an hour.

91
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,179
我已经半个小时没看到他了

92
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,719
我要他开始油漆，布兰达呢？
I wanted him to start painting. Brenda?

93
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,983
- 你叫她整理射箭场
- 不，我要叫她去油漆
-Setting up the archery range.
-I'd rather she paint. Come on. Let's go.

94
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,751
大家动作快

95
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:36,923
我们不是有两个星期的时间吗？
I thought we had two weeks.

96
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,794
跟我来，我带你们去换衣服
Come on. I'll show you
where you can get changed.

97
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:52,431
- 我来帮你
- 谢谢
-Here, let me give you a hand with that.
-Thank you.

98
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,344
可以了吗？
You got it?

99
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,534
你很会画画
You draw very well.

100
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,037
谢谢，可惜时间不够
Thanks. I wish I had more time to do it.

101
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,715
真蠢
Oh, dummy.

102
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,620
- 这是你什么时候画的？
- 昨天晚上
-When did you do this?
-Last night.

103
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:43,683
- 我真是这个德性吗？
- 你昨晚是这样没错
-Do I really look like that?
-You did last night.

104
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,995
你很有天份
You're very talented.

105
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,370
你也很漂亮
You're very pretty.

106
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,339
这份差事真的不适合你，对吧？
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?

107
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,246
有什么特别的原因吗？
Any particular reason?

108
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:07,945
这是我自己的问题，跟你没有关系
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

109
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,013
- 你要走了？
- 不知道
-You wanna leave?
-I don't know. I may have to...

110
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:16,683
我也许得回加州去处理一些事情
...go back to California
to straighten something out.

111
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:23,933
别这样，再给我一次机会
Come on. Give me another chance.

112
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:27,202
再留一个星期，帮我整顿这个地方
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.

113
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:34,169
到了周五你若去意仍坚，到时候我送你上车
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

114
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:38,405
好吧，再留一个星期，到星期五
All right. Friday. I'll give it a week.

115
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,656
谢了，艾莉丝
Thanks, Alice.

116
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,870
比尔，史帝夫想知道是不是要更多油漆
Bill? Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.

117
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:08,502
- 油漆够了，不过稀释剂不够
- 好，我告诉他
-Paint's all right. Need more thinner, though.
-Okay.

118
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:10,611
艾莉丝，其他人来了吗？
-Alice. Did the others show up?
-Yeah, everybody except that girl Annie.

119
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:13,741
大家都来了，只剩下安妮还没到

120
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:15,375
你熬得过整个夏天吗？
-Think you're gonna last all summer?
-I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

121
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:18,114
我连熬一个星期的信心都没有

122
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:21,550
我会告诉史帝夫多拿些稀释剂来
好
-I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
-Fine.

123
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:39,165
- 你要分开列表吗？
- 对
-You want it listed separately?
-Right.

124
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:42,473
布兰达，我要你先把射箭场整理好
Brenda, I want you to
finish the archery range.

125
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,674
安妮一到就叫她到厨房工作
If Annie gets here, get her started
in the kitchen. Do your best.

126
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,410
尽力而为，知道吗？

127
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:49,486
我吃完午饭就会回来
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

128
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:50,915
待会儿要下大雨了
It's supposed to rain like hell,
so get as much done as possible.

129
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,751
你们加紧赶工，我不希望进度落后太多

130
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:04,893
他忘了告诉我们，镇上的人称这里为血腥营地
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place "Camp Blood."

131
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:09,901
搞不好这里的厕所里有蛇，湖里还有鳄鱼
Next there'll be snakes in the
outhouse and crocodiles in the lake.

132
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,737
不，鳄鱼都在木屋里
No, the crocodiles are in the cabins.

133
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,567
- 你疯啦？
- 我花式射箭手法更高竿
-Are you crazy?
-Wanna see my trick shot? It's even better.

134
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,572
你真不可思议
I don't believe you!

135
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:57,448
甜心，你生气时更美
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

136
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,579
- 真的吗？
- 真的
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

137
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:01,658
你是来帮我还是来吓我的？
You come to help me or scare
me to death? You do that again...

138
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,491
你敢再来这招，我就把你钉在墙上
你说这话真性感
-...l'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
-I love that sexy talk!

139
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:34,284
嗨，我要去水晶湖营地
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

140
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,806
我一直都想跟孩子们共事
Guess I always wanted to
work with children.

141
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:56,174
我讨厌听别人叫他们“小鬼”，
听起来好像小羊
I hate when people call them "kids."
Sounds like little goats.

142
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,410
但我为了追求梦想，愿意不择手段
But when you've had a dream
as long as I have, you'll do anything.

143
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:26,133
刚刚那不是通往水晶湖营地的路吗？
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

144
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:33,547
我们最好停车
I think we better stop.

145
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:37,879
拜托
Please?

146
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,818
停车！拜托…
Stop, please! Please! Stop!

147
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:47,728
停车！拜托…
Please, stop!

148
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:14,413
不！…
No. No.

149
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,644
不
No.

150
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:33,867
大家一起来，往左边一点点…
All right, move it out. A little to the left.
Little to the left.

151
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:43,675
拉出去，往左边一点点…不…
Move it out. Move it out. Okay,
little to the left. Now-- No, no.

152
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:48,282
这样很好…很好…
Let's go. Okay. Okay. Good. Good.

153
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:03,993
如果你是冰淇淋，你要当什么口味？
If you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?

154
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,868
洛基巧克力
-Rocky Road.
-Hey!

155
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,978
你吃维他命C究竟是为了什么？
What's that vitamin C
stuff do for you, anyway?

156
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:27,956
维他命C可以中和硝酸盐
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

157
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,857
怎么了？你是不是看到什么了？
What's the matter? Do you see something?

158
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:37,866
没有…
No. Nothing.

159
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,277
奈德！走开
Ned! Get out of here!

160
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:51,275
我来抓你了

161
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:57,781
- 各位，准备开工了吗？
- 可以了
-Hey, you guys. Ready to go back to work?
-Yeah.

162
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,120
- 来吧，艾莉丝
- 救命…
-Come on, Alice.
-Help! Help!

163
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:07,663
奈德不太对劲
-Something's wrong with Ned.
-Get a life preserver!

164
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,364
去拿救生圈

165
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:29,312
- 他会游泳吗？
- 我不知道
-Can he swim?
-I don't know.

166
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:32,319
- 他在这附近
- 我来
-He's right around here somewhere.
-I got it.

167
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,889
潜下去找他
Go ahead, dive for him.

168
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,718
- 他在那里
- 快来救我
-There he is!
-Come on. Help me.

169
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,864
小心他的头
Watch his head.

170
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:49,729
- 小心他的头
- 抱住他了吗？
-Watch his head!
-Got him?

171
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,675
- 你会做口对口人工呼吸吗？
- 会
-Can you give mouth-to-mouth?
-Yeah.

172
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:08,325
- 天啊
- 加油，奈德
-Oh, God.
-Come on, Ned.

173
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:12,122
- 奈德
- 天啊！
-Oh, Neddy!
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

174
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,028
听着，对不起嘛…可以了吗？
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

175
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,360
比尔！
Bill!

176
00:25:55,706 --> 00:25:59,938
比尔，过来，快点…
Bill, come here, quick! Hurry!

177
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:07,650
- 什么事？
- 那里有一条蛇
-What is it?
-There's a snake over there.

178
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,416
在哪里？
Where?

179
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,661
- 我该怎么办？
- 杀了它
-What do I do?
-Kill it.

180
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:21,060
它说不定会咬我
It might bite.

181
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,429
- 你没进过丛林吗？
- 这里不是丛林
-Haven't you ever been in the woods?
-We're not in the woods.

182
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,465
- 比尔，你在做什么？
- 那里有一条蛇
-Bill, what are you doing?
-There's a snake.

183
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:30,267
- 我们进来干嘛？
- 别让我失望啊
-Why are we in here?
-Feet don't fail me now!

184
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:32,399
- 在那里
- 天啊
-There it is!
-Oh, God!

185
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:38,174
- 有蛇在这里我怎么睡觉？
- 没人提过这里有蛇
-I can't sleep with a snake in here.
-Nobody said anything about snakes.

186
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:42,275
- 杀了它
- 它不出来我怎么杀它？
-Kill it!
-I can't get it until it comes out.

187
00:26:42,386 --> 00:26:45,549
- 叫它出来
- 要怎么叫蛇啊？
-Well, call him!
-How do you call a snake?

188
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:46,918
我把它赶出来
I'll flush him!

189
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,921
- 我来
- 在哪里？
-I got it.
-Where--?

190
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:57,760
- 小心
- 让我来
-Look out!
-I got him!

191
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:03,501
天啊
Oh, God.

192
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:09,342
它死了吗？
Is it dead?

193
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,245
不是死了就是分裂了
Either that or it's got a very short clone.

194
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:20,251
- 至少我们知道晚餐菜色为何
- 玛西…
-Well, at least we know what's for dinner.
-Marcie!

195
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,893
我要做沙拉
要不要多做一点大家吃？
I'm making salad. Want me
to make some for everybody?

196
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:30,956
- 好极了，我们好像还有汉堡
- 我不吃汉堡
-That would be great. There's hamburger--
-None for me.

197
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,093
有苹果，你会做苹果派吗？
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?

198
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:36,969
- 当然，没问题
- 酷啊，怎么回事？
-Sure. No sweat.
-What is going on?

199
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,079
可恶
Oh, shit.

200
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:53,252
- 你们是谁？
- 我们是营地辅导员
-Who are you people?
-Camp counselors. Ned is just fooling around.

201
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:54,654
奈德只是闹着玩的

202
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,885
- 对，我只是…
- 闭嘴，酋长
-Right, just--
-Can it, Cochise.

203
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,461
是史帝夫克斯帝请你们来的？
他花钱请你们胡闹？
Steve Christy hire you people?
He pay you for this?

204
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,793
- 好帅的摩托车
- 小子，你抽烟了？
-Nice bike.
-You been smoking, boy?

205
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,526
抽烟？我不抽烟，抽烟会致癌
Smoking? Don't smoke. Causes cancer.

206
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:10,095
少装糊涂，你是不是骇了？是不是哈了草？
You just get off a spaceship or something?
Colombian gold. Grass. Hash. The weed.

207
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,437
- 他在说什么？
- 少自作聪明
-What's he talking about?
-Don't get smart.

208
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:16,569
- 我？我这个人最笨了
- 你给我闭嘴，懂吗？
-Me? I'm as dumb as they come.
-Not another word out of you, understand?

209
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,776
其实我们只是在整顿这个地方，如此而已
Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.

210
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:21,748
为什么？
For what?

211
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:23,319
警察先生，有没有什么要我们效劳的？
-Is there anything we can do to help?
-I'm looking for somebody.

212
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,888
- 我们很乐意帮忙
- 我在找人

213
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:29,823
- 找谁？
- 镇上的疯子劳夫
-Who's that?
-A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

214
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,793
这里没有疯子
There's no crazy people around here.

215
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,890
我不是叫你闭嘴吗？
I told you to sit on it, Tonto. I got word
Ralph was pedaling out this way...

216
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:41,661
我听说劳夫骑车往这儿来，
打算宣扬他的“福音”
我们没看到任何人
-...spouting his gospel.
-We haven't seen anybody here.

217
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:45,401
- 这里只有我们
- 这个叫劳夫的人有危险性吗？
-Just us.
-This guy Ralph. Is he dangerous?

218
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,203
那个疯子每次喝醉酒就抓狂
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

219
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,371
最后搞得我必须出庭作证让法官判他坐一周牢
I spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.

220
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:55,817
二号警车，你在哪里？听到请回答
Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.

221
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:59,749
我是多夫，我在水晶湖营地，通话完毕
This is Dorf. I'm out here
at Camp Crystal Lake. Over.

222
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:03,348
多夫，回来，老大要你回镇上
Haul it back in, Dorf.
Chief wants you back in town.

223
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,894
收到，我马上来，通话完毕
Roger that. 10-4. On my way. Out.

224
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,591
千万不能让老大久等
Never keep the chief waiting.

225
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:15,669
你们这些小鬼别惹麻烦，明白吗？
You kids keep your noses clean, understand?
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

226
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:18,003
否则我会找上门来的

227
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:24,972
我们这里可不容忍任何人为非作歹
We ain't gonna stand
for no weirdness out here.

228
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,992
我是上帝派来的使者，
你们留在这里只有死路一条
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.

229
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:21,470
这个地方被诅咒了，被诅咒了
This place is cursed. Cursed.

230
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:26,534
- 这里被下了死亡咒
- 你是谁？
-It's got a death curse!
-Who are you?

231
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:27,803
你想干嘛？
What do you want?

232
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:32,878
- 是上帝派我来的
- 走开
-God sent me.
-Get out of here, man!

233
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:37,309
我来警告你们，你们留在这里只有死路一条
I got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

234
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:42,724
快走吧…
Go. Go!

235
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,268
那个八成就是劳夫
-I think we just met Ralph.
-God, what's next?

236
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:57,897
天啊，接下来还会发生什么事？

237
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:12,850
你们全都死定了…
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

238
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,248
- 谁喜欢吃生一点的汉堡？
- 我
-Who likes them rare?
-Me.

239
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,547
你们怎么吃得下？看起来好像死掉的动物
How can you guys eat that?
It looks like dead animals.

240
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:44,347
死掉的动物？
Dead animals? That's the old counselors.
You cannibals!

241
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:47,480
那些是以前的辅导员，你们这些食人族

242
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,526
只要比例正确就能吸收身体所需的蛋白质
If you would mix this stuff right,
you'd get all the protein you need.

243
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:52,993
可惜安妮放我们鸽子，据说她厨艺高明
Too bad Annie never showed.
She was supposed to be a good cook.

244
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:57,965
- 可别指望我们当大厨
- 女人要造反了
-Don't expect me to play chef.
-The squaws are revolting.

245
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:01,136
- 有麻烦吗？
- 不是灯泡坏了就是停电
-Trouble?
-Yeah. A bad bulb or no power.

246
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,171
里面看起来阴森森的
Seems a little gloomy in here.

247
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:05,764
史帝夫教过我怎么用备用发电机
Steve taught me how to use
the emergency generator.

248
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:09,679
- 镇上的供电设备很蹩脚
- 瞧他一副男子汉的模样
-Town power lines are lousy.
-Don't you love that macho talk?

249
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,044
备用发电机
Emergency generator.

250
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:13,979
- 要不要过来帮我一下？
- 好
-Want to give me a hand?
-Yeah.

251
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,609
- 等我
- 你们留下来注意汉堡
-Wait for me.
-Can you watch the burgers?

252
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,280
- 没问题
- 烤焦算了
-Sure.
-Burn them.

253
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:27,029
- 他会不会大惊小怪？
- 我不知道
-Think he's gonna be bent out of shape?
-I don't know.

254
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:30,863
这台发电机和我叔叔
缅因州木屋里的那台差不多
This looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

255
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:34,528
- 试试看
- 真是老古董
-Well, here goes.
-What an antique.

256
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:46,075
神行了何等大事？
Well, what hath God wrought?

257
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,550
哈？
Hello?

258
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,532
有什么事吗？
Can I help you?

259
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,681
哈？…
Hello? Hello?

260
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:29,812
- 跟我来
- 我来了
-Come on.
-Coming, I'm coming.

261
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:38,256
起风了，而且风向180度大转变
Wind's come up.
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

262
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,421
这让我想紧紧拥抱你
Makes me want to hold onto you.

263
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:48,469
- 奈德怎么办？
- 我又不爱奈德
-What about Ned?
-I don't love Ned.

264
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:52,142
- 他像个大浑球
- 奈德
-He keeps acting like such a jerk.
-Neddy!

265
00:34:52,142 --> 00:34:57,346
别叫他
我还以为你想好好教训他一顿
-Don't call him.
-Thought you wanted to give him...
...one of your motherly lectures.

266
00:34:57,447 --> 00:35:00,575
奈德这个人本来就是为所欲为
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, you know?

267
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:06,816
暴风雨要来了，这里会被吹得七零八落
It's gonna storm. Gonna tear down
that valley like a son of a gun.

268
00:35:06,923 --> 00:35:09,448
我从小就怕暴风雨
I've been afraid of storms
since I was little.

269
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,527
真的吗？
No. Really?

270
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:17,123
我好几次梦到自己被困在暴风雨中
I've had this dream about five or six
times where I'm in a thunderstorm...

271
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:24,331
天上下着倾盆大雨，
雨珠落地时听起来像石头一样
...and it's raining really hard. It sounds
like pebbles when it hits the ground.

272
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,208
我听得到，我想捂住耳朵，但是没有用
I hear it and I try to block it out
with my hands, only it doesn't work.

273
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:32,645
声音越来越大
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.

274
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:39,149
后来雨珠变成血
And then the rain turns to blood...

275
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:44,389
血流成河
...and the blood washes away
in little rivers...

276
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:48,726
后来声音就没了
...and then the sound stops.

277
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,758
那只是个梦
-It's just a dream.
-I know. I call it my "shower dream."

278
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:56,737
我知道，我称之为“血雨梦”

279
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,666
这可不是梦，快走，咱们要变成落汤鸡了
Hey, hey. This is no dream.
Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

280
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,660
杰克和玛西会被淋成落汤鸡
Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched!

281
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,235
他们若躲起来亲热就不会
Not if they're where I think they are.

282
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,260
真好听
That's nice.

283
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,761
我想到了，我们来玩大富翁
I know what we can do.
We'll play Monopoly.

284
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:42,360
- 我最讨厌大富翁
- 我的玩法很棒的
-I hate Monopoly!
-Not the way I play it, you don't.

285
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:45,669
- 你的玩法是怎样？
- 我们来玩脱衣大富翁
-Like what?
-We're going to play strip Monopoly.

286
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:50,041
- 我来当庄家
- 你在开玩笑吧？
-I'll be the shoe.
-You have got to be kidding.

287
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:52,271
万一史帝夫闯进来怎么办？
What if Steve walks in?

288
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:56,648
- 我们网开一面，他可以不脱鞋
- 很简单的
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on. It's easy.

289
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,744
你们不用付租金，用衣服来抵帐
Instead of rent, you pay clothes. Bill
can be banker. Unless he's chicken.

290
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:02,154
比尔当银行，除非他没种

291
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,284
若你不幸来到我开的旅馆，你就完了
Heaven help you if you land
in my hotel!

292
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,886
看看玛西有没有留些大麻下来
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

293
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:12,926
- 我的五百块筹码呢？
- 在那里，我的棋子呢？
-What happened to my 500's?
-They're there. Where's my shoe?

294
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,810
我可不会轻易认输
I'm not going to pass "Go"
without a glow.

295
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,741
我们已经帮你掷过骰子了，你排最后
We rolled for you. You're going last.

296
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:34,280
公家金库也不会把衣服还给你
Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

297
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:38,415
两个六，我可以再掷一次
Double sixes! I get to roll again!

298
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:42,018
- 她好像出老千
- 你说得没错
-We're being hustled.
-I think you're right.

299
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,230
你真棒
You are so fine.

300
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:57,671
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

301
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:00,401
我要尿尿，你压到我的膀胱了
I gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.

302
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:08,613
快去快回，床上没有你变得好冷
Hurry back, okay?
It's getting cold in here.

303
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:21,094
- 你会帮我留个位置吗？
- 当然
-You'll save my place for me?
-Yeah.

304
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:40,340
五
Five.

305
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:45,676
- 波罗的大道，我买了
- 那里门可罗雀
-Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
-No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

306
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,153
我喜欢这个颜色
I think it's a pretty color.

307
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:51,792
快点
Come on.

308
00:41:52,562 --> 00:41:53,790
八
Eight.

309
00:41:55,998 --> 00:42:00,935
- 波罗的大道，你欠我一只靴子
- 马上给你
-Baltic Avenue. You owe me one boot.
-Coming.

310
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,306
艾莉丝首先进帐
Alice draws first blood.

311
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:07,174
- 你怎么可以这样说我的脚？
- 谢谢
-That's a terrible way to talk about my feet.
-Thank you.

312
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,602
接下来轮谁？
Who's next?

313
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:13,977
我开始喜欢这个游戏了
You know I think I'm beginning
to like this game.

314
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:17,246
等他到我的地盘时再说吧
Wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

315
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:20,049
- 还要啤酒吗？我去拿
- 我看看，是铁路
-More beer? More beer.
-Let's see. A railroad.

316
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:26,738
“离厕所40码，威利梅克制作”
Forty Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.

317
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:30,614
小鬼，你们太逊了吧？
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

318
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,686
杰克？
Jack?

319
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,519
杰克？
Jack?

320
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,462
杰克？
Jack?

321
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:59,736
我照镜子时知道自己永远是个丑八怪
When I looked into that mirror,
I knew I'd always be ugly.

322
00:45:01,016 --> 00:45:06,079
我说“小姐，你永远都这么平庸”
I said,
"Lady, you'll always be plain."

323
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:11,189
哈？
Hello?

324
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,222
奈德？
Ned?

325
00:45:53,602 --> 00:45:55,797
你们别闹了
Hey, come on, you guys.

326
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,676
大概是我想像力作怪
It must be my imagination.

327
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,799
- 你惨了
- 可恶
-Hello.
-Shit.

328
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,533
我的手气真是背透了
Worst run of bad luck
since Richard Nixon.

329
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:08,609
你可以认输
You can call it quits.

330
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,545
你做梦，你再走两步就要脱光了
Fat chance! You're two steps
from Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

331
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:21,422
我还能说什么？
What can I say?
It's not much, but I call it home.

332
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:23,548
这个地方再怎么说也是我的狗窝

333
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:30,592
- 我去关门…
- 快拿钱
-I'll get it. I'll get it.
-Get the money.

334
00:47:30,632 --> 00:47:33,294
- 天啊
- 外面风好大
-God!
-It's blowing like crazy out there.

335
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:36,893
我木屋的窗户好像忘了关
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open. Shoot!

336
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:42,810
咱们改天再玩吧
We'll have to finish this game
some other night.

337
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,439
讨厌，赛况才刚刚变得有趣
Just when it was getting interesting.

338
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,610
- 明天见
- 再见
-See you guys in the morning.
-See you.

339
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:52,351
- 晚安
- 晚安
-Good night.
-Good night.

340
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:03,095
乱死了，拿去
Look at this mess! Here.

341
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,868
- 你要继续玩吗？
- 我还没决定
-Were you going to go ahead with it?
-I hadn't made up my mind.

342
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,802
改天再玩好了
We'll have to finish
the game another night.

343
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:17,004
“餐馆”

344
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:34,084
- 史帝夫，你还要什么吗？
- 不用了，珊蒂，这样就行了
-Is there anything else you want?
-No, thanks, Sandy. I'm fine.

345
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:37,222
雨这么大，你就别走了，除非你想淹死
You can't go out in that rain.
You want to drown?

346
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:40,699
我非走不可，我营地来了六个新的辅导员
I've got to.
I've got six new counselors at camp.

347
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:44,169
他们是丛林菜鸟
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense.

348
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:48,402
只要他们懂得躲雨就不会有事
They'll be okay if they know enough
to come out of the rain.

349
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:52,907
- 我欠你多少？
- 晚上带我出去玩就好了
-Well, what do I owe you?
-Just a night on the town, Steve.

350
00:48:53,915 --> 00:48:58,113
- 珊蒂，你知道我的意思
- 没问题，两块两毛五
-Come on now, you know what I mean.
-That's okay. Two and a quarter.

351
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:03,356
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:49:16,137 --> 00:49:18,901
- 这是找你的钱
- 你留着吧
-Here's your change.
-No, you keep it.

353
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:20,269
- 谢谢
- 不客气
-Thank you.
-Sure.

354
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,172
- 开车小心点
- 我会的
-Drive careful.
-I will.

355
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:23,335
晚安
Good night.

356
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,638
“餐馆”

357
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,584
- 嗨
- 嗨
-Hi.
-Hi.

358
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:52,676
你的车不是连城墙都爬得上去吗？
-Thought that'd go through anything.
-Not dragging a trailer.

359
00:52:52,787 --> 00:52:54,584
后面挂辆拖车就不行了

360
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,088
能不能载我一程？
Can you give me a lift?

361
00:52:56,624 --> 00:52:59,923
- 我早上再叫辅导员载我过来
- 有何不可？
-I'll have a counselor bring me back.
-Why not?

362
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:23,642
救命
Help me!

363
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:50,337
救命
Help me!

364
00:55:17,999 --> 00:55:19,694
哈
Hello.

365
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:28,973
- 哈
- 在这里，快来救我
-Hello.
-Over here. Please somebody help me.

366
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:30,544
哈
Hello.

367
00:55:33,648 --> 00:55:35,240
哈
Hello.

368
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,451
哈
Hello.

369
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:46,987
哈？
Hello?

370
00:55:52,867 --> 00:55:58,237
快点来，拜托，快来救我
Come quickly, please.
Come quickly. Help.

371
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:15,485
你在哪里？哈
Where are you? Hello.

372
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:36,901
哈？
Hello?

373
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,648
好了
All right.

374
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,355
出来，这已经不好笑了
Come on out! You're not funny anymore!

375
00:56:51,626 --> 00:56:53,218
一点都不好笑
It's not funny at all.

376
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,756
比尔
Bill.

377
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:05,622
- 发电机没事
- 我好像听到有人尖叫
-Hi. The generator is okay.
-I thought I heard a scream.

378
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,294
- 风这么大你怎么听得到？
- 好像是布兰达的声音
-How can you hear in that wind?
-It sounded like Brenda.

379
00:58:09,837 --> 00:58:10,929
我最好去看看
I'd better look.

380
00:58:11,038 --> 00:58:14,337
有人把射箭场的灯打开了
Somebody turned on the lights
at the archery range.

381
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:18,477
我什么都没看到
I can't see anything.

382
00:58:19,814 --> 00:58:21,509
灯又灭了
They're off now.

383
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,141
我去看看
I'm gonna check it out.

384
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:26,745
比尔
-Bill. Can I come?
-Come on.

385
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:29,356
- 我可以一起去吗？
- 来吧

386
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:34,454
布兰达
Brenda!

387
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:37,463
布兰达
Brenda!

388
00:58:42,036 --> 00:58:43,401
她在哪里？
Where is she?

389
00:58:45,506 --> 00:58:47,599
她一定跟杰克和玛西在一起
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

390
00:58:51,212 --> 00:58:53,203
- 艾莉丝？
- 什么事？
-Alice?
-Yeah?

391
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,641
过来
Come here.

392
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:17,262
这是怎么回事？
What is going on?

393
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,173
快走
Come on!

394
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:33,146
- 杰克，开门
- 杰克
-Jack, open the door.
-Jack.

395
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:39,988
- 他们在哪里？
- 我不知道，我们走
-Where are they?
-I don't know. Come on.

396
00:59:44,065 --> 00:59:45,862
布兰达？
Brenda?

397
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,028
玛西？
Marcie?

398
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,629
杰克？奈德？
Jack? Neddy?

399
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:01,007
比尔，我们应该通知别人
Bill, I think we should call someone.

400
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:04,681
若他们在开玩笑，我就要打爆他们的头
If this is a joke, I'll brain them!

401
01:00:04,785 --> 01:00:09,085
我是认真的，我真的认为我们该通知别人
I'm serious.
I really think we should call someone.

402
01:00:18,132 --> 01:00:19,429
锁住了
The sucker's locked.

403
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:21,925
- 钥匙呢？
- 我不知道
-Where's the key?
-I don't know.

404
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:23,330
等一下
Wait a minute.

405
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:33,737
小心
Watch out.

406
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,144
小心
Be careful.

407
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:43,815
我去开灯
Let me get the light.

408
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,825
怎么了？
What's wrong?

409
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:57,031
线路不通，试试公用电话
It's dead. Try the pay phone.

410
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:58,671
有零钱吗？
Do you have a dime or a quarter?

411
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:01,369
没有，看看桌上有没有
No. Check the desk.

412
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,548
喂？
Hello?

413
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,511
公用电话也不通
This damn thing's dead too!

414
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:31,934
车子怎么了？
What's the matter with it?

415
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,602
湿了
It's wet.

416
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,197
我不知道
I don't know.

417
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:38,904
我们走路离开这里吧，现在就走
Why don't we just hike out of here?
Get out. Right now!

418
01:01:39,013 --> 01:01:42,744
这里离最近的路口有十英里，
史帝夫很快就会回来的
It's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

419
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,286
我们可以开他的吉普车去求助，别担心
We can use his jeep if we need
to get help. Don't worry.

420
01:01:46,387 --> 01:01:50,050
- 这一切一定有个可笑的解释
- 怎么说？
-There's some stupid explanation for this.
-Like what?

421
01:01:50,191 --> 01:01:53,592
我们明天一定会笑破肚皮，我保证
We'll be laughing about this tomorrow,
I promise.

422
01:01:57,565 --> 01:01:58,759
咱们别再淋雨了
Let's get out of the rain.

423
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:08,770
13号星期五还不够糟，居然碰上满月
It's not bad enough to have Friday the 13th,
we've gotta have a full moon too.

424
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:10,977
我们有做统计
We keep statistics. We have more accidents,
more rapes, more robberies...

425
01:02:11,078 --> 01:02:17,585
每到满月，车祸、强暴案、
抢案、凶杀案都比平常多
...more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

426
01:02:17,585 --> 01:02:20,110
人们一到满月就抓狂
It upsets people. Makes them nuts.

427
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:23,679
就算是巧合，也被你说得煞有其事
You're making science
out of coincidence.

428
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:28,562
听说劳夫今天跑去你那儿了
I hear Ralph was out your way today.

429
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:30,993
他太太紧张得要死，还好我们把他送回家了
His wife was a nervous wreck
until we got him home.

430
01:02:31,098 --> 01:02:35,169
疯子劳夫跑来搅局，真是屋漏偏逢连夜雨
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

431
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:38,028
雨快停了
Well, the rain's stopping.

432
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,431
不过这场雨下得还真够呛
It was a pisser while it lasted.

433
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:43,442
特尼警官，听到请回答，呼叫九号车…
Sgt. Tierney, come in.
Sgt. Tierney, Car Niner.

434
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:46,946
我是特尼
This is Tierney.

435
01:02:47,048 --> 01:02:50,506
发生车祸，带油压剪到公路17英里处
Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.
Near mile-marker 17. Possible fatals.

436
01:02:50,618 --> 01:02:51,949
可能有人伤亡

437
01:02:52,053 --> 01:02:54,453
至少有三人被困在车上，快去
Three, maybe more, trapped.
Head on.

438
01:02:54,555 --> 01:02:58,582
收到，预计15分钟后抵达
Roger. Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

439
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:11,237
- 我得让你在这里下车
- 没问题
-I have to let you off here.
-Sure.

440
01:03:12,773 --> 01:03:14,001
谢谢
Thanks.

441
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,307
祝你好运
Good luck.

442
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:34,351
“欢迎光临水晶湖营地”

443
01:03:53,347 --> 01:03:56,405
谁在那里？
Who is that?

444
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:03,922
你在这里干嘛？
What are you doing
out in this mess?

445
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:32,249
“危险，高压电”

446
01:05:25,773 --> 01:05:27,297
你觉得发生了什么事？
What do you think happened?

447
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:29,402
我不知道
I don't know.

448
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:33,439
发电机大概没油了
The generator's probably out of gas.

449
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:35,606
我去看看
I'll go check it.

450
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:39,282
要不要我跟你去？
Do you want me to come with you?

451
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:43,282
你留在这里，睡一会儿吧
Why don't you stay here
and try and sleep.

452
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:46,224
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

453
01:07:17,184 --> 01:07:18,549
油箱是满的
Full of gas.

454
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:57,246
比尔…

455
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,625
发电机
Generator.

456
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:15,531
我该怎么办？
What am I gonna do?

457
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:29,404
求求你…
Please! Oh, please!

458
01:15:32,813 --> 01:15:34,303
你是谁？
Who are you?

459
01:15:35,015 --> 01:15:38,746
我是克斯帝家的老朋友，伍瑞斯太太
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christys.

460
01:15:40,687 --> 01:15:43,190
别哭了…
No, no. There, there.

461
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:46,455
你不冷静下来我怎么帮你？
I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

462
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,327
- 她死了，他也死了
- 天啊，可怜的比尔…
But she's dead and he's dead.
Oh, my God! Poor Bill! Oh, God!

463
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:54,798
- 别哭了，带我去看看
- 不…
-All right. Come on, dear. Show me.
-No. No!

464
01:15:54,901 --> 01:15:59,167
没事的，我会照顾你的，
我以前也帮克斯帝家工作过
It's all right. I'll take care of you.
I used to work for the Christys.

465
01:15:59,272 --> 01:16:02,309
- 天啊，这是怎么回事？
- 求求你带我离开这里
What's going on?
Help me get out of here!

466
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:05,870
这个地方阴森森的，
又加上暴风雨，难怪你会怕
It's this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.

467
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:09,312
不…他们都死了…
No, no! They're all dead!
They're all dead!

468
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:12,408
- 好，我去看看
- 别离开我
-All right. I'll go look.
-Don't leave me!

469
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:14,316
他们会杀了你
They'll kill you too!

470
01:16:14,754 --> 01:16:16,654
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

471
01:16:34,941 --> 01:16:37,774
我的天啊
Oh, my Lord!

472
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,703
这么年轻
So young.

473
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:42,541
这么漂亮
So pretty.

474
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:46,812
什么样的禽兽才会做出这种事？
What monster could have done this?

475
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:49,588
比尔在外面
Bill is out there!

476
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,321
天啊，这个地方
Oh, God, this place!

477
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:57,326
史帝夫不该重新开放这个地方
Steve should never have
opened this place again!

478
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,489
这里发生过太多灾难
There's been too much trouble here.

479
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,395
你知道有个年轻男孩在这里淹死吗？
Did you know a young boy drowned?

480
01:17:03,503 --> 01:17:05,630
就在那两个年轻人被杀死的前一年
The year before those two others
were killed.

481
01:17:05,739 --> 01:17:08,401
都怪辅导员粗心大意
The counselors weren't paying attention!

482
01:17:08,508 --> 01:17:11,909
那个男孩淹死的时候，他们正打得火热
They were making love
while that young boy drowned!

483
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:15,774
他叫杰森
His name was Jason.

484
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:21,243
事发当天我在这里工作，正忙着准备餐点
I was working the day it happened.
Preparing meals.

485
01:17:21,354 --> 01:17:23,845
我以前是这里的厨师
Here. I was the cook.

486
01:17:23,957 --> 01:17:27,324
应该时时刻刻都要有人注意杰森
Jason should have been watched!
Every minute!

487
01:17:27,427 --> 01:17:29,054
他…
He was--

488
01:17:32,032 --> 01:17:34,762
他不太会游泳
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

489
01:17:36,937 --> 01:17:39,405
我们可以走了，亲爱的
We can go now, dear.

490
01:17:39,773 --> 01:17:42,606
我们应该等克斯帝先生
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

491
01:17:43,209 --> 01:17:45,302
没这个必要
That's not necessary.

492
01:17:45,412 --> 01:17:47,175
我不懂
I don't understand.

493
01:17:48,448 --> 01:17:50,473
救我
Help me!

494
01:17:50,717 --> 01:17:51,649
救命
Help!

495
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:53,286
救命，妈咪
Help, Mommy!

496
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:57,489
救命，妈咪
Help! Help, Mommy!

497
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,922
我会救你的，杰森
I am, Jason.

498
01:18:00,026 --> 01:18:01,516
我会的
I am.

499
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:03,559
天啊

500
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:07,056
杰森是我儿子
You see, Jason was my son.

501
01:18:07,167 --> 01:18:09,829
今天是他的生日
And today is his birthday.

502
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:12,530
克斯帝先生呢？
Where's Mr. Christy?

503
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:17,303
我不能让他们重新开放这个地方，对不对？
I couldn't let them open this place again.
Could I?

504
01:18:18,178 --> 01:18:20,271
这里出过那么多事
Not after what happened.

505
01:18:23,984 --> 01:18:27,920
我可爱、无邪的杰森
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

506
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,915
我的独子
My only child.

507
01:18:31,691 --> 01:18:33,124
杰森
Jason.

508
01:18:37,664 --> 01:18:39,564
你害他淹死
You let him drown!

509
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:42,260
你粗心大意
You never paid any attention!

510
01:18:42,702 --> 01:18:45,432
看你把他害成什么样子
Look what you did to him!

511
01:18:45,772 --> 01:18:49,936
看你把他害成什么样子
Look what you did to him!

512
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:55,136
杀了她，妈妈，杀了她
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

513
01:19:59,179 --> 01:20:03,115
别让她逃走，妈妈，别让她活下去
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live!

514
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:07,482
我不会的，杰森…
I won't, Jason. I won't!

515
01:20:56,202 --> 01:20:58,762
可恶，子弹在哪里？
Where are the goddamn bullets?

516
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:16,513
来，亲爱的
Come, dear.

517
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:20,491
我不会让你死得像杰森那么痛苦
It will be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

518
01:21:23,863 --> 01:21:28,129
杀了她，妈妈，杀了她
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

519
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:30,999
杀了她
Kill her.

520
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:11,101
杀了她，妈妈，杀了她
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

521
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:14,833
她无处可躲
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

522
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:17,668
去抓她，妈妈
Get her, Mommy. Get her!

523
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:26,483
杀了她…
Kill her! Kill her.

524
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:52,747
放开我
Get off me!

525
01:30:58,237 --> 01:31:00,637
不…

526
01:31:01,607 --> 01:31:04,337
我帮你打了十毫克的镇定剂，没事了
Ten milligrams, Valium.
It's all right.

527
01:31:04,443 --> 01:31:06,206
一切都没事了
It's all over. Everything's over.

528
01:31:09,949 --> 01:31:12,383
转过身去，亲爱的
Roll over. Roll over, dear.

529
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:34,539
你爸妈已经在路上了
Your folks are on the way up.

530
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:39,576
还有人活着吗？
Is anyone else alive?

531
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:43,074
他们都死了吗？
Are they all dead?

532
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:45,283
是的
Yes, ma'am.

533
01:31:46,485 --> 01:31:48,282
我的两个手下把你从湖里拖上来
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead too.

534
01:31:48,387 --> 01:31:50,855
我们也以为你也死了

535
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,122
你记得事发经过吗？
Do you remember very much?

536
01:31:54,794 --> 01:31:56,284
那个男孩
The boy.

537
01:31:56,562 --> 01:31:58,223
他也死了吗？
Is he dead too?

538
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:01,927
- 谁？
- 那个男孩，杰森
-Who?
-The boy, Jason.

539
01:32:03,702 --> 01:32:05,033
杰森？
Jason?

540
01:32:05,137 --> 01:32:09,972
在湖里攻击我的那个男孩，
是他把我拖进水里去的
In the lake. The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me under the water.

541
01:32:11,844 --> 01:32:15,405
我们没有找到什么男孩
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

542
01:32:17,249 --> 01:32:19,012
但他…
But he....

543
01:32:25,157 --> 01:32:27,682
那他还在那里
Then he's still there.
