00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,719
Where's Jay?

3
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:31,750
How long were those potatoes
under the fire? How'd you do that?

4
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,222
-Somebody will see!
-No way.

5
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:54,648
-Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?
-How would I know?

6
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:12,041
-You said we were special.
-I meant everything.

7
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,588
-That's not allowed.
-Come on.

8
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:09,140
Come on.
A man is not made out of stone.

9
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,812
Somebody's there!

10
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,366
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing a--

11
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,837
Please, don't!

12
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,433
No!

13
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,523
Hi, girl. Excuse me! Hi, boy.

14
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,110
You speak English?
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?

15
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:12,948
That far?
Okey-dokey. See you later.

16
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,461
It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.

17
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:30,132
This is Big Dave and it's time for you
Lazybones to get out of bed.

18
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:33,719
It's black-cat day in Crystal Lake.

19
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,521
I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.

20
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:46,565
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake from here?

21
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,449
What is it, Enos? About 20 miles?

22
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:57,493
-About that.
-Camp Blood?

23
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,455
-They' re opening that place again?
-Lots of luck.

24
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:04,625
-Can I get a bus or something?
-Not likely.

25
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:09,880
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?
What about a lift? That would be halfway.

26
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:13,384
No sweat, Trudy. Okay, kid, let's move it.

27
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:17,930
-Name's Annie.
-All right, Annie, let's go.

28
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,148
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?

29
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,275
I don't know.

30
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,155
-You're going to Camp Blood, ain't you?
-Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!

31
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:37,283
-Leave people alone!
-You'll never come back!

32
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,452
Oh, shut up, Ralph!

33
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,581
It's got a death curse!

34
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:48,335
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

35
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,254
Climb up, miss.

36
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:12,943
He's causing problems enough
for your boss with all that talk.

37
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,906
Goddamn nuisance.

38
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,848
-He tell you anything?
-Who?

39
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,559
Your boss. Steve Christy.

40
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:49,396
I'll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.

41
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:54,819
-Campers will mostly be inner-city children.
-No, I mean about what happened.

42
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,365
No.

43
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,997
Come on. There's something
you're not telling me.

44
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,213
-Quit. Quit now.
-Quit? Why would I want to quit?

45
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,383
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

46
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:21,804
Terrific. Not you too. You sound
like your crazy friend back there.

47
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:26,684
Well, maybe. Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

48
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:32,189
Boy drowning in '57? A bunch of fires?

49
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,442
Nobody knows who did any of them.

50
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:39,113
In 1962, they were going to open up.
The water was bad.

51
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,324
Christy will end up like his folks:
crazy and broke.

52
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:47,204
He's been up there a year fixing up that
place. Must have dropped $25,000.

53
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:51,083
And for what? Ask anybody.

54
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,129
-Quit!
-I can't.

55
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,841
Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

56
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:02,428
Just like my nieces. Heads full of rocks.

57
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:08,100
-You're an American original.
-I'm an American original.

58
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:13,314
-Dumb kid.
-At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

59
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,921
-Take care of yourself.
-No sweat. Thanks for the lift.

60
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:12,665
Hey, Marcie. You really think
there'll be other gorgeous women...

61
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,793
...at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

62
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,089
-Is sex all you ever think about, Ned?
-Hey, no. No. Absolutely not.

63
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:23,175
Sometimes I just think about
kissing women.

64
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:26,197
-You wanna give me a hand over here?
-Sure.

65
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,909
Alice! I wanna get this tree stump out.

66
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,496
Get on this side, you pull
on that side. Alice!

67
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:34,914
Coming.

68
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,378
-That's great. I'm Steve Christy.
-Jack.

69
00:13:41,545 --> 00:13:43,005
-Marcie
-Ned Rubinstein.

70
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,800
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.

71
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:48,094
Hi. Steve, Cabin B is all ready.

72
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,681
-Where's Bill? Cleaning out the boathouse?
-Haven't seen him in half an hour.

73
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,226
I wanted him to start painting. Brenda?

74
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:59,814
-Setting up the archery range.
-I'd rather she paint. Come on. Let's go.

75
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,941
I thought we had two weeks.

76
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,194
Come on. I'll show you
where you can get changed.

77
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,373
-Here, let me give you a hand with that.
-Thank you.

78
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,842
You got it?

79
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:50,197
You draw very well.

80
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:54,869
Thanks. I wish I had more time to do it.

81
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,620
Oh, dummy.

82
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:01,000
-When did you do this?
-Last night.

83
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:06,088
-Do I really look like that?
-You did last night.

84
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:13,596
You're very talented.

85
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,808
You're very pretty.

86
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,521
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?

87
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,399
Any particular reason?

88
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:29,528
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

89
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:34,700
-You wanna leave?
-I don't know. I may have to...

90
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,745
...go back to California
to straighten something out.

91
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:43,959
Come on. Give me another chance.

92
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:48,088
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.

93
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:53,469
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

94
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,516
All right. Friday. I'll give it a week.

95
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,816
Thanks, Alice.

96
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:23,791
Bill? Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.

97
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,378
-Paint's all right. Need more thinner.
-Okay.

98
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:32,341
-Alice. Did the others show up?
-Yeah, everybody except that girl Annie.

99
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,304
-Think you're gonna last all summer?
-I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

100
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:39,932
-I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
-Fine.

101
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,241
-You want it listed separately?
-Right.

102
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,161
Brenda, I want you to
finish the archery range.

103
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:04,415
If Annie gets here, get her started
in the kitchen. Do your best.

104
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,709
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

105
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:11,422
It's supposed to rain like hell,
so get as much done as possible.

106
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:21,557
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place "Camp Blood."

107
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:26,228
Next there'll be snakes in the
outhouse and crocodiles in the lake.

108
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:29,356
No, the crocodiles are in the cabins.

109
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,802
Are you crazy?

110
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,931
Wanna see my trick shot?
It's even better.

111
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,935
I don't believe you!

112
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:11,607
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

113
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:16,654
You come to help me or scare
me to death? You do that again...

114
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:20,574
-...I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
-I love that sexy talk!

115
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:47,643
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

116
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,951
Guess I always wanted to
work with children.

117
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:08,080
I hate when people call them "kids."
Sounds like little goats.

118
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:12,501
But when you've had a dream
as long as I have, you'll do anything.

119
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:37,234
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

120
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:44,408
I think we better stop.

121
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:48,579
Please?

122
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:54,919
Stop, please! Please! Stop!

123
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,713
Please, stop!

124
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,838
No. No.

125
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:23,924
No.

126
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:39,482
All right, move it out. A little to the left.
Little to the left.

127
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:48,908
Move it out. Move it out. Okay,
little to the left. Now-- No, no.

128
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:53,287
Let's go. Okay. Okay. Good. Good.

129
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:08,385
If you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?

130
00:22:08,552 --> 00:22:12,348
-Rocky Road.
-Hey!

131
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:27,738
What's that Vitamin C
stuff do for you, anyway?

132
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:31,951
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

133
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:36,122
What's the matter?
Do you see something?

134
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,210
No. Nothing.

135
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:48,551
Ned! Get out of here!

136
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:59,478
Hey, you guys.
Ready to go back to work?

137
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,861
-Come on, Alice.
-Help! Help!

138
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:12,116
-Something's wrong with Ned.
-Get a life preserver!

139
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,176
-Can he swim?
-I don't know.

140
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,053
-He's right around here somewhere.
-I got it.

141
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,556
Go ahead, dive for him.

142
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:39,226
-There he is!
-Come on. Help me.

143
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:41,270
Watch his head.

144
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:50,029
-Watch his head!
-Got him?

145
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:59,455
-Can you give mouth-to-mouth?

146
00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,962
-Oh, God.
-Come on, Ned.

147
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,091
-Oh, Neddy!
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

148
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:19,767
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

149
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,758
Bill!

150
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:57,388
Bill, come here, quick! Hurry!

151
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:04,520
-What is it?
-There's a snake over there.

152
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:06,355
Where?

153
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:15,781
-What do I do?
-Kill it.

154
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,241
It might bite.

155
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:21,078
-Haven't you ever been in the woods?
-We're not in the woods.

156
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:23,289
-Bill, what are you doing?
-There's a snake.

157
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,875
-Why are we in here?
-Feet don't fail me now!

158
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,877
-There it is!
-Oh, God!

159
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:33,632
-I can't sleep with a snake in here.
-Nobody said anything about snakes.

160
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,470
-Kill it!
-I can't get it until it comes out.

161
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,598
-Well, call him!
-How do you call a snake?

162
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,558
I'll flush him!

163
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:49,857
-I got it.
-Where--?

164
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:51,150
Look out!

165
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,568
I got him!

166
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:58,073
Oh, God.

167
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,413
Is it dead?

168
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,917
Either that or it's got a very short clone.

169
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:13,589
-Well, at least we know what's for dinner.
-Marcie!

170
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,721
I'm making salad. Want me
to make some for everybody?

171
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:24,266
-That would be great. There's hamburger--
-None for me.

172
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,727
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?

173
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:30,564
-Sure. No sweat.
-What is going on?

174
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:41,450
Oh, shit.

175
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,123
-Who are you people?
-Camp counselors. Ned is fooling around.

176
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,083
-Right, just--
-Can it, Cochise.

177
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,585
Steve Christy hire you people?
He pay you for this?

178
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,879
-Nice bike.
-You been smoking, boy?

179
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:56,590
Smoking? Don't smoke. Causes cancer.

180
00:26:56,757 --> 00:27:01,762
You just get off a spaceship or something?
Colombian gold. Grass. Hash. The weed.

181
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,931
-What's he talking about?
-Don't get smart.

182
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:08,519
-Me? I'm as dumb as they come.
-Not another word out of you, understand?

183
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:12,148
Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.

184
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,315
For what?

185
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:16,944
-Is there anything we can do to help?
-I'm looking for somebody.

186
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:20,865
-Who's that?
-A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

187
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:23,701
There's no crazy people around here.

188
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:28,789
I told you to sit on it, Tonto. I got word
Ralph was pedaling out this way...

189
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:32,084
-...spouting his gospel.
-We haven't seen anybody here.

190
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,129
-Just us.
-This guy Ralph. Is he dangerous?

191
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:38,340
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

192
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:41,969
I spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.

193
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:46,182
Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.

194
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:49,685
This is Dorf. I'm out here
at Camp Crystal Lake. Over.

195
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:53,063
Haul it back in, Dorf.
Chief wants you back in town.

196
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,526
Roger that. 10-4. On my way. Out.

197
00:27:57,693 --> 00:28:00,112
Never keep the chief waiting.

198
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:07,495
You kids keep your noses clean.
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

199
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:13,417
We ain't gonna stand
for no weirdness out here.

200
00:28:56,418 --> 00:29:02,174
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.

201
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:07,638
This place is cursed. Cursed.

202
00:29:09,098 --> 00:29:12,435
-It's got a death curse!
-Who are you?

203
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,562
What do you want?

204
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:18,899
-God sent me.
-Get out of here, man!

205
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:23,737
I got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

206
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:28,159
Go. Go!

207
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:43,257
-I think we just met Ralph.
-God, what's next?

208
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:57,772
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

209
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,380
-Who likes them rare?
-Me.

210
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:26,759
How can you guys eat that?
It looks like dead animals.

211
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:30,346
Dead animals? That's the old counselors.
You cannibals!

212
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:33,474
If you would mix this stuff right,
you'd get all the protein you need.

213
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,477
Too bad Annie never showed.
She was supposed to be a good cook.

214
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:40,231
-Don't expect me to play chef.
-The squaws are revolting.

215
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:43,150
-Trouble?
-Yeah. A bad bulb or no power.

216
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,361
Seems a little gloomy in here.

217
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:47,947
SteVe taught me how to use
the emergency generator.

218
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:51,492
-Town power lines are lousy.
-Don't you love that macho talk?

219
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,661
Emergency generator.

220
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:55,704
-Want to give me a hand?
-Yeah.

221
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:58,290
-Wait for me.
-Can you watch the burgers?

222
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:01,335
-Sure.
-Burn them.

223
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:08,467
-Think he's gonna be bent out of shape?
-I don't know.

224
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:12,388
This looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

225
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:15,933
-Well, here goes.
-What an antique.

226
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:26,610
Well, what hath God wrought?

227
00:32:40,226 --> 00:32:41,936
Hello?

228
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:53,030
Can I help you?

229
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:02,331
Hello? Hello?

230
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:06,669
-Come on.
-Coming, I'm coming.

231
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,801
Wind's come up.
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

232
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,804
Makes me want to hold onto you.

233
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:24,103
-What about Ned?
-I don't love Ned.

234
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,356
-He keeps acting like such a jerk.
-Neddy!

235
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:30,234
-Don't call him.
-Thought you wanted to give him...

236
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:32,194
...one of your motherly lectures.

237
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:36,740
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, you know?

238
00:33:36,907 --> 00:33:41,328
It's gonna storm. Gonna tear down
that valley like a son of a gun.

239
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:43,956
I've been afraid of storms
since I was little.

240
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:46,292
No. Really?

241
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:51,297
I've had this dream about five or six
times where I'm in a thunderstorm...

242
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:58,012
...and it's raining really hard. It sounds
like pebbles when it hits the ground.

243
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,768
I hear it and I try to block it out
with my hands, only it doesn't work.

244
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,812
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.

245
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:12,568
And then the rain turns to blood...

246
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:17,865
...and the blood washes away
in little rivers...

247
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:22,161
...and then the sound stops.

248
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:29,376
-It's just a dream.
-I know. I call it my "shower dream."

249
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:34,006
Hey, hey. This is no dream.
Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

250
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:32,083
Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched!

251
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:34,710
Not if they're where I think they are.

252
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:01,445
That's nice.

253
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:04,865
I know what we can do.
We'll play Monopoly.

254
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:08,119
-I hate Monopoly!
-Not the way I play it, you don't.

255
00:37:08,244 --> 00:37:11,288
-Like what?
-We're going to play strip Monopoly.

256
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:15,668
-I'll be the shoe.
-You have got to be kidding.

257
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,336
What if Steve walks in?

258
00:37:17,503 --> 00:37:21,757
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on. It's easy.

259
00:37:21,882 --> 00:37:27,221
Instead of rent, you pay clothes. Bill
can be banker. Unless he's chicken.

260
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:29,932
Heaven help you if you land
in my hotel!

261
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:33,394
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

262
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:37,690
-What happened to my 500's?
-They're there. Where's my shoe?

263
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:49,428
I'm not going to pass "Go"
without a glow.

264
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,264
We rolled for you. You're going last.

265
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,601
Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

266
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,605
Double sixes! I get to roll again!

267
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:02,733
-We're being hustled.
-I think you're right.

268
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:09,323
You are so fine.

269
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,957
Where are you going?

270
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:21,085
I gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.

271
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:28,843
Hurry back, okay?
It's getting cold in here.

272
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:40,521
-You'll save my place for me?
-Yeah.

273
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,998
Five.

274
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,128
-Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
-No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

275
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:06,338
I think it's a pretty color.

276
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:09,884
Come on.

277
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,261
Eight.

278
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:18,601
-Baltic Avenue. You owe me one boot.
-Coming.

279
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,853
Alice draws first blood.

280
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,732
-Terrible way to talk about my feet.
-Thank you.

281
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,150
Who's next?

282
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:31,197
You know I think I'm beginning
to like this game.

283
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:34,200
Wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

284
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,994
-More beer? More beer.
-Let's see. A railroad.

285
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:38,574
Forty Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.

286
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:42,286
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

287
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:45,289
Jack?

288
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:51,879
Jack?

289
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,468
Jack?

290
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:10,272
When I looked into that mirror,
I knew I'd always be ugly.

291
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:15,945
I said,
"Lizzie, you'll always be plain."

292
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,950
Hello?

293
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:58,237
Ned?

294
00:44:01,866 --> 00:44:04,118
Hey, come on, you guys.

295
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:48,996
It must be my imagination.

296
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:08,891
-Hello.
-Shit.

297
00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:11,769
Worst run of bad luck
since Richard Nixon.

298
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:13,687
You can call it quits.

299
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:18,818
Fat chance! You're two steps
from Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

300
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:28,160
What can I say?
It's not much, but I call it home.

301
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:34,417
-I'll get it. I'll get it.
-Get the money.

302
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,545
-God!
-It's blowing like crazy out there.

303
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:41,715
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open. Shoot!

304
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:47,471
We'll have to finish this game
some other night.

305
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:50,099
Just when it was getting interesting.

306
00:45:50,808 --> 00:45:53,352
-See you guys in the morning.
-See you.

307
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,771
-Good night.
-Good night.

308
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:05,990
Look at this mess! Here.

309
00:46:06,157 --> 00:46:10,327
-Were you going to go ahead with it?
-I hadn't made up my mind.

310
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:13,414
We'll have to finish
the game another night.

311
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:35,436
-Is there anything else you want?
-No, thanks, Sandy. I'm fine.

312
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:38,647
You can't go out in that rain.
You want to drown?

313
00:46:38,814 --> 00:46:41,984
I've got to.
I've got six new counselors at camp.

314
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:45,321
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense.

315
00:46:45,488 --> 00:46:49,909
They'll be okay if they know enough
to come out of the rain.

316
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:54,371
-Well, what do I owe you?
-Just a night on the town, Steve.

317
00:46:54,538 --> 00:46:59,251
-Come on now, you know what I mean.
-That's okay. Two and a quarter.

318
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:03,839
Thank you.

319
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:18,604
-Here's your change.
-No, you keep it.

320
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:19,980
-Thank you.
-Sure.

321
00:47:20,147 --> 00:47:21,649
-Drive careful.
-I will.

322
00:47:21,816 --> 00:47:22,817
Good night.

323
00:50:40,306 --> 00:50:41,557
-Hi.
-Hi.

324
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:45,561
-Thought that'd go through anything.
-Not dragging a trailer.

325
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:47,146
Can you give me a lift?

326
00:50:47,313 --> 00:50:51,275
-I'll have a counselor bring me back.
-Why not?

327
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:10,312
Help me!

328
00:52:34,128 --> 00:52:36,172
Help me!

329
00:53:02,907 --> 00:53:04,241
Hello.

330
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:13,375
-Hello.
-Over here. Please somebody help me.

331
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:14,835
Hello.

332
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:19,340
Hello.

333
00:53:23,177 --> 00:53:24,470
Hello.

334
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:30,976
Hello?

335
00:53:36,398 --> 00:53:41,821
Come quickly, please.
Come quickly. Help.

336
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,170
Where are you? Hello.

337
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:18,482
Hello?

338
00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:25,948
All right.

339
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,870
Come on out! You're not funny anymore!

340
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,665
It's not funny at all.

341
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,062
Bill.

342
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:43,526
-Hi. The generator is okay.
-I thought I heard a scream.

343
00:55:43,692 --> 00:55:47,530
-How can you hear in that wind?
-It sounded like Brenda.

344
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:48,989
I'd better look.

345
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:52,493
Somebody turned on the lights
at the archery range.

346
00:55:54,745 --> 00:55:56,455
I can't see anything.

347
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:59,125
They're off now.

348
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,002
I'm gonna check it out.

349
00:56:02,503 --> 00:56:06,799
-Bill. Can I come?
-Come on.

350
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:11,303
Brenda!

351
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:13,597
Brenda!

352
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:20,354
Where is she?

353
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:24,608
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

354
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,363
-Alice?

355
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,823
Come here.

356
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,553
What is going on?

357
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,183
Come on!

358
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:07,234
-Jack, open the door.
-Jack.

359
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:14,742
-Where are they?
-I don't know. Come on.

360
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,622
Brenda?

361
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:22,124
Marcie?

362
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:28,005
Jack? Neddy?

363
00:57:32,384 --> 00:57:34,970
Bill, I think we should call someone.

364
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:37,765
If this is a joke, I'll brain them!

365
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:42,520
I'm serious.
I really think we should call someone.

366
00:57:50,653 --> 00:57:52,404
The sucker's locked.

367
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:54,532
-Where's the key?
-I don't know.

368
00:57:54,698 --> 00:57:56,200
Wait a minute.

369
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,502
Watch out.

370
00:58:10,923 --> 00:58:12,341
Be careful.

371
00:58:14,343 --> 00:58:15,886
Let me get the light.

372
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,187
What's wrong?

373
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:28,107
It's dead. Try the pay phone.

374
00:58:28,274 --> 00:58:30,484
Do you have a dime or a quarter?

375
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:32,736
No. Check the desk.

376
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:42,288
Hello?

377
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,999
This damn thing's dead too!

378
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:01,849
What's the matter with it?

379
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:03,434
It's wet.

380
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:04,602
I don't know.

381
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:08,314
Why don't we just hike out of here?
Get out. Right now!

382
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:11,942
It's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

383
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:15,321
We can use his jeep if we need
to get help. Don't worry.

384
00:59:15,446 --> 00:59:18,991
-There's some stupid explanation for this.
-Like what?

385
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:22,745
We'll be laughing about this tomorrow,
I promise.

386
00:59:26,082 --> 00:59:27,541
Let's get out of the rain.

387
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:37,134
It's not bad enough to have Friday the
13th, we've gotta have a full moon too.

388
00:59:37,301 --> 00:59:41,889
We keep statistics. We have more
accidents, more rapes, more robberies...

389
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:45,643
...more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

390
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,437
It upsets people. Makes them nuts.

391
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:51,273
You're making science
out of coincidence.

392
00:59:53,025 --> 00:59:55,778
I hear Ralph was out your way today.

393
00:59:55,945 --> 00:59:58,864
His wife was a nervous wreck
until we got him home.

394
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:02,243
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

395
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,620
Well, the rain's stopping.

396
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:07,373
It was a pisser while it lasted.

397
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,085
Sgt. Tierney, come in.
Sgt. Tierney, Car Niner.

398
01:00:12,169 --> 01:00:13,504
This is Tierney.

399
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:18,342
Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.
Near mile-marker 17. Possible fatals.

400
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:20,803
Three, maybe more, trapped.
Head on.

401
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:25,099
Roger. Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

402
01:00:34,483 --> 01:00:37,361
-I have to let you off here.
-Sure.

403
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,530
Thanks.

404
01:00:39,697 --> 01:00:41,365
Good luck.

405
01:01:18,903 --> 01:01:20,321
Who is that?

406
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:27,536
What are you doing
out in this mess?

407
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:47,950
What do you think happened?

408
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:49,994
I don't know.

409
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:53,873
The generator's probably out of gas.

410
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:56,000
I'll go check it.

411
01:02:57,126 --> 01:02:59,336
Do you want me to come with you?

412
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:03,174
Why don't you stay here
and try and sleep.

413
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:05,551
I'll be right back.

414
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:33,973
Full of gas.

415
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,059
Generator.

416
01:11:11,245 --> 01:11:13,789
What am I gonna do?

417
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:29,407
Who are you?

418
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,577
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christys.

419
01:12:36,372 --> 01:12:38,207
No, no. There, there.

420
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:40,960
I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

421
01:12:41,085 --> 01:12:45,714
But she's dead and he's dead.
Oh, my God! Poor Bill! Oh, God!

422
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:49,051
-All right. Come on, dear. Show me.
-No. No!

423
01:12:49,218 --> 01:12:54,140
It's all right. I'll take care of you.
I used to work for the Christys.

424
01:12:54,306 --> 01:12:56,600
What's going on?
Help me get out of here!

425
01:12:56,725 --> 01:13:00,229
It's this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.

426
01:13:00,396 --> 01:13:03,190
No, no! They're all dead!
They're all dead!

427
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:06,235
-All right. I'll go look.
-Don't leave me!

428
01:13:06,402 --> 01:13:08,154
They'll kill you too!

429
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,364
I'm not afraid.

430
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:30,801
Oh, my Lord!

431
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:33,721
So young.

432
01:13:33,888 --> 01:13:35,473
So pretty.

433
01:13:36,474 --> 01:13:38,517
What monster could have done this?

434
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:42,021
Bill is out there!

435
01:13:42,772 --> 01:13:45,649
Oh, God, this place!

436
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:49,070
Steve should never have
opened this place again!

437
01:13:49,236 --> 01:13:51,697
There's been too much trouble here.

438
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,742
Did you know a young boy drowned?

439
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:57,411
The year before those two others
were killed.

440
01:13:57,578 --> 01:13:59,955
The counselors weren't paying attention!

441
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:03,667
They were making love
while that young boy drowned!

442
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:07,129
His name was Jason.

443
01:14:08,714 --> 01:14:11,967
I was working the day it happened.
Preparing meals.

444
01:14:12,134 --> 01:14:14,595
Here. I was the cook.

445
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,723
Jason should have been watched!
Every minute!

446
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:19,517
He was--

447
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:25,064
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

448
01:14:27,066 --> 01:14:29,527
We can go now, dear.

449
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:32,947
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

450
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,157
That's not necessary.

451
01:14:35,282 --> 01:14:37,076
I don't understand.

452
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:39,954
Help me!

453
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:41,372
Help!

454
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:42,790
Help, Mommy!

455
01:14:42,957 --> 01:14:45,876
Help! Help, Mommy!

456
01:14:46,794 --> 01:14:48,921
I am, Jason.

457
01:14:49,171 --> 01:14:50,172
I am.

458
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:56,011
You see, Jason was my son.

459
01:14:56,178 --> 01:14:58,681
And today is his birthday.

460
01:14:58,806 --> 01:15:01,225
Where's Mr. Christy?

461
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:04,270
I couldn't let them open this place again.

462
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:05,980
Could I?

463
01:15:06,564 --> 01:15:08,649
Not after what happened.

464
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:15,865
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

465
01:15:16,782 --> 01:15:19,076
My only child.

466
01:15:19,577 --> 01:15:20,703
Jason.

467
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:26,959
You let him drown!

468
01:15:27,084 --> 01:15:30,045
You never paid any attention!

469
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:33,048
Look what you did to him!

470
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:37,261
Look what you did to him!

471
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:39,615
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

472
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:47,206
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live!

473
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:51,293
I won't, Jason. I won't!

474
01:17:38,549 --> 01:17:40,718
Where are the goddamn bullets?

475
01:17:56,192 --> 01:17:57,318
Come, dear.

476
01:17:57,735 --> 01:18:01,822
It will be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

477
01:18:04,742 --> 01:18:08,329
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

478
01:18:10,289 --> 01:18:11,624
Kill her.

479
01:19:44,717 --> 01:19:47,553
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

480
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:51,307
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

481
01:19:51,474 --> 01:19:54,226
Get her, Mommy. Get her!

482
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:56,604
Kill her! Kill her.

483
01:24:15,863 --> 01:24:17,865
Get off me!

484
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:21,340
Ten milligrams, Valium.
It's all right.

485
01:27:21,507 --> 01:27:23,592
It's all over. Everything's over.

486
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:28,931
Roll over. Roll over, dear.

487
01:27:48,576 --> 01:27:50,828
Your folks are on the way up.

488
01:27:53,414 --> 01:27:55,624
Is anyone else alive?

489
01:27:57,001 --> 01:27:58,836
Are they all dead?

490
01:27:59,253 --> 01:28:00,880
Yes, ma'am.

491
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:06,635
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead too.

492
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:09,680
Do you remember very much?

493
01:28:09,805 --> 01:28:11,307
The boy.

494
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:13,434
Is he dead too?

495
01:28:13,642 --> 01:28:17,063
-Who?
-The boy, Jason.

496
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:19,482
Jason?

497
01:28:19,607 --> 01:28:24,403
In the lake. The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me under the water.

498
01:28:26,155 --> 01:28:29,617
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

499
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:32,912
But he...

500
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:41,587
Then he's still there.

501
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,124
