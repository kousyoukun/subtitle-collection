1
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:54,921
因此，由于上天的慈悲，圣女贞德今天被列入圣徒的行列，这是非常幸运的。
And so by disposition of the divine mercy, it was done most opportunely, that Joan, child of god, daughter of France, today be placed among the number of the saints.

2
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:27,350
圣女贞德的历史被记录在这里，她在地球上只生活了19年。
Saint Joan of Arc whose history is recorded here, lived only 19 years on this earth.

3
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:34,917
她于1412年出生在一个叫Domrémy的村庄，就在洛林的广场上。
She was born in 1412 in a village of Domrémy, on the marche of Lorraine.

4
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:45,061
当时法国在百年战争中败给了敌人，被敌人蹂躏，城市被毁，农场被洗劫一空，人民绝望。
At the time when France, losing the hundred years war, was overrun by her enemies, her cities ruined, her farms stripped bare, her people hopeless.

5
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:54,848
但是法国的敌人没有料到琼会在她村子里被毁坏的小教堂里祈祷。
But the enemies of France did not reckon on the girl Joan praying in the little ruined church of her village.

6
00:04:55,105 --> 00:05:05,901
当她跪在那里时，她的圣人的声音一次又一次地对她说，敦促她成为一名士兵，带领法国军队走向胜利。
As she knelt there, the voices of her saint spoke to her again and again, urging her to become a soldier, to lead the armies of France to victory.

7
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:15,664
在兰斯为皇太子加冕，他们对她的要求是不可能的... ...然后又问了一遍。
to crown the Dauphin at Rheims, Impossible things they asked of her... ...and asked again.

8
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:42,247
真遗憾... ...可惜是法兰西王国。
What a pity... ... a pity that it is the Kingdom of France.

9
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:46,730
珍妮特?
Jeanette?

10
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,949
珍妮特!
Jeanette!

11
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,943
珍妮特，你的车来了，我们要给他送早餐。
Jeanette, your ride is here, we are to give him breakfast.

12
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,018
看到它。
See to it.

13
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,418
你怎么了，女孩?
What ails you girl?

14
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:09,942
为什么你总是一个人，不听任何人的话，回答问题就像在梦中一样?
Why you always alone and listen to no one and answer as if you were in a dream?

15
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:22,770
爱你的教堂固然好，虽然它已被烧毁，但不去想别的，只看我而不看我，忘记你的朋友，把这一切都留给你自己，这可不妙!
It's well to love your church, burnt though it is, but to think of nothing else, to look at me without seeing me, to forget your friends and keep all of this to yourself, this cannot be good!

16
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:24,877
你变成一个奇怪的女孩了，珍妮特。
You've become a strange girl, Jeanette.

17
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,901
我不相信你!
I don't trust you!

18
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,925
我不能相信你!
I can't trust you!

19
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,842
去做早餐。
Go and make breakfast.

20
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:43,102
从我藏身的地方，我可以看到他们，我可以看到他们抢劫、焚烧、谋杀……他们一路烧尽了一切。
From where I was hiding I could watch them, I could see 'em looting, burning, murdering... They burned everything in their path.

21
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:46,026
可是叔叔，这些士兵是英国人还是勃艮第人?
But uncle, were the soldiers English or Burgundians?

22
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,450
勃艮第人!
Burgundians!

23
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,474
大约60人，骑着马，带着武器。
About 60 of 'em,  mounted, and armed.

24
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:52,898
勃艮第人和英国人，都留下了同样的痕迹。
Burgundians or English, they leave the same trail.

25
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,922
我不懂勃艮第人!
I can't understand the Burgundians!

26
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,623
法国杀死!
French killing French!

27
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:58,023
他们在欺骗自己的人民!
They're deceiving their own people!

28
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,447
不止勃艮第人背叛了我们，杜兰。
Oh, it's not only the Burgundians that betray us, Durand.

29
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:04,171
我们的上一任国王死前把我们交给了英国人。
Our last king promised us to the English before he died.

30
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:07,495
太后为了英国的金子把我们出卖了。
Queen mother sold us out for English gold.

31
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,719
我们的领主在互相争斗。
Our lords are fighting among each other.

32
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:19,791
年轻的查尔斯，我们的国王，优秀的王子，我们的太子，不管你怎么称呼他，他太虚弱了，无法维持秩序，也太穷了，无力还债。
Young Charles, our King, fine prince, our Dauphin, whatever you call him, he's too weak to keep order and too poor to pay his debts.

33
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,120
我在市场上看到瑞布了。
I..I saw Reboux at the market.

34
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,520
他在奥尔良的战斗中失去了一只胳膊。
He lost an arm in the fighting at Orleans.

35
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,444
哦,可怜的Reboux !
Oh, poor Reboux!

36
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,868
-他们可能会占领奥尔良。-他们会接受的!
- They may take Orleans. - They will take it!

37
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,792
他们包围了我们最后一座伟大的城市。
They've surrounded our last great city.

38
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,816
城墙里的人除了绝望和饥饿一无所有。
Folk within the wall have nothing but their despair and their hunger.

39
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,240
没有缓解的希望了，他们也撑不了多久了。
There's no hope for relief and they can't hold out much longer.

40
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:39,464
如果奥尔良沦陷，法国就完了。
If Orleans falls it means the end of France.

41
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:43,288
我想在我老婆听到搜查的消息之前回家!
Well, I want to be home before my wife hears word of the raid!

42
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,512
我们可以去现场接你，我们要去帕洛维安
We could pick you up at the site, we're going down to the Palo Vien

43
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:53,515
让你的手忙碌起来，让你的注意力集中在你正在发生的事情上。
Keep your hands busy and keep your mind on what's going on about you.

44
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,039
谢谢你，伊莎贝尔。谢谢你！
Well, thank you Isabel.  Thank you!

45
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,463
再见Jide
Goodbye Jide

46
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,015
别介意，珍妮特。
Don't mind it, Jeannette.

47
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,239
我们知道你是一个善良温柔的女孩，但你有一种梦幻般的朦胧感。
We know you're a good and gentle girl but there's a dreamy haze about you.

48
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:13,063
让他喜怒无常、生气。
Makes him moody and angry.

49
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:19,586
……一场梦吗?
A...a dream?

50
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,810
他梦见你和士兵们走了。
He dreamed you went away with soldiers.

51
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,834
军队。
With an army.

52
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,982
一开始他以为你被带走了，后来又觉得你是自愿离开的。
First he though that you'd been carried away, then it seemed that you went of your own free will.

53
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:34,830
他梦见我带着一支军队走了，他不止一次梦见过。
He dreamed I went away with an army He's dreamed it more than once.

54
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,554
他也告诉了我们，约翰和我。
He told us too, John and me.

55
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:41,302
他说他会在这种事发生之前把你淹死在默兹河，如果他不在这里，他会让我们这么做。
He said he'd drown you in the River Meuse before a thing like that should happen, and if he were not here, he charged us to do it.

56
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:42,626
在这里。
Here.

57
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,349
亲爱的、亲爱的上帝，可怜可怜我吧!
Dear sweet God, have pity on me!

58
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:38,573
帮帮我吧!
Help me in this trouble!

59
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:48,445
四年多以前，我第一次听到那些声音，在我父亲的花园里，一遍又一遍地，你们的圣徒们告诉我，我必须离开。
It's more than four years since I first heard the voices, in my father's garden, again and again your Saints told me that I must go.

60
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,469
但如何?
But how?

61
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,293
我怎样才能拯救法国?
How can I save France?

62
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,517
我怎么能，带领皇太子去加冕?
How can I, lead the Dauphin to his coronation?

63
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,541
我可以吗?
Can I?

64
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:05,265
我只是个乡下的穷姑娘。我从没见过国王或军队。
I'm only a poor girl of the farms. I've never seen a King or an army.

65
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,589
我不适合跟大人物说话。
I'm not fitted to speak to great people.

66
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,213
或者去他们中间。
or go among them.

67
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:18,660
这段时间我一直在尝试，想要开始，但我找不到办法，所以什么都没有做。
All this time I have...I have tried, to make a beginning but I can find no way so nothing is done.

68
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:27,508
我知道现在每一天我们失去法国，我仍然不知道如何去做对我的要求。
I know that everyday now we lose France, I still don't know how to go about what is asked of me.

69
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,732
所以我什么都不做!
So I do nothing!

70
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:32,156
原谅我，原谅我!
Forgive me, forgive me!

71
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,412
我很无助，很痛苦。
I am helpless and in anguish.

72
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:48,036
会不会有声音来，说我已得到宽恕?
Will a voice come and say that I am forgiven?

73
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,312
因为我一心已经试验，我已经试验。
For I have tried with all my soul, I have tried.

74
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:12,084
那我就得去，尽我所能去，虽然我不知道怎么去。
Then I must go, and do what I can, without knowing how.

75
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:26,032
杜兰叔叔!
Uncle Durand!

76
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:28,901
杜兰叔叔!
Uncle Durand!

77
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,392
杜兰叔叔!
Uncle Durand!

78
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:44,052
- Jeannette，我忘了什么吗?-不，只是杜兰德叔叔我必须去沃库勒尔，带我一起去吧。
- Jeannette, did I forget something? - No, only uncle Durand I must go to Vaucouleurs, take me with you.

79
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:45,832
——Vaucouleurs吗?——是的。
- To Vaucouleurs? - Yes.

80
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:51,448
你父亲没跟我说过这件事。你妈妈什么也没说。
Your father said nothing about this to me. Your mother said nothing about it.

81
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,951
不。
No.

82
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,144
这很奇怪，Jeannette。
Well this is very strange, Jeannette.

83
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,736
你想在城里买东西吗?
You want to buy something in the city?

84
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:04,265
我得和罗伯特·德·鲍德里科特爵士谈谈。
I have to speak to Sir Robert de Baudricourt.

85
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,760
关于什么?你为什么要找国王的队长?
What about? Why would you speak to the King's captain?

86
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:13,920
-我不能告诉你Durand叔叔。-那我就不能带你去了
- I can't tell you Uncle Durand. - Then I can't take you.

87
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,193
我走着去。
I shall walk then.

88
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:23,405
即使我把腿穿到膝盖，我也必须去。
Even if I wear my legs to the knees, I must go.

89
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:43,475
也许我做错了……但是来吧。
It may be that I do wrong... but come.

90
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,626
——下一个。-杰拉德·莫尔索，罗伯特爵士。
- Next. - Gerard Morseau, Sir Robert.

91
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:04,281
-摩梭，你交税迟到了。他们烧了我的房子，罗伯特爵士。
- Morseau, you are late for the taxes. - Uh they burned my house, Sir Robert.

92
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:08,248
-偷了我的粮食。-让他等到下次收获。
- Stole my grain. - Give him till next harvest.

93
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:15,176
杜兰德·拉索伊斯-你们村的税还没交呢。-我知道，罗伯特爵士。
Durand Lassois, - Taxes for your village are not due yet. - I know, Sir Robert.

94
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:18,749
…这是我的侄女。——嗯。
- This is uh... this is my niece. - Hm.

95
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,977
-她是Domrémy的雅克·德·亚克的女儿。——是的,是的。
- She is the daughter of Jacques d'Arc of Domrémy. - Yes, yes.

96
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:24,295
她想和你谈谈。
She wishes to speak with you.

97
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:33,431
…我…是的，是的，继续，女孩，大声说出来。告诉我。
I... I... Yes, yes, go on girl, go speak up. Tell me.

98
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,941
…我给你带了个口信，罗伯特爵士。
I... I bring you a message Sir Robert.

99
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:42,780
你必须送我去见太子。我的主人命令。
You must send me to the Dauphin. My lord commands it.

100
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,027
你的主?我是你的主人!
Your lord? I am your lord!

101
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:51,804
-我的主是天上的王。-嗯，这是一个问题。这是一个点。
- My Lord is the King of Heaven. - Hm, that's a point. That's a point.

102
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:56,654
但我要领导太子的军队。
But I am to lead the Dauphin's armies.

103
00:13:57,446 --> 00:14:00,889
领导他的军队?皇太子什么时候有军队的?
To lead his armies? When did the Dauphin have an army?

104
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,142
女人不是领导军队的女孩，她们跟着!
And women don't lead armies girl, they follow!

105
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,576
如果你想成为那样的人，可以安排一个营地跟班。
And if you want to become that, a camp followerette can be arranged.

106
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:13,153
-但我要拯救法国。-为了拯救法国?
- But I'm to save France. - To save France?

107
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,050
回家吧，姑娘，别犯傻了!
Go home girl and don't be an idiot!

108
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:17,230
如果有可能拯救法国，那是很久以前的事了。
If it would have been possible to save France, it would have been done long ago.

109
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:18,848
我们本来可以自己动手的，伯尼茨?
We would have done it ourselves, eh Burnitz?

110
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,248
但是战争会改变的!
But the war will change!

111
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:24,947
当我来帮助太子的时候，……我必须带他去加冕典礼!
When I come to the aid of the Dauphin, I... I must lead him to his coronation!

112
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:29,871
麦萨，把这个叫穆尼的女孩带回家，告诉她父亲打她耳光。
Maxar, take this Mooney girl home, and tell her father to box her ears.

113
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:33,391
但你必须送我去见太子，我必须拯救法国!
But you must send me to the Dauphin, I must save France!

114
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,716
对不起，罗伯特爵士。我不知道她会说什么。
I am sorry, Sir Robert. I didn't know what she is going to say.

115
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,069
我要带她回家。
I'll take her home.

116
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:46,868
-你真是个傻瓜，如果我知道你要说的话……-我不想把这件事强加给你，Durand叔叔，但没有别的办法。
- What a fool you made out of me, if I've known what you are going to say... - I didn't want to bring this on you uncle Durand, but there was no other way.

117
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:50,149
-我必须和他谈谈。-你必须这么做?你父亲永远不会原谅我的。
- And I had to speak to him. - You had to? Your father will never forgive me.

118
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,939
-绝对不会!-嘘，嘘，表弟。
- Never in the world! - Hush, hush cousin.

119
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,527
让路!
Make way!

120
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,554
注意!让路!
Attention! Make way!

121
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:03,062
珍妮特!不，Jeannette，回来!
Jeannette! No, Jeannette, come back!

122
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,147
罗伯特爵士说了!——罗伯特爵士!
- Sir Robert has spoken! - Sir Robert!

123
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,481
罗伯特爵士，你必须派我去参战!
Sir Robert, you must send me out to take part in the war!

124
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:11,108
奥尔良处于极度危险之中，即使在今天，一场战斗仍在激烈进行。
Orleans is in great danger, and even today a battle is raging.

125
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:15,577
什么?奥尔良离这里有两百里格，没人知道那里发生了什么。
What? Orleans is 200 leagues from here, nobody knows what's going on there.

126
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,306
罗伯特爵士!
Sir Robert!

127
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,523
罗伯特爵士!
Sir Robert!

128
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:22,608
珍妮特!
Jeannette!

129
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:25,432
我告诉你，就在今天，有一场对我们不利的战斗!
I tell that there is fighting this very day and it goes against us!

130
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,856
你一定要听!你必须听我说!
You must listen! You must hear me!

131
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:35,079
孩子，我们都想拯救法国，但没有国王，法国已经缩小到一个小地方，他们需要一个冠军，这是无法挽救的!回家!
Child, we all want to save France, but France has dwindled down to a tiny patch without a King, where they need a champion and there's no saving it! Go home!

132
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,103
回家去找你父亲吧，孩子。
Go home to your father, child.

133
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,027
不要饶恕我。
Don't mean to spare me.

134
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:46,217
你说的话真奇怪，姑娘。
Those are very strange things you say girl.

135
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:49,036
是的，它们很奇怪。
Yes, they are strange.

136
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:54,216
我是来找劳勃爵士的，但你看得出他既不关心我，也不关心我说的话。
I'm sent here to speak to Sir Robert, but you saw that he cares neither for me nor for my words.

137
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,846
不过，在大斋节之前，我必须和皇太子在一起。
Nevertheless before the middle of Lent I must be with the Dauphin.

138
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,091
相信我，我宁愿回家和我妈一起纺纱。
Believe me I'd rather go home and spin with my mother.

139
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:13,494
因为这不是我该待的地方。但世界上没有一个人，没有国王，没有贵族，没有王子能给我们热爱的法国带来帮助。
For this is not my proper place. But there is not one person in the world, not among Kings, or nobles, or princes who can bring help to the France we love.

140
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,719
除了你面前这个女佣，一次都没有。
Not once save this maid you see before you.

141
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:23,187
不是因为我有什么，而是因为天上的王希望这样。
It's not because of anything in me, but because the King of heaven wishes it so.

142
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,331
你听说过预言吗?
Have you heard of a prophecy?

143
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
有预言说洛林的女仆会拯救法国。
There is a prophecy that a maid from Lorraine will save France.

144
00:16:29,093 --> 00:16:34,193
-你听到了吗?-不，我对预言一无所知。
- Have you heard it? - No, I know nothing of a prophecy.

145
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,417
我们现在进攻吗，丫头?
We attack now, wench?

146
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,741
她会和她父亲大吵一架的。
She'll have a battle with her father.

147
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:47,489
-她说的是实话!-珍妮特，过来!-你必须回家-我们的救世主-为我们的国王加冕!
- She speaks the truth! - Jeannette, come to me! - You must go home1 - Our Saviour. - That to crown our king!

148
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,913
穿着一件红色的裙子！
In a neck red dress!

149
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,337
在你身边，我不知道如何说话。
Bide you I wouldn't know how to speak.

150
00:16:53,561 --> 00:17:00,909
但年复一年，我还是被告知我必须离开，我必须拯救奥尔良，把英国人从法国的土地上赶走。
But still...year after year, I was told that I must go, I must save Orleans and drive the English from French soil.

151
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,533
你父母知道这事吗，珍妮特?
Do your parents know of this, Jeannette?

152
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,634
不。我没有告诉任何人。
No.  I have told no one.

153
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:11,214
虽然我没被要求保持沉默，但是
Not that I was asked to keep silent, but

154
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:19,438
我知道我父亲会禁止我去的我们该怎么办?
I knew my father would forbid me to go What are we to do?

155
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:23,413
我知道你必须回去，叔叔但我必须留下，直到罗伯特爵士听我的。
I know that you have to go back uncle but I must stay until Sir Robert will listen to me.

156
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:25,213
你必须留下来吗?
You must stay?

157
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:26,837
是的,我必须!
Yes, I must!

158
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:35,737
我将站在他的门口，直到他经过，如果没有我的地方，我将睡在田野里。
I'll stand at his gates until he passes and if there is no room for me, I'll sleep in the fields.

159
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,061
我被命令做的事。
What I am commanded to do.

160
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:44,785
我做!
I do!

161
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,309
把她留给我，杜兰德。
Leave her here with me, Durand.

162
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,333
我会照顾她的。
I'll take care of her.

163
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,257
如果我见到了你父亲呢?
What if I meet your father?

164
00:17:57,981 --> 00:17:59,981
你一定要告诉他你带我来这儿吗?
Must you tell him you brought me here?

165
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,705
你在这里很安全，我可以离开你，但是…
You're safe enough here and I can leave you but...

166
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,113
但是,叔叔?
But what, uncle?

167
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:13,736
这样做不会有什么好结果。
No good will come of it.

168
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
我不会说任何好的。
I won't say nothing good of it.

169
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,232
你怎么又来了?
Why are you here again?

170
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:30,928
你知道劳勃爵士不会见你的。回家吧，姑娘，明天别回来了。
You know Sir Robert won't see you. Go home girl and don't come back tomorrow.

171
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,171
就是她，过来了。
That's she, coming now.

172
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:44,163
-对不起，你是女仆吗?-我叫琼，雅克·德·雅克的女儿。
- Forgive me, but are you the maid? - I'm Joan, daughter of Jacques d'Arc.

173
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:50,139
-我们听说你在里尔，想见你。-告诉你，我们相信你，我们为你祈祷。
- We heard about you in Lille, we wanted to see you. - And to tell you that we believe in you, we prayed for you.

174
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:53,030
上星期天我们为你们举行了弥撒。
We held a mass for you last Sunday.

175
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,887
谢谢你！
Thank you.

176
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,140
我知道你的祈祷会有帮助。
I know that your prayers will help.

177
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,830
门又当着我的面锁上了。
The gates were locked in my face again.

178
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,201
妈妈。
Mother.

179
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:17,637
我是来带你回家的，珍妮特。
I came to take you home, Jeannette.

180
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,066
你必须回家，珍妮特。
You must come home, Jeannette.

181
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:30,182
一个黑暗的梦已经在你身上爬了一会儿，但它并没有什么害处，它很快就会消失的，当它消失的时候，就没有人会去想它了。
A dark dream has crept over you for a little while, but its done no harm, and soon it will be gone and when it's gone no one will think of it.

182
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,277
但是回家。
But come home.

183
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:35,851
我从没想过要伤害你，妈妈。
I never wanted to hurt you, mother.

184
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:39,162
因为我爱你胜过世界上的任何人。
For I love you more than anyone else in the world.

185
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:47,516
但如果我有100个父亲和100个母亲，…我不能回去。我现在必须往前走了。
But if I had a 100 fathers and a 100 mothers, I... I could not go back. I must go forward now.

186
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,923
那告诉我在哪里，珍妮特?
Then tell me where, Jeannette?

187
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:52,249
你会朝什么方向走?
Toward what would you go?

188
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,729
-那女孩呢?——罗伯特先生。
- Where's the girl? - Sir Robert.

189
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,400
这是一个。
That's the one.

190
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:09,903
两周前，你来找我，跟我说了一场战斗。
Exactly 2 weeks ago you came to see me and spoke of a battle.

191
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:14,510
今天有个信使送来了消息。那天确实有一场大战役。
Today a courier came with messages. There was indeed a great battle on that day.

192
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,951
对太子来说也是一场惨败。
And a heavy defeat for the Dauphin.

193
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,741
你是怎么知道的?你学过巫术吗?
How did you learn this? Have you studied witchcraft?

194
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:26,343
-你当然知道我没有。-这正是我们所不知道的。
- Oh surely you know I have not. - That is just what we do not know.

195
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:30,039
福涅尔神父问她。
Father Fournier, put her to question.

196
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:44,017
你若是魔鬼，从撒但差来的，就离开我们吧。
If you are a thing of evil and sent from Satan, depart from us.

197
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:49,456
但你若是良善的，是从神来的，请近前来。
but if you are good and from God, come near.

198
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:59,376
我请求您的祝福，父亲。
I ask your blessing, father.

199
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:03,406
我要求邪恶远离你们。
And I ask of whatever is evil fly far from you.

200
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:08,655
只要能帮助我们的事业和法国的事业，就留下来吧。
Whatever is good remain to help our cause and the cause of France.

201
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,536
她不是巫师，劳勃爵士。
She is no sorcerer, Sir Robert.

202
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:20,597
不管你听她说了什么，不管是不是预言，都与魔鬼无关。
Whatever you have heard her say, whether prophecy or not, the devil has no part in it.

203
00:21:22,053 --> 00:21:24,173
谢谢你,父亲。
Thank you, father.

204
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:30,787
-你还是想去找太子。-我的主人命令我去。
- You still wish to go to the Dauphin. - My Lord has commanded me to go.

205
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:35,171
这两位先生想让我派你去执行这个狂野的任务，他们愿意和你一起护送。
These 2 gentlemen wish me to send you forth on this wild mission of yours, they are willing to ride with you as escort.

206
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:38,968
在我看来，这是徒劳的，但他们相信你可以帮助我们的国家。
To me it seems like a fool's errand, but they believe you may help our country.

207
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,705
如果有这样的机会，我不想让任何东西碍事。
Now if there is a chance of that, I don't want to put anything in the way.

208
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,573
然后一切都将实现。
Then it shall all come true.

209
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,593
再见,我的孩子。
Goodbye, my child.

210
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:03,916
自从我听了你的演讲，我就像在做梦一样。
Ever since I heard you speak, I've gone about in a kind of dream.

211
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:08,673
因为我还没有清楚地看到我该往哪里去，或者我这辈子该做什么。
For I've never yet seen clearly where I must go, or what I must do with my life.

212
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:13,570
但突然间，当我听到你的声音，我觉得我知道了。
But suddenly, when I heard your voice, it seemed to me that I knew.

213
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,688
我来做你的追随者。
I come to be your follower.

214
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:22,370
谢谢你！你是第一个。
Thank you. You are the first.

215
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:25,711
我很乐意做第二个。我们什么时候出发?
And I'm quite willing to be the second. When do we set out?

216
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:29,366
今天而不是明天。明天而不是后天。
Today rather than tomorrow. Tomorrow rather than the day after.

217
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,990
太子在希农。
The Dauphin is at Chinon.

218
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:33,014
穿过敌国的路很远。
That's a long way through enemy country.

219
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,191
所以，准备好迎接一场艰难而危险的冬季骑行吧。
So prepare yourself for a rough and dangerous winter ride.

220
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:40,991
给我拿件男孩子的衣服来。
Fetch me a...boy's clothing.

221
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:42,915
我会打扮成男人。
I'll dress as a man.

222
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:48,391
如果这是错的，我会一直知道这是错的。
If this is wrong, then I'll always know it was wrong.

223
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:54,315
不,妈妈。我是为此而生的。
No, mother.  I was born for this.

224
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:58,491
珍妮特，镇上的人给你带了一匹马。
Jeannette, the town folk have brought you a horse for your journey.

225
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:10,111
,它的完成。
There, it's finished.

226
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,335
…你，你真是个英俊的小伙子!
Why you...you, you make a handsome lad!

227
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,859
我已经派人送信给皇太子，让他们等着你。
I've sent a messenger ahead with my letter to the Dauphin so they'll expect you.

228
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,714
琼，你以前骑过吗?
Joan, have you ridden before?

229
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,455
等我们到达希农时，我应该会骑得很好。
By the time we reach Chinon I should ride well.

230
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:43,233
当心你只能在夜间骑马，你即将到来的消息会像火一样在前方飞奔，敌人会想要守望着你。
Take care that you ride only by night, the news of your coming will run ahead like fire and the enemy will want to watch for you.

231
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,702
我不怕他们。
I fear them not.

232
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:49,926
没有剑?在这里,用我的。
No sword?  Here, take mine.

233
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:57,858
母亲生孩子，把他们交给这个世界，她认为她很了解他们。
A mother bears children and gives them to the world and she thinks she knows them well.

234
00:23:58,044 --> 00:23:59,983
但她根本不认识他们。
But she doesn't know them at all.

235
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,094
现在你必须走了。保护她。
And now you must go. Guard her well.

236
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,619
你还有很长的路要走，还有冰冷的河要渡。
You have many leagues to ride and icy rivers to cross.

237
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,542
去救世主的圣殿吧，母亲，为我们祈祷。
Go to the shrine of redeemer, mother, and pray for us.

238
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,588
——再见!-上帝与你同在!
- Goodbye! - God be with you!

239
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,961
-祝你好运，琼，快回来!——再见,琼!
- Godspeed, Joan, come back soon! - Goodbye, Joan!

240
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,300
-上帝保佑你，琼。——谢谢!
- God help you Joan. - Thank you!

241
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:49,099
去吧，洛林的女仆，我对你的期望很低，但不管怎样，去吧。
Go then maid of Lorraine, I expect but little of you, but go... and come what may.

242
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,993
告别,琼!
Farewell, Joan!

243
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,929
——再见!——告别,琼!
- Goodbye! - Farewell, Joan!

244
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,984
告诉我们你是谁!
Well, tell us who you are!

245
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,545
旅行者，我的朋友，只是旅行者。
Travellers, my friend, just travellers.

246
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:16,024
-你是谁?-我是克莱沃的警长。
- And who may you be? - I'm the head constable of Clairevaux.

247
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,544
我们是诚实的人。
We're honest men.

248
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,168
也许吧，但我必须看着你。
You may be, but I must look at you.

249
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,366
你是个小伙子吗?
Are you a lad?

250
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:51,099
-让我告诉你为什么我们会在这里见面。-好吧，告诉我们，让我们继续。
- Let me tell you why we meet you here. - Well, tell us and let us go on.

251
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:54,181
我们镇上有一群勃艮第士兵。
There is a party of Burgundian soldiers in our town.

252
00:25:54,585 --> 00:26:00,642
他们说他们是来对付洛林的女仆的，就是来帮助皇太子的那个。
They say that they're here to lay hands on the maid from Lorraine, the one that is coming to help the Dauphin.

253
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:06,517
如果你们中的一个是那个女仆-那就绕到我们村子里去。-谢谢你，警官。
If one of you should be that maid, - Then go round our village. - Thank you, constable.

254
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,385
这与我们无关。
This does not concern us.

255
00:26:09,804 --> 00:26:11,579
我妻子送了两条面包。
My wife send two loaves of bread.

256
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:16,398
-我们已经尽力了。-再次感谢你。
- That was the best we could do. - Thank you again.

257
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:22,995
如果你允许的话，我想亲自把它们交给这孩子。
I would like to if you would permit me to lay them in the hands of the lad myself.

258
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:31,214
如果你是洛林来的女佣，我没说你是，但如果是的话，我有个消息要告诉你来自克莱尔沃的人。
If it should be that you're the maid from Lorraine, I don't say that you are, but if it should be, I have a message for you from the people of Clairevaux.

259
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:32,763
它是这样的:
It's this:

260
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,617
“上帝与你同在。”
"God go with you."

261
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:39,924
"愿上帝与你同在，拯救法国，也拯救我们"
"God go with you and save France and save us too."

262
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:54,946
现在我们可以回家了，邻居们，因为我们已经见过她了，也警告过她了。
Now we can go to our homes, neighbours, for we've seen her and we've given her the warning.

263
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,916
那些是希农的塔。
Those are the towers of Chinon.

264
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,472
哦，我们安全通过了。
Oh we've come through safely.

265
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,832
我们在这里。
We're here.

266
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:12,879
对希侬来说，我们试过了，一切都是值得的，我将见到我的女儿。
To Chinon we tried...it has all been worthwhile... ...and I shall see my daughter.

267
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:32,363
-你带了金子吗?——黄金?
- Did you bring the gold Trémouille? - Gold?

268
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,394
黄金?不，我没有。
Gold? No, I did not.

269
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:40,185
公爵，当你出现的时候，你应该鞠躬。
You should bow when you come into the presence, Duke.

270
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,564
你的态度是……邋遢。
Your attitude is... slovenly.

271
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,554
-你欠我钱。- - - - - -钱吗?
- You owe me money. - Money?

272
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:47,736
我有确切的消息，你打算放弃你的王国。
I have definite information that you plan to abandon your kingdom.

273
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:48,791
你要离开我们。
You're leaving us.

274
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,115
你遗弃我们。
You're deserting us.

275
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:56,375
如果我借给你3000克朗，你就会消失在北方或南方而我可以吹口哨要我的钱。
If I lent you 3,000 crowns, you'd disappear to the North or the South and I can whistle for my money.

276
00:27:56,548 --> 00:28:00,942
不仅是这笔贷款还有你已经欠我的大笔钱。
Not only this loan in question but the enormous sums you already owe me.

277
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,789
那就借我一千吧。
Then lend me a thousand.

278
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:06,049
很安全，我不能走太远。
It's safe, I can't go very far on that.

279
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,872
我需要你的签名。
I'll need your signature.

280
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,229
没拿到钱我不会签字的。
I refuse to sign until I have the money.

281
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,176
我需要你先签名。
I'll need your signature first.

282
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:17,828
-仆人，给大人的羽毛笔。——你强盗!你贼!你强盗!
- Lackey, a quill for my Lord. - You robber! You thief! You brigand!

283
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:19,801
先生们，不要在法庭前。
Gentlemen, not before the court.

284
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,451
在他借钱给我之前，他要求我在白纸底下签名，我知道为什么。
Before he lends me money he demands my signature at the bottom of a blank page, and I know why.

285
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:30,178
每次我向他借钱，他都用我的签名把我的一些领地卖给勃艮第，以筹集他借给我的钱。
Every time I borrow from him he uses my signature to sell some of my territory to Burgundy to raise the money he lends me.

286
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:31,150
那不是真的。
That's not true.

287
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,651
但这太不可思议了，我的主人!
But that's incredible my lord!

288
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,275
那是不诚实的!
That would be dishonest!

289
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,999
好吧，以他的标准来说不是!
Well, not by his standards!

290
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,323
这是合理的商业惯例。
It's sound business practice.

291
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:42,947
我欠他的钱已经够多的了，我不得不向他借钱来付我所欠他的利息。
I'm already so deep in debt to him that I have to borrow money from him to pay the interest on what I owe him!

292
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,371
让我们公平点，陛下。
Let us be fair, my sovereign.

293
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:52,919
如果Trémouille向你收取的利息高于惯例，他可能会被赦免，理由是你不太可能登上王位。
If Trémouille charges you more interest than is customary, he may be pardoned on the grounds that you are very unlikely to come to your throne.

294
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:58,067
如果你不这样做，他将永远得不到偿还，连本息都得不到。
And if you don't he'll never be paid, principal or interest.

295
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:01,215
你的亲生母亲说……谁相信我妈妈说的话?
Your own mother has said... Who believes what my mother says?

296
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:07,339
.．.她说你不是上一任国王的儿子——她的风流韵事似乎可以证实……-别说我妈了
...has said you're not the son of the last King and - the history of her amores would seem to substantiate... - Enough about my mother.

297
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,840
你也打算投靠英国人，大主教，不是吗?
Well, you intend going over to the English too, don't you archbishop?

298
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:23,712
不,我知道。你们两个都是，你们两个，除非我每天都在意，因为我在下沉，而你认为是时候放手让我淹死了？
No, I know. You are on both sides, both of you, unless I mind everyday because I'm going down and you think the time has come to... let go and let me drown?

299
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,036
但是…等一下!
But...hold it!

300
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,949
我周围都是小偷。
I'm surrounded by thieves.

301
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:42,473
不是贼，大人。
Not thieves, my lord.

302
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:46,221
这些人窃取了国家，才成为政治家。
These men steal kingdoms, that makes them statesmen.

303
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:49,469
你也在轻视我…看看你提供的娱乐。
And you're slighting me too... look at the entertainment you provide.

304
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:50,593
酒杯!
Tumblers!

305
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:53,617
等陛下看到下一个景点就会原谅我的。
Your majesty will forgive me when he sees the next attraction.

306
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:55,441
它是什么?
What is it?

307
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:58,465
陛下还记得洛林那个可怜的疯丫头吗?
Does your majesty remember the poor, mad maid from Lorraine?

308
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:02,713
不…我做了什么?
No... Do I?

309
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,737
就是博德里考特写给你的那个。
The one Baudricourt wrote you about.

310
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,860
她一直在旅馆等你，希望能见到你。
She's been waiting at the inn, hoping to see you.

311
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,184
好吧，让她等着。
Well, let her wait.

312
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,208
她现在在这里。
She's here now.

313
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:18,980
她在门口……我向您保证，如果您把王座借给我一会儿，我就会笑得把整个宫廷都夷为平地……而且你不会为此付出任何代价。
She's on the threshold... I promise you, if you lend me your throne for a moment I'll lay the whole court flat with laughter... and it will cost you nothing.

314
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,004
很好。
Very well.

315
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:28,552
马蒂，我表弟，很高兴你能来，不，不，不。和我们坐在一起看娱乐节目。
Marty, my cousin, so happy to have you here, No, no, no. Sit with us and watch the entertainment.

316
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:32,500
我一直在观察查尔斯，但我不敢相信自己的眼睛。
I have been watching Charles but I couldn't believe my eyes.

317
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:38,672
欢乐,轻浮,浪费……而离这里几法里的奥尔良，你最后一座伟大的城市正在消亡，而你却任由它消亡。
Gaiety, frivolity, waste... and a few leagues from here Orleans, your last great city is dying, and you let it die.

318
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:40,996
你的王国离你而去，你却视而不见。
Your kingdom slips from you and you look the other way.

319
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,420
没有了，Alençon，没有了，如果你爱我。
No more, Alençon, no more if you love me.

320
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:50,716
如果我爱你，我必须说更多我听说你要离开我们，查尔斯，你打算放弃法国但你是法国的心脏。如果你走了，我们还剩下什么?
If I love you, I must say more I've heard you're leaving us Charles, that you plan to abandon France But you're the heart of France. What have we left if you go?

321
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,240
法国对我意味着什么?
And what does France mean to me?

322
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:56,688
一个疯狂的父亲签字放弃了我在条约上的权利，一个宣布我为私生子的母亲。
a mad father who signed away my rights for the treaty, a mother who has declared me illegitimate.

323
00:30:57,112 --> 00:31:00,112
她嫁给了唯一的国王现在是觊觎我王位的人的母亲。
a sister who married the only King and now is mother to the pretender to my throne.

324
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:04,036
你想知道我是不是自娱自乐?
Do you wonder if I amuse myself?

325
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,360
我看不下去。
I can't watch it.

326
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:09,383
我的主人和堕落的同胞们，现在是今晚最后的胡闹时刻!
My lord and fellow reprobates, we now come to the final foolery of the evening!

327
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,307
最后的也是最好的。
The last and the best.

328
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,331
-当你知道那是什么…-你要跳舞吗?——玩!
- When you know what it is... - Are you to do dancers?  - A play!

329
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:18,355
这比戏剧好。
It's better than a play.

330
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,771
洛林来了一位女先知。
A prophetess has come from Lorraine.

331
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,706
承诺拯救法国，为我们的皇太子加冕。
Promising to save France and crown our Dauphin.

332
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:32,888
现在，我们的游戏是让克莱蒙特伯爵登上王位，他会假装自己是显赫的查尔斯。
Now then, the game is we put the Count of Clermont on the throne, he will pretend that he is the illustrious Charles.

333
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:49,086
今晚结束后，我将按大众的要求成为太子?
When the evening is over, I shall be Dauphin by popular demand, huh?

334
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:51,060
幸运的是，这还不够。
Fortunately, that is not enough.

335
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:56,312
-现在，坐上王位。-请，我的善良的人们，敬礼吧。
- Now, sit on the throne. - Please, a little obeisance, my good people.

336
00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:58,549
这是更好的。
That's better.

337
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:04,170
现在，让她进来。我说，让她进来吧。
Now, let her enter. Let her enter, I say.

338
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,370
啊…你们有三个人。
Ah... there are three of you.

339
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:28,674
我能问下洛林的女仆是谁吗?
And which may I ask is the maid of Lorraine?

340
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:34,088
-我是洛林来的女佣。-和你在一起的其他姑娘是谁?
- I am the maid from Lorraine. - Who are these other maidens with you?

341
00:32:36,776 --> 00:32:40,803
这是让·德·梅斯贝特朗·德·波朗日和我一起来保护我。
This is Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy came with me to guard me.

342
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:42,704
一个三口之家?
A family of three?

343
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:48,462
先生，如果你有任何反对女仆的意思或者怀疑我们对她的尊重我建议你说话要小心。
Sir, if you mean anything against the maid or doubt our respect for her I advise you to watch what you say.

344
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:51,596
我的歉意。
My apologies.

345
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:54,951
我宁愿没有人向我下跪。
I'd rather nobody knelt to me.

346
00:32:55,402 --> 00:33:00,920
然后没有人会。我向你保证，这不是一个为了舒服而选择的姿势。
Then nobody will. I assure you, it's not a position one chooses for comfort.

347
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:06,080
但来吧，这是我们伟大的皇太子。
But come, here's our great Dauphin.

348
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:32,637
我坐在这里等着你答应我的王冠，洛林的女仆。
Well, here I sit waiting for the crown you promised me, maid of Lorraine.

349
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,516
求你为我戴上冠冕。
See that I am crowned.

350
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:37,271
一定要马上给我加冕。
See that I am crowned at once.

351
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:50,034
给，你的王子向你求婚了，姑娘。
Here, your Dauphin offers you his hand, maiden.

352
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:32,695
我温柔的太子，我要找的就是你。
My gentle Dauphin it is you I seek.

353
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:36,833
我千里迢迢来找你，没有人能取代你的位置。
I've come a long way to find you and no other can take your place.

354
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:40,389
上帝通过他的使者对我说话。
God has spoken to me through his messengers.

355
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:45,880
他的意愿是我来帮助你你将成为法国的国王。
And it is his will that I come to aid you and that you'll be King of France.

356
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:48,087
你怎么认识我的?
How did you know me?

357
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:52,261
我可以告诉你，当我们独处的时候。
I can tell you that when we are alone.

358
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:03,995
-你的意见是什么?-这个女孩很危险，肯定有第三者。
- What is your opinion? - This girl is dangerous, there must be a third party.

359
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:12,028
-我敢发誓她是你的敌人派来的。-我的太子，我告诉你，从现在开始，战争将会改变。
- I could swear she was sent by your enemies. - My Dauphin, I say to you from this hour the war will change.

360
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:15,124
你的生活将会改变。
And your life will change.

361
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:19,216
但事实是，琼，我不是上帝可能会感兴趣的那种人。
But the truth is, Joan, I'm not the sort of person God would be very likely to be interested in.

362
00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:20,848
真的,我不是。
Truly, I'm not.

363
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:27,664
虽然我可能不比其他人差，但是…如果你问我，上帝对我们任何人都不太在意。
Though I'm no worse than the others here probably but... God bothers very little with any of us if you should ask me.

364
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,500
我跟你说了实话。跟我说实话。
Now, I've been honest with you. Be honest with me.

365
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:34,316
你想要什么?钱吗?
What is it you want? Money?

366
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:35,474
土地吗?
Lands?

367
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,065
礼物呢?
Presents?

368
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:43,898
-我是个穷人，尽管…神对你不感兴趣，这是不对的。
- I'm a poor man in spite of being... - It is not true that God takes no interest in you.

369
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:48,671
你说这话是为了躲避我，就像你刚才躲在女人中间一样。
You say that to hide yourself from me as you just now hid among the women.

370
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,744
但上帝会找到你的。让你成为国王。
But God will find you out. And make you King.

371
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:55,804
这是一个诚实的声音。听她说，查尔斯。
This is an honest voice. Listen to her, Charles.

372
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:58,357
我认为你来得正是时候。
I think you've come just in time.

373
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,121
一会儿……我以为你是王子。
For a moment... I thought you were the Dauphin.

374
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:07,063
我是他的堂兄，荣森公爵。
I'm his cousin, the Duke of Ronson.

375
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:11,207
我很高兴你能来，好公爵。
I'm glad you're here, good Duke.

376
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:18,163
我们采集的法国皇室血液越多，我们的事业就越强大。-别相信她，大人。
The more we gather of the royal blood of France, - the stronger is our cause. - Don't trust her my Lord.

377
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,840
我试着不相信她。
I'm trying not to trust her.

378
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:29,113
但每次我看着她的眼睛，我相信她说的是真的。-更有理由不信任她了
But every time I looked into her eyes, - I believe what she says is true. - More reason to distrust her.

379
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,591
温柔的多芬,
Gentle Dauphin,

380
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:46,178
我若将这奥秘的事告诉你们，只有你们知道，只有神知道，你们岂肯信我是神差来的吗?
if I tell you things so secret that they are known to you and God alone, will you believe that I am sent by him?

381
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,267
跟我来，琼。
Come with me, Joan.

382
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,660
尼古拉斯，从犁上脱下来!把你的马!
Nicholas, unhitch from the plough! Bring your horse!

383
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:24,928
来加入女仆的军队吧!
Come and join the maid's army!

384
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,733
女仆吗?她没有军队!
Maid? She has no army!

385
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,124
-那她很快就会有一个了!-走吧，尼古拉斯!
- Then she will soon have one! - Come along, Nicholas!

386
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:32,116
——出现!——加入我们!
- Come along! - Join us!

387
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,449
成千上万的人蜂拥而来。
Men come flocking by the thousands.

388
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,639
女仆的名字是魔法。
The maid's name is magic.

389
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,150
-我的人相信这一点。-没人退缩吗?
- My people believe in that. - Nobody holds back?

390
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,978
为什么?为什么?为什么?军队聚集。
Why? Why? Why? The army gathered.

391
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,632
男人从四面八方赶来。
Men are coming from everywhere.

392
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:38,727
金银珠宝从地下挖出来，倒入宝库。
Gold and jewels are dug from the ground and poured into the treasury.

393
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:41,846
你买不到的谷物和牲畜被当作礼物送人。
Grain and cattle you couldn't buy are sent as gifts.

394
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,821
你命令我们召集军队，我们做到了。
You ordered us to raise the army, we've done it.

395
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,957
但你还没给我们游行的命令。
But you still haven't given us the word to march.

396
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:51,180
但在大主教和教堂的官员检查了那姑娘之后，我就不知道了。
But I couldn't very well before the girl had been examined by the archbishop and the officers of the church.

397
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,372
但是考试已经结束了。
But the examination has finished.

398
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:58,481
二十位博学而忠诚的牧师在普瓦捷审问了她三个星期。
20 learned and loyal priests questioned her for 3 weeks at Poitiers.

399
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:02,643
他们向Domrémy和沃库勒尔索取有关她的所有证据。
They sent to Domrémy and Vaucouleurs for all the available evidence about her.

400
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,688
教堂发现琼的心是纯洁的，虔诚的，纯洁的，而且如此正式地说。——是的。
The church finds Joan untouched, religious and pure at heart, - and says so formally. - Yes.

401
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,161
虽然我们发现她身上除了优点什么都没有，但我们还是不确定让她上战场是否明智。
Although we find nothing except good in her, still we are not certain if it's wise to send her into battle.

402
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:20,551
现在你至少还活着，皇太子，但如果你投入这场战争你不仅会失去你的王国，还会失去你的生命。
At present you are at least alive, Dauphin, but if you throw yourself into this war you may lose not only your kingdom, but your life.

403
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:23,342
我不会去领导军队。她将领导它。
I'm not going to lead the army. She's going to lead it.

404
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:26,147
一个绿色乡村女孩带领着一支法国军队?
A green country girl leading an army of France?

405
00:40:26,353 --> 00:40:28,191
你会成为基督教界的笑柄。
You will be the laughing stock of Christendom.

406
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:35,056
我已经这样很久了。感谢你……和你。多年来你一直试图说服我相信我是我父亲王位的觊觎者。
I've been that for a long time. Thanks to you... and you. For years you've tried to convince me that I'm a pretender to my father's throne.

407
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:39,475
一个无赖，一个低能儿。有时我倾向于相信你。
A scoundrel, an imbecile. At times I've been inclined to believe you.

408
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,629
但后来她来了……帮我解决问题。
But then she came... and sort me out.

409
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:45,493
她在教堂跟你说了什么?
What did she tell you in the chapel?

410
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:48,298
我不能告诉你。
I can't tell you that.

411
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,021
和我不会。
And I won't.

412
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:54,088
你会告诉我们的。你这辈子从来没有保守过秘密。
You'll tell us. You've never kept a secret in your life.

413
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:56,242
我要留着这个。
I shall keep this one.

414
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:03,564
事实上，我还不知道我想做什么。
The truth is I don't yet know what I want to do.

415
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:07,372
请注意，这是我自己的脑袋。我自己的脑袋和王冠。
It's my own head, mind you. My own head and my crown.

416
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:10,085
我不知道我是否想冒这个险。
I don't know whether I want to risk them.

417
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:14,603
但我们要等多久?难道我们永远也不能接替奥尔良吗。
But how long are we to wait? Are we never to relieve Orleans.

418
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,140
我不知道。
I don't know.

419
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,025
我不知道。
I don't know.

420
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:25,095
你等得越久就越聪明，陛下。
The longer you wait the wiser, your Majesty.

421
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:28,253
我也不确定。
I'm not sure of that either.

422
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:31,987
-陛下，我…-太子，请原谅我的失礼。
- Your majesty, I... - My Dauphin, forgive my bad manners.

423
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:37,150
几天来我一直想见你，但守卫拒绝了，你参加了议会……亲爱的琼，那件斗篷很适合你，你看起来光彩照人!
For days I've tried to see you but the guard said no, you were in council... My dear Joan, that cloak becomes you, you look radiant!

424
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:40,202
谢谢你，我的太子，一切准备就绪。
I thank you for it, my Dauphin, all preparations are made.

425
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:42,508
让我们行动起来。是行动的人，不是空谈的人!
Let us have action. Men of action and not men of words!

426
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:46,321
送我去奥尔良，你要的指示就会实现。
Send me to Orleans, and the sign you asked for will be given.

427
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,717
-现在是时候了。-时间总是有的，琼。
- Now is the time. - There is always time, Joan.

428
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:51,225
不，时间有限，皇太子。
No, there is not always time, my Dauphin.

429
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:55,267
好好利用我，因为我已经告诉过你，我只会坚持一年多一点的时间。
Use me well, for I've told you I shall last a year and but a little longer.

430
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:56,916
和我们一起去奥尔良吧。
Come ride with us to Orleans.

431
00:41:57,129 --> 00:42:00,729
如果你希望我答应，你就不要要求不合理的事情。
If you wish me to say yes, you must not ask for unreasonable things.

432
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:02,968
你不能让我带领军队。
You must not ask me to lead an army.

433
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:07,674
我再次警告你，陛下。相信这个女孩是没有常识的。
I warn you again, your Majesty. It's not common sense to trust this girl.

434
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:12,535
如果拯救奥尔良是上帝的旨意，你为什么需要士兵?
If it be God's will to deliver Orleans, Why do you need soldiers?

435
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:15,874
士兵们会战斗，上帝会给他们胜利。
The soldiers will fight and God will give them victory.

436
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:19,258
如果我能确定…你看，我不确定的是我自己。
If I could be sure... You see it's myself that I'm not sure of.

437
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:24,233
-我不确定我能成为一个好国王。-你需要的是对上帝的信仰。
- I'm not sure I would make a good King. - What you need is faith in God.

438
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:27,124
当你有了它，你就会对自己有信心。
When you have that you'll have faith in yourself.

439
00:42:27,135 --> 00:42:30,135
我不确定上帝想让我做国王。
I'm not sure God wants me to be King.

440
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:39,611
为什么上帝要帮助我，当我……我是什么?
Why should God send me help, when I am... what I am?

441
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,918
放下你的疑虑和恐惧，我的太子。
Put aside your doubts and fears, my Dauphin.

442
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:51,998
像我梦想的那样高尚，像上帝要求的那样，像法国需要你的那样。
Be noble as I have dreamed you to be, be as God requires you to be, be as France needs you.

443
00:42:52,315 --> 00:43:02,277
你的法国，你的国家，你的人民，没有你是如此的无助，但一旦你把你的信仰转向上帝，他们就会所向披靡。
Your France, your nation and your people, so helpless without you, but unconquerable as soon as you turn your trust to God.

444
00:43:03,578 --> 00:43:08,174
-看着她的脸，你会怀疑吗，大人?——没有。
- Can you look at her face and doubt, my Lord? - No.

445
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,661
我现在不怀疑了。
I do not doubt now.

446
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:15,012
Alençon，带她去见船长。
Alençon, take her to the captains.

447
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:21,475
上帝与这女孩同在，在战斗中也会与她同在。
God is with this girl, and will be with her in battle.

448
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,599
你觉得盔甲很重吗?
Does the armour feel heavy to you?

449
00:43:56,623 --> 00:44:00,546
不。我心情轻松愉快，因为我要去见军队，然后出发。
No. I am light and light-hearted, for I shall meet the army and begin.

450
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,570
把我的旗帜高举，维隆!
Hold my banner high, Velon!

451
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:30,713
先生们，这是女仆琼。
Gentlemen, I present you Joan the maid.

452
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:39,502
这是安特尔，库弗特，波隆，
This is Antel, Couvert, Poulon,

453
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:51,182
德罗戈，瑟瑟蕾，这是莱尔。
Derrogaux, Serseraille, and this is Laire.

454
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:59,700
哈!以比戎的野牛起誓!这是一个女孩…在日常工作中!哈哈哈!
Hah! By the wild bull of Bijon! It's a girl... and in harness! Hahaha!

455
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:06,798
莱尔以自己是一个直率的家伙而自豪，对任何人都不文雅，所以不必在意他的问候。他打架。
Laire takes pride in being a plain blunt fellow without polish for anybody, so think nothing of his greeting. He fights well.

456
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:08,913
如果他打得好，我会喜欢他的。
If he fights well, I shall like him.

457
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,937
这不是问题所在
That is not the question

458
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:15,761
来和我们坐一起吧，琼。
Well, come sit with us Joan.

459
00:46:15,785 --> 00:46:18,602
我们将在一起工作，我们必须互相了解。
We shall all be working together and we must become acquainted.

460
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:21,626
是我朋友博德里考特派你去找太子的吗?
Was it my friend Baudricourt who sent you to the Dauphin?

461
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,550
是的!
Yes!

462
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:25,602
他是怎么开始相信你的?
How did he ever come to believe in you?

463
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,402
我觉得他从没信任过我，长官。
I don't think he ever believed in me, sir.

464
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:34,050
让·德·梅斯和贝特朗·德·波朗日相信我，我想他是为了他们才派我来的。
Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy believed in me, and he sent me because of them I think.

465
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:40,074
在法国或世界的历史上，我记得没有一个人的名字是这样突然地建立起来的。
In the history of France or the world I remember no name built up with such suddenness.

466
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:45,622
没有哪一种热情如此广泛地传播，没有哪一种事业在如此有利的支持下发展。
No enthusiasm so wide spread, no career advanced under such favourable auspices.

467
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:49,970
一定是某个有非凡想象力和技巧的人策划了这一切。
Somebody of really portentous imagination and skill must have cooked this thing up.

468
00:46:50,794 --> 00:46:52,294
哦,什么事?
Oh, what thing?

469
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:54,302
这位来自洛林的处女。
This virgin from Lorraine business.

470
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:57,626
你不必在我们面前装模作样，你知道的。
You don't have to keep up appearances with us, you know.

471
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:04,649
你明白他的意思吗?
Do you know what he means?

472
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,073
是的,我喜欢。
Yes, I do.

473
00:47:06,497 --> 00:47:08,497
你会发现她很诚实的，Serseraille。
You'll find her honest, Serseraille.

474
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:12,245
她是两件事之一…不是骗子就是傻瓜。
She's one of two things... Either a charlatan or a fool.

475
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:25,016
至于第一个，我不能回答，因为我不知道这个词的意思，如果我是一个傻瓜，上帝至少不会反对我。
As for the first, I can't answer for I don't know what the word means, If I'm a fool, God at least does not held it against me.

476
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:31,522
琼:我向你保证，只要你不试图发号施令，我们就会相处得很好。
Joan I promise you, that so long as you don't try to give any commands, we shall all get along well.

477
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:35,186
哦，我不打算发号施令。我不知道该下什么命令。
Oh, I shall not try to give any commands. I wouldn't know what commands to give.

478
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,653
我发誓，这是我听到你说的第一个明智的话，丫头!
By the rock of Moses, that's the first sensible word I heard you say, wench!

479
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:42,939
-你坚持这一点，上帝保佑，不会有麻烦的。-别骂人，莱尔。
- You stick to that and by the thunders of God there will be no trouble. - Don't swear, Laire.

480
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:44,213
不发誓?
Don't swear?

481
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:49,221
-现在，在黑岩…这军队中，无论贵贱，都不可起誓。
- Now, by the black rock of... - There must be no swearing in this army among high or low.

482
00:47:49,224 --> 00:47:51,224
你想把军队打昏吗?
Do you want to strike the army dumb?

483
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:54,831
-这必须从你开始。-你说过你不会下命令的，琼。
- This must begin with you. - You said you would give no order, Joan.

484
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:57,482
但这不是军事命令，长官。
Oh, but this is not a military order, sir.

485
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,516
你一定看到了。
Surely you must see that.

486
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:05,628
但是向奥尔良进军的军队是为神圣的事业而成立的。
But the army that is to march on Orleans was raised in a holy cause.

487
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:09,959
我今天看到了男人，其中有女人，她们喝酒，骂人。
I saw the men today, there were women among them, they drank and swore.

488
00:48:10,036 --> 00:48:14,836
这些事必须停止，在我们出发之前，每个人都必须去忏悔。
These things must cease and every man must go to confession before we march.

489
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,839
-在神面前…-别骂人，莱尔。
- Before God... - Don't swear, Laire.

490
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:21,464
但如果你必须这么做，请向我的员工发誓。
But if you must, swear by my staff.

491
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:24,741
我的员工?这算什么誓言啊?
By my staff? What kind of an oath is that?

492
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:26,822
没有军队被派去忏悔。
No army was ever sent to confession.

493
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,270
如果我们下这样的命令，我们会被嘲笑的。
If we gave such orders, we'll be laughed at.

494
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:34,958
——我不会下这样的命令!-或者我们中的任何一个，你可以肯定。
- I shall give no such command! - Or any of us, you may be sure of that.

495
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,409
以拉撒路的疮起誓!
By the sores of Lazarus!

496
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:59,821
哪个国家的领导人会和一个绿色的乡下女孩坐在一起?
What war have it's leaders had to sit in council with a green country girl?

497
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:01,951
让我们这个愚蠢的王子染上瘟疫。
A pox on this silly Dauphin of ours.

498
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,670
当他是个懦夫的时候就够糟糕了。现在他派孩子来领导我们。
Bad enough when he was a plain coward. Now he sends children to lead us.

499
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,443
她不是来领导我们的，你这头牛。
She's not to lead us, you great ox.

500
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:16,575
她骑在我们的前面，作为一种象征，一个象征性的领袖，让士兵们团结在一起。-不，我爱珍妮丝和他所有的禁卫军，她不会让我团结起来的。
She's to ride before us as a sort of symbol, a figurehead - for the soldiers to rally around. - No by the love of Janice and all his 2 face Janissaries, she will not rally me around.

501
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:21,992
我不指望她能在战斗中帮上什么忙-不过我还是很感激她。——为了什么?
I don't expect she'll be of much help in battle, - Nevertheless I'm grateful to her. - For what?

502
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:24,722
谢谢你再给我们一次机会。
For giving us another chance.

503
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:29,246
肯定有别的办法可以给整支军队下命令。
There must be some other way to give an order to a whole army.

504
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,418
这是我认识的唯一一个人，琼，你通过上尉们下达了一个总令，他们拒绝了你。
It's the only one that I know Joan, you gave a general order through the captains, and they refused you.

505
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:35,642
但是我怎么告诉他们呢?我该怎么做呢?
But how can I tell them? How can I do this?

506
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:37,066
我不知道…我实在不喜欢。
I don't know...truly I don't.

507
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,290
帕斯科神父，我该怎么办?
Father Pascur, what am I to do?

508
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:42,975
我希望我能帮上忙，因为我知道你是对的，但我不知道该怎么做。
I wish I could help for I know you are right, but I don't see how it can be done.

509
00:49:57,576 --> 00:49:59,675
你经常玩这个游戏吗?
Do you play this game often?

510
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,282
每天，每天。
Every day all day.

511
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:03,553
这就是全部。
That takes it all.

512
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:07,643
从现在起，没有多少时间玩游戏了。
From now on there won't be much time for games.

513
00:50:09,669 --> 00:50:11,469
-是女仆。——女仆。
- It's the maid. - The maid.

514
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:15,774
——女仆……我们要追随的人。-我们能做点什么吗?
- The maid... the one we follow. - Is it something we can do perhaps?

515
00:50:15,794 --> 00:50:18,794
是的。拿起你的骰子。
Yes. Pick up your dice for a moment.

516
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
拿起你的骰子，朋友。
Pick up your dice, my friend.

517
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:26,359
他们告诉我军队是这样的，所有的军队都是这样的，没有什么能改变他们。
They tell me that armies are like this, that all armies are like this and that there is no changing them.

518
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,160
然而我们不能胜利，我们不配胜利。
Yet we cannot have victory we are not worthy of it.

519
00:50:29,248 --> 00:50:31,748
但我们来这里是因为你承诺胜利。
But we came here because you promised victory.

520
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:39,288
神召我们去做我们所要做的工作，这是真的，但是神站在我们一边是不够的，我们必须站在他一边。
It is true that God has called us to the work we are to do, but it is not enough that God is on our side, we must be on his side.

521
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,582
我们该怎么办，女仆?
What are we to do, maid?

522
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,839
不许赌博。
There must be no gambling.

523
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:46,529
——没有赌博?-不，即使是秘密的。
- No gambling? - No, not even in secret.

524
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:49,204
你也不能妄称上帝的名起誓。
And you must not swear and take God's name in vain.

525
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,449
-那是什么?-女仆说不许发誓。
- What was that? - No swearing the maid said.

526
00:50:54,088 --> 00:50:55,688
你必须赶走你所有的女人。
And you must send away all your women.

527
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:57,782
——什么?那是什么?——没有女人。
- What? What's that? - No women.

528
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,867
-营地里不能有追随者。-她指的是我们。
- There must be no camp followers. - She means us.

529
00:51:00,942 --> 00:51:05,942
在我们出发之前每个人都必须去忏悔并清除灵魂中所有的罪恶。
And before we march each man must go to confession and clear his soul of all evil he has done.

530
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,543
她把我们当什么了?和尚吗?
What does she thinks we are? Monks?

531
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,752
-安静，救世主!-让她说!
- Be quiet, Savion! - Let her speak!

532
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,623
请听我说。
Please hear me.

533
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,721
越多越好。
As many as can.

534
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:18,705
你看，我已经没有力量了。
You see, there is no strength in me.

535
00:51:18,763 --> 00:51:21,763
我的手也没有力气。
And no strength in my hands.

536
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:27,150
我们没有任何力量足以打败英格兰人。
There is no strength in any of our hands great enough to win against the English.

537
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:30,216
我们的力量在于我们的信念。
Our strength is in our faith.

538
00:51:30,272 --> 00:51:40,357
如果我们的信心被神所恨的一点小事腐蚀了，那么，即使我们有一百万人，我们也必被打败而死。
And if our faith is eaten away by little things that God hates then, though there be a million of us, we shall be beaten back and die.

539
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,897
是的,靠近!
Yes, come near!

540
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,482
还有你们男人!
And you men too!

541
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:48,778
还有那些听不见的人!给他们这个消息!
And those who cannot hear! Give them this message!

542
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:54,253
只有当我们成为上帝的军队，我们才能获胜。
We can win only if we become God's army.

543
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:59,831
站在你们面前，向你们提出这个要求并不容易。
It is not easy to stand here before you, and ask this of you.

544
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:02,602
也许这并不容易做到。
Perhaps it will not be easy to do.

545
00:52:02,725 --> 00:52:13,568
但我知道，如果这些事情都做到了那么即使英国人悬在云端坐上了旋风，我们也能打败他们。
But I know that if these things are done then though the English hang from the clouds and ride on the whirlwind, we shall beat them.

546
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:25,088
尽管他们的箭如冰雹从天而降，他们的矛如铁环，他们的大炮如天上的雷雨般说话和打击，但他们终究是我们的!
Though their arrows fall like hail from the sky and their spears be a ring of steel and their cannons speak and strike like the thunderstorm from heaven, yet they shall be ours!

547
00:52:25,404 --> 00:52:29,163
为此，神已经应许。
For this, God has promised.

548
00:52:29,832 --> 00:52:33,332
我们在天上的父是我们的领袖。
Our father who is in heaven is our leader.

549
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:37,647
我们尊崇他名的时候，他必与我们同在。
He will be with us, while we hallow his name.

550
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:40,291
他会给我们所需要的一切。
He will give us all we need.

551
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:47,232
我们每天的食物，我们的胜利和这片永远自由的土地。
Our daily bread, our victory and the land that is forever free.

552
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:24,188
如果那是奥尔良，我们为什么在河的这一边?
Why are we on this side of the river if that is Orleans?

553
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,370
你是奉杜努瓦之命而来的。
You've come this way by order of Dunois.

554
00:53:26,418 --> 00:53:28,618
-奥尔良的杂种。-他在这里发号施令?
- Bastard of Orleans. - He commands here?

555
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:33,907
是的,女孩。一定是他骑马出来欢迎你了。
Yes, girl. That must be he riding out to welcome you.

556
00:53:49,962 --> 00:53:51,962
Dunois——问候。-你好，大人。
- Greetings Dunois. - Greetings, my Lord.

557
00:53:52,087 --> 00:53:54,087
我真诚地欢迎你们，我的朋友们。
You're most heartedly welcomed, my friends.

558
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:57,046
你把女仆带来了，就更重要了。
More so since you bring the maid with you.

559
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:03,794
如果那是奥尔良城，你为什么命令我们从河的这一边过来?
If that is the city of Orleans, why did you command that we approach by this side of the river?

560
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:06,218
我们应该勇敢地奔向英国人最强大的地方。
We should have ridden up boldly where the English are strongest.

561
00:54:06,442 --> 00:54:08,442
那你就在河的右边了，姑娘。
Then you are on the right side of the river, maid.

562
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,666
你看到那些塔了吗?
You see those towers?

563
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,690
那是托勒勒斯，英国最坚固的堡垒。
That's The Tourelles, the strongest English fort.

564
00:54:13,014 --> 00:54:15,014
我们拿下它，其他堡垒就会土崩瓦解。
We take it, the other forts will crumble.

565
00:54:15,038 --> 00:54:16,638
谁指挥着Les Tourelles?
Who commands over Les Tourelles?

566
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:17,862
威廉爵士Glasdale。
Sir William Glasdale.

567
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:21,410
他是英格兰队长中的精英，我跟他打过很多次。
He's the pick of the English captains, I've fought him many times.

568
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:28,182
我奉命警告这个英国人，放弃要塞，拯救他和他手下的生命。
I'm commanded to warn this Englishman, to give up the fort, and to save his life and the lives of his men.

569
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:30,106
带我去见他!
Take me to him!

570
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:41,830
威廉爵士Glasdale !
Sir William Glasdale!

571
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,954
威廉爵士Glasdale !
Sir William Glasdale!

572
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:53,478
我是威廉·格拉斯代尔爵士。
I am Sir William Glasdale.

573
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:54,702
你是谁?
Who are you?

574
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:56,725
我是琼，女仆。
I am Joan, the maid.

575
00:54:57,749 --> 00:55:11,669
威廉·格拉斯代尔爵士，还有你们英国人，你们没有权利进入我们的法国，天堂之王派我来通知你们，放弃你们的堡垒，回到你们自己的国家去，哈!
Sir William Glasdale, and you men of England, who have no right to be in our France, The King of Heaven sends you word by me, to abandon your forts and go back to your own country, Hah!

576
00:55:11,693 --> 00:55:18,941
如果你们不这样做，我将在你们中间树立一个崇高的，崇高的，将被永远铭记。
And if you do not do so I shall make such a high, high among you, as will be eternally remembered.

577
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:26,013
我来告诉你这些，以免你在一场注定失败的战争中死去。
I come to tell you this, lest you perish in a lost cause, in an evil war.

578
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:34,909
你真是太慷慨了，但我想提醒你两件事，第一，我们将赢得这场战争，第二，如果有邪恶的原因，那也是你自己的。
This is most generous of you, but I wish to remind you of two things, First, we are winning this war, Second, if there is an evil cause, it is your own.

579
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,333
杜努瓦，听着，魔鬼站在你这边。
Dunois, now hear, you have the devil on your side.

580
00:55:38,757 --> 00:55:40,757
上帝保佑我们!
We have God on ours!

581
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:45,705
我告诉你，威廉爵士，我想是为了你，也是为了那些将要死去的人!
I tell you Sir William it is of you I think, and of the many men who will die!

582
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:49,253
如果你不听我的警告，现在就投降!
if you do not heed my warning and surrender now!

583
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:54,101
我从不害怕巫术，我也不会听一个妓女的警告!
I have never feared sorcery, and I'll take no warning from a harlot!

584
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:01,924
我对你是好意。
I meant only well to you.

585
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:09,273
把她从弓上拿开混蛋，否则这些弓箭手会用箭射穿你漂亮的女仆，破坏她的乐趣!
Take her out of bow shot Bastard, or one of these archers may put a shaft through your pretty maid and spoil her fun!

586
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:11,597
琼。
Come Joan.

587
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:15,921
盐牛!常见的“内在!
Salt cow! Common 'orn!

588
00:56:15,945 --> 00:56:17,945
和你来时的路一样普通。
Common as the road by which you came.

589
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:22,469
Sapphist !妓女!女巫!撒旦的眼睛!
Sapphist! Strumpet! Witch! Eye of Satan!

590
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,141
时间到了。
This is the hour.

591
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,670
现在是时候了。
Now is the time.

592
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:33,179
以上帝的名义，打击!罢工大胆!
In God's name, strike! Strike boldly!

593
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,500
前进!
Forward!

594
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:41,387
——火!——火!
- Fire! - Fire!

595
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,429
——前进!——火!
- Forward! - Fire!

596
00:57:43,986 --> 00:57:45,386
火!火!
Fire! Fire!

597
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:52,884
前进!人缝!让那些行!
Forward! Man the slits! Get those cannoneers!

598
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:56,523
火弹弩!
Fire the catapults!

599
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,210
火!
Fire!

600
00:58:09,372 --> 00:58:11,572
快点拿炮盾!
Hurry with the mantlets!

601
00:58:28,284 --> 00:58:29,784
追随白旗!
Follow the white banner!

602
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,238
前进!为了上帝和我们的国家，前进吧!
Forward! For God and our country, forward!

603
00:58:39,008 --> 00:58:40,008
跟着旗帜!
Follow the banner!

604
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:44,069
主啊，神与你们众人同在!所有人!
God is with you all, Lords! All!

605
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:48,814
火!
Fire!

606
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,458
突破墙壁!密切与他们!
Break through the walls! Close with them!

607
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,794
以上帝的名义，前进!
In God's name, forward!

608
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,097
女巫，女巫!
The witch, the witch!

609
00:59:25,905 --> 00:59:27,775
呆在那里,懦夫!
Stay there, coward!

610
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:42,095
前进，我的朋友们，前进!
Forward, my friends, forward!

611
00:59:59,926 --> 01:00:01,287
起来,结束了!
Up and over!

612
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,188
法国!法国!上帝是你的保护者!
France! France! God is your protector!

613
01:00:19,793 --> 01:00:21,827
前进!前进!
Forward! Forward!

614
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:36,613
勇敢的人，好士兵，快点!
Brave men, good soldiers, hurry!

615
01:00:38,344 --> 01:00:39,544
在墙上!
On the walls!

616
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:41,366
弓箭手!
Archer!

617
01:00:42,148 --> 01:00:46,725
快男人!总之，到城墙上去!
Hurry men! Altogether, to the walls!

618
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,878
我打了女巫!她倒下了，她倒下了!
I hit the witch! She's down, she's down!

619
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,110
她倒下了，女巫倒下了!
She's down, the witch is down!

620
01:00:58,183 --> 01:01:02,183
胜利，英格兰赢了!
Victory, England has won!

621
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:30,263
必须说出来，琼。
It must come out, Joan.

622
01:01:42,123 --> 01:01:47,682
拿着我的护身符，女仆。它会驱散你的痛苦。
Hold my amulet, maid. It will conjure away your pain.

623
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:52,953
谢谢你，我的朋友。不,不,谢谢。
Thank you, my friend. No, no thanks.

624
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,570
我宁死也不愿使用魔法。
I'd rather die than use sorcery.

625
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:00,153
我要用油清洗你的伤口，再用猪油包扎一下。
I'll cleanse your wound with oil and dress it with lard.

626
01:02:01,378 --> 01:02:02,378
我绑定。
Bind me.

627
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:08,106
而我躺在这里……一段时间。
And I lie here... for a while.

628
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:30,134
帕斯克雷尔神父，你听到了吗。
Father Pasquerel, do you hear.

629
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:34,312
-图勒勒斯陷落了。——不,琼。这是回忆的笔记。
- The Tourelles has fallen. - No, Joan. That's the note for recall.

630
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:36,904
我们接到撤退的命令。
We've been ordered to retreat.

631
01:02:40,668 --> 01:02:43,668
帮我系上挽具。-孩子，你受伤了。
- Help me to my harness. - Child, you are wounded.

632
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,802
我感觉不到。
I don't feel it.

633
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:56,487
不!不，法国人!不要放弃!
No! No, men of France! Do not give up!

634
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:59,821
勇敢的人们，不要后退!
Courage men, do not fallback!

635
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:02,917
莱尔，杜诺瓦，Alençon，回头!
Laire, Dunois, Alençon, turn back!

636
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:05,429
朋友们，跟我来。我们不能放弃。
Friends, come with me. We must not give up.

637
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:08,439
我们今天已经尽力了，琼，我们的人都累坏了。
We've done all we can this day, Joan, our men are exhausted.

638
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:11,899
英国人也同样疲惫不堪。-我们举行了一次会议，决定撤退。
- The English are just as exhausted. - We held a council and decided to retreat.

639
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:14,466
你有你的委员会，我有我的。
You've been with your council and I've been with mine.

640
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:18,773
我告诉你，我们主的议会比你们的更好更强。
And I say to you, the council of our Lord is better and stronger than yours.

641
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,160
-我们只要继续前进，堡垒就是我们的了!-如果她想进攻，我们就进攻。
- We need only to go forward and the fort is ours! - If she wants to attack, we attack.

642
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:28,328
当我的旗帜触墙时，我们就会胜利!-吹响号角，前进的战士们!
When my banner touches the wall - we shall have victory! - Sound the trumpets, forward men!

643
01:03:28,377 --> 01:03:31,777
前进!跟着旗帜!
Forward! Follow the banner!

644
01:03:34,668 --> 01:03:35,361
你的脚!
On your feet!

645
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:38,470
不要放弃!
Do not give up!

646
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,400
为了法国的荣耀!
For the glory of France!

647
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,442
墙上!墙上!
To the walls! To the walls!

648
01:03:56,935 --> 01:04:00,359
法国人，法国人!没有回头路了!
French men, French men! There is no turning back!

649
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:03,910
我们会胜利的，这是上帝的旨意!
We shall have victory, God wills it!

650
01:04:08,104 --> 01:04:09,500
-上墙!-上墙!
- To the walls! - To the walls!

651
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:34,317
规模梯子!
Scale the ladder!

652
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:50,841
法国、超越!
France, rise above!

653
01:05:04,078 --> 01:05:05,374
敌人去死吧!
Death to the enemy!

654
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:17,198
前进，伙计们，这就是胜利!
Forward men, this is the victory!

655
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,090
抵制!
Resist!

656
01:05:34,738 --> 01:05:37,627
勇敢地进入，胜利将属于我们!
Enter boldly, victory shall be ours!

657
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:49,612
上帝说屈服!上帝说屈服!
God say yield! God say yield!

658
01:05:49,656 --> 01:05:54,721
上帝说屈服!屈服来赎回你的生命!
God say yield! Yield to redeem your life!

659
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,900
神说，你要屈服，救赎你的生命!
God say yield to redeem your life!

660
01:05:59,011 --> 01:06:02,411
我永远不会向你屈服，女巫!
I'll never yield to you, sorceress witch!

661
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:07,275
你说我是妓女，但我很同情你和你男人的灵魂!
You call me harlot, but I have great pity on your soul and the souls of your men!

662
01:06:07,574 --> 01:06:10,174
屈服于天上的王吧!
Yield to the King of heaven!

663
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:14,903
我说永远!不是对你，来自地狱的恶魔!
I say never! Not to you, fiend from hell!

664
01:06:14,913 --> 01:06:16,413
不,不!
No, no!

665
01:06:16,925 --> 01:06:18,525
在地狱中燃烧!
Burn in hell!

666
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:35,368
被火烧死是件可怕的事。
Death by fire is a horrible thing.

667
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:16,250
琼!琼，我们一直在找你。
Joan! Joan, we've been looking for you.

668
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:21,011
你为什么哭?
Why are you crying?

669
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:26,235
因为他们死了……可怕死了!
Because they're dead...horribly dead!

670
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:31,183
是我杀了……杀了谁?
It was I who killed... Killed who?

671
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,207
所有这些人。
All these men.

672
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,055
你在为英国人哭泣吗?
Are you crying about the English?

673
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:45,609
我并不憎恨英国人。
I have no hatred for the English.

674
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:50,209
我大胆而大声地说话，好让你们跟着我，
I spoke bold and loud so that you would follow me,

675
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:55,909
我认为胜利是美好的。
I thought victory would be beautiful.

676
01:07:55,944 --> 01:08:01,744
-看看这个丑陋而血腥的东西。-为什么没有比这更美好的胜利了?
- Look at this so ugly and bloody. - Why there was never a more beautiful victory than this.

677
01:08:01,905 --> 01:08:05,005
这是你们的胜利。整个城市都在等着接见你。
And it's your victory. The whole city is waiting to receive you.

678
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:08,372
-你必须带领军队穿过街道。——不!
- You must lead the army through the streets. - No!

679
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:12,396
不!我的灵魂沾着鲜血，我不会…
No! This blood is on my soul and I won't spend...

680
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,244
琼，你对奥尔良城和法国人民有信心。他们想见你。
Joan, you have given faith to the city of Orleans and the people of France. They want to see you.

681
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:24,392
我…来了。
I... Come.

682
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:27,016
圣女贞德。
Maid of Orleans.

683
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,140
你敢碰我的孩子吗?
Won't you touch my child!?

684
01:08:48,564 --> 01:08:50,563
你的触碰比我的好!
Your touch is better than mine!

685
01:08:52,787 --> 01:08:54,287
在巴黎!
On to Paris!

686
01:08:55,211 --> 01:09:03,907
耶稣玛丽亚…我，琼，女仆，尽我所能地恳求您，结束我们之间的这场战争。
Jesus Maria... great and honoured prince, Duke of Burgundy I, Joan the maid, beg you as humbly as I can, to put an end to this war between us.

687
01:09:04,131 --> 01:09:08,336
因为你们的勃艮第是法国的一部分，不应该站在英国一边打仗。
for your Burgundy is part of France, and should not fight on the English side.

688
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,336
那就让我们拥有一个美好而坚定的和平吧。
Let us then have a good, firm peace.

689
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:17,608
为了批准这份和平协议，我敦促你参加在兰斯大教堂举行的查理七世加冕典礼。
And to ratify that peace, I urge you to attend the coronation of Charles the 7th in the cathedral of Rheims.

690
01:09:17,632 --> 01:09:22,632
来吧，在神圣的…你的皇室堂兄。
Come and take your rightful place at the consecration of...of your royal cousin.

691
01:09:22,856 --> 01:09:24,956
愿上帝让我们永远成为朋友。
And may God keep us ever friends.

692
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:32,004
写在兰斯的地方，公元1429年七月十五日。
Written in the said place of Rheims, the 15th day of July in the year of our Lord 1,429.

693
01:09:32,228 --> 01:09:34,228
-她对你赞不绝口!——非常讨人喜欢。
- She speaks well of you! - Very flattering.

694
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:36,052
她以平等的身份称呼我!
She addresses me as an equal!

695
01:09:36,076 --> 01:09:41,300
她一直在打败你，而且我得说她打败了我手下最好的英格兰队长。
Well, she's been taking towns from you consistently, and I must say she's defeated the best of my English captains.

696
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,124
巫术!魅力!
By sorcery!  By enchantment!

697
01:09:43,537 --> 01:09:45,737
我们的士兵看到她的旗帜就跑开了。
Our soldiers see her banner and run away.

698
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:49,957
她的胜利将成为历史上最可耻的一段插曲。
Her victories will be remembered as the most shameful episode of history.

699
01:09:50,043 --> 01:09:51,743
我很同意你的看法。
I quite agree with you.

700
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:59,676
强大的英格兰和勃艮第，基督教世界最富有的王子，被一个乡下姑娘打败了。
Mighty England and great Burgundy, the richest prince in Christendom, beaten by a green country girl.

701
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:06,376
大人，你是来向我寻求帮助和建议的吗?我想说:想一想，公爵。
My Lord, did you come to me for aid and advice, I have this to say: Think, Duke.

702
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:11,970
在你拒绝女仆和她的邀请去参加你亲爱的表妹的加冕典礼之前，请三思。
Think carefully before you reject the maid and her invitation to the coronation of your dear cousin.

703
01:10:12,052 --> 01:10:15,052
现在不是开玩笑的时候，卢森堡伯爵。
This no moment for jesting, Count of Luxembourg.

704
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,640
而且没有主题。
And no subject for it.

705
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:23,721
事实是明天在兰斯大教堂女仆将为她的舞蹈老师，法国国王太子加冕。
The fact remains that tomorrow in the Cathedral of Rheims the maid will crown her dancing master, the Dauphin, King of France.

706
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:26,459
她获胜了，到目前为止还没有犯任何错误。
She's victorious and she has made no mistakes so far.

707
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:32,899
如果她决定向巴黎进军，毫无疑问她会的，巴黎将会沦陷……我们会下降。
If she decides to march on Paris, and no doubt she will, Paris will be lost... and we'll fall.

708
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:36,139
这是勃艮第历史上的一个重大时刻。
This is a grave moment in the history of Burgundy.

709
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,440
-还有英格兰。-还有教会。
- And of England. - And of the church.

710
01:10:39,504 --> 01:10:43,704
我们不得不对付许多异教徒，但没有一个比这个更危险。
We had to deal with many heretics, but none as dangerous as this one.

711
01:10:43,799 --> 01:10:45,199
那个女仆是个异教徒?
The maid a heretic?

712
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:49,868
我想教堂已经检查过她了，发现她善良、虔诚，毫发无损。
I thought the church had examined her and found her good, pious and untouched.

713
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:54,713
如果当时我是普瓦捷的法官，我可以向你保证，结果会完全不同。
If I had sat as judge at Poitiers, I can assure you the verdict would have been different.

714
01:10:54,748 --> 01:10:57,648
毕夏普伯爵你对女仆的仇恨是有道理的。
Count Bishop your hatred for the maid is justified.

715
01:10:57,659 --> 01:11:03,415
如果她提前一小时把我赶出城堡，我会骂她更难听的话。异教徒。
Had she chased me from my castle at an hour's notice I would have called her much worst names... than a heretic.

716
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,220
也许我们很幸运，她现在就在这里。
It may be luck for us that she's exactly where she is.

717
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,040
——运气吗?-她就要犯第一个错误了。
- Luck? - She's about to make her first error.

718
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:14,912
明天她将为查尔斯加冕。她应该把王冠戴在自己头上。
Tomorrow she will crown Charles. She should set the crown on her own head.

719
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:18,483
查尔斯是个傻瓜，卑鄙小人，无赖。他以前出卖过我们。
Charles is a fool, a gull, a knave. He sold out to us before.

720
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,365
-他可能会再做一次。-你要给他钱?
- He may do it again. - You'd offer him money?

721
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:22,958
不是我,你。休战。
Not I, you. For a truce.

722
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:28,624
一百年来法国第一次取得了胜利，凭什么查理要和我们休战?
For first time in a 100 years France is victorious, Why in heaven's name should Charles grant us a truce?

723
01:11:28,641 --> 01:11:32,441
在他面前摆黄金，他可能会拿走，他一直都是。
Dangle gold in front of him and he might take it, he always has.

724
01:11:32,508 --> 01:11:34,208
Trémouille像往常一样和他在一起。
Trémouille is with him as usual.

725
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:36,106
而Trémouille会卖任何东西。
And Trémouille would sell anything.

726
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:46,799
好吧，亲爱的考雄，既然这是我们唯一的机会，也是最后的机会，你必须马上派人去兰斯，开出很高的价格，十万金克朗。
Right my dear Cauchon, and since it's our only chance and our last, you must send a messenger to Rheims at once, and put the offer very high, say 100,000 gold crowns.

727
01:11:47,023 --> 01:11:49,922
如果我们达成停战协议，我们就有时间保卫巴黎。
If we get the truce, we'll have time to fortify Paris.

728
01:11:50,246 --> 01:11:52,246
你说得对，贝德福德公爵。
You are right, Duke of Bedford.

729
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,270
女仆的第一个错误。
The maid's first error.

730
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,974
她应该把王冠戴在自己头上。
She should place the crown on her own head.

731
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:03,598
当真正的加冕礼到来时，会有一个像这样的小垫子。
When it comes to the actual coronation, there will be a little cushion like this one.

732
01:12:03,922 --> 01:12:06,946
你跪在上面，我给你涂油。
You'll kneel on it, and I will anoint you.

733
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,970
-人民会怎样?——人?
- And which way will the people be? - People?

734
01:12:09,294 --> 01:12:10,994
是的，我亲爱的臣民。
Yes, my dear subjects.

735
01:12:11,018 --> 01:12:12,518
那些纳税的人。
Those who pay the taxes.

736
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:13,542
这样的。
That way.

737
01:12:13,566 --> 01:12:15,566
好吧，我想我会跪着，脸对着他们多一点。
Well, I think that I'll kneel with my face a little more toward them.

738
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:19,514
并不是说我太看重自己的脸，而是说，我毕竟是他们的国王，他们最好习惯这一点。
not that I think too well of my face, but after all, I am their King and they may as well get used to it.

739
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:23,762
哦，进来吧，亲爱的Trémouille我们正在排练我的加冕仪式。
Oh, come in my dear Trémouille we were just rehearsing the ritual of my coronation.

740
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:26,786
那么今天加冕的就是你了?
Oh, then it is you who is to be crowned today?

741
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,510
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

742
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:32,334
骑着马穿过拥挤的街道，你会觉得这是女仆的加冕礼。
Riding through the crowded streets, one gets the impression that this is the maid's coronation.

743
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:37,606
那是因为她是一个非常漂亮的女孩，穿着盔甲，令人兴奋，而且她做了非凡的事情。
That's because she is a very pretty girl in armour and exciting to look at, and she has done extraordinary things.

744
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,030
哦!非常高贵的!最皇家!
Oh!  Very Kingly! Most Royal!

745
01:12:40,454 --> 01:12:48,401
查尔斯，你可以在公开场合穿这件衣服但私下里你得意识到这个女孩野心勃勃又不择手段，如果战争继续她的军队占据上风，
Put that on in public Charles but in private it's high time that you realize that this girl is both ambitious and unscrupulous, and if the war goes on and her military party keeps the ascendant,

746
01:12:48,425 --> 01:12:51,425
她，而不是你，将统治法国，不管你是否加冕。
she, not you, will rule in France whether you're crowned or not.

747
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:54,449
如果你是一扇窗，我亲爱的公爵，要看透你再容易不过了。
If you were a window, my dear Duke, you couldn't be easier to see through.

748
01:12:54,673 --> 01:12:58,673
这女孩是我身边唯一一个不追求权力和金钱的人，包括你!
This girl is the only person around me who isn't after power and money, including you!

749
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:01,297
她所做的一切，都是为了我和法国。
Everything she's done, she's done for me and for France.

750
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:02,621
她很聪明。
She's very clever.

751
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,545
她知道她得先赢你!
She knows she has to win you first!

752
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:08,293
但说到权力，她现在的权力比你我和勃艮第加起来还大。
But as for power, she has more power now than you and I and Burgundy put together.

753
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,217
整个国家都支持她!
The whole country's behind her!

754
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:13,865
好吧，如果你想这么说的话…你在想什么，Trémouille?
Well, if you want to put it that way... What's on your mind, Trémouille?

755
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,189
我只是为你担心而已。
I fear for you that's all.

756
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:18,513
为你自己，而且有充分的理由。
And for yourself and with very good reason.

757
01:13:18,737 --> 01:13:21,737
如果你的最高愿望是再一次跪着练习。
If your highest wishes to practise kneeling just once more.

758
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:23,061
是的,我喜欢。
Yes, I do.

759
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:30,274
好吧，大人，我把使者打发走。
Very well my Lord, I'll send the messenger away.

760
01:13:30,512 --> 01:13:33,012
——信使?信使是什么?——为什么勃艮第。
- Messenger? What messenger? - Why Burgundy's.

761
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:37,700
-他是来求休战的——停战?真是一派胡言。
- He's here begging for a truce. - Truce? What nonsense.

762
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:43,508
-他们会付多少钱?-五万克朗，如果你下令停止战斗。
- How much will they pay? - 50,000 crowns if you give the order to stop fighting.

763
01:13:43,698 --> 01:13:47,697
-你能拿到多少?——我?我…我与此事无关。
- And how much do you get? - I? I... I've nothing to do with it.

764
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:51,754
你通常的份额是一半，我亲爱的鳄鱼，而且你没变。
Your usual share is half, my loving crocodile and you haven't changed.

765
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:55,212
我想要你的那份。给我十万。
I want your share. I want 100,000 in my hands.

766
01:13:55,436 --> 01:13:57,836
我都不确定我是否会接受。
And I'm not even sure that I'll take it.

767
01:13:58,486 --> 01:14:00,086
我该怎么跟他说呢?
What shall I tell him?

768
01:14:01,164 --> 01:14:03,364
你告诉他等一下，我们不急。
You tell him to wait, we are in no hurry.

769
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:08,149
很好，大人。
Very well, my Lord.

770
01:14:12,173 --> 01:14:16,597
查尔斯!在这个生死攸关的时刻，你怎么能想到钱呢?
Charles! How can you think of money at this fateful and serious moment?

771
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:18,921
我不知道。但我毫不费力就能做到。
I don't know. But I can without the slightest effort.

772
01:14:19,245 --> 01:14:22,169
原谅我，亲爱的大主教，但你必须了解政府。
Forgive me, my dear Archbishop, but you must know about governments.

773
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:28,541
我已经说过，我再次说，这场战争是不必要的流血，我们越早结束越好。
I have said and I say again that this war is unnecessary bloodshed, and the sooner we end it, the better.

774
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:30,565
要是我知道该怎么做就好了。
If only I knew what to do.

775
01:14:31,389 --> 01:14:36,213
如果琼继续，她可能会把我亲爱的勃艮第表妹赶出这个国家，这也许是最好的事情。
Joan might drive my dear cousin Burgundy right out of the country if she continues, and that might be the best thing.

776
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:40,761
很难知道什么是最好的东西。
It's so difficult to know what "is", the best thing.

777
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:46,809
等我当上国王，我就知道了。
When I'm king, then I'll know.

778
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:35,599
陛下，这是我们为之奋斗和等待的一天，它来了。
Sire, this is the day we fought for and waited for and it has come.

779
01:19:35,932 --> 01:19:44,390
我和任何凡人一样高兴，因为我目睹了我的国王的加冕礼和涂油仪式。
I'm as happy as any mortal has ever been, for I've watched the anointing and the coronation of my King.

780
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:48,447
——万岁!-国王万岁!
- Hurray! - Long live the King!

781
01:19:48,934 --> 01:19:53,934
国王万岁!国王万岁!
Long live the King! Long live the King!

782
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,390
琼女仆!
Joan the Maid!

783
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:15,010
琼女仆!在巴黎!
Joan the maid! On to Paris!

784
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,520
我去更衣室见送信的。
I'll see the messenger in the robing room.

785
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,399
-哦，他们没有接触，没有接触。-他们接吻了，接吻了。
- Oh, they didn't touch, they didn't touch. - They kissed, they kissed.

786
01:20:40,486 --> 01:20:42,286
就像我现在吻你一样。
Just as I kiss you now.

787
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,159
——陛下……-只是我们的接吻是完全不同的事情，不是吗，亲爱的?
- Your Majesty... - Only our kissing is a very different matter isn't it, my dear?

788
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:47,984
-哦，陛下，您一定要小心。-不，那是你的责任。
- Oh, your Majesty, you must take care. - No, that's your part to take care.

789
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:50,439
我的信念是勇敢、粗心、不计后果。
Mine is to be bold, careless and reckless.

790
01:20:50,674 --> 01:20:52,874
去我想去的地方，去我想去的地方。
To enter where I will and depart when I choose.

791
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:58,226
看，世界是我的。看看你，现在这里是真正的宫廷我是一个不容小觑的国王。
For look, the world is mine. Look about you, this is a real court now and I'm a King to be reckoned with.

792
01:20:58,276 --> 01:21:00,676
很可爱，茉莉花的香味。
It is lovely, the scent of jasmine.

793
01:21:00,678 --> 01:21:02,178
我可以永远待在萨利。
I could stay here in Sully forever.

794
01:21:02,389 --> 01:21:08,425
是的，下个星期我们必须去洛契斯参加宴会-再下个星期去布洛瓦。-这些邀请好像没完没了。
Yes, well next week we must go to Loches to be feasted, - And the week after that to Blois. - There seems to be no end to these invitations.

795
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:10,050
致敬!
And to the tributes!

796
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:13,431
看到了吗?
See?

797
01:21:14,248 --> 01:21:20,248
作为参考，你还记得希侬的那个小裁缝吗他连一件新外套都不相信我?
And for the reference, do you remember that little tailor at Chinon who wouldn't trust me for a new coat?

798
01:21:20,665 --> 01:21:24,965
现在…不，那只秃鹰又来了。
Now... Nay, here comes that vulture again.

799
01:21:25,023 --> 01:21:27,823
那么Trémouille，你是来给我带钱的吗?或者把它带走?
Well Trémouille, do you come to bring me money? Or to take it away with you?

800
01:21:27,857 --> 01:21:30,457
陛下，这件事比钱重要得多。
Your Majesty, this is a much more important matter than money.

801
01:21:30,692 --> 01:21:35,292
男人的疯狂。来，Chartille，代替我。不要作弊!
The man's mad. Here, Chartille, take my place. And don't cheat!

802
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:37,667
——她在这里。-她一个人吗?
- She's here. - Is she alone?

803
01:21:37,732 --> 01:21:39,532
不，她带来了Alençon。
No, she brought Alençon with her.

804
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:42,793
记住，陛下，这次你一定要信守诺言。
Remember Sire, it's absolutely imperative that this time you keep your word.

805
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:45,440
-我什么时候不守信用了?——昨天。
- When have I not kept my word? - Yesterday.

806
01:21:45,523 --> 01:21:47,523
那是昨天的事了。
Well, that was yesterday.

807
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,640
你好,我的朋友。
Greetings, my friends.

808
01:21:50,918 --> 01:21:54,918
琼，我们邀请你来是因为我们想死你了，我们最喜欢的主题。
Joan, we've asked you into the presence because we've missed you, our most favourite subject.

809
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:59,994
我尊贵的国王，几个星期以来我们一直在巴黎城外等待您的到来。
My noble King, for weeks we have waited outside the walls of Paris for your arrival.

810
01:22:00,027 --> 01:22:02,627
我们应该在胜利的时刻出击。
We should have struck in the hour of victory.

811
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,810
但现在还不算太晚。
But it is not too late now.

812
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:11,237
保持你的诺言。跟我们一起走，巴黎还是属于我们的。-对不起，琼，但你必须取消所有这些计划。
Keep your promise. Ride with us and - Paris shall yet be ours. - I'm sorry Joan but you've to cancel all such plans.

813
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:14,290
-我刚和勃艮第休战。——休战?
- I have just negotiated a truce with Burgundy. - A truce?

814
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:16,759
——这是疯狂。-流血太多了。
- That's madness. - It's been too much bloodshed.

815
01:22:16,946 --> 01:22:19,546
图勒勒斯被严重破坏了，我们需要和平。
The Tourelles has been terribly torn, we need peace.

816
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,501
我们的敌人需要和平，我的国王，但不是你。
Our enemies need peace, my King, but not you.

817
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:25,917
让他们回到自己的岛上，他们就能拥有一个美好而持久的和平。
Let them go home to their island and they can have a good and lasting peace.

818
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:27,861
我们现在只需要继续前进。
We only have to go forward now.

819
01:22:28,054 --> 01:22:32,654
-他们最后的堡垒就会倒塌。-我告诉你，我决定停战了。
- And their last great stronghold will fall. - I tell you I have decided upon a truce.

820
01:22:32,706 --> 01:22:34,306
我已经决定。
I have decided.

821
01:22:34,346 --> 01:22:37,248
但你不能这么做，我的国王。
But you cannot do this, my King.

822
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:41,171
这将意味着你放弃了所有的有利条件。
It would mean that you threw away all the advantages.

823
01:22:41,454 --> 01:22:44,853
为了胜利，我们付出了太多，付出了太多。
We have fought so hard and have given so much blood to win.

824
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:48,030
-陛下已经签署了休战协议。——签署了吗?
- His Majesty has signed the truce. - Signed it?

825
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:48,621
是的。
Yes.

826
01:22:48,815 --> 01:22:52,215
我们的国王从不食言。
And our King never repudiates his word.

827
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:54,241
你知道这看起来像什么吗，殿下?
You know how this looks, your Highness?

828
01:22:54,258 --> 01:22:56,758
比如背叛和愚蠢。或者两者都有!
Like betrayal or stupidity. Or both!

829
01:22:56,893 --> 01:23:00,693
我从没说过我聪明，我从没说过我诚实，我从没说过我英俊。
I never said that I was wise, I never said I was honest, I never said I was handsome.

830
01:23:00,817 --> 01:23:04,817
我不是特别适合当国王的人，但只要我是国王，我就是国王。
I'm not a particularly good person to be a King, but as long as I am a King, I will be a King.

831
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:06,583
你懂什么治国之道?
What do you know statecraft?

832
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,915
你知道国家元首必须屈尊的经验吗?
What do you know of the experience which the heads of nations must stoop?

833
01:23:10,046 --> 01:23:13,446
一个统治者必须与最低等的人妥协和讨价还价，甚至是敌人。
A ruler must compromise and bargain with the lowest sort of people, even the enemy.

834
01:23:13,566 --> 01:23:16,566
人们被腐败统治，他们喜欢这样。
Men are governed by corruption, they like it.

835
01:23:16,706 --> 01:23:18,906
人恨腐败，上帝也恨腐败。
Men hate corruption and God hates it.

836
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:22,141
我不知道，但男人很自然就会这么做。
I don't know, but men take to it very naturally.

837
01:23:28,165 --> 01:23:30,165
这是什么意思?
What does this mean?

838
01:23:30,189 --> 01:23:32,189
他背叛了我们，琼。
He's betrayed us Joan.

839
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:43,877
这不可能是真的。
It cannot be true.

840
01:23:53,934 --> 01:24:01,051
我的国王，你有没有……敌人的钱?
My King, have you taken... money from our enemies?

841
01:24:01,131 --> 01:24:06,131
这个问题不应该由国王来回答。或被要求。
That is not a question the King should answer. Or be asked.

842
01:24:07,011 --> 01:24:09,611
那你就成功了。
Then you have done it.

843
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:14,111
你背叛了我们。
You have betrayed us.

844
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:15,926
我们所有的人。
All of us.

845
01:24:17,827 --> 01:24:21,827
你的国家，甚至你自己。
Your country and even yourself.

846
01:24:22,032 --> 01:24:25,232
我会告诉法国人民你的所作所为。
I shall tell the people of France what you've done.

847
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:33,597
我讨厌战争，我不喜欢战争，每次我看到法国人在流血，我就能…我感到头发都竖起来了。
I hate war, I don't like battles, every time I see French blood flowing I can... I can feel the hair rise on my head.

848
01:24:33,825 --> 01:24:36,825
我全心全意地祈求和平。-我们是和平的。
- With all my soul I prayed for peace. - We are at peace.

849
01:24:37,097 --> 01:24:39,097
除非我们的土地自由，否则我们不会有和平。
We cannot have peace so till our land is free.

850
01:24:39,209 --> 01:24:43,808
我恰好是决定我们打什么战争，维护什么和平的人。
It happens that I am the one that decides what war we fight and what peace we keep.

851
01:24:43,993 --> 01:24:46,593
我警告你，随便你怎么休战吧。
I warn you, make any dirty truce you like.

852
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:50,238
不管是否得到批准，我们都要进军巴黎。-不，亲爱的表妹，你不能。
- We'll march on Paris with or without sanction. - No my dear cousin, you will not.

853
01:24:50,325 --> 01:24:52,325
我下令解散军队。
I ordered the dismissal of the army.

854
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:54,618
我讨厌这些穿着盔甲叮当作响的战士。
I'm sick of all these warriors clanking about in armour.

855
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:58,425
你们Alençon，莱尔，杜诺瓦，你们所有人。放下你们的战斧，命令你们回家。
You Alençon, Laire, Dunois, all of you. Put down your battle-axes, you're ordered home.

856
01:24:58,554 --> 01:25:02,196
从现在起，所有的命令都由我来。
And from now on, all commands come from me.

857
01:25:02,421 --> 01:25:05,221
如果我的船长离开，我也会离开。
If my captains leave, I shall leave also.

858
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:07,285
不是你的船长，是我的船长。
Not your captains, my captains.

859
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:11,002
我所吩咐你们的，你们也要照样去行。随你的便。
And you also will do as you are told. Not as you please.

860
01:25:11,046 --> 01:25:12,446
-关于现在…——啊,是的。
- About the present... - Ah, yes.

861
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:15,924
琼，我们决定授予你荣誉以表示我们的感激。
Joan, we've decided to ennoble you as a token of our gratitude.

862
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:19,478
而你所在的Domrémy镇将免除税收。
And your town of Domrémy will be exempt from taxation.

863
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:23,741
但你必须留在法庭直到你被允许离开。
But you must remain with the court until you are given permission to leave.

864
01:25:23,822 --> 01:25:24,822
现在来加入我们吧。
Now come and join us.

865
01:26:10,545 --> 01:26:12,345
在经历了一个世纪的失败后，我们开始取得胜利。
After a century of defeat, we began to win.

866
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:14,369
我们确实赢了。屡战。
We did win.  Battle after battle.

867
01:26:14,393 --> 01:26:17,717
而现在，就在我们即将结束战争的时候，我们被命令解散。
And now, just as we are about to end the war, we're ordered to disband.

868
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:19,741
撤退从逃跑的敌人手中撤退
To retreat from an enemy that is on the run.

869
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:21,365
为什么会发生这种情况?
Why has this happened?

870
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:22,989
怎么会这样呢?
How could this happen?

871
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:26,413
查尔斯无法忍受人们爱女仆胜过爱国王。
Charles can't bear that the people love the maid more than their King.

872
01:26:26,437 --> 01:26:31,161
完成我的…我最后看了一眼卑鄙的查尔斯。
That finishes me... I've looked my last on Charles the Despicable.

873
01:26:34,485 --> 01:26:36,085
和我一起去诺曼底，琼。
Come to Normandy with me Joan.

874
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,109
我们可以在那里继续战斗。
We can go on fighting there.

875
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:40,533
我们的国王命令你回家。
Our King has ordered you home.

876
01:26:40,757 --> 01:26:43,356
我的家是英国人在篱笆后面等待的地方。
My home is where the English wait behind the hedges.

877
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,680
但是你，琼，你要去哪里?
But you Joan, where will you go?

878
01:26:46,104 --> 01:26:48,704
我的国王命令我留在他身边。
My King has ordered me to stay with him.

879
01:26:48,728 --> 01:26:50,728
那你就是他的俘虏了，法庭上的俘虏。
You'll be his captive then, a prisoner at the court.

880
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:54,052
守在那里，免得你与他的敌人作战，抢夺他的交易。
Held there lest you make war on his enemies and spoil his bargains.

881
01:26:54,076 --> 01:26:58,076
琼，你说过你会站出来告诉人们他们的国王是什么样的。
Joan, you said you'd speak out and tell the people what kind of king they have.

882
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:04,572
如果你对自己和追随你的人诚实，你就不能再站在他一边，你不能保持沉默。
If you're honest with yourself and the people who followed you, you cannot stand by him any longer, you cannot be silent.

883
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:07,296
我岂可毁谤他，离开他呢。
Should I speak against him and leave him?

884
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,320
——是的!——没有。
- Yes! - No.

885
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:14,344
为什么Dunois ?
Why Dunois?

886
01:27:15,468 --> 01:27:17,468
如果你反对他，他还是国王。
If you speak against him, he'll still be King.

887
01:27:17,892 --> 01:27:19,773
如果你离开他，他还是国王。
If you leave him, he'll still be King.

888
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:22,197
到那时，法国会有什么呢?
And what will France have then?

889
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:24,221
一个纯粹腐败的政府!
A government of pure corruption!

890
01:27:24,845 --> 01:27:28,669
没有信仰，就没有善良的天使，只有腐败!
No faith, no good angel, Nothing but corruption!

891
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:35,341
但如果你留在他身边，他有时会为你和法国人民着想，而不总是为自己的利益着想。
But if you remain by his side he'll sometimes have to think of you and of the people of France, and not always of his own interests.

892
01:27:35,565 --> 01:27:37,565
但我会诚实地留下来吗?
But would I be honest to stay?

893
01:27:37,889 --> 01:27:40,889
让皇太子登上王位是上帝的旨意吗?
Was it God's will that you set the Dauphin on his throne?

894
01:27:43,512 --> 01:27:44,412
是的。
Yes.

895
01:27:44,836 --> 01:27:46,836
这是他选的国王。
Well, this is the King he chose.

896
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,060
让人怀疑上帝是不是错了。
Make's a man wonder if God could be wrong.

897
01:27:50,884 --> 01:27:51,384
不。
No.

898
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:55,008
不，上帝不会错的。
No, God could not be wrong.

899
01:27:56,032 --> 01:27:58,832
这是他选择的国王。
This is the King he chose.

900
01:28:01,856 --> 01:28:05,780
然而,……每个政府都是由议价者组成的，琼。这是意料之中的事。
And yet... Every government is made up of bargainers, Joan. That's to be expected.

901
01:28:06,104 --> 01:28:08,404
这是一个幸运的国家，他们没有完全按照自己的方式生活。
And it's a lucky country where they don't have it all their own way.

902
01:28:08,428 --> 01:28:12,252
但有个像你这样的人要让那些讨价还价的人规矩点。
But there's somebody like you about to make the bargainers behave.

903
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:20,100
我会和他在一起，直到停战。
I'll stay with him, 'til the truce ends.

904
01:28:20,324 --> 01:28:21,924
休战可能永远不会结束。
The truce may never end.

905
01:28:22,348 --> 01:28:27,472
那我就把我的白色盔甲献给上帝，不再带领他的军队。
Then I'll dedicate my white armour to God, and lead his armies no more.

906
01:28:33,596 --> 01:28:35,196
别灰心，琼。
Don't lose heart Joan.

907
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:40,444
如果有什么事能让我失去信心，跟你们三个说再见。
If anything could make me lose heart, saying goodbye to you three.

908
01:28:41,467 --> 01:28:43,067
不能在这里结束。
It can't end here.

909
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,072
我们会再见面的，琼。
We'll meet again, Joan.

910
01:28:57,304 --> 01:29:02,904
我从来都不怎么喜欢……话说,琼。除了亵渎。
I was never much with... words, Joan. Except for profanity.

911
01:29:03,074 --> 01:29:06,223
这不仅仅是咒骂。
And this is beyond swearing.

912
01:29:06,723 --> 01:29:09,323
再见,亲爱的朋友。
Goodbye, dear friend.

913
01:29:10,066 --> 01:29:11,866
和良好的士兵。
And good soldier.

914
01:29:12,968 --> 01:29:15,968
你今天早上祷告了吗?
Did you say your prayers this morning?

915
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:18,668
这是我忘了的。
That's what I forgot.

916
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,610
当你说这些话时，请记住我。
Remember me when you say them.

917
01:29:49,194 --> 01:29:53,568
琼，让我向你下跪一次。
Joan, let me kneel to you this once.

918
01:29:53,942 --> 01:29:57,542
对我来说，你比任何国王或王后都重要。
You are more to me than any King or Queen could ever be.

919
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:00,372
对我来说，你们就是法国，法国是你们的。
To me you are France and France is yours.

920
01:30:00,402 --> 01:30:04,402
在她弥留之际，你把她抱了起来给她献上胜利之杯。
You lifted her up when she was dying and set a cup of victory to her lips.

921
01:30:04,517 --> 01:30:06,517
我们都喝过那个杯子里的酒。
We've all drunk from that cup.

922
01:30:06,695 --> 01:30:11,295
它造就了我们的新国家。让我们所有人焕然一新。
It's made a new nation of us. Made new men of all of us.

923
01:30:11,442 --> 01:30:17,216
他们中的许多人现在已经去世了，这一切发生了，我真希望我已经死了。
Many of whom are now dead, as I could wish I were now that this has happened.

924
01:30:35,195 --> 01:30:40,380
天堂之王，我来履行我的誓言。
King of heaven, I've come to fulfil a vow.

925
01:30:42,077 --> 01:30:44,477
与勃艮第签订休战协议。
The truce with Burgundy signed.

926
01:30:44,985 --> 01:30:49,185
我们和平共处，我再也不穿这身白色盔甲了。
We're at peace and I shall wear this white armour no more.

927
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:59,350
我把它放在你的圣坛上。
I leave it here, at your altar.

928
01:31:05,957 --> 01:31:08,860
我们和平了，我的国王。
We are at peace, my King.

929
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:13,251
但并不是我们梦想的和平。
But not such a peace as we dreamed.

930
01:31:13,428 --> 01:31:20,028
不，可怕而邪恶的停战协议，还有很多战争要打。
No, horrible and evil an armistice, with much of the war to be fought.

931
01:31:21,798 --> 01:31:24,798
我们的敌人也在准备。
And our enemies preparing.

932
01:31:24,914 --> 01:31:31,104
和我们……从一个城镇到另一个城镇，在这里主持会议。
And we... dwindle here from town to town, holding court.

933
01:31:31,255 --> 01:31:34,655
接待大使馆，解散士兵。
Receiving embassies and dismissing soldiers.

934
01:31:34,762 --> 01:31:37,362
我们从一个城镇到另一个城镇大吃大喝。
From town to town we have feasted.

935
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:42,789
我听命于国王，从一个城市到另一个城市。
From city to city I have attended, doing the King's bidding.

936
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:47,359
如果计划成功，我们还得多吃几顿。
We must feast in many more if the plan holds.

937
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:56,231
但是，天啊，这食物真苦。
But, oh, sweet God, the food is bitter.

938
01:31:58,691 --> 01:32:07,168
我宁愿再睡在地上嚼着豆子和米饭面对英国人的长矛，这样我们就会失去我们赢得的一切。
I would rather sleep on the ground again and chew my handful of beans and rice and to face the rank of English spears, for this way we shall lose all we have won.

939
01:32:09,086 --> 01:32:11,086
连我都看得出来。
Even I can see that.

940
01:32:12,806 --> 01:32:15,806
我的声音什么也没说。
And my voices have said nothing.

941
01:32:21,981 --> 01:32:25,181
要是我的声音能再和我说话就好了。
If only my voices would speak to me again.

942
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:33,369
如果他们会告诉我我应该做什么，那么我可以在晚上睡觉，接受什么来找我，但他们沉默。
If they would tell me what I should do then I could sleep at night and accept what comes to me but they are silent.

943
01:32:35,406 --> 01:32:38,731
我一遍又一遍地问。
I asked again and again.

944
01:32:39,045 --> 01:32:43,244
我必须留在国王和他的家人身边吗?
Must I remain with the King and his household?

945
01:32:43,469 --> 01:32:48,469
忙于填补这些天的空白?
Busy with the nothings that fill these days?

946
01:32:56,131 --> 01:33:01,539
如果我的声音不回应，我就不能留在这里。
If my voices do not answer, I cannot stay here.

947
01:33:02,393 --> 01:33:06,793
我必须重新武装起来，找到敌人，像以前一样战斗。
I must arm again and find the enemy and fight as before.

948
01:33:08,243 --> 01:33:10,643
如果这是错的，让我的声音告诉我。
Let my voices speak to me if this is wrong.

949
01:33:12,746 --> 01:33:15,746
让他们现在跟我说。
Let them speak to me now.

950
01:33:40,769 --> 01:33:42,769
我被抛弃了吗?
Have I been abandoned?

951
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:47,393
我是否犯了不可原谅的错误?
Have I made an error that is not forgiven?

952
01:33:59,386 --> 01:34:01,786
还是没有回答。
There is still no answer.

953
01:34:08,486 --> 01:34:10,086
那我得走了。
Then I must go.

954
01:34:10,384 --> 01:34:14,984
与敌人战斗，天堂之王。
And fight the enemy, King of heaven.

955
01:34:15,327 --> 01:34:20,127
我要去找另一副盔甲，而不是这副我作为你的信使所穿的闪亮盔甲。
I shall find another armour, not this shining one in which I rode as your messenger.

956
01:34:20,392 --> 01:34:24,992
但另一个阴郁而卑微，适合一个普通士兵。
But another dark and humble, fitting to a common soldier.

957
01:34:26,985 --> 01:34:32,985
很久以前，我的声音告诉我，我将被俘虏。
Long ago my voices told me that I would be taken prisoner.

958
01:34:34,876 --> 01:34:38,875
当它来临的时候，至少我手里还有双臂。
When it comes, at least I shall have arms in my hands.

959
01:34:38,918 --> 01:34:42,518
我想我有死的勇气。
I think I have courage to die.

960
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:47,139
但不要以这种微小而病态的方式死去。
But not to die thus in small, sick ways.

961
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:49,563
日报。
Daily.

962
01:35:11,028 --> 01:35:13,628
通知主人他们要把女巫带进来!
Inform the master they're bringing in the witch!

963
01:35:13,887 --> 01:35:15,887
女仆被抓了!
The maid is captured!

964
01:35:16,394 --> 01:35:17,594
过来,看!
Come here, look!

965
01:35:17,668 --> 01:35:23,068
女巫!女巫!她只是个女孩!
There's the witch! The witch! Why she's only a girl!

966
01:35:30,563 --> 01:35:38,034
原来你是女仆……这个农村女孩领导军队，为国王加冕，让士兵们战栗。
So you are the maid... The peasant girl who leads armies, crowns Kings, and sets soldiers quaking in their boots.

967
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:41,989
作为一个法国人，你的仰慕者。
As a Frenchman, your great admirer.

968
01:35:41,993 --> 01:35:46,593
作为一个勃艮第人，你幸运的俘虏。
As a Burgundian, your fortunate captor.

969
01:35:46,926 --> 01:35:49,226
-在Compiègne?-是的，大人。
- At the gates of Compiègne? - Yes, my Lord.

970
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:53,040
当我们突袭她和她的少数追随者时，这座城市当着我们的面关上了城门。
The city shut the gates in our faces as we descended upon her and her few followers.

971
01:35:53,152 --> 01:35:55,952
-我们很小心，不让她受伤。-干得好，船长。
- We were careful not to wound her. - Well done, captain.

972
01:35:56,094 --> 01:35:59,094
亲爱的，照顾好她的身体。
My dear, look after her good health.

973
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:04,378
-我会照顾好你的，琼。-他们拿走了我的戒指。
- You shall be in good hands, Joan. - They've taken my ring.

974
01:36:04,518 --> 01:36:05,518
我想要回来。
I want it back.

975
01:36:07,317 --> 01:36:10,317
波维主教大人。
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvais.

976
01:36:12,172 --> 01:36:13,972
-欢迎您，陛下。问候,计数。
- Welcome, your Grace. - Greetings, Count.

977
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:17,542
一杯酒?酒总是比便宜货好。
A goblet of wine? Wine is always good over a bargain.

978
01:36:17,611 --> 01:36:18,811
好的，谢谢。
Why yes, thank you.

979
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,940
在我看来，我记得这个房间在不太愉快的情况下。
It seems to me, I remember this room under less happy circumstances.

980
01:36:22,994 --> 01:36:26,394
是的，我记得你当时有点喘不过气来。
Yes, as I remember you were a bit breathless.

981
01:36:26,565 --> 01:36:28,265
你当时在躲避女佣。
You were running from the maid.

982
01:36:28,435 --> 01:36:32,635
-你现在拥有的人。-我现在有了。
- Whom you now have. - Whom I now have.

983
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:35,490
要我把钱送上去吗?
Shall I have the money sent up?

984
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:38,818
五千英镑不够，陛下。
5,000 pounds is not enough, your Grace.

985
01:36:39,047 --> 01:36:41,247
我在别的地方可以找到更好的。
I can do much better elsewhere.

986
01:36:41,497 --> 01:36:44,497
5000英镑是一大笔钱。
5,000 pounds is a great deal of money.

987
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:46,308
国王得到的赎金更少。
Kings have been ransomed for less.

988
01:36:46,436 --> 01:36:50,436
但这次不一样，这是个女巫。女巫是昂贵的。
But this is something different, this is a witch. Witches are expensive.

989
01:36:50,576 --> 01:36:52,976
5000年。是或否?
5,000. Yes or no?

990
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
我用了10个袋子。
I've used 10 bags.

991
01:37:13,712 --> 01:37:18,712
问题是每个袋子装500磅还是1000磅。
The question is does each bag contains 500 or 1,000 pounds.

992
01:37:18,957 --> 01:37:21,957
毕夏普，有没有可能你在撒谎?
Bishop, could it be possible that you're lying?

993
01:37:22,153 --> 01:37:25,753
在我看来，你被授权最高可获得一万英镑。
It looks to me as if you're authorised to go as high as 10,000 pounds.

994
01:37:25,986 --> 01:37:29,386
如果我说我是，你会想要15个。
If I said that I were, you'd want 15.

995
01:37:29,547 --> 01:37:31,847
如果你是一个真正的基督徒，你就会白白放弃她。
If you're a true Christian, you'd give her up for nothing.

996
01:37:32,103 --> 01:37:35,303
她是个女巫，是个异教徒!一个崇拜者!
She's a sorceress, a heretic! An idolatress!

997
01:37:35,454 --> 01:37:37,653
-她必须被烧死。-现在，现在…等待主教。
- She must be burned. - Oh now, now... wait Bishop.

998
01:37:37,814 --> 01:37:43,014
如果这完全是宗教问题，你为什么要给我英国硬币?
If this is entirely a religious matter, why do you offer me English coin?

999
01:37:43,165 --> 01:37:45,765
英格兰是我们教会真正的女儿。
England is a true daughter of our church.

1000
01:37:45,804 --> 01:37:49,804
她全心全意地和我们在一起，为了铲除这个异端邪说。
She's with us heart and soul, in the matter of scorching this heresy.

1001
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:55,321
哦,是的。当女仆打败英国人时。当然，那是异端邪说。
Oh, yes. When the maid beat the English. Yes of course, that was heresy.

1002
01:37:55,567 --> 01:37:58,967
更别说她把你赶出了你的主教辖区。
Not to mention her booting you out of your Bishopric.

1003
01:37:59,262 --> 01:38:03,262
-你站在哪一边，我的朋友?-我们都站在这一边。
- Whose side are you on, my friend? - This same side we're all on.

1004
01:38:03,567 --> 01:38:06,767
我的一面，对我有什么好处。那是我这边，也是你这边。
The me side, what's in it for me. That's my side, and it's your side.

1005
01:38:07,113 --> 01:38:15,713
英国方面，法国方面，勃艮第方面。当然……这个女孩，她是我认识的唯一一个不站在我这边的人。
And the English side, and the French side, and the Burgundian side. Of course... this girl, she's the only one I know who is not on the me side.

1006
01:38:15,926 --> 01:38:18,026
所以当我想到我要卖掉她时，我感到羞愧。
And that's why I'm ashamed when I think I'd sell her.

1007
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:25,809
-是的，即使是一万英镑。-很好，一万。你要吗?
- Yes, even for 10,000 gold pounds. - Very well, 10,000. Will you take it?

1008
01:38:28,033 --> 01:38:30,033
我们数一数好吗?
Shall we count it out?

1009
01:38:33,957 --> 01:38:35,957
你纺纱缝得真好!
You spin and sew so well!

1010
01:38:36,381 --> 01:38:38,380
我从布鲁塞尔买了一些漂亮的布料。
I have some beautiful cloth from Brussels.

1011
01:38:38,904 --> 01:38:40,904
为什么不给你做条裙子，琼?
Why don't we make a dress for you Joan?

1012
01:38:41,928 --> 01:38:43,928
谢谢，夫人但我不想要。
Thank you, my lady but don't want one.

1013
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:50,452
当我穿成这样的时候，每个人都能看到我仍然代表着我所做的一切。
While I'm dressed as I am everyone can see that I still stand for what I have done.

1014
01:38:51,476 --> 01:38:53,476
不，我不能改变。
No, I cannot change.

1015
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,500
什么事，玛格丽特?
What is it, Marguerite?

1016
01:38:56,724 --> 01:38:58,513
主人要找女仆。
The master wants the maid.

1017
01:38:58,537 --> 01:38:59,537
他在哪里?
Where is he?

1018
01:38:59,561 --> 01:39:01,761
他在保险库数钱呢。
He's in the strong room, counting money.

1019
01:39:02,185 --> 01:39:03,785
一大堆钱!
A mountain of money!

1020
01:39:03,809 --> 01:39:04,809
我的王!
My King!

1021
01:39:07,933 --> 01:39:09,913
我的国王送来了我的赎金!
My King has sent my ransom!

1022
01:39:34,337 --> 01:39:36,312
英语……
The English...

1023
01:39:39,936 --> 01:39:41,912
.．.不是我的国王。
...not my King.

1024
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:47,713
你可以带她去。
You may take her.

1025
01:40:04,237 --> 01:40:14,409
书记官们，勋爵们，主人们，神父们，我，皮埃尔·高雄，上帝的慈悲，波维主教，感谢你们来到鲁昂城，
Scriveners, lords, masters and fathers, I, Pierre Cauchon, by divine mercy, Bishop of Beauvais, gratefully thank you for coming here to the City of Rouen,

1026
01:40:14,433 --> 01:40:17,033
在即将开始的审判中协助我。
to assist me in the trial that is about to begin.

1027
01:40:17,457 --> 01:40:27,205
我相信，当我说这是我们最热切的愿望时，我代表我们大家说，这次审判将是公正、无偏见和无可指责的。
I am confident that I speak for us all, when I say that it is our most ardent wish, that this trial shall be just, unbiased and irreproachable.

1028
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:39,111
更重要的是，这是我们的君主，法国和英国国王亨利六世陛下的命令，他的代表，沃里克伯爵，荣幸地接见了我们。
The more so since it is the command of our Sovereign, His Royal Majesty, Henry VI, King of France and of England, whose representative, the Earl of Warwick, is honouring us with his presence.

1029
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:51,831
我的主…根据你给我的命令，作为这个案子的推手，我引荐了这个女人，俗称“女仆琼”，今天上午在我们面前出现，
My Lord... in accordance with the orders you gave me, and as promoter of this case, I have cited the woman, commonly known as Joan the maid, to appear this morning here before us,

1030
01:40:52,155 --> 01:40:54,155
回答对她的指控。
and to answer the accusations brought against her.

1031
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,479
让·勒·梅斯特尔少爷你能把被告带到我们面前吗?
Master Jean Le Maistre will you bring the accused before us?

1032
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:06,627
“大人，”说着，琼恳求您答应她两件事:第一，允许她在出庭前听弥撒。
My Lord, the said Joan has two requests she begs you to grant, First, that she may be allowed to hear mass before appearing.

1033
01:41:07,051 --> 01:41:11,051
第二，你身边坐着法国牧师和英国牧师。
Second, that you have French priests as well as English, to sit beside you.

1034
01:41:11,575 --> 01:41:14,975
这些问题我以前已经提过了，简少爷。
These points have been mentioned before, Master Jean.

1035
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:23,947
在咨询了最显赫的贵族和权威，并考虑到她被指控的罪行，以及她不雅的着装后，
After consulting the most eminent lords and authorities, and taking into consideration the crimes of which she is accused, as well as the indecency of her attire,

1036
01:41:24,371 --> 01:41:26,671
我们不能准许她听弥撒。
we could not grant her permission to hear mass.

1037
01:41:27,095 --> 01:41:35,658
而且，除了威廉·哈顿少爷是英国人之外，我们这些评委都是法国人，而且是善良的法国人。
Also, apart from Master William Hatton, who is English, we the judges are all Frenchmen, and good Frenchmen.

1038
01:41:36,182 --> 01:41:38,182
把被告带到我们面前。
Bring the accused before us.

1039
01:42:09,906 --> 01:42:11,906
如果你愿意，你可以坐下。
You may sit if you wish.

1040
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,310
谢谢你,父亲。我的立场。
Thank you, father.  I'll stand.

1041
01:42:15,134 --> 01:42:16,734
起初。
At first anyway.

1042
01:42:16,758 --> 01:42:26,806
根据共同的报告，公众的谣言，以及我们所获得的各种信息，我们以异端邪说和巫术的嫌疑传唤你到我们面前。
Acting upon common report, public rumour, and various informations obtained by us, we have summoned you before us as a suspect of heresy and sorcery.

1043
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:31,330
你能发誓说真话吗关于我们要问你的一切?
Will you swear to speak the truth concerning everything we shall ask you?

1044
01:42:31,954 --> 01:42:35,553
大人，我不知道你会问什么问题。
My Lord, I do not know what your questions will be.

1045
01:42:35,977 --> 01:42:39,377
也许你会问我一些我不该回答的问题。
Perhaps you will ask me things I should not answer.

1046
01:42:39,401 --> 01:42:43,001
-她不敢回答!-烧了她，了结了她!
- She's afraid to answer! - Burn her and have it done with!

1047
01:42:43,102 --> 01:42:49,803
关于我的母亲，我的父亲以及我离开家参加战争后所做的一切，我愿意告诉你。
Of my mother and of my father and what I did after I left home to take part in the war I will tell you willingly.

1048
01:42:49,804 --> 01:42:57,005
但对于上帝赐予我的启示，我不会告诉任何人，除了查尔斯，我的国王。
But of certain revelations which have come to me from God, I will speak to no one save Charles, my King.

1049
01:42:57,229 --> 01:43:00,829
为什么神要向你启示呢?
Why should God make revelations to you?

1050
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:03,653
神喜悦谁，就给谁启示。
God makes revelations to whom He pleases.

1051
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:07,677
关于信仰的事，你能发誓说真话吗?
Will you swear to speak the truth on matters concerning the faith?

1052
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:23,801
关于信仰的问题，我发誓说真话。
I swear to speak the truth on questions concerning the faith.

1053
01:43:32,325 --> 01:43:33,325
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

1054
01:43:33,349 --> 01:43:36,548
我的名字叫琼。在家里，我被称为珍妮特。
My name is Joan. At home I was called Jeannette.

1055
01:43:36,572 --> 01:43:37,572
你多大了?
How old are you?

1056
01:43:37,996 --> 01:43:40,596
我想我19岁。
I am 19 I think.

1057
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:44,620
你说你得到了上帝的启示。
You say that you have had revelations from God.

1058
01:43:44,644 --> 01:43:48,644
你能告诉我们第一次发生的时间吗?
Can you tell us when it first happened?

1059
01:43:55,668 --> 01:44:01,692
当我十三岁的时候，我听到父亲的花园里有声音。
When I was thirteen years old, I heard a voice in my father's garden.

1060
01:44:01,693 --> 01:44:04,693
那是夏天的中午。
It was at noon time in the summer.

1061
01:44:04,694 --> 01:44:08,694
声音在我右边，朝向教堂。
The voice was at my right, toward the church.

1062
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:14,995
它在巨大的光芒中对我说话。
And it spoke to me from amidst of a great light.

1063
01:44:15,596 --> 01:44:20,797
当我第一次听到这个声音时，我很害怕，那个声音说了什么?
When I first heard it I was frightened, What did the voice say?

1064
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:25,521
首先，它只讲了身边的事情，以及我应该如何生活。
First it spoke only of things near at hand and how I should live my life.

1065
01:44:29,045 --> 01:44:40,992
但后来，后来它对我说，走吧!去解除对奥尔良的围攻。
But then, then later it said to me Go!.. . Go raise the siege of Orleans.

1066
01:44:40,993 --> 01:44:44,993
让皇太子在兰斯加冕。
Have the Dauphin crowned at Rheims.

1067
01:44:45,894 --> 01:44:49,094
把英国人从法国的土地上赶走。
Drive the English from French soil.

1068
01:44:52,295 --> 01:44:54,095
你回答这个声音了吗?
Did you answer this voice?

1069
01:44:54,396 --> 01:44:59,396
我说我只是个乡下来的穷姑娘，对法庭和战争一窍不通。
I said I was only a poor girl from the farms who knew nothing of courts and warfare.

1070
01:44:59,897 --> 01:45:03,897
但仍有声音对我说，
But still the voice said to me,

1071
01:45:07,798 --> 01:45:16,500
去吧，上帝的孩子，法兰西的女儿，去吧!
Go child of God, daughter of France, Go!

1072
01:45:16,824 --> 01:45:20,224
跟你说话的那个声音，是谁的声音?
This voice that spoke to you, whose voice was it?

1073
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:24,948
一开始我以为是天使。
At first I thought it was an angel.

1074
01:45:25,472 --> 01:45:29,472
后来我知道是圣迈克尔在讲话。
Then later I knew it was Saint Michael who spoke.

1075
01:45:30,496 --> 01:45:34,095
有时圣凯瑟琳会出现在我面前。
Sometimes Saint Catherine appeared to me.

1076
01:45:34,396 --> 01:45:36,096
和圣玛格丽特。
And Saint Margaret.

1077
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,120
你见过这些圣徒吗?还是他们只对你说话?
Did you see these saints, or did they speak to you only?

1078
01:45:39,544 --> 01:45:43,544
我看他们就像现在看你一样清楚。
I saw them as clearly as I see you now.

1079
01:45:43,568 --> 01:45:47,568
你的国王看到你的圣徒了吗?
Did your King see your saints?

1080
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:52,092
经过。这与你的审判无关。
Pass over that. This does not concern your trial.

1081
01:45:52,316 --> 01:45:53,916
她没有这个权利!
She has no right!

1082
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:57,940
——继续。-圣人头上有头发吗?
- Proceed. - Do the saints have hair on their heads?

1083
01:45:57,964 --> 01:46:01,164
很高兴知道他们有。
It's good to know that they have.

1084
01:46:03,188 --> 01:46:04,988
他们穿衣服吗?
Do they wear clothes?

1085
01:46:04,989 --> 01:46:08,789
神岂如此贫穷，连圣徒的衣服也不能穿吗。
Is God so poor that he cannot clothe his saints?

1086
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:12,190
圣玛格丽特说的是英语还是法语?
Did Saint Margaret speak in English or in French?

1087
01:46:12,191 --> 01:46:16,191
她为什么要讲英语?她不站在英国那边。
Why should she speak English? She is not on the English side.

1088
01:46:16,292 --> 01:46:19,692
你的圣徒们讨厌英国人吗?
Do your saints hate the English?

1089
01:46:19,693 --> 01:46:23,693
他们恨上帝恨的，爱上帝爱的。
They hate what God hates and they love what God loves.

1090
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:27,094
上帝吗?他讨厌英国人吗?
God?  Does he hate the English?

1091
01:46:27,595 --> 01:46:31,195
上帝对英国人的爱或恨，我一无所知。
Of God's love or hate for the English, I know nothing.

1092
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:35,218
我只知道，英国人会被赶出法国的土地。
I know only this, that the English will be driven from French soil.

1093
01:46:36,442 --> 01:46:39,642
除了那些埋在这里的人。
Except for those that are buried here.

1094
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:47,390
上帝会赐予我的国王一场伟大的胜利查理七世将成为全法国的国王!
God will give my King a great victory and Charles the 7th will be King of all France!

1095
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:59,791
你相信你是处于一种优雅的状态吗?
Do you believe that you are in a state of grace?

1096
01:47:01,706 --> 01:47:06,706
如果我不在，愿上帝把我放在那里。
If I am not, may God put me there.

1097
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:13,320
如果我是，愿他把我留在那里。
If I am then, may he keep me there.

1098
01:47:13,513 --> 01:47:15,813
回答得好，琼。
That is a good answer, Joan.

1099
01:47:15,923 --> 01:47:18,923
我们不需要你的评论，简少爷。
We can do without your comments, Master Jean.

1100
01:47:19,525 --> 01:47:23,125
谁劝你脱掉女人的衣服，穿得像个男人?
Who counselled you to throw off women's clothes and dress like a man?

1101
01:47:23,404 --> 01:47:27,804
一件事不雅……而且违背了圣经的教义。
A thing indecent... and contrary to the teachings of the holy scriptures.

1102
01:47:27,971 --> 01:47:29,771
对此，我不怪任何人。
For that I blame no one.

1103
01:47:29,888 --> 01:47:34,887
我和士兵生活在一起，穿男装更合适。
Having lived among soldiers it was more fitting for me to wear man's clothes.

1104
01:47:34,993 --> 01:47:39,893
但给我一件女人的衣服，如果你允许我去听弥撒，我就穿它。
But give me a woman's dress and I will wear it if you permit me to hear mass.

1105
01:47:39,945 --> 01:47:43,645
否则我不会穿它，因为上帝喜欢我穿它。
Otherwise I will not put it on since it pleases God that I wear this one.

1106
01:47:43,867 --> 01:47:48,867
我所做的一切，都是奉我主的命令。
All I have done, I've done by the command of my Lord.

1107
01:47:49,806 --> 01:47:52,606
这就是我所做的一切。
That is all that I've done well.

1108
01:47:52,869 --> 01:47:56,469
你怎么知道你的声音来自上帝?
How do you know that your voices come from God?

1109
01:47:56,702 --> 01:48:02,202
我知道他们是从神来的，因为他们所吩咐我的，都是善的。
I knew that they came from God because what they commanded me to do was only good.

1110
01:48:02,408 --> 01:48:06,008
诸位大人，我在普瓦捷已经回答过这些问题了。
My Lords, I have answered these same questions at Poitiers.

1111
01:48:06,226 --> 01:48:13,104
我的国王命令兰斯大主教和其他忠诚博学的牧师在我被允许领导他的军队之前对我进行检查。
My King charged the Archbishop of Rheims and other loyal and learned priests to examine me before I was allowed to lead his army.

1112
01:48:13,226 --> 01:48:16,626
把普瓦捷的记录拿来，我就会给你所有的答案。
Send for the records at Poitiers, and you shall have all my answers.

1113
01:48:16,705 --> 01:48:20,805
兰斯大主教在普瓦捷的检查与此无关。
The examination at Poitiers by the Archbishop of Rheims has no relevance.

1114
01:48:20,944 --> 01:48:23,944
我们现在是你们的裁判，你们必须回答我们!
We are your judges now and you must answer us!

1115
01:48:24,051 --> 01:48:27,051
但你们没资格评判我。
But you are not fitted to be my judges.

1116
01:48:27,229 --> 01:48:31,255
你们是我的死敌。
You are my mortal enemies.

1117
01:48:31,429 --> 01:48:34,428
英国……和Burgurdians。
English... and Burgurdians.

1118
01:48:34,923 --> 01:48:35,923
你们所有的人。
All of you.

1119
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,930
你也不是教会。
And you are not the church.

1120
01:48:41,052 --> 01:48:45,052
你们是敌人国王的贴身男仆，听从他的命令。
You are the valets of the enemy King whose orders you obey.

1121
01:48:45,702 --> 01:48:50,002
我若被教会审判，为什么不在教会的监里，和妇女在一起呢?
If I am being tried by the church, why am I not in a church prison among women?

1122
01:48:50,381 --> 01:48:59,043
我被关在英国的监狱里，有英国士兵看守，还用铁链锁着……锁在我的床上。如果我必须站起来，我必须让守卫解开镣铐。
I am in a English prison guarded by English soldiers and chained... chained to my bed. If I must rise for any purpose I must ask the guards to unlock the bonds.

1123
01:48:59,093 --> 01:49:02,893
我们，你们的法官，把你们锁起来是因为你们试图逃跑。
We, your judges, keep you chained because you've attempted to escape.

1124
01:49:03,016 --> 01:49:07,216
难道所有战俘不都有试图逃跑的权利吗?
Is it not a right of all prisoners of war to try to escape?

1125
01:49:09,861 --> 01:49:13,561
你们说你们是我的法官。
You say that you are my judges.

1126
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:28,863
我不知道你们是谁，但我对你们说，你们要谨慎，不要错判我。因为我实在是神所差来的，你们是自取大祸。
I do not know if you are, but I say this, take care not to judge me wrongly, for in truth I am sent by God and you place yourself in great danger.

1127
01:49:28,897 --> 01:49:31,497
带她回牢房去!
Take her back to her cell!

1128
01:49:32,641 --> 01:49:34,641
日安，各位大人。
Good day, my Lords.

1129
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,048
你和你完美无瑕的审判。
You and your flawless trial.

1130
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:45,559
那女孩太聪明了，你配不上她!她嘲笑你!
The girl's too clever for you! She ridicules you!

1131
01:49:45,698 --> 01:49:51,298
-是的，还在公共场合威胁你。-我可以向你保证，亲爱的沃里克。这种事不会再发生了。
- Yes and threatens you in public. - I can assure you, my dear Warwick. It won't happen again.

1132
01:49:51,494 --> 01:49:54,494
不会的，因为不会再有公开会议了。
No it will not, for there will be no more public sessions.

1133
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:58,872
按照我的命令，你们要继续秘密行动。
You will continue behind closed doors according to my orders.

1134
01:50:08,529 --> 01:50:09,929
那是小教堂吗，神父?
Is that the chapel, Father?

1135
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:12,491
——是的,琼。-我可以进去吗?
- Yes, Joan. - May I enter?

1136
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:15,219
没有女儿，这是禁止的。
No daughter, it is forbidden.

1137
01:50:23,365 --> 01:50:25,365
你知道为什么吗?
Do you know why?

1138
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:27,299
这是被禁止的。
It is forbidden.

1139
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:35,304
陛下，也许我们不该这么快就拒绝这个孩子关于普瓦捷档案的请求。
Your Grace, perhaps we should not say no so quickly to this child's request concerning the records of Poitiers.

1140
01:50:35,526 --> 01:50:46,922
因为我们在战争中不是站在女仆一边的，所以我们很难对她进行评判。-以公正的方式。-这是一个教会法庭，完全受公正的教会法律管辖。
Since we were not on the maid's side in the war, we can hardly judge her... - in unbiased fashion. - This is an ecclesiastical court, governed solely by the unbiased laws of the church.

1141
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:48,579
教会的法律?
The laws of the church?

1142
01:50:48,772 --> 01:50:51,372
他们要求英国人守在门口吗?
Do they demand English guards at the doors?

1143
01:50:51,512 --> 01:50:54,312
他们坚持要英国的黄金来承担费用吗?
Do they insist that English gold bears the expense?

1144
01:50:54,507 --> 01:50:56,907
——沉默Calleis。-不，陛下。
- Silence Calleis. - No, your Grace.

1145
01:50:57,196 --> 01:51:00,196
这样的程序与我们的法律相抵触。
Such a procedure contravenes our laws.

1146
01:51:00,402 --> 01:51:04,102
-我不能参加这次审判。-那你可以走了。
- I can take no part in this trial. - Then you may leave.

1147
01:51:04,298 --> 01:51:07,298
你们中间，凡跟他有相同意见的，也可以离开。
And any of you who are of his opinion may leave also.

1148
01:51:07,576 --> 01:51:11,976
但记住，如果你现在走，我对你的敌意也会随之而去。
But remember this, if you go now, you carry my enmity with you.

1149
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:14,509
以及英格兰国王的敌意。
And the enmity of the King of England.

1150
01:51:14,704 --> 01:51:16,904
法国和英国的国王。
The King of France and of England.

1151
01:51:17,155 --> 01:51:21,355
我很抱歉带着你的仁慈离开。或者你的无情。
I'm sorry to leave with your mercy. Or your lack of mercy.

1152
01:51:21,577 --> 01:51:28,177
但是，为了我的良心，我无法亲眼目睹这在我看来不过是一场预先设想的可耻的闹剧。
But for my conscience sake I cannot witness what seems to me but a preconceived and shameful farce.

1153
01:51:48,303 --> 01:51:49,903
你和我们一起去。
You will come with us.

1154
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,920
——我?——是的。你被捕了。
- I? - Yes. You're under arrest.

1155
01:52:14,901 --> 01:52:19,195
我应该在教堂监狱里，被女人看守着。
I should be in a church prison, guarded by women.

1156
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:23,428
你一定要把我留在这里吗，马西厄神父?
Must you leave me here, Father Massieu?

1157
01:52:23,474 --> 01:52:25,674
我奉命把你留在这里。
I'm commanded to leave you here.

1158
01:52:26,603 --> 01:52:28,403
上帝保佑你，孩子。
God keep you, child.

1159
01:52:52,072 --> 01:52:57,999
琼，这是让·拉维恩大师，他是由法国最尊敬的宗教裁判所指派的。
Joan, this is Master Jean Laverne, who has been assigned by the most reverend Inquisitor of France.

1160
01:52:58,222 --> 01:52:59,622
协助我们对你的审判。
To assist us at your trial.

1161
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:03,650
珍老师已阅读了前几届会议的所有报告。
Master Jean has read all the reports of the preceding sessions.

1162
01:53:03,823 --> 01:53:06,223
所以对你的案子很了解。
And is therefore well acquainted with your case.

1163
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:10,079
我是珍，我向你保证我们会公正地审判你。
I am Jean and I promise you that we will judge you justly.

1164
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:13,218
但你是个文盲，需要咨询。
But you're an unlettered girl and need council.

1165
01:53:13,469 --> 01:53:16,269
你可以选择一位评委给你出谋划策。
You may choose one of the judges to advise you.

1166
01:53:16,485 --> 01:53:17,685
我感谢你。
I thank you.

1167
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:23,425
但我不打算离开我的主人的会议。
But I have no intention of departing from the council of my Lord.

1168
01:53:23,849 --> 01:53:26,349
你能发誓对我们的要求说真话吗?
Will you swear to speak the truth on everything we ask you?

1169
01:53:26,373 --> 01:53:28,373
我已经来过你无数次了。
I've come before you countless times.

1170
01:53:28,697 --> 01:53:32,696
我曾多次发誓。你是我的负担!
Again and again I have sworn. You burden me too much!

1171
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:37,620
你最近听到自己的声音了吗?
Have you heard your voices recently?

1172
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:41,544
是的。他们沉默了一会儿。
Yes.  For a while they were silent.

1173
01:53:41,868 --> 01:53:45,868
-现在他们每天都和我说话。-他们在你的牢房里出现过吗?
- Now they speak to me daily. - Did they appear to you in your cell?

1174
01:53:46,869 --> 01:53:50,869
我有时听不懂他们在说什么。
I do not always understand what they say.

1175
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:53,370
我的守卫太吵了。
My guards make too much noise.

1176
01:53:53,575 --> 01:53:55,575
你的声音告诉你什么?
What do your voices tell you?

1177
01:53:57,102 --> 01:54:00,102
大胆地回答你。
To answer you boldly.

1178
01:54:02,275 --> 01:54:04,675
他们答应送你了吗?
Did they promise to deliver you?

1179
01:54:04,793 --> 01:54:09,989
圣凯瑟琳告诉我，我会被拯救。
Saint Catherine told me that I would be rescued.

1180
01:54:10,327 --> 01:54:17,527
我不知道这是否意味着我将被法国人进攻鲁昂城。
I do not know whether this means that I would be delivered by a French attack upon this city Rouen.

1181
01:54:17,633 --> 01:54:22,323
或者别的什么，但我被告知，我将在一场伟大的胜利中获得自由。
Or something else, but I was told that I would be freed by a great victory.

1182
01:54:22,567 --> 01:54:27,167
-你能记住确切的单词吗?——是的。
- Can you remember the exact words? - Yes.

1183
01:54:27,335 --> 01:54:32,243
勇敢地接受一切。
Accept everything with courage.

1184
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:35,390
不要害怕你的牺牲。
Do not fear your martyrdom.

1185
01:54:35,568 --> 01:54:40,168
因为最终，你将在天堂的王国里。
For in the end, you shall be in the kingdom of paradise.

1186
01:54:40,474 --> 01:54:44,797
这个声音是什么意思?你的牺牲吗?
What does the voice mean by... your martyrdom?

1187
01:54:47,663 --> 01:54:51,731
我…我不确定。
I... I am not sure.

1188
01:54:54,155 --> 01:54:57,955
这可能意味着我在监狱里所遭受的痛苦。
It may mean what I suffer here in prison.

1189
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:05,700
夜复一夜，我都睡不着觉，但我还是必须到你面前来回答你的问题。
Night after night, I have no sleep and still I must come before you and answer questions.

1190
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:09,437
同样的问题。
The same questions.

1191
01:55:09,615 --> 01:55:13,415
来吧，我在牢房里要忍受的事，我都快疯了。
Come before half mad with what I must endure in my cell.

1192
01:55:13,645 --> 01:55:19,195
没有……没有休息，没有休息，白天黑夜。
Without... without rest, without rest, day or night.

1193
01:55:23,934 --> 01:55:27,934
我不知道我还得忍受多少痛苦。
I do not know how much more I will have to suffer.

1194
01:55:28,168 --> 01:55:30,167
我把自己交给上帝。
I refer myself to God.

1195
01:55:30,191 --> 01:55:34,191
你认为你会去天国吗?
Do you think you will go to the Kingdom of Paradise?

1196
01:55:37,215 --> 01:55:41,215
是的，当然，好像我已经在那里了。
Yes, surely as if I were already there.

1197
01:55:41,739 --> 01:55:45,739
-这是个很严肃的回答。——是的!
- This is a very grave answer. - Yes!

1198
01:55:46,263 --> 01:55:49,363
我把它当作宝贵的财富。
And I hold it for a great treasure.

1199
01:55:49,364 --> 01:55:55,565
你在希农教堂给了你的国王什么标志让他相信你是上帝派来的?
What was the sign you gave to your King in the chapel of Chinon that made him believe you were sent by God?

1200
01:55:55,866 --> 01:56:01,490
这个问题你已经问了我100遍了，我也告诉过你无数遍了，我不许你回答!
I think you've asked me that question 100 times and I've told you again and again you shall have no answer from me!

1201
01:56:01,514 --> 01:56:03,214
这与这次审判无关!
It does not concern this trial!

1202
01:56:03,438 --> 01:56:10,038
这个标志是用金、银还是珠宝做的?
Was this sign made of, ah, gold or silver, or jewels?

1203
01:56:12,962 --> 01:56:18,962
世界上没有哪个金匠能做出如此富有而美丽的徽章或标志。
No goldsmith in the world could fashion a crest or sign so rich and fair.

1204
01:56:20,286 --> 01:56:23,286
它将持续1000年。
It will last 1,000 years.

1205
01:56:23,287 --> 01:56:27,287
-是皇冠吗?-我没说那是王冠。
- Was it a crown? - I did not say it was a crown.

1206
01:56:27,488 --> 01:56:28,688
那是什么呢?
Well, what was it then?

1207
01:56:29,111 --> 01:56:31,411
如果你想知道，去我的国王那里问他。
If you wish to know, go to my King and ask him.

1208
01:56:31,687 --> 01:56:37,764
-这个妓女在嘲笑我们的法庭!-你问了我一些我发誓不回答的问题，可你还是问个不停。
- This harlot mocks our court! - You ask me questions I have sworn not to answer, and yet you keep asking them.

1209
01:56:37,889 --> 01:56:40,489
你希望我作什么伪证?
What do you wish of me that I perjure myself?

1210
01:56:40,572 --> 01:56:43,372
书记官们，住手。不要写这个答案。
Scriveners, stay your hand. Don't write that answer.

1211
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:51,839
琼，如果我们证明你违背了信仰，你愿意服从教会吗?
Joan, if we prove to you that you have acted against the faith, are you ready to submit to the church?

1212
01:56:52,034 --> 01:56:58,006
我求你相信，我永远不会做或说任何反对教会的事。
I beg you to believe that, I would never do or say anything against the church.

1213
01:56:58,036 --> 01:57:02,836
如果我做了这样的事，我一定会拒绝的。
And if I had done such a thing I would willingly reject it.

1214
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:07,911
-回答得好，琼。现在我…-如果你们接受法庭的裁决，你们就会拒绝自己的声音。
- That is a good answer Joan. Now I... - If you accept the decision of this court, you would reject your voices.

1215
01:57:08,094 --> 01:57:10,894
如果你仍然坚持你的声音是正确的，你就拒绝了教会。
If you still maintain that your voices are right, you reject the church.

1216
01:57:11,155 --> 01:57:12,755
如果你不服从，你就是个异教徒!
If you do not obey, you are a heretic!

1217
01:57:12,933 --> 01:57:16,733
我不会拒绝上帝和教会的声音!
I would not reject the voices of my Lord nor the church!

1218
01:57:22,423 --> 01:57:25,223
在我看来，一切都是一体的。
It seems to me that it is all one.

1219
01:57:25,485 --> 01:57:27,585
我们的主，我们的教会。
Our Lord and our church.

1220
01:57:28,298 --> 01:57:31,297
你为什么这么为难呢?
Why do you make such a difficulty about it?

1221
01:57:31,475 --> 01:57:34,075
你为什么在加冕礼上展示你的旗帜?
Why did you display your banner at the coronation?

1222
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:36,101
它分担了辛劳。
It had shared in the toil.

1223
01:57:36,231 --> 01:57:38,831
它应该分享荣誉，这是唯一正确的。
It was only right that it should share in the honour.

1224
01:57:39,055 --> 01:57:43,055
困苦人岂与你亲嘴，和你的衣服，为你作弥撒吗?
Did the poor kiss your hands and garments and have masses said for you?

1225
01:57:43,556 --> 01:57:46,756
他们高兴地来找我，我怎么能把他们推开呢?
They came to me happily, how could I push them away?

1226
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:49,580
如果他们为我祈祷，我相信他们没有做错。
And if they prayed for me, I believe they did no wrong.

1227
01:57:49,904 --> 01:57:51,904
你是穿着男人的衣服接受圣礼的吗?
Did you receive the sacraments in man's clothing?

1228
01:57:51,928 --> 01:57:55,928
-你为武器祝福了吗?-你找到你的国王了吗?
- Did you bless the weapons? - Did you seek out your King?

1229
01:58:00,452 --> 01:58:03,452
-诸位大人，我一次只能回答一个问题。
- My Lords, I can answer only one at a time.

1230
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:07,476
要自信，要骄傲，要自负!这些都是撒旦的罪!
To be sure of yourself, to be proud, to be boastful! These are the sins of Satan!

1231
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:10,700
她是一个异教徒，一个叛教者，一个女巫。
She is a heretic, an apostate, and a sorceress.

1232
01:58:11,024 --> 01:58:13,024
她必须上火刑柱。
And she must go to the stake.

1233
01:58:13,048 --> 01:58:16,048
但我们必须在她死前败坏她的名声。
But we must discredit her before she dies.

1234
01:58:16,049 --> 01:58:21,873
因为她不只是一个女巫，她是法国人民崇拜的象征。
For she is not just a sorceress, she is a symbol, adored by the people of France.

1235
01:58:22,197 --> 01:58:27,921
如果我们现在烧死她，她就成了殉道者，而这正是她的国王希望我们做的。
If we burn her now we make a martyr of her, and that's exactly what her King wants us to do.

1236
01:58:28,144 --> 01:58:41,293
但是，如果我们能迫使她放弃，宣誓放弃，放弃她的声音，她的使命和她的国王，人民就会对她失去信心，对由异教徒加冕的国王也会失去信心。
But, if we can force her to recant, to abjure, to renounce her voices, her mission and her King, the people will lose faith in her, and in the King that was crowned by a heretic.

1237
01:58:41,317 --> 01:58:44,917
他们会接受我们的亨利为合法的法国国王。
They will accept our Henry as the lawful King of France.

1238
01:58:44,941 --> 01:58:48,541
很好，主教大人，继续你的计划吧。
Very well, my lord bishop, proceed with your plan.

1239
01:58:49,142 --> 01:58:55,142
但让我提醒你，如果你想成为鲁昂大主教女仆必须死在火刑柱上。
But let me remind you: The maid must die at the stake if you're ever to be archbishop of Rouen.

1240
01:59:16,943 --> 01:59:23,344
那就是我自己了，如果你不听的话，这里会很好。
It's myself then, it could be nice in here if you don't listen.

1241
01:59:28,144 --> 01:59:29,744
好吧,姑娘。
Well, look wench.

1242
01:59:31,145 --> 01:59:34,145
我会解开你的枷锁。
I'll unlock your chains.

1243
01:59:34,169 --> 01:59:36,769
给你的肉体一个愈合的机会。
Give your flesh a chance to heal.

1244
01:59:37,693 --> 01:59:39,693
我会松开你的镣铐。
I'll loosen your fetters.

1245
01:59:40,917 --> 01:59:43,317
让你在牢房里走动。
Let you walk about the cell.

1246
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:46,441
我给你奶酪和酒。
I'll give you cheese and wine.

1247
01:59:46,742 --> 01:59:51,566
你会被烧死，你会在广场上被烧死，你会在不知道被亲吻是什么滋味的情况下死去。
You'll be burned, you'll be burning in the square, You'll die without knowing what it is to be kissed.

1248
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:55,490
看着我。看着我，丫头!
Look at me.  Look at me wench!

1249
01:59:55,914 --> 01:59:57,914
把你的手拿开!
Take your hands off her!

1250
01:59:59,738 --> 02:00:02,338
别给我下命令。你不过是个珀斯人。
Don't give me orders.  You're only a perth.

1251
02:00:02,662 --> 02:00:04,262
我将向船长报告你的情况。
I shall report you to the captain.

1252
02:00:04,686 --> 02:00:07,486
如果我是你，我就不会那么做，法国人。
You know, I wouldn't do that if I were you, Frenchman.

1253
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:11,510
-你不能为了我而冒险，神父。——我的孩子。
- You mustn't put yourself in danger for me Father. - My child.

1254
02:00:12,434 --> 02:00:15,634
我们有办法救你，琼。
We think we know a way to save you Joan.

1255
02:00:16,358 --> 02:00:17,958
我不想死!
I don't want to die!

1256
02:00:18,982 --> 02:00:21,182
但我不能否认我的声音。
But I cannot deny my voices.

1257
02:00:21,206 --> 02:00:24,406
为了救我的命，我不惜牺牲我的灵魂。
I'll damn my soul to save my life.

1258
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,430
另一种方式。
There's another way.

1259
02:00:26,731 --> 02:00:27,930
向教皇的申诉。
An appeal to the Pope.

1260
02:00:28,154 --> 02:00:33,154
这是礼拜仪式上的事，我的孩子，但看来如果你提出这样的上诉他们就不能继续这场可耻的审判了。
These are liturgical matters, my child, but it seems if you make such an appeal they cannot continue with this shameful trial.

1261
02:00:33,578 --> 02:00:40,202
根据教会的法律，他们必须把你送到罗马，或者提交一份报告，等待教皇的决定。
According to the laws of the Church, they must send you to Rome, or submit a report and wait for the Pope's decision.

1262
02:00:41,726 --> 02:00:44,126
我希望我能去罗马。
I wish I could go to Rome.

1263
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:47,550
教皇……会相信我。
The Pope...would believe me.

1264
02:00:47,874 --> 02:00:50,474
谁允许你进这间牢房的?
Who gave you permission to enter this cell?

1265
02:00:51,898 --> 02:00:53,698
马上离开这里。
Get out of here at once.

1266
02:00:58,222 --> 02:00:59,622
你提交吗?
Do you submit?

1267
02:01:01,052 --> 02:01:05,424
我向在罗马的教皇呼吁。
I appeal to the Pope who is at Rome.

1268
02:01:06,081 --> 02:01:09,481
带我去那里，我就臣服于他。
Take me there and I shall submit to him.

1269
02:01:15,361 --> 02:01:16,761
——沉默!
- Silence!

1270
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,160
这事很严重，大人。
This is very serious, my Lord.

1271
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:22,216
-她有权利这么做。-上诉费用昂贵。
- She is within her rights. - This appeal is expensive.

1272
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:25,110
-我们不能继续审判了。-我们继续。
- We cannot proceed with the trial. - We shall proceed.

1273
02:01:25,382 --> 02:01:31,381
但如果我们继续，审判将是非法的，判决也将无效。
But if we were to continue, the trial would be illegal and the verdict null.

1274
02:01:31,672 --> 02:01:34,872
-你得救了，琼。魔鬼的尾巴，神父!
- You're saved, Joan. - The devil's tail, Priest!

1275
02:01:34,944 --> 02:01:37,944
如果再让我看见你跟她说话我就把你扔进塞纳河。
If I see you whisper to her again I'll have you thrown into the Seine.

1276
02:01:38,153 --> 02:01:41,353
至于这次向教皇的请求，我拒绝允许。
As for this appeal to the Pope, I refuse to allow it.

1277
02:01:41,609 --> 02:01:44,009
这里是国王发号施令，不是教皇。
The King commands here, not the Pope.

1278
02:01:44,224 --> 02:01:46,824
他为这个女巫付出了高昂的代价。
He's paid a high price for this witch.

1279
02:01:46,984 --> 02:01:52,267
他还为你们的服务买单，我的硕士，医生和主教们。
And he's also paying for your services, my Masters, Doctors and Bishops.

1280
02:01:52,519 --> 02:01:56,719
这就是为什么我呼吁教皇，他不听任何国王的命令。
That is why I appeal to the Pope, who takes orders from no King.

1281
02:01:56,875 --> 02:01:59,675
上诉被驳回了。把它从记录中删除!
The appeal is overruled. Erase it from the record!

1282
02:01:59,805 --> 02:02:04,605
是的，你当然写了反对我的东西，但没有写支持我的东西。
Yes, you surely write what is against me but nothing that is for me.

1283
02:02:04,707 --> 02:02:05,907
带她走!
Take her away!

1284
02:02:10,967 --> 02:02:13,367
各位大人，请注意?
May I have your attention, my Lords?

1285
02:02:13,512 --> 02:02:22,526
波维主教大人把这案子的起诉书寄给我，请我把我对这次审判的意见告诉他。
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvais, sent me the articles of accusation of this case, and asked me to give him my opinion of the conduct of this trial.

1286
02:02:22,745 --> 02:02:27,568
是的，陛下，但我不希望您亲自来见我。
Quite so your Grace, but I would hardly hope that you would trouble yourself to appear in person.

1287
02:02:27,574 --> 02:02:31,174
我担心我的信会丢失，就像许多其他的信一样。
I fear that my letter might become lost, as so many others have.

1288
02:02:31,282 --> 02:02:36,282
然而，在目睹了今天的会议之后，我准备提出我的意见。
However, having witnessed today's session, I am ready to render my opinion.

1289
02:02:36,442 --> 02:02:38,242
记下来，抄写员。
Write this down, scribe.

1290
02:02:38,609 --> 02:02:44,409
我，简，阿夫兰契主教，宣布这次审判是非法的。
I, Jean, Bishop of Avranches, declare that this trial is unlawful.

1291
02:02:44,501 --> 02:02:52,737
被告提出的上诉在我和其他人的见证下，绝对是完全无效的。
That the appeal made by the accused and witnessed by me among others, is definitely and completely suspensive.

1292
02:02:52,796 --> 02:02:57,458
今后有关此案的所有程序都必须交由罗马处理。
And that all future procedure of this case must be referred to Rome.

1293
02:02:57,531 --> 02:03:07,644
-我们去我家吧…-如果女仆的上诉被驳回，这就进一步证明了在基督教世界中广为流传的谣言
- Why don't we go to my apartment... - If the maid's appeal is overruled, it is further proof of the widespread rumours that circulate throughout the Christian world

1294
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:11,300
这不是宗教审判，而是政治审判。
that this is not a religious but a political trial.

1295
02:03:11,434 --> 02:03:18,695
我警告你们，你们这些所谓的法官，你们可能会成功地把她送上火刑柱。
I warn you, you the so called judges, you may succeed in sending her to the stake.

1296
02:03:18,768 --> 02:03:22,768
但总有一天，你们的英格兰国王会为这些事感到羞愧。
But one day, your English King will be ashamed of these proceedings.

1297
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:25,859
罗马会公布这女孩的真相。
Rome will declare the truth about this girl.

1298
02:03:25,994 --> 02:03:31,494
而法国也会因为她的诞生而赞美她。
And France will praise the maid for it's birth as one nation.

1299
02:03:31,928 --> 02:03:45,780
至于你，皮埃尔·高雄，波维主教，我宣布你为叛徒，因为你背叛了你的国家，你背叛了……你的教会。
And as for you, Pierre Cauchon, Count Bishop of Beauvais, I declare you a traitor, for you have betrayed your country and you betray... your church.

1300
02:03:47,651 --> 02:03:53,791
陛下，现在我不能允许……我不允许……
Your Grace, at this time I cannot permit... I will not permit...

1301
02:04:03,515 --> 02:04:05,515
春天来了,爸爸。
It's spring, father.

1302
02:04:05,739 --> 02:04:09,539
是的，孩子，今天是5月9日。
Yes child, it's the 9th day of May.

1303
02:04:43,162 --> 02:04:49,386
我们已经尽力避免了，琼，但你固执傲慢的态度让我们别无选择。
We have tried to avoid this Joan, but your stubborn and arrogant attitude has left us with no alternative.

1304
02:04:49,687 --> 02:04:56,512
如果你继续隐瞒真相，如果你坚持你的异端邪说，你将会受到折磨。
If you continue to hide the truth, if you persist in your heresy, you will be put to the torture.

1305
02:04:56,836 --> 02:04:58,136
琼，还有时间。
Joan, there is still time.

1306
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:00,360
你必须承认你的声音是邪恶的。
You must admit that your voices are evil.

1307
02:05:00,484 --> 02:05:02,984
他们骗了你，就像你骗了我们一样。
They have lied to you just as you have lied to us.

1308
02:05:03,285 --> 02:05:05,285
不，他们只告诉我真相!
No, they tell me only truth!

1309
02:05:07,386 --> 02:05:13,087
尽管我不知道他们说的"拯救"或"胜利"是什么意思。
Even though I don't know what they mean by my rescue, or my victory.

1310
02:05:15,688 --> 02:05:18,688
上帝的方式并不总是我们的方式。
God's ways are not always our ways.

1311
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:20,812
你自找苦吃。
You have asked for your torture.

1312
02:05:22,036 --> 02:05:28,159
如果你把我撕成碎片，把我的灵魂从我的身体里分离出来，我不会否认我的声音!
If you tear me limb from limb, separate my soul from my body, I will not deny my voices!

1313
02:05:28,983 --> 02:05:33,983
如果我说了，我以后就会说，是你强迫我说的!
And if I did, I would always declare afterwards that you had compelled me to say it by force!

1314
02:05:35,384 --> 02:05:45,887
我问过我的声音……如果我被烧死……他们告诉我要完全依赖…在神。
I have asked my voices... if I would be burned... and they have told me to rely entirely... on God.

1315
02:05:50,986 --> 02:05:54,986
明天早上，在圣图安的墓地，我们决定进行最后一次治疗。
Tomorrow morning, in the cemetery of St Ouen, we've decided to hold our last session.

1316
02:05:55,189 --> 02:05:58,389
征得你医生的同意，我们要带琼去那里。
With your physician's consent, we are taking Joan there.

1317
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:04,501
如果她再拒绝放弃宣誓，我们就抛弃她把她交给民政当局。
And if she again refuses to abjure, we're abandoning her and handing her over to the civil authorities.

1318
02:06:04,558 --> 02:06:08,719
我将下令在准备就绪的情况下执行。
I shall order the execution under being readiness.

1319
02:06:09,108 --> 02:06:15,895
这个琼，你们眼前看到的，已经从错误堕落到错误，从罪恶堕落到罪恶。
This Joan, whom you see before you, has fallen from error into error, from crime into crime.

1320
02:06:16,151 --> 02:06:19,370
法国以前从来没有出现过这样一个怪物。
Never before in France has there appeared such a monster.

1321
02:06:19,518 --> 02:06:22,836
她是个女巫，异教徒，分裂者。
She is a witch, a heretic, a schismatic.

1322
02:06:22,885 --> 02:06:32,807
就连她的国王本身也是个异教徒，因为他想要在这样一个叛教者的帮助下重获王位，我们把你带到这里
Even her King himself is a heretic, because he sought to regain his throne with the help of such an apostate, we brought you here to this

1323
02:06:32,879 --> 02:06:37,079
神圣而古老的墓地给你最后的公开机会。
sacred and ancient cemetery to give you your last chance in public.

1324
02:06:37,297 --> 02:06:43,632
你们愿意还是不愿意撤销你们的声音所驱使你们以及你们的法官所判你们有罪的所有行为?
Will you or will you not revoke all the acts to which your voices drove you and which where your judges have condemned?

1325
02:06:47,624 --> 02:06:48,624
烧女巫!
Burn the witch!

1326
02:06:48,686 --> 02:06:49,686
烧女巫!
Burn the witch!

1327
02:06:50,884 --> 02:06:54,484
我向上帝和我们的圣父教皇屈服。
I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope.

1328
02:06:54,651 --> 02:06:56,651
教皇在罗马，我们不能走得太远。
The Pope is in Rome, we cannot go so far.

1329
02:06:56,708 --> 02:06:58,108
你必须服从我们。
You must submit to us.

1330
02:06:58,213 --> 02:07:01,413
如果你不这么做，我们现在就把你交给刽子手。
If you do not, we shall hand you over to the executioner now.

1331
02:07:03,725 --> 02:07:06,715
我向上帝和我们的圣父教皇屈服。
I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope.

1332
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,949
你必须向我们投降，否则就得死。
You must submit to us or die.

1333
02:07:12,942 --> 02:07:16,142
如果你投降，我们就送你去教堂监狱。
If you submit, we'll send you to a church prison.

1334
02:07:16,334 --> 02:07:21,960
你听见了吗，琼。如果你投降，你会被带到教堂监狱那里会有女人保护你。
Do you hear, Joan. If you submit, you'll be taken to a church prison where there will be women to guard you.

1335
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:35,820
琼，他在宣读你被逐出教会的判决。
Joan, he's reading the sentence of your excommunication.

1336
02:07:36,418 --> 02:07:37,418
提交。
Submit.

1337
02:07:45,751 --> 02:07:47,251
-这意味着她的死亡——签名,琼!
- This means her death. - Sign, Joan!

1338
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:51,819
发誓放弃!
Abjure!

1339
02:07:58,366 --> 02:07:59,366
发誓放弃!
Abjure!

1340
02:07:59,869 --> 02:08:00,869
发誓放弃?
Abjure?

1341
02:08:02,049 --> 02:08:04,449
宣誓放弃是什么意思?
What does it mean to abjure?

1342
02:08:05,247 --> 02:08:07,647
这意味着服从你的法官。
It means to submit to your judges.

1343
02:08:08,199 --> 02:08:11,999
如果你这样做了，你就能从火里逃出来你也会被从英国监狱里救出来。
If you do, you can escape the fire and you'll be delivered from the English prison.

1344
02:08:14,968 --> 02:08:16,768
几乎,甜蜜的神。
Almost, sweet God.

1345
02:08:22,198 --> 02:08:23,198
提交!提交!
Submit! Submit!

1346
02:08:30,275 --> 02:08:34,833
——避免琼!——发誓放弃!
- Abjure Joan! - Abjure!

1347
02:08:36,191 --> 02:08:41,191
——发誓放弃!——请发誓放弃!
- Abjure! - Please abjure!

1348
02:08:41,848 --> 02:08:44,448
拯救你自己!拯救自己,琼!
Save yourself! Save yourself, Joan!

1349
02:09:01,763 --> 02:09:06,728
我把我的言行都交给你。
I submit my words and actions to you.

1350
02:09:07,824 --> 02:09:13,224
-我宁愿发誓也不愿被烧死。她是自个儿投降的!她提交!
- I'd rather abjure than be burned. - She submits herself! She submits!

1351
02:09:41,053 --> 02:09:43,453
不,琼。你必须签上你的名字。
No, Joan. You must sign your name.

1352
02:10:09,088 --> 02:10:10,088
安静!
Silence!

1353
02:10:10,132 --> 02:10:11,732
女仆屈服了。
The maid has submitted.

1354
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:14,100
我们必须怀着悔悟的心情接待她。
We must receive her with penitence.

1355
02:10:16,175 --> 02:10:18,575
奉主之名，阿门。
In the name of our Lord, Amen.

1356
02:10:18,817 --> 02:10:22,467
你终于回到了我们教会的怀抱。
At last, you've come back to the bosom of our mother church.

1357
02:10:22,479 --> 02:10:26,078
因此我们免除了你被逐出教会的责任。
And thus we absolve you from the excommunication.

1358
02:10:26,374 --> 02:10:29,074
但为了赎罪你的罪行。
But in order that you should expiate your crimes.

1359
02:10:29,345 --> 02:10:39,505
为不叫你们又回到异端去，我们定你们永远在监里，吃的是忧愁，喝的是苦难。
And to make sure that you will not fall back into heresy, we condemn you to perpetual prison, to the bread of sorrow, and the water of affliction.

1360
02:10:44,976 --> 02:10:49,336
神父，带我去你的教堂监狱。
Father, take me to your church prison.

1361
02:10:49,891 --> 02:10:52,291
给我女人来保护我。
Give me women to guard me.

1362
02:10:53,615 --> 02:10:54,815
她逃脱了。
She's escaped.

1363
02:10:55,139 --> 02:10:57,339
你欺骗了我们，你背叛了国王。
You've deceived us, and you've betrayed the King.

1364
02:10:58,063 --> 02:10:59,563
你要是相信她就好了?
If only you would trust her ?

1365
02:10:59,587 --> 02:11:02,587
我跟你说了一遍又一遍。她会烧。
I've told you and again and again. She will burn.

1366
02:11:03,111 --> 02:11:04,111
我们会抓住她的。
We shall catch her yet.

1367
02:11:04,235 --> 02:11:06,835
我们会送你一件女士礼服，穿上。
We will send you a woman's dress, wear it.

1368
02:11:06,836 --> 02:11:09,436
不要再穿男人的衣服了。
Do not wear the attire of a man ever again.

1369
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:10,660
我会服从。
I'll obey.

1370
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,040
不!不!
No! No!

1371
02:11:19,345 --> 02:11:22,544
不!他们说要带我去教堂监狱!
No!  They told me they would take me to church prison!

1372
02:11:22,809 --> 02:11:26,209
哦!他们骗了我!他们骗了我!
Oh! They lied to me! They lied to me!

1373
02:11:26,965 --> 02:11:28,478
哦!不!
Oh! No!

1374
02:12:05,183 --> 02:12:07,383
哦,甜蜜的神。
Oh, sweet God.

1375
02:12:09,442 --> 02:12:12,642
原谅我。原谅我。
Forgive me. Forgive me.

1376
02:12:15,975 --> 02:12:18,075
我很害怕。
I was afraid.

1377
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:27,614
我说的……是怕火。
What I said... was for fear of the fire.

1378
02:12:29,037 --> 02:12:31,237
我诅咒了我的灵魂
I have damned my soul

1379
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:36,420
为了救我的命。
to save my life.

1380
02:13:19,224 --> 02:13:21,224
你对我说，
You speak to me,

1381
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:26,969
我拒绝了你
and I denied you.

1382
02:14:12,793 --> 02:14:13,993
我的孩子……
My child...

1383
02:14:16,817 --> 02:14:20,817
你的女人的衣服。你还没换呢。
Your woman's dress. You haven't changed into it.

1384
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:26,664
他们今天早上来确认你遵守了誓言，而你却违背了誓言!
They come this morning to make sure you kept your oath and you've broken it!

1385
02:14:28,488 --> 02:14:30,488
你必须把这个穿上。
You must put this on.

1386
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:34,912
在他们到来之前赶快穿上。警卫会解开你的镣铐。
Put it on quickly before they arrive. The guards will unlock your bonds.

1387
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:39,136
那太迟了。
It's too late.

1388
02:14:44,349 --> 02:14:47,549
正如我所料。她没有遵守诺言。
Exactly as I expected. She has not kept her word.

1389
02:14:47,614 --> 02:14:50,214
-她说的都是废话。-她说的都是真的。
- She meant nothing of what she said. - She meant all that she said.

1390
02:14:50,279 --> 02:14:54,079
但我们没有诚实地对待她。守卫还在这里，和以前一样。
But we have not dealt honestly with her. The guards are still here, just as before.

1391
02:14:54,205 --> 02:14:55,405
她保留了男人的衣服。
She has retained the clothes of a man.

1392
02:14:55,448 --> 02:14:58,848
她违背了她签署的弃权书!-我们让她无法保留它。
- She has broken her signed abjuration! - We made it impossible for her to keep it.

1393
02:14:58,916 --> 02:15:00,716
你在这里做得太过分了，简少爷!
You exceed your function here, Master Jean!

1394
02:15:00,734 --> 02:15:02,134
我向审判官上诉。
I appeal to the Inquisitor.

1395
02:15:02,222 --> 02:15:04,222
她只会被判刑，别无他求。
She shall have her sentence and nothing else.

1396
02:15:04,238 --> 02:15:05,238
等一下，各位大人。
One moment, my Lords.

1397
02:15:05,630 --> 02:15:12,362
如果这女孩是被骗违背誓言的，我不会对她判刑。
If this girl has been tricked into breaking her vow, I will not share in a sentence against her.

1398
02:15:12,466 --> 02:15:17,815
如果我们离开你的牢房，我们所有人，你会穿上这条裙子吗?
If we leave your cell, all of us, will you put on this dress?

1399
02:15:24,788 --> 02:15:27,788
不，大人，我不会的。
No, my Lord, I will not.

1400
02:15:28,423 --> 02:15:31,223
我又听到自己的声音了。
I've heard my voices again.

1401
02:15:31,409 --> 02:15:37,409
他们告诉我，我否认他们是做了一件非常邪恶的事，但他们原谅了我。
They told me I did a very wicked thing by denying them but they have forgiven me.

1402
02:15:38,662 --> 02:15:44,362
我对他们有信心。我一点都不喜欢你。
I have faith in them. I have none in you.

1403
02:15:45,341 --> 02:15:46,841
这是一个致命的答案。
This is a fatal answer.

1404
02:15:48,106 --> 02:15:52,177
琼，你知道这意味着什么吗?
Joan, Do you know what this means?

1405
02:15:53,201 --> 02:15:54,801
意思是火。
It means the fire.

1406
02:15:55,025 --> 02:15:56,241
你的死亡。
Your death.

1407
02:15:56,442 --> 02:16:04,858
没有信仰的生活比烈火更可怕，比英年早逝更可怕。
To live without faith is more terrible than the fire, more terrible than dying young.

1408
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:08,599
我在这里没什么事可做。
I have nothing more to do here.

1409
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:12,111
让我回到我所为之而来的上帝那里。
Send me back to God for whom I came.

1410
02:16:13,335 --> 02:16:15,935
请放心，大人。一切都结束了。
Be of good cheer, my lord.  It is all over.

1411
02:16:15,959 --> 02:16:17,959
是的。剩下的交给刽子手。
Yes.  The executioner will see to the rest.

1412
02:16:17,983 --> 02:16:19,983
我该写些什么记录呢?
What shall I write for the records?

1413
02:16:20,207 --> 02:16:22,206
写她已经复发了。
Write that she has relapsed.

1414
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:24,130
我们被迫放弃。
We are forced to abandon.

1415
02:16:26,554 --> 02:16:30,754
主教……我因你而死。
Bishop...I die through you.

1416
02:16:59,955 --> 02:17:03,555
如果她被逐出教会了，为什么他们要赦免她，给她圣餐?
If she's excommunicated, why do they give her absolution and holy communion?

1417
02:17:03,856 --> 02:17:07,056
主教说，女仆想要什么就给她什么。
The bishop said give the maid everything she wants.

1418
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:08,280
他老是自相矛盾。
He keeps contradicting himself.

1419
02:17:08,304 --> 02:17:11,904
这又一次证明了他的矛盾和内疚。
It's another proof of his inconsistency and guilty conscience.

1420
02:17:11,928 --> 02:17:14,528
它很快就会死去。
It cannot take long to die.

1421
02:17:17,152 --> 02:17:20,151
会有一点痛苦，但很快就会结束。
There will be a little pain but then it will end.

1422
02:17:25,675 --> 02:17:30,799
疼痛会很大……但这一切终将结束。
The pain won't be little... but it will end.

1423
02:17:50,123 --> 02:17:53,123
我现在看得很清楚。
I see it so clearly now.

1424
02:17:55,647 --> 02:17:59,748
我的胜利，是我的殉难。
My victory, is my martyrdom.

1425
02:18:02,372 --> 02:18:03,372
我逃跑。
My escape.

1426
02:18:05,396 --> 02:18:06,596
我的死亡。
My death.

1427
02:18:42,274 --> 02:18:44,974
向后站!后退!
Stand back! Back away!

1428
02:18:50,698 --> 02:18:51,698
离开!
Get away!

1429
02:18:53,822 --> 02:18:55,422
把警卫!
Pull the guards!

1430
02:19:00,946 --> 02:19:01,946
女巫!
Sorceress!

1431
02:19:26,869 --> 02:19:28,869
上帝与你同在，琼!
God be with you Joan!

1432
02:19:34,193 --> 02:19:38,193
原谅我!女仆的上帝!原谅我!原谅我!
Forgive me! Maid of God! Forgive me! Forgive me!

1433
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:40,917
主啊，饶恕我们吧!
Oh, Lord, pardon us all!

1434
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:47,341
这伤害了!
That hurts!

1435
02:19:59,865 --> 02:20:01,465
只有一个孩子!
Only a child!

1436
02:20:17,289 --> 02:20:18,489
救救她!
Save her!

1437
02:20:18,512 --> 02:20:19,912
让开!
Get out of the way!

1438
02:20:32,336 --> 02:20:35,136
后退!后退!
Back away! Back away!

1439
02:20:37,044 --> 02:20:39,644
你，魔鬼毕夏普!
You, the devil Bishop!

1440
02:20:43,395 --> 02:20:46,595
奉主之名，阿门。
In the name of our Lord, Amen.

1441
02:20:47,928 --> 02:20:49,928
我能画个十字吗?
Could I have a cross?

1442
02:20:49,966 --> 02:20:51,666
握在我手中!
To hold in my hands!

1443
02:20:51,754 --> 02:20:58,199
啊，多么可耻，在你们放弃了自己的错误之后，异端邪说的魔鬼又在你们心中升起来了。
Ah, what shame that after the abjuration of your errors, the devil of heresy has once more risen in your heart.

1444
02:20:58,345 --> 02:21:10,659
你又犯了罪，因此我们法官同样裁定你，琼，通常被称为女仆，一直在谈论你假装的神圣启示。
You have returned to your crimes, therefore we the judges same decree that you, Joan, commonly called the maid, have been on the subject of your pretended divine revelations.

1445
02:21:10,704 --> 02:21:13,329
-一个旧病复发的异教徒-上帝保佑你
- A relapsed heretic, - God bless you.

1446
02:21:13,379 --> 02:21:21,457
一个女巫，说谎，诱惑，恶毒，傲慢，煽动，残忍，叛教，分裂。
A sorceress, lying, seducing, pernicious, presumptuous, seditious, cruel, apostate and schismatic.

1447
02:21:21,517 --> 02:21:32,903
因此，我们把你交给当局，请求同样的当局，如果你真有悔悟的迹象，请他们原谅你的判断
And so we abandon you to the civil authority, requesting the same authority that it may be pleased to moderate its judgement and if true signs of penitence should appear

1448
02:21:32,939 --> 02:21:38,254
让忏悔的圣礼得以施行。
that the sacrament of penance may be administered to you.

1449
02:21:39,849 --> 02:21:41,849
我是一个虔诚的基督徒。
I am a good Christian.

1450
02:21:46,427 --> 02:21:50,027
刽子手!做你的责任!
Executioner! Do your duty!

1451
02:22:39,550 --> 02:22:40,550
胆小鬼!
Coward!

1452
02:22:40,874 --> 02:22:41,874
异端!
Heresy!

1453
02:22:45,198 --> 02:22:56,346
哦，错误的人，背叛自己和国家的人，你们把伟大和不朽的名字强加给你们的头号敌人。
Oh mistaken men, traitors to yourselves and your country, you thrust greatness and an undying name upon your chief enemy.

1454
02:22:57,670 --> 02:23:12,442
现在，刽子手已经点燃了柴捆，把她的灵魂从火中唤醒，把她的身体抛向风中，你将永远不会听到今天工作的结束。
Now the executioner has lighted the faggots, and sends her spirit up from the fire, and cast her body to the winds, and you shall never hear the end of this day's work.

1455
02:23:13,066 --> 02:23:26,390
几场胜利的胜利可以被当做九天的奇迹，但你让她成为了一个象征，她的骨灰和话语会像种子一样在沙漠和道路上生根。
The winning of a few victories that could put aside as a nine days wonder, but you've made her a symbol, and her ashes and her words will blow like seeds and take roots on deserts and pavement.

1456
02:23:27,891 --> 02:23:33,115
他们将成为传令官和先知，传播她的名声。
They will flower into heralds and prophets, to spread her fame.

1457
02:23:34,839 --> 02:23:50,589
这将是她的时代，她的世纪，而我们所有人，牧师和国王，都将是她悲剧中的小角色。
This will be her age, her century, and all the rest of us, priests and kings, will be minor figures in her tragedy.

1458
02:23:55,873 --> 02:23:57,673
父亲，为我祈祷吧。
Father, pray for me.

1459
02:23:57,758 --> 02:24:01,958
我将永远被诅咒，我烧死了一个圣人!
I shall be damned forever, I've burned a Saint!

1460
02:24:04,102 --> 02:24:11,738
去吧，上帝的孩子，法兰西的女儿!
Go, child of God, daughter of France!

1461
02:24:13,006 --> 02:24:13,706
走了。
Go.

1462
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:18,199
——走吧!-天啊。
- Go! - Oh, sweet God.

1463
02:24:19,735 --> 02:24:22,935
你一直和我在一起。
You who have been with me always.

1464
02:24:24,377 --> 02:24:29,031
现在和我在一起，穿越黑暗。
Be with me now, through the darkness.

1465
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:33,530
因为我无意伤害任何人。
For I meant to hurt no one.

1466
02:24:35,766 --> 02:24:38,566
不要为我受伤。
Let none be hurt for me.

1467
02:24:39,061 --> 02:24:42,790
来帮助她吧，上帝的圣徒们。
Come to her assistance, ye saints of God.

1468
02:24:42,862 --> 02:24:46,462
主的使者啊，出来迎接她吧。
Come forth to meet her, ye angels of the Lord.

1469
02:24:46,474 --> 02:24:51,674
接受她的灵魂，在至尊面前献上。
Receiving her soul, offering it in the sight of the most high.

1470
02:24:52,253 --> 02:24:58,128
愿基督与你合唱，愿天使带领你进入天堂。
May Christ receive you with chorally and may the angels lead thee into paradise.

1471
02:24:59,777 --> 02:25:07,696
…以及我们死亡的时刻
…阿们。
And... and the the hour of our death... amen.

1472
02:25:11,380 --> 02:25:12,580
耶稣。
Jesus.
