1
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,119
<i>The summer I was 11...</i>

2
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:48,429
<i>I was desperately in love
with the waitress in Hal's Café.</i>

3
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,298
<i>Her name was Jeanetta.</i>

4
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,640
<i>I thought she was beautiful...</i>

5
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,141
<i>but there was something beyond that,
something magical about her...</i>

6
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,041
<i>the way there is
about some movie stars.</i>

7
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,384
How you guys doin'?
You need more coffee?

8
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,292
<i>It was a wasted summer
in every other way.</i>

9
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,229
<i>My little brother Ask and I
spend every morning...</i>

10
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,827
<i>down at Hal's drinking Cokes
while I mooned overJeanetta.</i>

11
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,731
<i>There was a night that summer
when my brother Charley...</i>

12
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,403
<i>got stuck baby-sitting
Ask and me.</i>

13
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,569
<i>Charley had plans that night...</i>

14
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,878
<i>and he wasn't about to break them
just to look after us...</i>

15
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,918
<i>so he did something
we could never have imagined.</i>

16
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,922
<i>He offered to take us with him.</i>

17
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,585
<i>And he made us swear
we wouldn't tell Mom and Dad.</i>

18
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,150
So, boys...

19
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,589
got any chicks
lined up for tonight?

20
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,327
- Yeah, sure, Limber.
- Yeah, right.

21
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,528
You just better not
be hitting on mine.

22
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,950
<i>Charley's moods were up and down
that whole summer.</i>

23
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,622
<i>We were moving across the country
to Tacoma, Washington.</i>

24
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,460
<i>My dad was fed up with teaching...</i>

25
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,228
<i>and he was going into business
with a friend.</i>

26
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,929
<i>Charley was angry
at having to miss...</i>

27
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,870
<i>his senior year in high school
with his friends.</i>

28
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,913
<i>Charley had always seemed
mysterious to Ask and me.</i>

29
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,578
<i>He was our brother,
but he was older...</i>

30
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,087
<i>and his world
was different from ours.</i>

31
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,716
<i>And even when he wasn't
angry about moving...</i>

32
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,090
<i>his moods had a way
of surprising you-</i>

33
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,187
<i>sometimes good,
sometimes bad-</i>

34
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,425
<i>and you never knew
which was coming.</i>

35
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,936
- You guys want a beer?
- Sure.

36
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,831
Be cool about it.

37
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,879
Very smooth.

38
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,685
A couple of dudes in the back seat.

39
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,098
Where you buttheads been?

40
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,396
What's going on?

41
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,841
Jeanetta's in there dancing
with anything that moves.

42
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,703
Oh, boy.

43
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,011
Okay, I'm gonna go inside
and check out the girls.

44
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,385
If there's any left over,
I'll bring some out for you guys.

45
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,618
Okay.

46
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,752
Don't let anybody see you
drinking that beer.

47
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,352
Okay?

48
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,605
I'm gonna go take a look.

49
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,167
You'd better not.

50
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,219
- How've you been?
- Great.

51
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,559
You wanna dance?

52
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,994
Yeah.

53
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,271
Fuck you.

54
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,711
<i>I was embarrassed
by what Charley had said...</i>

55
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:46,047
<i>butJeanetta said she understood
and that Charley was just upset.</i>

56
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,646
<i>She asked when we were moving.</i>

57
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,951
<i>She made me promise
to write to her.</i>

58
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,649
<i>And then she did a funny thing.</i>

59
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,786
<i>She kissed me...</i>

60
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,259
<i>on the lips too.</i>

61
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,265
<i>And I wished Ask had seen it,
because I knew he'd never believe me.</i>

62
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,135
<i>- You're gonna have lots of girlfriends.
- And then Charley came.</i>

63
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,696
Tom!

64
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,436
Well, bye.

65
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,343
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

66
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,662
How come you said that
toJeanetta?

67
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,942
She wants me to deliver
a message to Dad.

68
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,607
What message?

69
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,483
She said to tell him...

70
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,053
that she'll wait for him
to work things out.

71
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,788
Bull.

72
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,860
No bull.

73
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,111
What the hell happened toJeanetta,
Charley? I missed my dance.

74
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,677
What's wrong?

75
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,625
<i>We moved to Washington
later that summer...</i>

76
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,999
<i>although it seemed
like a waste of effort.</i>

77
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,632
<i>My father sold his business after a year
and went back to teaching.</i>

78
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,806
<i>No one ever spoke
of that night at Hal's again...</i>

79
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,143
<i>and after a while
the memory of it faded.</i>

80
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,480
<i>And there were times I couldn't swear
to you that it really happened.</i>

81
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,746
<i>Sometimes I think being a kid
is like that-</i>

82
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,416
<i>the things that happen
are like in a dream.</i>

83
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,925
<i>Then you get older
and you wake up...</i>

84
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,258
<i>and you see them
in a different, clear way...</i>

85
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,662
<i>and you hope
it's not too late to matter.</i>

86
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,590
Hey. I was gonna pick you up
at the bus station.

87
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,423
I had a little money for a cab.

88
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,486
Yeah, well, welcome home.

89
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,761
- How you doing?
- Okay.

90
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,325
Let me grab this.

91
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,504
Ooh! What have you got
in these things?

92
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,064
- Books.
- Yeah?

93
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,632
Yeah. Here.

94
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,781
God, you look great.
Berkeley hasn't changed you a bit.

95
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,612
- Huh.
- So what's up?

96
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,447
It's good to be home.

97
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,764
There's not gonna be a party,
is there?

98
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,107
Hi, Tom.

99
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,575
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh, let me see you.

100
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,738
Hey, put his luggage away.
It looks like he's leaving.

101
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,477
- Don't you eat? You look skinny.
- Oh, he does not.

102
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,520
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

103
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,048
Well, listen. I have some things to
finish in the kitchen, okay?

104
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,094
- Would you get Cassie? She's upstairs.
- Sure.

105
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,256
Edward, would you and Ask move
the furniture, please? We're almost ready.

106
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,596
Yeah. Let's just slide
the couch back against the wall.

107
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,101
Okay. Well, let's get the table first.

108
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,769
Leave that suitcase, Tom.
I'll get that one.

109
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,104
- Okay.
- Where's Charley?

110
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,076
I think he's getting the beer.

111
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,607
- Tom here yet?
- Yeah.

112
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,085
Yeah, he just got in.
He's waking up Cassie.

113
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,345
No, he isn't.

114
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,261
Charley, is all that gonna fit?

115
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,223
We'll just have
to throw out the food.

116
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,465
Yeah, right, and knock back
a few brewskies, right?

117
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,563
- Let me have one.
- Keep your hands off.

118
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,871
- I'm gonna get it.
- Stop it.

119
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,981
Come in.

120
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,223
- Hi.
- Thanks.

121
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,325
So?

122
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,494
What happened?

123
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,808
Couldn't dig in.

124
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,975
Was it because of Eileen?

125
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,404
Maybe.

126
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,374
Hey.

127
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,084
You know anything about this letter?

128
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,816
No. Did she send you a letter?

129
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,014
Sort of.

130
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,626
You gonna see her?

131
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,029
- What for?
- To talk.

132
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,730
Ask, she's married to Sam Crawford.

133
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,241
She's pregnant.
What am I gonna talk to her about?

134
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,607
You could talk.
Communication never hurts.

135
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,485
Tom, get down here!

136
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,824
Hi, honey. Come on.

137
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,761
Party time.

138
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,167
- Charley. Hi.
- How are you?

139
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,368
Welcome to hard times.

140
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:05,480
Hey, come on, Charley.
Please put me down. Hey!

141
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,729
Cassie's cake.

142
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,193
- Aw, Cassie!
- Yeah.

143
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,461
- Looks great, Cassie.
- Come here. Thank you.

144
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,230
I made it for you.

145
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,494
Come on, Ask.

146
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,973
- Does everybody have a drink?
- Happiness.

147
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,240
Well, I believe I last
stood here to commemorate...

148
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,748
the scientific achievements
of our own Askew Warren...

149
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,918
whose volcano project
had just exploded...

150
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,920
spewing forth a rich brown lava...

151
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,582
redecorating the entire
science laboratory.

152
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,215
Thank you. Thank you.

153
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,761
And before that,
if I'm not mistaken...

154
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,923
we celebrated Cassie's performance
in the school play.

155
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,160
Yes. I meant to do that, Dad.

156
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,136
When she forgot her lines and decided
her character should die on stage.

157
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,368
- It was a noble death.
- It shortened the play.

158
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,000
And in that spirit...

159
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,204
we welcome...

160
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,769
- Tom Warren!
- Go, Tom.

161
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,214
Home from school
before a single year has elapsed.

162
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,549
Just a few weeks shy
of his final exams.

163
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,516
He puts us in mind of the great man
who once said...

164
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,582
"Half the failures in life...

165
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,786
arise from pulling
in one's horse as he's leaping. "

166
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,526
- Yeah!
- Let the banner fall.

167
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,204
"You must know home
to be a traveler. "

168
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,550
What does it mean, Ask?
Please?

169
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,882
Come on,
it mean what it says.

170
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,246
Uh-huh.

171
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,015
It's philosophical.

172
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,026
- Ah.
- All right.

173
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,185
- The Warrens!
- The Warrens.

174
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,753
Yeah.

175
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,336
Ask, dance.

176
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,028
You're crazy.

177
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,296
Put it somewhere real safe.

178
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,274
Into my arms.

179
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,570
Sashay.

180
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,083
Oh, Charley. Jesus.

181
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,319
- What are you doing?
- Bonita, this is my brother Tom.

182
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,552
Tom, this is Bonita.

183
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,787
- Hi, Bonita.
- Hi.

184
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,589
Bonita manages
the Quickie Chicken at the mall.

185
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,691
Shut up.
Just get me out of here.

186
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,368
So what are you doing here?

187
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,174
I couldn't sleep.
I'm sorry.

188
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,317
I mean, what are you doing here?

189
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,782
How come you couldn't
make it down in Berkeley?

190
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,183
I don't know.

191
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,520
You're here.

192
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,432
Yeah, well,
I'm here wherever I am.

193
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,432
But you were out,
and you made a clean break.

194
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,304
Jesus. If I could make a clean break,
I would be gone.

195
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,738
What are you talking about?

196
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,476
I'm just saying it's not
gonna be so easy next time.

197
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,578
This family's like a drug,
and we're all junkies.

198
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,466
Here's Tom, all fired up
and ready to face the day.

199
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,804
Why don't you take it easy, Tom?
You're so intense.

200
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,636
- Tom, are you busy Saturday?
- No.

201
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,677
Do you remember Marriet Hoffman,
Jeannie Hoffman's girl?

202
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,469
Yes.

203
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,981
Well, she's really
had a rough time of things.

204
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,577
She's back, and most of her friends
are either married or gone.

205
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,587
She doesn't have
anyone to go out with.

206
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,589
I thought maybe
you could do me a favor.

207
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,751
Mom, look, no.
I hate being fixed up. Please.

208
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,524
Oh, have a heart.
She got used on in California.

209
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,256
- Do you tell that child everything?
- Yes, I do. Now, hush.

210
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,860
Don't think of it as a date.
Take her bowling or something.

211
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,632
Think of it as being neighborly.

212
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,230
Think of it as getting laid.

213
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,942
Now, that's funny.
So where are you going to take her?

214
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,206
Bowling is the pits.
Take her to the beach.

215
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,770
No. Don't take her to the beach.

216
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,214
Take her bowling.
At least you'll have something to do.

217
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,117
I'm not gonna take her anywhere,
okay? I'm not gonna go.

218
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,280
All right, let's go. School.
Bye, hon.

219
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,620
- Bye, dear.
- I'll even lend you my car.

220
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,784
You never let anybody
touch your car.

221
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,350
I'll pay for the gas.

222
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,988
You should do it. It'll keep your mind
off of what's her name.

223
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,796
Mom, can we please,
this one time...

224
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,271
not make this a family decision?

225
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,308
I already took the liberty.

226
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,800
Saturday?

227
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,005
I'm late for an appointment.

228
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,324
So what about you?
Tell me something about yourself.

229
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,158
Like what?

230
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,755
Anything. You pick.

231
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,501
How about you go first?

232
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,059
Well-

233
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,838
What do you want?
Good stuff or awful stuff?

234
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,502
Start with the awful stuff.

235
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,067
Oh.

236
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,537
Well, let's see.

237
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,576
My father left me and my little sister
in the back seat of a Corvair once...

238
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,288
and he forgot about us.

239
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,486
What made you think of that?

240
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,657
I bought a fish today
and it came in a plastic bag...

241
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,858
and it reminded me of being
in the back seat of that car.

242
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,827
You go.

243
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,899
All right.

244
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,081
I dropped out of school.

245
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,746
- Yeah? What school?
- Berkeley.

246
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,383
I was at Pierce College
for two years...

247
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,587
and then I went to Berkeley.

248
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,991
You didn't like it?

249
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,428
No. No, I liked it.

250
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,358
It's kind of complicated.

251
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,028
Mm-hmm.

252
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,663
I dropped out too.

253
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,711
- Of what?
- Of Los Angeles.

254
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,041
School?

255
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,440
The whole place.

256
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,317
So what happened in LA?

257
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,514
Oh, I-

258
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:59,721
I fell in love with a piranha
who happened to be my boss.

259
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,432
Who was married, of course,
and I slept with him.

260
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,767
All your basic mistakes
except getting pregnant.

261
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,411
- What are you doing now?
- I'm coagulating.

262
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:19,007
I hate to say getting it together,
so I'm regrouping. How's that?

263
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,044
I'm selling TVs and stereos and-

264
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,046
What about you?

265
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,393
I'm getting it together.

266
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,284
- Well, thank you. I had a good time.
- Me too.

267
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,578
- Good night.
- Good night.

268
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,947
Good night.

269
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,516
Good night.

270
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,123
Do you want to come in?

271
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,195
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

272
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,761
Okay.

273
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,728
You want something to drink?

274
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,092
Sure.

275
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,007
Oh.

276
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,547
I didn't like what I was wearing.

277
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,257
- So what do you think?
- It's nice.

278
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,685
Sparse.

279
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,388
Yeah. I left all my stuff in LA.

280
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,228
I thought it would be
easier to be someone new...

281
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,899
if I didn't have all my old junk
lying around.

282
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,202
It's water.

283
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,576
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

284
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,948
Still drinking out of jars, though.

285
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,282
Why do I do that?

286
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,918
Do what?

287
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,288
Want to see something really ugly?

288
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,097
Sure.

289
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,109
I bite my nails
when I'm nervous.

290
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,476
You nervous?

291
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,148
Yeah. I guess.

292
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:16,817
L-

293
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:22,259
I like you,
and that makes me nervous.

294
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,764
Well, you know,
I'm nervous too.

295
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,464
Meaning, you like me?

296
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,803
Yeah.

297
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,049
I'm working on being forthright...

298
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:48,684
and in my previous life, I would have
waited for the guy to say something first.

299
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,091
Hey, do you mind
if I ask you something?

300
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:57,601
I mean, would it be okay if we had
an agreement, you know, just about us?

301
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,766
I mean, not that there is an us yet,
of course, but, well, what if-

302
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,676
What if we made a deal
before we go to bed?

303
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,039
A deal?

304
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,582
Well, yeah.
You know how you-

305
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,512
People just have
different expectations.

306
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,717
So I have worked out
a contract...

307
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,281
for lovers.

308
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,761
Yeah. Come on.
I'll show it to you.

309
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,959
Sit down. Sit down.

310
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,741
It's just something where
we agree to call one another...

311
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,748
and to spend the night
if we have sex.

312
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,260
Oh, well, it protects you too.

313
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,922
I mean, it's not legal or anything.

314
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,355
I mean, it's-

315
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,802
It's not a commitment...

316
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,331
if that's what
you're worried about.

317
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,705
It's really starting
to sound crazy, but it's-

318
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,716
It's just something where we agree
to be nice to each other.

319
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,294
I'm being a complete asshole.

320
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,894
Maybe we're going too fast.

321
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,975
I'd like you to leave now.

322
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,040
Marriet, we could talk.

323
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,541
Please leave.

324
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,345
I could stay and we could talk.

325
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,215
Get out.

326
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,012
What was that?

327
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,077
Maybe she just wanted
a little insurance.

328
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,317
- I mean, anyway, you said you liked her.
- So what, Ask?

329
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,157
Would you want a girl to sign a contract
agreeing to like you no matter what?

330
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,354
Yeah.

331
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,657
- No matter what?
- Yeah.

332
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,863
I'm not making that layup.

333
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,833
Well, a contract sounds
like a good idea to me.

334
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,804
I sort of have one for myself anyway,
you know, my list of rules.

335
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,966
- List of rules? You still have that?
- Yeah.

336
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,567
- You made that up when we were kids.
- Yeah, well, I update it.

337
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,135
I keep it in my wallet-
Get out of the way-

338
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,044
In case I think of
something new while I'm out.

339
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,309
Like what?

340
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,476
Like never put out
electrical flames with water.

341
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,313
That's one of the rules
you live your life by?

342
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,753
Look, all I'm saying is that
a contract can be a good thing...

343
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,955
and you've gotta keep
your mind open to new ideas. Let's go.

344
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,623
- Oh, you want to go again?
- I want to go again.

345
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,189
- Double or nothing?
- Double or nothing.

346
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,258
- Just play.
- Okay, boy.

347
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,327
Boo!

348
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,318
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

349
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,058
Those are some funny-looking
taco shells.

350
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,226
What are they,
chicken or pork, Mom?

351
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,460
- Pork.
- Chicken. Here.

352
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,471
- Pork tacos, yeah.
- Don't tease your brother.

353
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,973
- Aren't there pork tacos?
- I don't think so.

354
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,736
- Here. I suppose-
- Stop kicking me.

355
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,176
- Pass this around for me, please.
- Okay.

356
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,247
- This looks good, Mom.
- Thank you.

357
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,249
- I'm very hungry.
- Thank you.

358
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,808
Hey. Thank you.

359
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,615
Charley, why don't you pull up another
chair and invite your friend to join us?

360
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,450
- No, thanks.
- I'll get it.

361
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,461
Ask, it's all right. You don't
have to do that. Please sit down.

362
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,464
No, it's okay.
There's a chair right here.

363
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:25,125
It wouldn't hurt to pretend that you're
part of the family once in a while.

364
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,534
Edward, please don't.

365
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,630
Jill, the child has been
in the house two days.

366
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,800
- Nobody knows her name.
- Bonita.

367
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,538
- Met her in the bathroom.
- Thanks, boys.

368
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,976
Would you please
ask your friend to join us?

369
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,125
- I'm tired, Mom.
- Oh, Cassie.

370
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,388
Don't go to sleep before you finish
your homework.

371
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,657
I'm tired now, Mom.

372
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,256
- Oh, great. She's out.
- Cassie.

373
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,927
Mom, this is Bonita.

374
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,064
Hello, Bonita.
Please, sit down.

375
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,666
My father, my two brothers,
who you've met already.

376
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,767
Hi.

377
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,438
That's my sister Cassie,
when she's awake.

378
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,982
So would you like some dinner?
Here. You can have Cassie's fork.

379
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,576
Oh, I don't eat meat.

380
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,349
We have cheese. Lettuce.

381
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:23,325
Well, I don't really eat cheese either,
'cause it really gums you up inside.

382
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,424
- Well, help yourself to whatever you see.
- Thanks.

383
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,625
What do you do for a living, Bonita?

384
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,169
I manage the Quickie Chicken
over at the mall.

385
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,501
I don't eat chicken either.

386
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,767
Why not?

387
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,144
Well, they shoot them
full of these growth hormones.

388
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,273
You just don't want them
in your chicken.

389
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,889
So, Bonita, how did
you and Charley meet?

390
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,322
I used to work with Charley
over at the warehouse.

391
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,024
I just couldn't stand being
around all those dead fish.

392
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,701
I keep telling Charley
he should leave.

393
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:09,700
Did Charley tell you that he passed up a
management internship at Weyerhauser?

394
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,901
No. Charley,
you never told me that.

395
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,740
They loved him. They didn't know
why he wasn't in college.

396
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,302
Charley's real smart.

397
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,314
Everybody who meets Charley
wants him on their team.

398
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,044
Edward, I really don't think we need
to go through this for Bonita's sake.

399
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,746
We're not going through it
for Bonita's sake.

400
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,981
Then whose sake
are we doing it for?

401
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,990
We're not going through it
for anyone's sake, Charley.

402
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,050
I'm just trying to point out to you
that people who meet you-

403
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,527
Oh, for Christ's sake.

404
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,308
It was a pleasure meeting you.

405
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,974
You have a nice family.

406
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,574
Thank you.

407
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,186
What happened?

408
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,882
Nothing.

409
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,449
Charley wasn't hungry.

410
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,092
Oh.

411
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,101
Was he like this before I left?

412
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,604
It's gotten worse since you left.

413
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,544
For some reason your brother
thinks your father is a son of a bitch.

414
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,549
I think we should
throw Charley out.

415
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,816
Why?

416
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,259
'Cause he can't seem to bring himself
to leave any other way.

417
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,632
- Does he want to leave?
- Oh, I think so.

418
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,665
Well, he's a big boy, Mom.
Why doesn't he just leave?

419
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,437
It's hard for him.

420
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,276
He and your father are all tangled up
with each other.

421
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,909
I don't know how
to pull them apart.

422
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,212
I almost forgot.

423
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,554
- I stopped by the bakery on the way home.
- Thanks.

424
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,561
She's anxious to see you, say hello.

425
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,460
All right, Dad. Thanks.

426
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,623
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,626
You want a cannoli
and some coffee?

428
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,730
- It's on me.
- Okay.

429
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,285
Have a seat.

430
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,230
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,511
I'm really glad you came.

432
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,252
How far along are you?

433
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,810
A few months.

434
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,588
You must be curious
about the circumstances.

435
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,821
Miss, may I have the cream, please?

436
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,776
I still love you.

437
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:18,914
How's Sam?

438
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,479
He's fine.

439
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,792
The baby's not his.

440
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,059
Excuse me?

441
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,797
It's not Sam's baby.

442
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,770
Whose baby is it?

443
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,090
Eileen?

444
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,963
- Is it my baby?
- No, it's not your baby, all right?

445
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,730
Well, whose baby is it, huh?
Whose?

446
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,510
Whose baby is it?

447
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,704
Huh?

448
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,078
It's Charley's.

449
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,522
The baby is Charley's.

450
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,791
He wanted to marry me.

451
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,662
He said it would be a way out
for both of us.

452
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,292
Out of what?

453
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,998
I don't know.
Your family.

454
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,808
He got to me through you, Tom.

455
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,373
He used to tell me all these stories
about his life.

456
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:54,208
And I held him,
and I made a mistake.

457
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,912
I can't explain it.

458
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,389
I wanted to get an abortion.

459
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,982
- Why didn't you?
- I was afraid of Charley.

460
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,926
He wanted the baby.
He wanted to marry me and run away.

461
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,929
I didn't know what he'd do.

462
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,591
I asked him to marry me,
and he said yes.

463
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,999
I did it for you.

464
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,930
That's great.

465
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,441
First you fuck Charley
because of me...

466
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,910
then you married
Sam Crawford for me.

467
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:27,082
Geez, Eileen, I think if you loved me any
more, no man in Tacoma would be safe.

468
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,635
You have a million girls
to choose from.

469
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,368
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.

470
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,569
Couldn't find anybody else to fuck?

471
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:01,412
It was an accident, Tom.
I didn't mean it to happen.

472
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,217
What does that mean?

473
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,859
Look at me, Charley.

474
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,939
I didn't know if you were
gonna hit me, Tom.

475
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,947
I don't want to hurt you.
Don't fuck around.

476
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,916
And don't try and come in here.

477
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,115
- He said he liked me?
- Yes.

478
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,183
- Oh, gross.
- Hey.

479
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,126
- What, are you sick?
- No, I'm not sick.

480
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,964
God, I wish I had the time to just lay
around all day and read the newspaper.

481
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,698
Cassie, you don't
read the newspaper.

482
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,674
Exactly, Tom.
I don't have the time, you know.

483
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,446
So, did you and Charley
have an argument last night?

484
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,452
I thought I heard doors slamming.

485
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,454
I guess we did.

486
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,012
What about?

487
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:19,119
Oh... Charley got Eileen pregnant.

488
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,402
I thought Sam Crawford
got her pregnant.

489
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,734
No. It was Charley.

490
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,140
- Who says?
- Eileen.

491
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,359
I'd never do that.
It's one of my rules.

492
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:58,526
What, don't sleep with
your brother's girlfriend?

493
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,500
Never do anything with the sole intent
of hurting someone else.

494
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,410
Maybe he didn't.

495
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,746
Maybe he loved her.
Does she love him, Tom?

496
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,718
No, Ask. Charley's a slut.

497
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,554
Mm-mm.
What are you talking about?

498
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,059
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

499
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,027
Why don't you do something
with your life, Tom?

500
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,090
What?

501
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,103
Well, you're turning weird,
you know...

502
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,571
and idle hands
are the devil's playground.

503
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,234
Figure that one out.

504
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,313
You won't see
much traffic at night.

505
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,615
Mostly trucks.

506
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,387
Put the money in the safe
and lock it up at midnight.

507
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,958
Okay, Dave. Thanks a lot.
I really appreciate it.

508
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,328
Thank you.

509
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,090
What are you doing?

510
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,329
Where is everybody?

511
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,269
Tom went to his new job...

512
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,243
and everyone else is gone.

513
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,338
How come you're home?

514
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:58,555
Miss Prison Warden wanted me to
clean up my room and so I fell asleep.

515
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,354
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

516
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,699
Grab that?

517
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,492
Where are you going?

518
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,326
Quit my job.
Told Arnsberger to bite it.

519
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,268
- I'm going east.
- Why?

520
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,563
Because I want a new life.

521
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,566
What about your old life
where I'm your sister?

522
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,478
You'll still be my sister.

523
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,009
You're deserting the ship, Charley.

524
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,299
Go back to sleep.

525
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,230
I'm leaving my car.
It's a fair trade.

526
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,632
Where is this?

527
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,675
- Jesus!
- I fell asleep in the van.

528
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,035
I fell asleep in the van.

529
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,672
He didn't even know
I was in there, Mom.

530
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,879
What the hell
kind of a stunt is this?

531
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,215
Dad, he didn't even know
I was there.

532
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,050
What did you say to Arnsberger?
He's a friend of mine.

533
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,384
Fuck Arnsberger.

534
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,118
I got you that job!
I stuck my neck out for you!

535
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,524
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- Edward, let him go.

536
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,927
You get back in the house.
It doesn't concern you.

537
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,899
Hey, where are you going?
This is your family. Charley, stop.

538
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,001
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna have this out with you.

539
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:06,069
All right, drive. But when you stop,
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

540
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,862
Running away.

541
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,902
Twenty-four years old,
pulling a junior high stunt.

542
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,037
Twenty-six, and he
shouldn't even live here.

543
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,047
He's a brat.
He's a little boy.

544
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,106
- Kick him out, Edward.
- I won't kick him out.

545
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,085
That's what he wants, just so he can say
the whole thing is our fault.

546
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,745
- Let him.
- I won't let him!

547
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,659
He could be anything
he wanted to be.

548
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,260
He works in a warehouse.

549
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,932
And he wouldn't have had that
if I hadn't gone to Arnsberger.

550
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,306
Maybe you shouldn't
have gone to Arnsberger.

551
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,476
He won't do a thing by himself.

552
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,911
He walks around
in his own little world.

553
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,446
Let him be connected to one thing
in the universe beyond himself.

554
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,578
- That's all I'm asking.
- He's not gonna find it here.

555
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,613
Not with us.

556
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,550
He is a part of us.

557
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,595
He is a part of our blood
and our bone.

558
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,630
He is part of everything we are.

559
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,996
We are his family,
and he belongs here.

560
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,160
He belongs where
he can live his life.

561
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,466
Jill, if he wants his privacy,
let him get an apartment.

562
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,440
He's trying something else.
He's trying to abandon the family.

563
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,999
I won't permit it.

564
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,056
Charley, are you mad at me?

565
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,754
- No, I'm not mad at you.
- Oh.

566
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,737
Look, you don't have
to believe this, but it's true.

567
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,537
I'm sorry about what happened
with Eileen.

568
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,316
I didn't mean to hurt you.

569
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,010
I didn't.

570
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:06,247
I just wanted to do something so bad
that they'd have to throw me out.

571
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,850
- Why don't you just leave, Charley?
- Because it's not that easy.

572
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,389
It's gonna take a lot more
than I thought.

573
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,536
What did he mean by that?

574
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,073
I don't know.

575
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,269
- I mean about Eileen.
- I said I don't know.

576
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,742
Tom, why is everybody
always keeping secrets?

577
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:37,277
Sorry, Cassie.
No one-

578
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,951
No one is keeping secrets.

579
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,888
Okay?

580
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,825
God. This family
is getting too weird.

581
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,056
We should get a dog.

582
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,191
Why?

583
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,963
Well, because we used to have a dog,
and we were happier then.

584
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,665
We need a family project
to pull us all together.

585
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,673
Oh, anyway, good night.

586
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,309
Good night.

587
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,750
And quit moping around
and being so tragic.

588
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,311
Yeah. Yeah.

589
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,990
All right, but I don't
show it here at all.

590
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,822
Okay, well, let me look.

591
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,991
Hi.

592
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,494
You're alive.

593
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,573
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.
- What for?

594
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,272
I had a good time.

595
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,337
You probably think I'm crazy.

596
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,007
No, I don't.

597
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,409
Well, then you just want
to go to bed with me.

598
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,884
No, Marriet.

599
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,788
Look. I really had a good time, okay?

600
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:01,803
- I'd like to go out with you again.
- You're funny.

601
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,429
Why?

602
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,440
Well, you just could
have called, you know.

603
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:09,274
I mean, it's been three weeks.
I just feel like an idiot.

604
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:12,873
You're absolutely right,
and I'm sorry. I really am.

605
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,941
There were just a few things
I had to work out in my mind.

606
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,953
You mean Eileen?

607
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,647
Pretty much, yeah.

608
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:24,751
Well, you could have called
and told me that.

609
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,730
You could have explained that to me.
I would understand that.

610
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:31,995
You're the one that threw me
out of your apartment.

611
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:33,558
Remember?

612
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,935
Well, maybe I could show you
something a little more upscale then?

613
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,702
With stereophonic sound. Yes?

614
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,981
Oh, yeah. I probably should be
spending a lot more money.

615
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,404
I've been dreaming about you.

616
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,366
- I bet.
- I have.

617
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,872
Wild, erotic sex dreams, probably.

618
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,544
Just your basic dreams.

619
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,620
Your basic sex dreams.

620
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,132
They've been really nice.

621
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,371
- Left. Left!
- I can't do left.

622
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,431
Hit left. You have to be able
to hit left, then right.

623
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,942
Charley wants us to pick up something
for him at the train station.

624
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,473
- What?
- I don't know. Box or something.

625
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,481
I thought we were gonna
go get the dog.

626
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,141
Well, we're gonna drop you off...

627
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,651
and then we're gonna pick you up on
the way back from the train station.

628
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,780
- Oh, and let me pick it out by myself?
- Yeah.

629
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,983
Maybe you're ready for a little
adult responsibility, huh?

630
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,084
And you're Mr. Maturity
himself, right, Ask?

631
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,692
Wait. I get to sit up front then.

632
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,588
I'm going to make love
with Julie pretty soon.

633
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,283
Who's Julie?

634
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:43,724
Oh, you don't know her.
Yeah, she's new since you left.

635
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,284
You really think so?

636
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,990
How do you know you're going to
make love to her, hmm?

637
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,999
'Cause I can feel it coming.

638
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:54,265
It's like one of those slow-motion films
you see of a car accident in Driver's Ed.

639
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:58,069
You know, where you see the cars sliding
for, like, a minute before they hit.

640
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,206
- What is this thing?
- It's Dad's.

641
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:06,772
He keeps the bills in it
and stores it in his closet.

642
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,783
- What does it say?
- It says, "Open this. "

643
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,156
Got a pocket knife?

644
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:30,939
Maybe we shouldn't open it.
I mean, it's Dad's box.

645
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,375
- Look, Tom! Tom! Tom! No, no, no, no!
- What?

646
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,676
No. You're gonna break
the blade off.

647
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,487
These aren't bills.

648
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,159
We can't open this.

649
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,069
See if there's one already open.

650
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,072
- I can't read this.
- Just see who it's from.

651
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,025
Jeanetta.

652
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,291
Jeanetta?

653
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,001
This is a love letter.

654
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,819
May I please see that?

655
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,189
We shouldn't have opened it.

656
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,227
Why would Charley do this?

657
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,562
Let's burn 'em.

658
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:16,041
No, we can't burn them.
They're Dad's.

659
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,741
Charley is trying to
humiliate Dad with this.

660
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,340
That's what this is.

661
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,480
If we give them back,
that's all that's gonna happen.

662
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,182
- Well, we can't burn them.
- Yeah, 425, right?

663
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,993
I think it's right around
the corner here.

664
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,953
They're not ours.

665
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,266
Jesus, Ask.

666
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:54,682
Okay, look, Ask,
here's what we're gonna do.

667
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,241
We're gonna compromise, okay?

668
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,085
We're gonna put the letters back
in the locker...

669
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,851
and we're gonna figure out
what to do later.

670
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,383
Okay?

671
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,019
Okay.

672
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:31,647
Oh, he's a little runt.
I saved him.

673
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,789
- From what?
- The gas chamber.

674
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,986
The guy said that sometimes
people don't have the heart...

675
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,461
to flush runts down
the toilet themselves...

676
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,897
so then they give them to the pound
and have them do the job.

677
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:48,035
So what did Charley
want you guys to pick up?

678
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,594
Nothing.

679
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:54,104
I thought you said he wanted
you to pick up something.

680
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:57,078
The key didn't fit.
We couldn't open the locker.

681
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,552
- Did I leave the iron on?
- Charley did it.

682
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:49,891
- Why do you say that?
- It's why he left the letters.

683
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,456
What letters?

684
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,627
Cassie, honey, come with me.
Ask, you come too.

685
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,193
- Tom, what letters?
- Tom, come on.

686
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,898
Wait, what letters?
What letters, Tom?

687
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:01,136
What letters, Tom?

688
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,758
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey!

689
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:24,124
- Where's Cassie?
- She's with Eleanor.

690
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:27,029
- Where's Charley?
- I don't know.

691
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,432
Did you get everybody out?
My son might be in there!

692
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,602
- We just got here. Where would he be?
- In the back!

693
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,010
Charley, you bastard!

694
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,547
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's okay. She's inside.

695
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:47,647
She wanted to be alone.
Just go on in.

696
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:51,251
- You want us to check out the roof?
- No, not yet. It's too bad!

697
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:57,896
- Cassie, are you all right?
- Leave me alone.

698
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,209
Hey!

699
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,946
Dad?

700
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,919
Where the hell are you going?

701
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,818
Leave me alone, Mom.

702
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,160
Don't! Leave me
alone, Mom! Don't!

703
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,796
Don't!

704
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,340
He's all right!
Charley is all right! He's okay!

705
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:44,073
How do you know, Tom? Tom, how do
you know? How do you know?

706
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:47,844
Dad, Charley's car is not here.
He's gone somewhere, all right?

707
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,108
All right?

708
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,277
I guess you're right.

709
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,951
Oh, my God.

710
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,724
Dad, do you care about
anybody but Charley? Huh?

711
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,667
- Of course I do.
- He doesn't care about you, Dad.

712
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,569
He doesn't care.
He doesn't care about me or Ask.

713
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,573
That's our house!
It's burning up!

714
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,042
Tom! Tom, he knows our house is
burning up. He's worried about Charley.

715
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,341
Charley doesn't care about-

716
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,574
He doesn't care about
anything but himself, Dad.

717
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,844
This house is everything
we own. Look at it!

718
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,476
- Tom! Tom!
- Look!

719
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:27,421
I don't give a damn about the house.
I don't give a damn about the house.

720
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,118
- Dad, Dad, Dad!
- I can't give you any more!

721
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:34,924
As far as I can. Get the flames
up on top. Go!

722
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,161
What's that sign?

723
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:12,497
Oh, my dad left that for Charley.

724
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:16,437
He doesn't think Charley
burned the house down.

725
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,140
What? Charley burned
the house down?

726
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,344
Well, what makes you say that?

727
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,849
Charley gave us some letters
before he left.

728
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,410
What letters?

729
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:35,747
Love letters.

730
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,587
My father's love letters.

731
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,422
Be careful.

732
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:47,299
From this woman
we used to know back in Virginia.

733
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,133
Wait, Charley was-

734
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,898
He burned the house down
because of that?

735
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:53,567
Well, not just that.

736
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,937
Charley was looking for
a way out of the family.

737
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,585
Come on. He never heard
of a crank phone call...

738
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:10,148
or, like, really rude behavior?

739
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:15,795
Charley's never heard of anything
except what's good for Charley.

740
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,310
My family's crazy.

741
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:38,511
Everybody's family is crazy.

742
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:41,180
Not like my family.

743
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,954
Yeah. Yeah, and everybody
thinks their family is crazier...

744
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:47,155
than everybody else's family too.

745
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,362
Except in your case, I-

746
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,028
Yeah.

747
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,304
I know it doesn't-

748
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:05,905
It may not seem like it now,
but you get over this stuff.

749
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,957
Hmm? What?

750
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,518
Oh, God.

751
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,023
Indian.

752
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,499
It's ready.

753
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,209
- Want to go first?
- You can go first.

754
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:42,177
Oh, no, no.
You're the guest.

755
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,044
Yeah, but we could go together.

756
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:49,214
You go first.

757
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,330
Mm-hmm.

758
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,738
Are you gonna
take your clothes off?

759
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:20,278
I don't know.

760
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,656
Whoa!

761
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,274
- Is it too hot for you?
- No, it's nice.

762
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,835
Mm-hmm.

763
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,472
Look.

764
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,744
- Hey, you got fingernails.
- Pretty good, huh?

765
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,311
Let me see.

766
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,455
Fingers too.
That's great.

767
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,052
- Yeah, huh?
- Yep.

768
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,263
Let me wash your face.

769
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,839
- Bad, huh?
- You're a mess.

770
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,399
You're a mess too.

771
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,752
- Hello.
- Hi.

772
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,354
- Hey.
- Tom.

773
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:45,192
- Dad, this is Marriet.
- Hello, Marriet.

774
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,133
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

775
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,269
Hey, look what Marriet
found at the house.

776
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,539
- It's broken, but it's okay.
- Thanks, Marriet.

777
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,173
- Hi, Ask.
- Hey.

778
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,581
- My little brother. Do you know my-
- I know Ask. Hi.

779
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,212
- Hi. This is Julie.
- Hi.

780
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:06,778
Hi, Julie.

781
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:10,314
And that's John and Frances Heffel
from next door in 219.

782
01:12:10,393 --> 01:12:13,487
We're just passing through.
Your folks invited us to the party.

783
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,622
Hi. Welcome.

784
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,789
Where's Mom and Cassie?

785
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,097
They're in the bedroom.
They'll be out in a minute.

786
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,761
Anybody want a drink?

787
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:26,608
Would you like a drink
or would you like to dance?

788
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,166
Let's dance.

789
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,414
Well, you must think
this is kind of strange...

790
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:40,011
having a party
when your house burns down.

791
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,723
Unlike you,
I'm tolerant of weirdness.

792
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,703
I hate Charley.

793
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,411
Well, at least he's gone now.

794
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:09,177
If he'd left a long time ago,
maybe none of this would've happened.

795
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,714
So, what if he comes back?

796
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:19,821
We'll have him arrested.

797
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,024
Are you serious?

798
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,198
Come on, everybody.

799
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:30,467
- Come on, dear. It's time for the toast.
- Mom? Cassie?

800
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,975
Do you want to do that later on?

801
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:42,340
Cass, this is my friend, Marriet.
This is my little sister, Cassie.

802
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,476
- Hi.
- Hi.

803
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,042
And I think you know
each other, don't you?

804
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,715
Hello. Hi. Nice to see you.

805
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,724
Dad's about ready to go here.

806
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,091
Well...

807
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:04,000
I believe the last time
I stood here...

808
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:06,871
was to celebrate Tom's
return home from college...

809
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,374
on the early retirement plan.

810
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,906
Before that, we honored Ask's
wholesale distribution of lava.

811
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:20,786
Before that, Cassie's contribution
to the literature of drama...

812
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,484
regardless of the intent of the author.

813
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:31,032
And in that same spirit...

814
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,632
we commemorate the passing
of the Warren house...

815
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:37,070
into smoke and ashes.

816
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:43,441
We celebrate without Charley,
but... we keep him with us in spirit...

817
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,804
if not in flesh.

818
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:50,143
Ask, let the banner fall.

819
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,925
- Oh, that's great.
- All right, Ask.

820
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,791
- The Warrens.
- Warrens.

821
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,558
- The Warrens.
- The Warrens!

822
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,141
Come on, Cassie.

823
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,972
Hey.

824
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,141
Hi, dear.

825
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,416
We'll paint.
That'll help.

826
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,618
Some plants over there
by the window.

827
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,627
- I like it.
- You do?

828
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,856
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's good.

829
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,728
Yeah, it could be us.

830
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,935
Marriet lives right there.

831
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,910
See? It is a great house.

832
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,212
<i>Yeah, come on in, Ask.</i>

833
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:44,633
<i>Shower my kisses
off your silent skin</i>

834
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,200
<i>- The reality is
- Hey. Hey!</i>

835
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,832
- What? You ate all mine.
- Oh, that's not true.

836
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:56,435
Yes, it is.
My whole bag. Hey, Ask.

837
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,939
I've changed my mind.
I think we should burn 'em.

838
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,247
Let's read one first.

839
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:13,955
No, I don't think we should read them.
I'm not even sure we should burn them.

840
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,190
You read one.

841
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,806
- No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

842
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,965
Just one.

843
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,141
- Here.
- You didn't mark the spot.

844
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,942
How are you gonna know
where to put it back?

845
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,779
- I thought you were going to burn these?
- But you don't fiddle with the order.

846
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,721
Wow. Hasn't even
been opened yet.

847
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,756
Wait, wait, wait!
Do one that's already open.

848
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,226
Wait, at least tear it
like the others from the flap.

849
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,661
Do you have a leash for him?

850
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,734
It's okay. Go ahead.

851
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,882
"Edward, darling.

852
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:12,046
You wouldn't believe the rain.
Sheets and sheets.

853
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,385
The sky just opened up.

854
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:18,552
All the bottom land is covered
with silt, flat and brown.

855
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,562
A few creases,
like an old mattress.

856
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,928
I've been thinking
about you all morning.

857
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,799
When I was bathing,
I thought of your soft hair.

858
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:31,067
- The feel of it against my skin. "
- Aw, come on!

859
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,731
Do you want me to stop?

860
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:41,540
"I thought how your smile
centers your face so perfectly.

861
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,744
I long for you.

862
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:47,880
It centers my life.
Does that make sense to you?

863
01:18:47,957 --> 01:18:49,925
I'm glad Tom made
the basketball team.

864
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:53,223
It means so much to him
to be accepted.

865
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,093
Ask isn't like that.
He's my favorite.

866
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,199
He doesn't need to belong
to anything but family.

867
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,206
I don't really know that's true.

868
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:09,073
What if you told me lies?

869
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:12,243
What if your letters are make-believe?

870
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,676
Their pictures line my dresser
along with yours.

871
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:21,649
I'm lucky to have you
and your boys and Cassie.

872
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:26,118
I long for you. "

873
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,136
Shouldn't you call her?

874
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,250
It's only 12:30.
Let's give her till 1:00.

875
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:51,582
Well, if she went to the movies,
she ought to be home.

876
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:56,056
The bus is at Marriet's.
Maybe she's with them. I'll go see.

877
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,253
Edward, don't. She'll just think
we're checking up on her.

878
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,553
She ought to be home.

879
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,259
I'll call the Hargroves
and see ifJenny's home yet.

880
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:40,331
Jenny got home two hours ago.

881
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,098
- I'm gonna go see.
- I'll call around.

882
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:36,791
Cassie wasn't home
and I was worried about her.

883
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:41,017
Oh. Well, she'll probably be home soon.

884
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,157
Those letters.

885
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,094
Did you read them?

886
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:59,110
Only to see who they were from.

887
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,013
You had no right to read my letters.

888
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,451
You're right, and I'm sorry.

889
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,286
Does Jill know?

890
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,189
I don't think so.

891
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,314
I had a good time.

892
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:48,929
- Cassie, where have you been?
- We went out to the movies.

893
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:51,124
Cassie, that was hours ago.

894
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,001
Where did you get the letters?

895
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:10,507
Hi, Dad.

896
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,516
- Where did you get the letters?
- What letters?

897
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:21,222
The letters in the van.

898
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:28,801
We found 'em.

899
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,463
Found 'em?

900
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,269
Where?
The letters burned.

901
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,612
Answer me.
Where'd you get them?

902
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:51,119
Charley saved them
before he burned the house.

903
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,087
Charley didn't burn the house.

904
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:00,725
Yes, he did, Dad.

905
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,899
He saved the letters
so we could read them.

906
01:24:07,476 --> 01:24:09,774
Don't worry.
We're gonna burn 'em.

907
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:53,181
He wants to erase everything.

908
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:57,344
That's how I felt when I left LA.

909
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,020
I just wanted to start over again.

910
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,921
That's why I invented the contract.

911
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,928
Oh, whoa!

912
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:26,137
Jesus!

913
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:38,652
- Maybe we should put this out!
- Yeah, I know! We are!

914
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:14,918
Damn!

915
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:34,275
Damn. Tom!

916
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:01,705
What the-

917
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,439
What happened?

918
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:06,879
What happened?

919
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:10,017
Hey, what did you do?
What happened?

920
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,153
Oh, my God.

921
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:18,181
Here. Come here.
Roll over. Oh, Ask.

922
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,784
Oh, Ask.

923
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:22,662
Oh, my God.

924
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,928
Am I hurt?
Do you think I'm hurt?

925
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:30,793
No. No, Ask, you're okay, buddy.
You're-

926
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,907
We're gonna get an ambulance.

927
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,467
Ambulance, now. Could you
call an ambulance, please?

928
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,877
Do you know how much
ambulances cost?

929
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,851
You don't talk, Ask.
Don't talk. Just shut up, all right?

930
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,115
- You never want me to do anything.
- Yeah.

931
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,050
Oh, my God.

932
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:55,559
I made love with Julie.

933
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,565
Yeah? How was it?

934
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:03,360
- I liked it. We both liked it.
- Good.

935
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:07,067
I'm glad it was mutual.
Can you hurry up, please?

936
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,207
Okay, now just don't talk. Shh.

937
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,908
- Tom!
- Right here. I know.

938
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:17,741
Oh, my God.

939
01:29:21,156 --> 01:29:26,560
I'm right here, Ask.
Hey. Hey, look at me. I'm right here.

940
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:29,722
Hey, buddy, I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

941
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,323
No, Ask. Look.
Look at me.

942
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,767
Come here. Look at me.
Don't go away.

943
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:40,171
I don't think he's breathing!
I'm right- I'm here.

944
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:42,676
Don't go away.

945
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:46,236
Don't go away.
Don't go away.

946
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:44,765
I'll ride with your mother.

947
01:30:45,674 --> 01:30:47,369
She gonna be all right?

948
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:04,316
What were they burning?

949
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,691
I don't know.

950
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:10,821
Your letters?

951
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:18,229
Did you know about them?

952
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:26,370
Jill, they never
meant anything to me.

953
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,784
- I didn't know how to stop them.
- I never cared about the letters.

954
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,683
I never believed they mattered.

955
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:44,155
Ask mattered.

956
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:52,262
Don't.

957
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,211
Why didn't you throw
the letters away?

958
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:13,353
You hadn't even opened half of'em.

959
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:21,352
I couldn't.

960
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:32,234
It was all make-believe to you,
wasn't it?

961
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:35,032
What was make-believe?

962
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,300
Toasts.

963
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:40,003
Parties.

964
01:33:41,516 --> 01:33:43,006
Everything.

965
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,574
Oh, Tom.

966
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:50,253
You're a hypocrite, Dad.

967
01:33:52,594 --> 01:33:56,496
You know, you always made it
seem like we were so perfect.

968
01:33:57,799 --> 01:34:01,599
Wasn't Charley a bastard
for not wanting to be a part of us?

969
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,503
You couldn't even
throw those letters away.

970
01:34:07,509 --> 01:34:10,205
Those letters were private.

971
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:18,444
Ask was embarrassed for you, Dad.

972
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,415
That's why he was
burning the letters.

973
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:18,035
Can I come in?

974
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,448
Come in.

975
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,430
Hi, Mom.

976
01:35:50,545 --> 01:35:52,137
I'm not gonna stay.

977
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:54,941
Good.

978
01:35:55,817 --> 01:35:57,785
Eileen told me about Ask...

979
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,945
and I wanted
to come home.

980
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:06,016
You destroyed your home, Charley.

981
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:10,493
You pulled it down around you.

982
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,229
I just wanted to see you.

983
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:37,247
Where will you go?

984
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:38,815
I don't know.

985
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:44,593
I spent some time in Pittsburgh,
and I was working in Florida for a while.

986
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,767
I'm sorry for you.

987
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:55,104
I'm not sorry for you.

988
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:53,162
I was beginning to think
that you were trying to avoid me.

989
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:12,842
What are you doing?

990
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,591
I'm cleaning out Ask's room.

991
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,326
I figured it was something
I could do.

992
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:25,657
Leave his stuff alone, Charley.
I don't want you touching his things.

993
01:38:26,434 --> 01:38:29,130
Well, somebody's got to do it.
It might as well be me.

994
01:38:58,132 --> 01:39:02,000
Okay, okay, okay.
All right?

995
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:41,508
You want to beat me up, Charley?
Go ahead. I know you can do it.

996
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:46,035
You leaving?

997
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:50,309
Yep. I don't think I'm much in
the mood for a family reunion.

998
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,824
You're not gonna get away,
not like this.

999
01:39:57,892 --> 01:39:59,655
Really?

1000
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:02,423
Since when are you the big authority
on getting away?

1001
01:40:10,605 --> 01:40:12,573
You know what's wrong
with this family, Charley?

1002
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,767
We're all in love
with screwing up.

1003
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:18,039
You know, we just can't wait for one of us
to do it so we can take him back...

1004
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:20,444
and we can tell each other
how special we all are.

1005
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:23,176
You know, it's perfect.
No one ever has to learn anything...

1006
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:26,379
no one ever has to grow up,
no one ever has to leave.

1007
01:40:26,454 --> 01:40:28,445
We could probably
go on doing this forever.

1008
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,292
I came for Ask, Tom.

1009
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:36,126
Ask would still be here,
alive, if it wasn't for you.

1010
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:50,334
Just let me leave.

1011
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,849
You're not gonna
get away by hating.

1012
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,712
Take it from me.

1013
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,519
You'll end up with the whole family...

1014
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:06,355
strangling you
from inside your own head...

1015
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:10,224
and you still won't get away.

1016
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:15,184
Charley, wait.

1017
01:42:15,863 --> 01:42:17,353
Don't go.

1018
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:27,197
I think we should have
a toast for all of us.

1019
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,041
Why?

1020
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:52,890
Will you pour?

1021
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,910
I don't think we should
have a toast without Ask.

1022
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:11,247
I don't think Ask
would mind, Cassie.

1023
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,713
"Always get to the bottom of things. "
It's one of his rules, right?

1024
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:21,891
Only this time, let's say
what's really on our minds.

1025
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:25,627
We never seem to
get around to doing that.

1026
01:43:28,269 --> 01:43:33,172
We last stood here when
Charley burned the house down.

1027
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:40,146
I never understood why Dad
and Charley fought all the time.

1028
01:43:43,284 --> 01:43:45,548
Even if I knew whose fault it was...

1029
01:43:47,154 --> 01:43:50,612
I don't think I'll ever understand
why Charley burned down the house.

1030
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,656
Because I hated him.

1031
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:07,431
I thought the toasts
were supposed to be funny.

1032
01:44:10,478 --> 01:44:15,347
And because I was afraid I could never
be good enough to make him happy.

1033
01:44:28,896 --> 01:44:33,424
Before that was when I dropped out
of school and came home...

1034
01:44:34,435 --> 01:44:36,062
because Charley's right.

1035
01:44:37,404 --> 01:44:40,999
This family is a drug,
and we're all junkies.

1036
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:45,776
And I thought I was ready
to be on my own and I wasn't.

1037
01:44:48,048 --> 01:44:50,744
And I keep thinking that
if I had stayed in school...

1038
01:44:50,818 --> 01:44:52,752
none of this
would have happened...

1039
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,720
and Ask would still be alive.

1040
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,280
It's too late.

1041
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:06,957
I mean, all of you guys
were keeping secrets...

1042
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:13,399
just to protect yourselves
and not anybody else.

1043
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:17,033
No, Cassie.

1044
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:20,370
It was me.

1045
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:24,015
Ask was covering up for me.

1046
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,679
Setting fire to my lies.

1047
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:35,351
I'm responsible.

1048
01:45:51,245 --> 01:45:53,805
I wonder what he'd say
if he were here now.

1049
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:00,752
What do you think he'd say, Tom?

1050
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:13,027
I think he would say that
we're all responsible...

1051
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:18,734
and we all have to take care
of each other...

1052
01:46:18,806 --> 01:46:20,740
in spite of who we are.

1053
01:46:22,076 --> 01:46:23,976
Or maybe because
of who we are.

1054
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,444
He'd probably put it on a banner.

1055
01:46:44,265 --> 01:46:45,755
Yeah.

1056
01:46:47,368 --> 01:46:49,199
And he'd raise his glass...

1057
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:53,439
and he'd say, the Warrens.

1058
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,435
The Warrens.

1059
01:47:39,687 --> 01:47:41,177
The Warrens.

1060
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,285
The Warrens.

1061
01:47:55,903 --> 01:47:57,393
The Warrens.

1062
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:05,601
Warrens.

1063
01:48:20,394 --> 01:48:24,387
<i>I went back to school that fall.
Marriet came with me.</i>

1064
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,193
<i>She thought Berkeley might be
a good place for a new start...</i>

1065
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:30,259
<i>and I was hoping the same thing.</i>

1066
01:48:31,205 --> 01:48:34,697
<i>Ask had been looking forward
to starting college himself...</i>

1067
01:48:34,775 --> 01:48:37,300
<i>and he was on my mind as we left.</i>

1068
01:48:37,378 --> 01:48:39,346
- You want to drive?
- Sure.

1069
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:43,741
<i>Somewhere in my bags,
I carried his list of rules.</i>

1070
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:47,213
<i>He'd started the list when
he was about eight or nine.</i>

1071
01:48:47,287 --> 01:48:49,187
<i>He'd change it as he went along...</i>

1072
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:51,190
<i>although sometimes
he'd keep something on it...</i>

1073
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:54,785
<i>just to remind himself of what
he was like when he wrote it down.</i>

1074
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:56,557
<i>I'll read them to you.</i>

1075
01:48:57,564 --> 01:49:02,160
<i>Number One: Never make
a complicated thing simple-</i>

1076
01:49:02,236 --> 01:49:04,136
<i>Or a simple thing complicated.</i>

1077
01:49:04,805 --> 01:49:07,467
<i>Number Two:
Wear white at night.</i>

1078
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:11,444
<i>Number Three:
Take care of Tom.</i>

1079
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:15,214
<i>Number Four:
Eat from the three food groups.</i>

1080
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:18,415
<i>Five: Be consistent.</i>

1081
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:24,050
<i>Six: Never do anything with
the sole intent ofhurting someone.</i>

1082
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:27,957
<i>Seven: Floss.</i>

1083
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:31,020
<i>Eight: Always put the family first.</i>

1084
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:35,533
<i>Nine: Clean even
where it doesn't show.</i>

1085
01:49:36,637 --> 01:49:39,367
<i>Ten: Pursue the truth.</i>

1086
01:49:40,441 --> 01:49:43,501
<i>Eleven: Wear socks
that match your shirt.</i>

1087
01:49:44,711 --> 01:49:47,874
<i>Twelve: Take care of Cassie.</i>

1088
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:50,784
<i>Thirteen: Look up words
you don't know.</i>

1089
01:49:52,186 --> 01:49:55,451
<i>Fourteen: Never put out electrical
flames with water.</i>

1090
01:49:57,024 --> 01:50:00,187
<i>Fifteen: Get to
the bottom of things.</i>

1091
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:03,224
<i>I thought a lot about Charley.</i>

1092
01:50:04,064 --> 01:50:06,464
<i>I even added a new rule to my list.</i>

1093
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:08,091
<i>Number Sixteen:</i>

1094
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:10,996
<i>Forgive.</i>
