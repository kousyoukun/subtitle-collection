1
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,000
It all began one night
when the lights went out.

2
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,465
What do I know? They just keep blowing.

3
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,431
The circuit is overloaded.

4
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,431
It's your bloody exercise machine.

5
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,099
It's not my stair stepper.

6
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,099
I nearly got electrocuted last night.

7
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,566
This whole house needs rewiring.

8
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,066
We can't afford it.

9
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,598
Maybe with your raise...

10
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,066
My raise?

11
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,499
I wanted to do a surprise party

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,931
for your promotion,

13
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,698
but the deposit check bounced
at mariela's.

14
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,066
The job isn't mine yet, Leslie.

15
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,631
Mariela's supposed to be

16
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,698
the only civilized caterer out here.

17
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,166
I said to her, "mariela, it can't bounce."

18
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,299
It's one of the brown ones."

19
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,699
The money market? Jesus, Leslie.

20
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:36,331
Kathy and Jason.

21
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,965
Doesn't anybody in this house

22
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,066
pay any attention to you?

23
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,699
Well, for god's sake, it's my account.

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,599
I said to her, "the green ones bounce."

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,898
"That's my husband's account.

26
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,831
My brown ones never bounce."

27
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,865
All right, now, you children
run into the kitchen,

28
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,965
and grandma's gonna get you
some breakfast.

29
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,465
Anyway, I practically had
to beg her to take plastic,

30
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,898
and you know how backed up that is.

31
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,999
Arguing with Leslie
about her money again?

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,132
Lillian.

33
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,066
As always, your timing is impeccable.

34
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:08,966
Don't try to be so sarcastic.

35
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,866
I actually came over to
congratulate you on your new...

36
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,432
your coffee's hot.

37
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,398
It's all right for us to have
a little cup

38
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,831
before exercise class.

39
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,331
And that reminds me.

40
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,831
I remembered some more names
for his surprise party.

41
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,166
Fabulous.

42
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,599
And folding chairs, right?

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,067
How many do we need? 250?

44
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,666
Try to understand

45
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,532
he'd always fancied himself a sorcerer

46
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,599
capable of fixing anything.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,731
And now, in his own house,

48
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,633
there were constant failures of power.

49
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,067
"Good-bye, darling.

50
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,731
"Love you, darling.

51
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,831
Slay the dragons, sweetheart."

52
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,365
If a sorcerer's house isn't his castle,

53
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,465
what is it?

54
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,331
Still, he was looking forward
to his promotion.

55
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,831
He'd worked hard for many years

56
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:02,165
in the American corporate structure.

57
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,899
He'd earned it.

58
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,098
But the magic was just draining
out of him

59
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,698
every time he got on that commuter train,

60
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,332
back and forth from the suburbs
every day.

61
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,899
Excuse me, please.

62
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,067
Every day.

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,566
You look fit today, George.

64
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,265
- Ready to do battle?
- I don't know.

65
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,366
It's all up for me,

66
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,331
and I've done what I can for you.

67
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,298
Now let's just read our papers.

68
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,798
I think you're jumping the gun.

69
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,898
Come on.

70
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,231
The whole point of these takeovers

71
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,499
is to sell off the assets

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,431
and put old farts like me out to pasture.

73
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:48,066
I can hear the fat lady singing, Graham.

74
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,600
I can hear her singing.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,931
Space invaders, Graham.

76
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:07,231
The new people are all gadgets
and the bottom line.

77
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:09,366
I hear you, George.

78
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:12,832
Stop them early,
or they'll run right over you.

79
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,531
"We can be more efficient
on such-and-such a program."

80
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,166
Ba, ba ba ba ba.

81
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,898
It's all bullshit, Graham, soup to nuts.

82
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,198
It's code for mass firings
and low quality.

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,331
Just melt the market dry and get out.

84
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:29,099
I mean, if our system wasn't any good,

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,265
why did they take us over
in the first place,

86
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,067
right?

87
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,632
Hey, buddy. Give me a buck, will ya?

88
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,766
What do you make, a million a year?

89
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,132
Yeah, that's the way.

90
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,067
This city is getting to be like Calcutta.

91
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,831
I remember when New York was a pleasure.

92
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,465
I can remember when it was...

93
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,898
now, that was true.

94
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,966
New York wasn't what it used to be.

95
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,700
Stella.

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,499
Lend me $20.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,899
I know I can win this.

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,931
I refuse to keep being

99
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:10,499
the only practical person I know.

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,765
Minute to win, babe. Minute to win.

101
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,698
Even in their summer dresses,

102
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,599
he scarcely noticed
the temptations anymore.

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,899
God, he could remember
when it was all he noticed.

104
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,131
He tried to remember that power
he used to have over women

105
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,366
back in his dangerous days.

106
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,765
When you brain drain boys

107
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,865
came over from england
in the '60s and '70s,

108
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:34,832
I had no problem.

109
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,866
I know.

110
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,231
I don't know, Graham.

111
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,099
These young turks, hell.

112
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,398
Their efficiency system is just a cover.

113
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,798
What was the name of that film,

114
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,632
the one about space invaders
taking over living people?

115
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,431
Pods.

116
00:06:58,432 --> 00:06:59,999
Pod people.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,732
Body snatchers.

118
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,199
That's it,
invasion of the body snatchers.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,231
Hey, I saw that movie.

120
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:06,366
It was pretty happenin'.

121
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,867
Pods, pods, pods.

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,131
Graham?

123
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,198
Can we push Jay Walter to 10:00?

124
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,465
Yeah, check with frank.
I think that's good.

125
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,532
You'll love this.

126
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,066
Wonder oats wants to kill the dog.

127
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,265
Have we got the numbers back
from the west coast yet?

128
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,066
Not yet. They're supposed
to get back by 4:00.

129
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,265
Don't touch the dog.

130
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,898
- Graham?
- Yeah?

131
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,066
The results of the great
Kentucky gelatin wars.

132
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,566
Tell me they're not shit, Amy.

133
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,532
They're not shit, Graham.

134
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,500
They're shit, Amy.

135
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,499
I knew you had a crush on somebody.

136
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,431
Would you, for god's sake,
behave yourself?

137
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,365
Stella, I don't know
how to play this person,

138
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,299
and I don't know who she is.

139
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:54,331
It's not a role.

140
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:55,731
It's a job, a rent-paying job.

141
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:58,632
Now come on; I want
to introduce you to the boss.

142
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,531
All right.

143
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,899
David, David, can you
bring this over to Jones?

144
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,066
Graham Marshall's office.

145
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,399
Yes, I'll be happy to take a message.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,598
- Graham.
- Graham, hi.

147
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,066
Excuse me a moment, Stella.

148
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,067
Have a look at this.

149
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,899
The number crunchers designed it,

150
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,331
but the thinking, basically, is mine.

151
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:18,465
What is this?

152
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,398
A program that projects survey responses

153
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,166
from preprocessed data.

154
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,732
Well, that's great, but what is this?

155
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:24,931
It makes it unnecessary

156
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,232
to go back to the public
with a new release.

157
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,698
It predicts how they'll react.

158
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,166
Does it buy the product for them?

159
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,566
Well, not yet.

160
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,931
Bring it back when it does,
and we'll do lunch.

161
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,066
Graham, seriously,
this has huge cost-cutting...

162
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,798
later, Bob.

163
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,431
I'm sorry, Stella.

164
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,831
Thanks, Graham.

165
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,365
I just wanted to introduce you
to Melanie o'Connor.

166
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,066
Do you remember I told you
about her, my roommate?

167
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,731
Mr. Marshall, I just want
to take this opportunity

168
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:48,331
to thank you for the job.

169
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,465
I'm sure you'll do just fine.

170
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,566
Stella will take you over to personnel,

171
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,232
and she'll put you to work, okay?

172
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,232
My resume.

173
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,567
Thanks.

174
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,298
He's nice.

175
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,731
Graham.

176
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:10,299
Peter Reynolds from Beatrice
called with congratulations.

177
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,599
Well, that's nice.

178
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,866
Bob?

179
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,732
About that... that thing...

180
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,831
Forget about this.

181
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,066
There's something more important.

182
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,898
As spokesman
for some of the younger turks,

183
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,366
I'm supposed to invite you to lunch

184
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,366
in celebration
of your approaching greatness.

185
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,431
Christ. Today?

186
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:30,732
Come on, executive bonding.

187
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,266
Raucous, unfunny jokes.

188
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,599
And we'll kiss your ass

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,965
in the hopes you'll mistake it
for affection.

190
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,331
How degrading for you.

191
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,731
I'll be there. What time?

192
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:39,331
- 12:30?
- Fine.

193
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,167
Bring your ass.

194
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,331
See you at the elevators, 12:30.

195
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,299
- Right.
- Roger.

196
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,366
You got it.

197
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,965
Marshall.

198
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,632
Graham.

199
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,831
Stella.

200
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:55,632
Thanks again for the job for Melanie.

201
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,831
She'll make a great receptionist.

202
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:58,633
She's got an outgoing personality.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,632
And congratulations.

204
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,099
I heard you're going to replace
Mr. Brewster.

205
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,266
It's about time.

206
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,598
Yes, I guess it is, at that.

207
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,631
Just about time.

208
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,999
Charles has got to announce
the promotion Friday.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,232
That's what I heard, Friday.

210
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,431
It's the least they can do,

211
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,066
give you a couple of days to celebrate.

212
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,765
Two glorious days,
three fun-filled nights.

213
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,732
And how will you fill
those fun-filled nights,

214
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,331
Mr. Marshall?

215
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,631
Well, right now, I'm planning
to have the wife's mother over

216
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,898
to berate me for not letting her
live with us.

217
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,899
Wouldn't be my choice.

218
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,931
That reminds me.

219
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,999
We're putting the boat in this weekend.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,067
And we forgot ours, didn't we, lads?

221
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,331
Tara's coming out to the house.

222
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:45,298
Tara? What kind of a name is that?

223
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,932
Her last name is raboomdeay.

224
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,398
*

225
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,266
The man is dating a plantation.

226
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,999
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,298
You don't understand.

228
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,566
We are the young, the proud.

229
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,699
We shouldn't be ashamed of success.

230
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,165
We should say, "yes, I have a boat."

231
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,366
"I have a country home.

232
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,866
I have a girlfriend named Tara."

233
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,131
Say it with me, brothers.

234
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,831
I do have a Mercedes.

235
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:18,866
I have a condo with a pool.

236
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,432
I have a personal sports trainer.

237
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:28,099
I have a wife, a mortgage, and two dogs.

238
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,066
Very sad.

239
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:33,066
God bless and keep
the old-fashioned family.

240
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,067
Hear, hear.

241
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,966
So there it was, his promotion...

242
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:47,066
The climax of his business life.

243
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,232
This was as good as it would get.

244
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,166
Tara raboomdeay.

245
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,299
Jeez.

246
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,966
What the hell is the matter?

247
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,532
What's everybody up to?

248
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,832
What is going on here?

249
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,799
Graham?

250
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,432
Can I speak to you for a second?

251
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,732
What the hell is going on
out there, George?

252
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,567
Did somebody die or lose money
or something?

253
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,167
They're asking me to get out early.

254
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,898
I'm sorry, George.

255
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,332
I mean, I wanted this spot, but...

256
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:46,832
Not this way.

257
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,566
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, Graham.

258
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,066
They certainly want you to stay on.

259
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,331
It's just,

260
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,732
they felt when it came
to head of department...

261
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,266
What?

262
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,899
Felt what?

263
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,799
Well, there's a general opinion

264
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,732
that you weren't in somehow
with the new program,

265
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:15,299
that you were...

266
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,932
What are you telling me, George?

267
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,831
You didn't get it, Graham.

268
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:24,733
You're not the one.

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,398
You're fucking kidding me.

270
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,166
I'm sorry, Graham.

271
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:37,398
Those assholes.

272
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,066
I don't believe this.

273
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,599
Those fucking assholes.

274
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
It's a whole new ball game, pal.

275
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,431
Who got it, George?

276
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:52,798
Who's the new head?

277
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,132
That.

278
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,633
Benham. Robert benham.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Benham.

280
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,631
Hail the conquering hero.

281
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,233
God help us all.

282
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,066
Spare some change?

283
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,399
No. Go away.

284
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,766
Come on, buddy. Give me some change.

285
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,867
Didn't you hear me? I said go away!

286
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,366
You know, I could teach you
a little something

287
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,465
about being a gentleman.

288
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,167
Get the fuck out of here!

289
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,965
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

290
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:44,066
This train is being taken out of service.

291
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:49,699
All passengers must leave
the train immediately.

292
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,066
Attention, please.

293
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:55,132
All passengers must leave
the train immediately.

294
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:57,099
We have had an passenger injury.

295
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,999
Please, your cooperation is needed.

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,233
This train is...

297
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,231
Had he really killed a man?

298
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:52,099
He wanted to run away from himself

299
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,898
as if he'd split into two pieces,

300
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,500
him and the murderer.

301
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,666
Hey, hey, I'm off duty.

302
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,732
Grand central station, please.

303
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,798
All right.

304
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,566
He must be in shock.

305
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:08,332
This rush, this adrenaline, the fear.

306
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,099
Christ, the fear!

307
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:24,965
You left early.

308
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,765
I couldn't take it either.

309
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:29,600
I hope to hell there's a bar car.

310
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:38,398
I don't know, Graham.

311
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:41,831
For me, the fun went out of it
after Wendy died.

312
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:45,365
It was never any good, really,
after that.

313
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:48,599
Your wife, your health...

314
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,466
That's the real stuff.

315
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:56,066
A guy like benham...

316
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,798
Okay, he's smart. He's ambitious.

317
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,999
His shirt was torn.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,531
He must have killed a man.

319
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,632
Do you know?

320
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,465
See, you're more like me, Graham,

321
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,866
someone who understands

322
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,466
that flesh and blood...
Human life, you know...

323
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,199
Is precious.

324
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,466
Life.

325
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,066
Murder, Graham.

326
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,198
What?

327
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,265
Do you want to talk about a day

328
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,465
that has been absolute murder?

329
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:30,898
But the good news is,

330
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,298
I finally got mariela to take
a postdated brown check,

331
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,699
so your surprise party
is a definite after all.

332
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,965
Look what you did, Mr. mcfuddlehead.

333
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:44,331
That's a perfectly good shirt
you threw away.

334
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,465
It's torn.

335
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:49,398
Well, maybe Esmeralda can sew it.

336
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:53,266
Mr. martelli, he came next.

337
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,132
I was working out on my stair stepper,

338
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,431
and all of a sudden, ffffft!

339
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:59,365
It jammed, I banged my shin,

340
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,299
and every air conditioner
in the house went off.

341
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,898
It's that damn fuse box again.

342
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,866
That's just what Mr. martelli said,

343
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,198
except somehow when he said it,
it cost $153.

344
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,499
We've got to economize, Leslie.

345
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,598
What was I...

346
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,066
The shirt. That's what it was.

347
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,698
Yeah, he said there's probably a short

348
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,067
in the stair stepper.

349
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,266
I don't see any rip.

350
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,398
I thought there was one.

351
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,232
Honestly, Graham.

352
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,166
What is the matter with you tonight?

353
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,667
Me? Nothing.

354
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,798
Graham, Bob benham wants to see you.

355
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,799
Fine.

356
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,066
Mr. Bob.

357
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,666
Sir Robert.

358
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,899
Graham, he's in George's office today.

359
00:19:55,767 --> 00:20:00,999
The emperor Bob.

360
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,032
Mr. benham will meet him
at the restaurant at 1:00.

361
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,699
Good.

362
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,999
I'll tell him.

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,832
Okay. I will.

364
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,098
This isn't exactly comfortable for me.

365
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,366
I know you wanted this job.

366
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,698
I suppose, if we were rival princes,

367
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,499
I could just have you killed.

368
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,566
Save a lot of politics.

369
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,166
It's not that easy to kill someone

370
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,999
and get away with it.

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,566
I thought instead, it would be good

372
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,499
if we could get together this weekend

373
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,865
out at the house...
You and Leslie, me and Tara.

374
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,399
The actual ta-ra.

375
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,632
Yes, that would be nice, Bob.

376
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,099
Good.

377
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,699
We'll do a little sailing,
a lot of eating,

378
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,099
and find the time to discuss
the new order of things.

379
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,865
Graham, do you happen to have a light?

380
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,700
Yes, of course.

381
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,665
He kept expecting a bolt of lightning

382
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,232
to come out of of the sky
and strike him dead.

383
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,899
Hey, buddy.

384
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,467
Spare some change?

385
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,966
Thanks.

386
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,299
God bless you.

387
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,532
But it never did.

388
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,465
All he felt was good, clean,

389
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,200
free...

390
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,431
As if he'd taken

391
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:39,267
a thousand-pound load off his back.

392
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:50,200
*

393
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:20,265
Are we making this the 754 or the 813?

394
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,131
Where do they get those numbers?

395
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,299
Everyone's so... Young.

396
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,232
Scotch, rocks, please.

397
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,499
No, wait a minute.

398
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,566
I'll have something vibrant and youthful.

399
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,066
Do you want a Shirley temple?

400
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,331
A light beer with a twist for my friend.

401
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:37,499
No, the scotch will be fine.

402
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,332
I'll have a side order of bran flakes.

403
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,599
Who's that with benham?

404
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,331
- Where?
- Over there.

405
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,632
That's Henry park,

406
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,865
Mr. computer from downstairs.

407
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,632
Some of the hardware is so outdated.

408
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,365
I'll bet he's drinking
something vibrant and youthful.

409
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,699
You look very vibrant to me.

410
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,999
Well, I think it's rotten, Mr. Marshall.

411
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,332
The only reason you didn't get that job

412
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,731
is 'cause they didn't give it to you.

413
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:08,499
Well, I think you've
handled it very gracefully

414
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,566
and vibrantly too.

415
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,232
I haven't even told my wife yet.

416
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,432
You haven't? Graham, why not?

417
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,732
Dread, really.

418
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,066
It's going to be a disaster.

419
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,331
That's ridiculous.

420
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,566
These things happen.

421
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,232
Not to her husband, it doesn't.

422
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,299
Usually, I just reach out my hand,

423
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,732
and obstacles disappear.

424
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:32,831
Pshew!

425
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,432
Great drink.

426
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,366
She thinks she's Mrs. Merlin.

427
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,731
- Who?
- Merlin.

428
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:44,199
The wizard, king Arthur.

429
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,766
Now, don't use the quiet voice, Graham.

430
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,566
It's just the same as yelling.

431
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,499
It is too expensive to maintain, Leslie!

432
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,199
And don't yell at me.

433
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,931
It's not the machine's fault.

434
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,231
I've never understood
why you need a stair machine

435
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,965
when we had stairs!

436
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:01,666
Because I have to keep going up, silly.

437
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,165
If I had to keep going down,

438
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,465
I'd lose the whole aerobic benefit.

439
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,165
It's like a computer.

440
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,531
You're not turning it on right.

441
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,531
You turn it on like this.

442
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,699
Well, that's very impressive,
Mr. Einstein.

443
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,499
But aren't you supposed
to scream "booga-booga"

444
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,898
or something?

445
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,866
- Fuck!
- Graham.

446
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,765
Well, I guess it's back to Mr. martelli.

447
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,066
There isn't gonna be
any Mr. god damn martelli.

448
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,799
I'm going to flick a switch
in the god damn fuse box,

449
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,398
and all the lights
will magically go on for free!

450
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,499
Graham...

451
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,731
And you are going to follow me,

452
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,899
and you're going to learn how to do it!

453
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,266
You know, there's lots of money

454
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:42,965
I don't spend around here.

455
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:44,731
Is this going to take long?

456
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:49,798
There's that big check I saw for $2,157.

457
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,231
That is our mortgage.

458
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,666
And the big one? That $3,300 one?

459
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,766
That's our life insurance, Leslie.

460
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,398
Well, it's not as though

461
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,699
I don't pay my share of things
around here,

462
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,466
more than my share.

463
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:08,966
And anyway, you're finally
getting a decent raise.

464
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,131
I mean, I'm just beginning to feel

465
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,665
that there's a great big whole lot

466
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:17,698
of male chauvinist prejudice
in operation here.

467
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,532
I mean, part of what helps you get ahead

468
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,799
is having a wife from
a good family who looks nice

469
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,532
and a house near George
and all the proper things,

470
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,099
and you can't blame me
just because I sign the checks

471
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,131
when, really...

472
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,432
Leslie?

473
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,199
Come up here.

474
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,666
I want to show you how to fix the lights.

475
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,132
Graham.

476
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,199
- Come on.
- Why do...

477
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,666
Do I need to know this?

478
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,766
Yes. Yes, you do.

479
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,831
Get up.

480
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,431
Stand on the top box.

481
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,566
Get on there.

482
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,331
- Okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

483
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,898
Now put out your right hand,

484
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:57,066
and get hold of that pipe
very, very firmly.

485
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,999
Ew. It's all filthy and wet.

486
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,331
Yuck.

487
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:03,265
It's important for your balance.

488
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:06,367
Right? Got hold?

489
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,966
Now reach out with your left hand,

490
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,232
get hold of that chain,

491
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,167
and pull down hard.

492
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,066
I see...

493
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,532
I see, and here's
the fuse box right here.

494
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,566
Ew, my hands are all yuck.

495
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,331
I didn't get the job, Leslie.

496
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,431
I see. So what do we do now?

497
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,798
Just...

498
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,699
What?

499
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,499
The promotion.

500
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,766
I didn't get it.

501
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,499
No, of course you got it, Graham.

502
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,633
You always get it.

503
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,599
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,067
I know what it meant to you.

505
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,066
No, you don't, Graham.

506
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,331
I really don't think you do know
how much it meant to me.

507
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:04,700
That's when he realized she was a witch.

508
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:11,599
For his survival, he was going
to have to get rid of her spell.

509
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,932
Yeah.

510
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,066
Hey, what took you so long?

511
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,698
I hope the traffic wasn't terrible.

512
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,432
He missed the turn.

513
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,299
Graham. Leslie.

514
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,431
Bob. How are you?

515
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,066
This is Tara, not the plantation.

516
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,365
- How do you do?
- Hello, Tara.

517
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,499
Tara liston the model.

518
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,798
Nice to meet you.

519
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,066
Shall we show them the ranch?

520
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,798
I think we have to.

521
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,700
Come on up.

522
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,266
She was perfect. He was perfect.

523
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,199
The house was perfect.
The boat was perfect.

524
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,365
The American dream.

525
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:59,798
She feels a bit small up top,

526
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,466
but she's surprisingly roomy
for overnights.

527
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,499
I want one. I want one!

528
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,566
Cuts along on a jolly clip
too, doesn't she?

529
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,067
She jolly well does.

530
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,632
By golly.

531
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,265
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

532
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,765
Graham?

533
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,566
Could you give me a hand
down here, please?

534
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,267
Certainly. Let me.

535
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,331
It's this gas. I just can't seem to...

536
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,567
- Let me try.
- Get it.

537
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,067
There.

538
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,999
Thank you, kind sir.

539
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,832
What department do you head
at gibb, Graham?

540
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,632
I'm in marketing too.

541
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,166
So you're under Bob now.

542
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,067
Yeah.

543
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,599
Don't stop.

544
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,332
No.

545
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,965
The power was draining out of him again.

546
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:43,332
He had to act.

547
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,099
I don't mean to speak ill
of the dead, Graham,

548
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,066
but George was simply dealing
with smoke signals and drums.

549
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,731
Our hackers can have the present hardware

550
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,066
linked internationally six months, tops.

551
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,298
Great.

552
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,766
As long as we don't overextend ourselves.

553
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:02,199
I think it's exciting to plan so big.

554
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,132
I'd like you to be
at that San Francisco convention

555
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,632
next week.

556
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,031
That should give you the real
overview of where we're headed.

557
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:09,899
What day next week?

558
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,832
Wednesday, I think.

559
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,866
The day of the head of
departments meetings.

560
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,965
Yes, actually. Yes.

561
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,931
I chair that meeting, Bob.

562
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:22,765
Well, actually, you have
chaired it in the past, Graham,

563
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,799
and, frankly, that's because
George was too apathetic

564
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,299
to take care of it himself.

565
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,033
It is a meeting
of department heads, after all.

566
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:34,599
Maybe we should talk
this one over with George.

567
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,899
I cleared it with George.

568
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,931
Graham?

569
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,567
For goodness sake,
you have your lighter with you.

570
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,066
Well, thank god

571
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,298
somebody around here's
getting a vacation.

572
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,632
Have a good time, sweetheart.

573
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,599
Do you remember the old days,

574
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,566
when we didn't have any money
and we said...

575
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,466
now, don't get all pitiful, Graham.

576
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,499
"I forgive you for failing, Graham."

577
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,466
Graham?

578
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,600
I forgive you for failing.

579
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:22,066
By the way,

580
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,799
I fixed your stair stepper.

581
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,733
Good.

582
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,800
Say bye-bye, now. Bye to daddy.

583
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,600
Bye.

584
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,599
He had no idea what was going to happen.

585
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,898
Actually, it was the first black magic

586
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:53,066
he'd ever even tried.

587
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:54,798
He was gambling with the fates,

588
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,266
rolling the great dice.

589
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,832
Hostility is dissipated through distance.

590
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:08,431
And we have created what we term
a wedge of accountability,

591
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,132
such as we see here.

592
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:27,733
Darn it, Graham.

593
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,700
Fuck.

594
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,066
Hello.

595
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:38,266
Mr. Marshall.

596
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,466
I'm afraid we have
some very bad news for you.

597
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,865
An... an accident?

598
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,599
Easy, Joe, easy. Watch the rug.

599
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,798
Yes.

600
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,231
I'm very sorry.

601
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:52,798
My god.

602
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,832
What a shock.

603
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,899
Da!

604
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,733
Aren't you going to say something?

605
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,932
Yes, of course.

606
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:20,066
Dearest Leslie,

607
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:24,866
your mother and I
have brought you to this spot

608
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:29,698
to share this last private...

609
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,731
This moment of...

610
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:35,732
Grief and pain.

611
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:42,365
Would you like to say something, Lillian?

612
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,533
No.

613
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:16,599
Abracadabra.

614
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,232
Shalakazam.

615
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,366
Bye-bye, baby.

616
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,632
Boom.

617
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,099
I'm the guy who called you
in San Francisco.

618
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,231
I'm Larry laker.

619
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:36,298
I'm with the Connecticut state police.

620
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,898
Yeah.

621
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,699
If you'd rather I come back later...

622
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,132
No, no.

623
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,732
Now is as good a time as any.

624
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:47,931
Can you help me out

625
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:51,298
with this crazy wiring on the socket?

626
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,766
And that god damn stair machine.

627
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:55,066
If I had just...

628
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,166
yeah, your mother-in-law
explained that to me,

629
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,166
but, you know, I do have
this particular question

630
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,500
about there not being any dust
on the electrical tape.

631
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,098
Electrical tape?

632
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,231
Yeah, you see,

633
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:08,698
because being down in a basement
and everything,

634
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:10,066
everything gets very dusty,

635
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,787
but the tape,
there wasn't any dust on that.

636
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,665
Yes?

637
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,631
Mr. Marshall, I'm here
to pick up Kathy and Jason.

638
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,465
Jason just went round there.

639
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,732
I think Kathy followed him.

640
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,898
Okay.

641
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:23,698
Boarding your dogs.

642
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,099
Yes, I'm looking for a place in town.

643
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,532
Well, it's a good thing
I caught you, then,

644
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,299
because I really did have this question

645
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,931
about this electrical tape
being down in the basement.

646
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,798
Like, I mean,
everything's dusty down there,

647
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,398
and there's just this one piece
that's hanging loose

648
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,266
that's got no dust on it.

649
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:43,266
Well, that's because
I was down there before.

650
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,666
I saw this tape loose,

651
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,465
and... and I rewrapped it.

652
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,465
If only I'd done a better job.

653
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,766
Hey, don't be too hard on yourself.

654
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,731
These things happen.

655
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,365
You're as human as the next guy.

656
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:03,099
Well, if there's nothing more, I...

657
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,066
I would like a little time to myself.

658
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,067
Absolutely.

659
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:07,465
I just wanted to clear that up.

660
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:10,198
You go ahead and let
the grieving process happen.

661
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,132
Thank you.

662
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,067
*

663
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,866
Honey.

664
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,900
That is really great coffee.

665
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,066
Mr. Marshall,

666
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,066
I'm Bob benham's new secretary,

667
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,431
and I just wanted to say how sorry he was

668
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:15,098
to hear about your wife.

669
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,567
Thank you.

670
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Graham.

671
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,331
We missed you, buddy.

672
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,066
- Is Bob in yet?
- Yes, he is.

673
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,499
Hi, Graham.

674
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,931
I'm sorry I didn't get
to send you a card yet

675
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:27,366
about your wife.

676
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,099
Has Bobby gotten here yet?

677
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,131
Yes, but he's in his office...

678
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,132
Graham, can you believe this?

679
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,465
They just faxed me the chewgood numbers.

680
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,931
And listen, I'm sorry about your wife.

681
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,166
I appreciate it.

682
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,731
The chewgood numbers at last.

683
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:42,166
Great, let me have them.

684
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,331
Bobster told me I should
give them to him right away.

685
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,431
You know where he is?

686
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:47,566
No, I don't.

687
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,231
Why don't you try George's office?

688
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:52,066
Amy, has the big, bad Bobby
got a couple of minutes for me?

689
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,199
Well, I'm not sure.

690
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,865
Yes, but he's with his decorator.

691
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,332
Graham.

692
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,398
I feel so bad.

693
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,766
I'm shocked.

694
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,298
Did you get my note?

695
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,399
Yes, thank you.

696
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,866
I just can't stop thinking about you.

697
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,332
Well, I am, as we say
in the grief business,

698
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,832
swell as can be expected.

699
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,432
Anyway, here's the artwork you wanted.

700
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,599
Stella Henderson.

701
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,432
She always comes through.

702
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:38,600
All right.

703
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,999
What if we had dinner?

704
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,466
I give up. What if we had dinner?

705
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,432
Tonight.

706
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,731
Tonight.

707
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:54,432
Okay.

708
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,567
Okay.

709
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,366
But you know what I mean

710
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,499
about these pod people, these yuppies.

711
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,066
If you don't treat people
the way they do,

712
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:07,132
they question your manhood.

713
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,832
And believe me, there is nothing worse

714
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,098
for a woman in business than
to have her manhood questioned.

715
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,066
But it's like this benham.

716
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,431
I mean, he thinks of people

717
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,099
as though they're made of styrofoam,

718
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,198
not as though they're...

719
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,199
human beings.

720
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,299
Which is the opposite

721
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,599
of the way you treat people under you.

722
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,066
Sweet old Graham.

723
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:24,465
No, but you know what I mean.

724
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,465
I mean, Bob, for instance,
would never appreciate Melanie.

725
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,831
Melanie?

726
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,698
You should see what she does
to prepare for a role.

727
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,199
Bob benham would just
write her off as a loser,

728
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,965
which is why you didn't get
George's job...

729
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:39,266
Because you wouldn't
treat people the way they do.

730
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,866
You know, you're very perceptive.

731
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,465
You talk about people,

732
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,965
and you listen to other people talk.

733
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:56,398
But you never talk about yourself.

734
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,699
Why is that?

735
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,000
I guess I'm afraid you'll find me out.

736
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,299
Don't be afraid.

737
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:09,300
Good night.

738
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:25,131
The world, as they say,
had become his oyster.

739
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:29,432
Now he was going to pry it open.

740
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,067
Hi.

741
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:51,798
I will try and put this
as politely as possible, Henry.

742
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,965
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

743
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,365
Bob says I'm supposed to help out

744
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,067
with the reorganization report.

745
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,632
Let me rephrase the question.

746
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,631
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

747
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:11,332
Bob just felt it was crazy
not to have a computer in here.

748
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,631
It's not the computer!

749
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,631
It's you and your god damn desk!

750
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:18,066
Look, Bob felt that...

751
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,800
I'll talk to Bob.

752
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:38,699
George?

753
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,066
What are you doing, George?

754
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:44,599
Well, Bob asked me
to wait outside for a moment.

755
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,632
In the... in the hall?

756
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,965
You're standing in the hall.

757
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,766
Yeah, well, he's busy, you know.

758
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,567
I didn't want to make waves.

759
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,999
What in the name of god

760
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,567
is Henry park doing in my office?

761
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,566
Excuse us. This'll just be a second.

762
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,066
I have to run anyway.

763
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:11,300
You'll get the estimates.

764
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:20,366
That decorator is harder
to get an appointment with

765
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,398
than the mayor.

766
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,831
Tell me this is about something.

767
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:26,166
There is a man in my office.

768
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,166
I thought it'd be more efficient

769
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,366
to have you and Henry
working closely together.

770
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,365
It is my office!

771
00:44:32,366 --> 00:44:36,798
It is the assistant chief's office!

772
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,700
It's still your office.

773
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,699
Why don't you bring Henry park in here?

774
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,766
That's entirely...

775
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,066
why don't you bring Melanie in

776
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,398
to make sure the phone gets answered?

777
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:47,632
Hell, we could bring in

778
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,166
the whole god damn New York Knicks

779
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,731
just to make sure
your trash hits the basket!

780
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,366
How's that?

781
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:58,465
If I thought I needed
an assistant to do my job...

782
00:44:58,466 --> 00:44:59,999
meaning what?

783
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,431
That I don't do my job?

784
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:06,199
Then why don't you
have me removed, Bobby boy?

785
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,165
Because you're too senior in the company

786
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:11,066
to be fired for anything less
than gross insubordination.

787
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:14,866
So you've decided to have me
removed piece by piece...

788
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:18,099
A privilege here, a responsibility there,

789
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,131
never enough to fight over,

790
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:24,299
just a subtle little drain
of power, right?

791
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,831
Well, let me tell you something, bobster.

792
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:31,866
You don't know the first
fucking thing about power.

793
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:35,532
I have more power in this hand

794
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:39,100
than all you fucking know.

795
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,232
Get out of the god damn hallway, George.

796
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,800
But take my picture. Take my picture.

797
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:15,932
Bobby boy.

798
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:17,533
George.

799
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:20,066
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

800
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,265
Could you take a picture with me?

801
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:23,499
Sure.

802
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,866
Bob has really made a difference.

803
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,765
Look at this party.

804
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:30,266
I lie awake at night and pray he'll die.

805
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:35,199
We are witnessing
the making of a legend, George,

806
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,331
the kind of thing
that front covers are made of.

807
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:39,831
Congratulations, George.

808
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,632
Hey, great. Thanks.

809
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,766
I'm going to miss you, George.

810
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,266
Well, you're right.

811
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:48,666
And he won't stop with just marketing

812
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,931
or even with gibb.

813
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,766
Don't get stepped on.

814
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,365
Hey, George, have a wonderful retirement.

815
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:57,067
Hey, great. Right.

816
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:03,665
Retirement, Christ.

817
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,732
Without work, I'll be dead in a year.

818
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,399
He was getting ready

819
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,333
to try the biggest trick of his career.

820
00:47:20,332 --> 00:47:23,931
Beware, Graham. Beware.

821
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:25,867
No one is safe.

822
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:29,265
You're not safe, my friend.

823
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,666
My old friend.

824
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:33,298
Not safe.

825
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:35,532
Take it easy, George. Here we go.

826
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,532
Reorganization.

827
00:47:38,533 --> 00:47:42,166
Your own report from your own office.

828
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,666
All right. All right, lie down, George.

829
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,231
Now, relax.

830
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:47,366
I've got to call a cab.

831
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:54,067
George?

832
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,366
George.

833
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:28,966
Have a good year, George.

834
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:39,399
Bob, Bob man.

835
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:42,399
The bobster.

836
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:50,100
That bad, bad Bobby.

837
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:59,999
Bobby boy.

838
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,600
Bobby, baby.

839
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:17,465
Bibbidi bobbidi...

840
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:18,466
Boo.

841
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:24,765
Could be he thinks I'm too young.

842
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:26,599
Well, he probably thought

843
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,232
that you weren't interested.

844
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,599
God, you're probably right.

845
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,766
But I am interested. What do I do?

846
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:35,666
- Give a clear signal.
- Clear signal.

847
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,066
That's all you can do.

848
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,831
You're right. You're absolutely right.

849
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:39,767
A clear signal.

850
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,931
Hi, Graham!

851
00:49:40,932 --> 00:49:42,365
Nice suit.

852
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:44,199
Hi, Melanie.

853
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,299
Stella, could I have a word with you?

854
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,699
I didn't get a chance
to say good night to you

855
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,465
at George's party.

856
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:58,632
Did you get drunk,
dance in your underwear,

857
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,500
and sing sea shanties?

858
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,833
Will you have dinner with me Saturday?

859
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:09,466
Yes.

860
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:12,299
I'll come by, like, 7:00?

861
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,831
I'll be, like, there.

862
00:50:17,832 --> 00:50:21,899
Every sorcerer needs an apprentice.

863
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,666
Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry.

864
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,365
How is it hanging or clicking or bobbing

865
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,066
or whatever it's supposed to do?

866
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,865
- Not too bad.
- Good.

867
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:39,499
You know, I would very much like

868
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,831
to see this report we've been working on.

869
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,331
Well, I don't know.

870
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,731
Bob told me to bring it out this weekend

871
00:50:44,732 --> 00:50:46,231
so he can have a first look at it.

872
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:47,931
He wants it all hush-hush.

873
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:51,798
Well, the thing is, Henry,
this isn't Bob's office.

874
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,032
It's mine.

875
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:54,931
And as my name
is going to be on that report,

876
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,798
I would like to see it.

877
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:58,199
Then maybe you should talk to Bob.

878
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,999
No, maybe you should talk to Bob,

879
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,199
because gross insubordination

880
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,399
could be the cause for your dismissal,

881
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,598
and I am asking you
to show me that report.

882
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:13,066
All right.

883
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:14,631
I'll talk to Bob.

884
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:16,300
Good.

885
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:33,798
Hello. Dr. Simms, please.

886
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,200
My name is George Brewster.

887
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:40,865
* abracadabra, shalakazam *

888
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:44,132
* bye-bye, baby, boom

889
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,398
hello, Dr. Simms.

890
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,931
No, no, I'm fine.

891
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:54,431
I'd just like to renew
my prescription for seconal.

892
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:57,666
Well... yeah, well,
I know I just had it refilled,

893
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:02,332
but I seem to have lost the bottle.

894
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:06,700
Yeah, yeah, I'm aware of the regulations.

895
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:11,832
No luck?

896
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:12,966
Very well.

897
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,899
I understand, doctor. Yeah.

898
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,067
Good-bye.

899
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:30,600
Joe.

900
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:35,366
Hi, Mr. Marshall.

901
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,798
What can I get for you?

902
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,965
Can you get me some heavy downers?

903
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:51,898
Something that'll really make me sleep.

904
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:54,965
100 bucks. Here by 5:00.

905
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:57,331
You got it.

906
00:52:57,332 --> 00:52:59,899
Thank you.

907
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:20,398
Hello?

908
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:22,331
Hudson rent-a-car?

909
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:26,732
Yeah, yeah, I'd like to rent
a car Saturday.

910
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:27,931
Yeah.

911
00:53:27,932 --> 00:53:31,799
My name is George Brewster.

912
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,099
I'm at the gibb building.

913
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,231
I'll be paying with cash.

914
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:39,332
You have a record
of my driver's license, yeah.

915
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,567
Hello.

916
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:45,266
Graham, is that you?

917
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,898
I know it's you, not your machine.

918
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:48,199
I always get your machine.

919
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,965
- Lillian.
- Well?

920
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:51,199
Where have you been?

921
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,266
Don't tell me you tried to call me back,

922
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:54,566
because I know you did not.

923
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,831
What did you say?

924
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,431
It's a bad connection, lil.

925
00:53:58,432 --> 00:53:59,999
You sound far away.

926
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,531
I've been giving them this expensive...

927
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,298
Very far away.

928
00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:05,665
But I just can't afford it.

929
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:08,499
Listen, Graham,
they are your kids, you know.

930
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,966
You are being so rude, very rude.

931
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,066
I can't hear you at all now, lil.

932
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,967
And I don't understand it either...

933
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:22,367
bibbidi bobbidi boom.

934
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:36,898
Unless, of course,

935
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,700
you would like to curse the darkness.

936
00:54:42,932 --> 00:54:44,465
George gave me this.

937
00:54:44,466 --> 00:54:45,798
Do you know why?

938
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:48,099
So that he would always have a light.

939
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,499
Let's not think about George

940
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,932
or anything sad right now.

941
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,999
I feel so happy.

942
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,833
Can't we just make the office go away?

943
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:07,432
Like it never existed at all.

944
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:10,432
Piew!

945
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:14,832
What a lovely place.

946
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:17,066
It's bigger than I thought it would be.

947
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:20,099
Okay, where's da booze?

948
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,132
In da kitchen.

949
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:29,199
What'll it be?

950
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:34,366
Surprise me.

951
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,731
What about music?

952
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:53,898
I have '60s. I have '80s.

953
00:55:53,899 --> 00:55:56,166
I have frank Sinatra. I have the Beatles.

954
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:58,231
Anything with a saxophone.

955
00:55:58,232 --> 00:56:00,000
You got it.

956
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:30,733
*

957
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,100
What's our poison?

958
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:47,633
White wine.

959
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:58,133
You're so beautiful, Stella.

960
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,265
After this...

961
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:04,166
After this.

962
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,200
Thank you, Mr. Brewster.

963
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,431
Come on. Stop complaining.

964
00:59:27,432 --> 00:59:28,732
It's not that early.

965
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:31,332
You want to get on the boat
as soon as possible.

966
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:56,432
Graham?

967
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:04,232
Graham?

968
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,466
What?

969
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:13,132
I can't remember a thing from last night.

970
01:00:16,332 --> 01:00:19,132
I can.

971
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:22,632
How was it for me?

972
01:00:24,632 --> 01:00:27,733
Well, you thought it was good.

973
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,199
Just let me get her out of the channel.

974
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,266
Then you can take the helm.

975
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:37,632
All right.

976
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:40,398
There's some coffee
down below, if you want.

977
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:42,067
Great.

978
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:50,532
Here. It gets stuck sometimes.

979
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:51,999
- Take the tiller.
- All right.

980
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,299
Just keep her going towards
that buoy over there, okay?

981
01:01:24,632 --> 01:01:27,233
That was magic.

982
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:32,066
Bibbidi...

983
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,365
Bobbidi...

984
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:36,533
Boo.

985
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:41,398
He felt like one of those gods

986
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:44,067
who appear to maidens in human form.

987
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:48,898
He knew he'd been great.

988
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:52,398
That's what always happens
when people fall in love.

989
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:55,199
Stella... such a sweet girl, really.

990
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,066
Or didn't you think
magicians could fall in love?

991
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,999
He'd have to be sure to reward her

992
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,566
for being in the right place
at the right time.

993
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:07,066
My father had it all figured out.

994
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:09,198
He was a London bus driver,

995
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:10,832
and when I was a boy,

996
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,299
he used to take me
over the river to Mayfair,

997
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,665
where the rich people lived.

998
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:19,666
And he used to say to me, "son",

999
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,866
"there is no heaven."

1000
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:25,965
"Here is the closest you'll ever get."

1001
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:28,866
"Life here is sweet."

1002
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:32,432
"Life back over there is hard."

1003
01:02:34,633 --> 01:02:36,399
"So live over here, son."

1004
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,599
In a freakish accident

1005
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,599
off the Connecticut shoreline
this morning,

1006
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,532
a privately owned sailboat
burst into flames and sank.

1007
01:02:48,533 --> 01:02:50,431
We spoke to police lieutenant Larry laker

1008
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:52,699
at the scene this afternoon.

1009
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,365
Lieutenant, what exactly happened here?

1010
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:59,499
The boat... Tara's dream...

1011
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,298
Was demolished.

1012
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:04,665
So it's going to be very hard
to determine

1013
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:08,066
a precise cause of the explosion.

1014
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,899
"The investigation is continuing."

1015
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,566
The investigation is continuing.

1016
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:12,665
I always say that.

1017
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,165
What can I say?

1018
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,131
We're tired, and we have no clues.

1019
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,765
Fuck it.

1020
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:22,099
You mind? I hate watching myself.

1021
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,265
What do you think?

1022
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,431
Well...

1023
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:29,600
For a start, I think I need
a new doorman.

1024
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:36,398
Robert benham died in that explosion.

1025
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:38,066
We haven't released that yet.

1026
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:40,099
But you're not surprised.

1027
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,298
Well, you said the name
of the boat on television.

1028
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:43,865
I knew it was Bob's.

1029
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,532
He was your superior, wasn't he?

1030
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,167
No, he was my boss.

1031
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,200
Yeah, he was your boss. Right.

1032
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,066
Well, maybe you can get his job

1033
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:58,066
now that he's gone?

1034
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,000
Maybe.

1035
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:09,198
You know, sudden death
hasn't been all bad to you.

1036
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,500
What's that supposed to mean?

1037
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,432
What do you think?

1038
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:24,799
Where were you this morning?

1039
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,398
You questioning me?

1040
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:29,067
I mean, am I a suspect?

1041
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,432
Where were you?

1042
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:42,331
I spent the night

1043
01:04:42,332 --> 01:04:44,832
with a girl called Stella Anderson.

1044
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:50,431
Am I sure?

1045
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:53,898
I apologize. A very personal question.

1046
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:56,898
Well, yes, actually. I was there.

1047
01:04:56,899 --> 01:04:58,431
I'm sure.

1048
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:01,600
We just need a witness
to confirm his whereabouts.

1049
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,633
May I come in?

1050
01:05:13,632 --> 01:05:16,631
Bob benham would have gone far.

1051
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:18,232
I'm sure he did.

1052
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:19,233
Would have.

1053
01:05:19,234 --> 01:05:20,799
But life goes on.

1054
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,265
And more importantly, business goes on.

1055
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:25,732
I need you to act as head

1056
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:28,166
until the board decides on a replacement.

1057
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,931
That doesn't bother you.

1058
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:31,331
No, not at all.

1059
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:34,566
No hard feelings about Bob
getting the spot over you.

1060
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:38,599
No, I believe the best man
always wins in the end.

1061
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,731
Good.

1062
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:41,566
Well, you'd better get back out there.

1063
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,666
It's been a madhouse today,

1064
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,798
and I need that reorganization report

1065
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,231
benham promised me.

1066
01:05:46,232 --> 01:05:49,599
I don't know these sailboats.

1067
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,398
I think my cessna is safer anytime.

1068
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:54,331
You fly a plane?

1069
01:05:54,332 --> 01:05:56,932
Every weekend.

1070
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,265
Mr. Marshall?

1071
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:04,066
Legal's having fits about the...

1072
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:05,366
Jim wants to know...

1073
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:07,399
Let's not all panic.

1074
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,567
You, you, and you panic.
The rest, stay calm.

1075
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:13,067
Now you.

1076
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,499
You've really wanted this promotion

1077
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,599
for a long time, haven't you?

1078
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,099
A man wants a lot of things.

1079
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,431
Do you hate champagne?

1080
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:32,067
I love champagne.

1081
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,499
It was so strange
talking to that cop today.

1082
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,732
It's left me with such a weird feeling.

1083
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:48,898
I don't think it's weird.

1084
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:52,298
He's doing a good job.

1085
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:56,166
If there's something wrong,
I want to know about it.

1086
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,366
Don't you?

1087
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:02,799
Cheers.

1088
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:09,900
Would you like music?

1089
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,432
I'd love some music.

1090
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:43,399
Shit.

1091
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:46,831
What?

1092
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:49,066
It's my god damn lighter.

1093
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:50,767
I can't find it.

1094
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:59,533
Where the bloody hell is it?

1095
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:10,467
*

1096
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,399
Here, Graham.

1097
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,431
Great.

1098
01:08:17,432 --> 01:08:19,667
Matches.

1099
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,066
Of course.

1100
01:08:23,067 --> 01:08:25,198
We mustn't let a little thing like this

1101
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,667
ruin our evening.

1102
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,766
I took it upon myself
to make some changes.

1103
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,832
For all Bob benham's undoubted skills,

1104
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,265
cost-cutting was not
one of his strong points.

1105
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:15,665
I'm afraid there's still
a considerable amount of fat

1106
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:18,099
to be cut from this company.

1107
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,765
So do you mean you want to reorganize

1108
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,331
the entire marketing department?

1109
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:23,965
Yes.

1110
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:25,831
It's funny.

1111
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,465
I had the wrong take on you, Marshall.

1112
01:09:28,466 --> 01:09:29,866
I had you pegged

1113
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:33,267
as one of George Brewster's
hold-the-fort boys.

1114
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:19,032
You mean extra weight in personnel?

1115
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:22,032
I mean people.
Let's get rid of some of them.

1116
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,898
Regular coke for me, please.

1117
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:27,600
Somebody left a lighter
in that rental car.

1118
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,198
George Brewster says
he didn't rent a car.

1119
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,666
The rental company says he did.

1120
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,666
Whatever. I don't know.

1121
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:37,298
Wanda, get holtz, Kim,
and Hartwell into my office

1122
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,965
at 3:00 this afternoon.

1123
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:42,766
You know, Graham, it's funny.

1124
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:44,931
Until today,
I'd never really noticed you.

1125
01:10:44,932 --> 01:10:46,298
We should get rid of anybody

1126
01:10:46,299 --> 01:10:48,599
that doesn't put the company first.

1127
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,532
Now, this man is good.

1128
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,732
He's got something to tell all of us.

1129
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:57,199
Miss Anderson, listen.

1130
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,999
It's not personal.

1131
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,166
It's just, we really need to establish

1132
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:02,431
this alibi for Marshall...

1133
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:03,499
an alibi?

1134
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,098
I told you he was there, at my house,

1135
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,266
Saturday night, all night.

1136
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:09,066
What... what can I say?

1137
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:10,631
- Okay.
- Okay.

1138
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:12,098
I have to go to work.

1139
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:14,866
Yeah, listen, I want
to give you my number

1140
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:15,966
here in New York.

1141
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,431
I'm in New York right now.

1142
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:19,799
I'd like you to have it.

1143
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,166
Fine.

1144
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,631
I really mean it

1145
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:25,599
when I say be careful.

1146
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,800
Bye. Thanks.

1147
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,965
- Marshall.
- Graham.

1148
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,331
Hi, Stella.

1149
01:11:40,332 --> 01:11:42,199
I was just wondering...
I won't take too much time...

1150
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,066
But did you find your lighter last night?

1151
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,866
Yeah.

1152
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:51,366
It was under the sofa.

1153
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,499
Now, stop distracting me.

1154
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,567
Bye, Stella.

1155
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,532
Stella?

1156
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,165
Stella, does George Brewster
ever come into the office?

1157
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,966
'Cause we just got a package,

1158
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:18,699
and I don't see his address here in the...

1159
01:12:19,932 --> 01:12:23,532
Mr. Marshall, there's a message
from Mr. Jones.

1160
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:25,067
Thank you.

1161
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,198
Executives are always on pink slips,

1162
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,466
so he would be in this one.

1163
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,066
Why can't they put them
in the right place?

1164
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:36,831
Let's see. Brewster, Brewster, Brewster.

1165
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:40,200
There.

1166
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:46,066
Would you please tell
Mr. Jones' secretary

1167
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:48,599
I can make lunch?

1168
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,432
Certainly will.

1169
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:03,567
Boy.

1170
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:14,765
You, you, and you panic.

1171
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,466
The rest of you, stay calm.

1172
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:34,667
Thanks, Joe.

1173
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,298
Melanie, you have a package
for George Brewster,

1174
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,600
and Graham said he'd be happy
to deliver it.

1175
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,333
Joe.

1176
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:14,698
What an idiot.

1177
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,066
Wrong one.

1178
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:18,167
No big deal.

1179
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,831
Stella, I'm out of here.

1180
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,699
How late are you gonna stay?

1181
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,898
Not too much longer.

1182
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:42,965
Didn't Joe pick up this package?

1183
01:15:42,966 --> 01:15:44,798
I'm sure you can get these numbers

1184
01:15:44,799 --> 01:15:46,132
for the morning, Wanda.

1185
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:48,799
It will be tight.

1186
01:15:57,767 --> 01:15:59,999
Give it a try.

1187
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,299
Good night.

1188
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,899
Taking work home, Melanie?

1189
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,233
No, I'm just going to mail these.

1190
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:37,067
Yes, I had a question
about the Bob benham case.

1191
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:40,532
Don't usually have the boss over.

1192
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:42,600
Of course, you've been here before.

1193
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,099
He almost laughed aloud.

1194
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,398
His powers had been switched on

1195
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:53,331
to the point no woman could resist him.

1196
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:55,898
The beers are in the refrigerator.

1197
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:57,533
Thank you.

1198
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,699
I'm sorry to take so long.

1199
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,665
I'll be right out.

1200
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,899
Did you find it?

1201
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,598
What?

1202
01:17:08,599 --> 01:17:10,367
Did you find the beer?

1203
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,465
It took every ounce of his self-control

1204
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:23,765
to stop himself from...

1205
01:17:23,766 --> 01:17:25,232
To remind himself

1206
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:27,499
he had come for
that god damn lighter package.

1207
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,331
You know, Melanie, I've just remembered

1208
01:17:30,332 --> 01:17:32,365
I've got quite a lot of work
to do tonight,

1209
01:17:32,366 --> 01:17:35,931
so I think I'll be going.

1210
01:17:35,932 --> 01:17:39,066
I'll...

1211
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:42,798
I'll post these letters for you
on the way home.

1212
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,066
No, just take the train.

1213
01:17:45,067 --> 01:17:48,831
I'll be right there.

1214
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:52,532
Then can I come by your place
to pick it up?

1215
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:54,332
Right away.

1216
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,632
Stella.

1217
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:30,432
Stella?

1218
01:20:32,932 --> 01:20:34,866
Graham.

1219
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:51,166
I think you have my lighter.

1220
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:54,499
I called the cop. I called laker.

1221
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,465
He's coming.

1222
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:58,632
You betrayed me.

1223
01:20:58,633 --> 01:20:59,999
Graham.

1224
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,765
You killed your wife, didn't you?

1225
01:21:02,766 --> 01:21:05,231
You did. You killed your wife.

1226
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:06,931
You killed benham.

1227
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:08,732
That's why he was asking me
all those questions.

1228
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:11,067
That's why I couldn't remember
anything on Saturday.

1229
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,067
God.

1230
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,532
You betrayed the magic.

1231
01:21:18,533 --> 01:21:20,632
Magic?

1232
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,232
Magic.

1233
01:21:24,233 --> 01:21:26,699
I trusted you.

1234
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:37,600
Give me the lighter.

1235
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:17,066
She'd felt his power.

1236
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:21,131
She'd never testify against him now.

1237
01:22:21,132 --> 01:22:24,300
And, besides, there was no evidence.

1238
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,532
She was a terrific girl, Stella.

1239
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:31,799
Very loyal.

1240
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,632
I felt badly for her,

1241
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:37,267
but it couldn't be helped.

1242
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:49,299
Help a guy out, buddy?

1243
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:58,067
God bless you.

1244
01:23:08,632 --> 01:23:10,198
Poor lieutenant laker.

1245
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,866
All hunches and circumstantial evidence,

1246
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:16,932
not even enough
to keep me in jail overnight.

1247
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:21,299
Good evening, lieutenant.

1248
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,898
And what is it this time?

1249
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:24,965
I was untouchable.

1250
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,599
Hey, wake up.

1251
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,631
And then, of course,

1252
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:35,066
there was the unexpected
and, I must say, regrettable

1253
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:39,066
suicide of George Brewster.

1254
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,231
It completely demolished whatever case

1255
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,831
laker might have tried to put together.

1256
01:23:43,832 --> 01:23:45,266
Poor old George.

1257
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:48,398
He just couldn't adapt to the new people.

1258
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:50,199
I, on the other hand,

1259
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,398
had beaten them at their own system

1260
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,199
and subsequently Rose
rather effortlessly,

1261
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,532
floating up from mere marketing

1262
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:59,999
through the corridors of policy
and on to the board

1263
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,132
and along the way promoting Stella

1264
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:04,931
to the Los Angeles office.

1265
01:24:04,932 --> 01:24:08,665
There was only one tiresome detail:

1266
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:10,698
Jones.

1267
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:15,532
He just wouldn't let go
of that corner office.

1268
01:24:32,832 --> 01:24:35,566
Abracadabra.

1269
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,166
Shalakazam.

1270
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:42,100
Bye-bye, baby.

1271
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,767
Boom.
