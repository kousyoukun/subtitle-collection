1
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,049
It all started one evening,

2
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:29,569
When the light disappeared.

3
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:42,675
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM

4
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,489
Fuse terminated.

5
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,007
Load the.
Your damn machine.

6
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,961
It is not my "stepenicarka".

7
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:04,437
Last night I almost kill me current.

8
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,173
Lines should be replaced.

9
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,910
Perhaps with your raise.

10
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,777
My raise?

11
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,556
Will host a party for improvement.
They returned my check.

12
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,030
I have not been upgraded.

13
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,244
Marijela the best supplier.

14
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:27,111
Brown receives a check everywhere.

15
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,499
For God's sake, Lez!

16
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,930
Hi Katie and Jason.

17
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,274
Did no one look after you?

18
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,229
Come little children, the grandmother
give you breakfast.

19
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:48,743
Finally we received a credit card.

20
00:02:57,822 --> 00:03:00,732
Again, the discussion about money?

21
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:04,598
Lillian, you're correct.

22
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:09,116
Do not be sarcastic.

23
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,635
I came to congratulate you on ...

24
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:14,372
Coffee is simmering.

25
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,367
We are we ..? This ...?

26
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:22,321
I still have some names.

27
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:26,925
How much should a chair? 250?

28
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:29,488
A lot of the 150th

29
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:33,571
He always considered himself a wizard.

30
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,569
Everything is repaired ...

31
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,825
and now in his own home
constant interruption of electricity.

32
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,561
Goodbye sweetheart.

33
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,947
I love you. Kill the dragon ....

34
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:54,638
If the wizard is not the main
in your home, what is?

35
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:58,851
He expected to improve.

36
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:02,239
For a long time and deserved.

37
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:09,103
He was losing the magic, as soon as he stepped into the train

38
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,013
that goes to the suburbs.

39
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,007
Every day, every day ...

40
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,911
Ready for battle, George?

41
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,734
No, all I did for you.

42
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,731
Read the newspapers.

43
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,381
're Fainthearted.

44
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,596
These mergers serve

45
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,767
BE DETACHED folks like me.

46
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:47,241
Graham, I eventually times.

47
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,455
I know I do.

48
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,878
The invasion of aliens.

49
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:07,353
New people. Electrical and substance.

50
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,655
I hear you, George.

51
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:12,696
Stop them at the time that you do not overrun.

52
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,563
"This program makes us an effective" ...

53
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:19,993
Blah, blah, blah - bullshit
Graham. Nonsense.

54
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,424
So all izmuze.

55
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,726
I will go on.

56
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:30,679
That our system was rolled,
they are taking us?

57
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,672
Daso, give dollar ...

58
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:40,104
Do you make a million a year?

59
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,622
This town is like Calcutta.

60
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,141
New York was once a pleasure ...

61
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:55,090
That's true. New York is
more what it was.

62
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:07,209
Lend me $ 20.
Certainly I get.

63
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,815
I'm not going to the only practical person.

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,291
Red gets, secreted.

65
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,331
It is hardly noticed temptations.

66
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,110
Sometimes it is just to notice a.

67
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,018
Recalled its impact on women.

68
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:30,318
Sometimes, in these perilous times.

69
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:32,447
When you come from England,

70
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,618
There were no problems.

71
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,475
For the Mladoturke

72
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:51,646
efficiency of a smokescreen.

73
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:56,772
Remember the movie where
aliens conquered people?

74
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,638
People - green beans!

75
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,983
Invaders of the body!
- Is the invasion the invaders of the body.

76
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,980
It was a funky film.

77
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:08,283
Green beans, green beans ...

78
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,929
To switch Walter for 10 h?

79
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,188
Okay. Check with Frank.

80
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,358
This ad is great.

81
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,442
A figure from the west coast?

82
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:24,702
Not yet.

83
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:26,657
Do not touch it.

84
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,003
Graham.

85
00:07:28,003 --> 00:07:30,262
Results from Kentucky.

86
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,433
It is not crap?

87
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,562
It is not shit.

88
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,212
Shit is ...

89
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,163
I know that at some trza�.

90
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:45,725
Calm down, already.

91
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,244
Stella, I do not know who this person.

92
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:57,237
It is a job.
And make myself familiar with the boss.

93
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,398
Graham?

94
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:13,482
One moment, Stella.

95
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:16,740
Look at this. The essence is mine.

96
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,173
What is it?

97
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:21,822
The program for data analysis.

98
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:23,560
What is it?

99
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:26,643
It is anticipated consumer reaction.

100
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:29,293
He buys the product for them?

101
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:30,553
Not yet.

102
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,986
Bring me to buy when it starts.

103
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:34,853
This is a savings.

104
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:38,285
I'm sorry, Stella.

105
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:42,976
This is Meloni O Connor.
Do you remember it is? Roommate.

106
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:46,495
Mr. Marshals, thank you for
opportunity that we provide.

107
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:51,621
You will be definitely good.
Stella will show

108
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,662
all about work.

109
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,571
My biography.

110
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,390
Zlatan is.

111
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,995
Peter Reynolds called to congratulate.

112
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,122
Very nice.

113
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,641
Bob ...

114
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,550
About what ...

115
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,461
Forget it, there is something more important.

116
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,632
On behalf of the Young Turk
I invite you to lunch ...

117
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,934
ahead of your recent promotion.

118
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,151
Today?

119
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,191
It is mandatory. Coarse jokes.

120
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,276
It will feed your ass.

121
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:37,186
Humiliating. When?

122
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:40,574
At 12.30. Bring the ass.

123
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,093
In the elevator at 12.30.

124
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:45,005
Clearly.

125
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,604
Thank you Melanie job.

126
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:58,514
You will see that is great.

127
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,989
Congratulations.

128
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,987
I hear that zamenjuje� Brewster. Finally.

129
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:08,808
Yes, it is high time.

130
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:11,980
Jones to be published on Friday.

131
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,804
And I heard it.

132
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,063
You will have two days to celebrate.

133
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:18,365
And three wonderful nights.

134
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,841
How do you fill the night?

135
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:26,401
With vanity complaining.

136
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,311
It would also have chosen.

137
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:36,262
The weekend, down a boat.

138
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,650
And when we our own?

139
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:43,341
It comes and Tara.

140
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,731
Tara? What's the name?

141
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:59,066
Svalerka his plantation.

142
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,150
Gentlemen ... do not understand.

143
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,279
We are a young, proud ...

144
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,882
I am not ashamed of success. We speak:
Yes, I already have a boat.

145
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:14,964
Cottage, by Tara female.
Repeat after me.

146
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:17,006
I have a Mercedes.

147
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:18,830
I have an apartment with a swimming pool.

148
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,436
I have a personal trainer.

149
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:27,474
I have a wife, mortgage, and two dogs.

150
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,817
Old-fashioned family.

151
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,467
That's it.

152
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,897
His promotion ...

153
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:46,456
The highlight of working life.

154
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,758
Could not be better.

155
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,967
Chit Chat, Bob.

156
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,268
What is your hell?

157
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,353
What is it?

158
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:11,520
Graham, can we talk?

159
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:26,809
What happened, George?

160
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,373
Someone has lost steam?

161
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,540
They are seeking to retire early.

162
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,363
Sorry, George.

163
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,403
I wanted to place ...

164
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,442
but not that way.

165
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,222
I do not understand me wrong.

166
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,434
They want to stay, but ...

167
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,298
believe that when it comes to the head ...

168
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,860
What? Who believes?

169
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,203
The general impression is that you are not in line ...

170
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,982
new project.

171
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:17,501
What do you mean?

172
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:23,495
Did not get promoted.

173
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,576
Kidding me?

174
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,052
Sorry.

175
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,962
These dupeglavci.

176
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:42,087
Unbelievable! Fucking dupeglavci.

177
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,041
The new rules of the game.

178
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:48,906
And who is the new head of department?

179
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,509
Bene.

180
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,594
Robert Bene.

181
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,590
Bene?

182
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:11,320
Long live the new hero?

183
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:14,491
Difficult for us.

184
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,983
Do you have any spare change?

185
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,765
No ... leaves.

186
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:07,789
Come on, give a couple ...

187
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,830
I said, go away!

188
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:19,126
I might as well learn good manners.

189
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,776
Carry!

190
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,281
Ladies and Gentlemen,

191
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:42,669
This composition entails ...

192
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:46,492
Now exit the train.

193
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:54,180
Let all leave the train.

194
00:15:54,788 --> 00:16:00,001
There's an accident and this is
composition is withdrawn.

195
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,434
Is it really killed a man?

196
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:55,123
Running away from him as if
Two persons - on the murderer!

197
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,076
Hey, do not do.

198
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,203
Grand Central Station.
- Good.

199
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:04,375
It must be in shock.

200
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:08,067
The crowd, the adrenaline, the fear ....

201
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,674
For God's sake. Fear ...

202
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,485
You left early. I am not served.

203
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:29,308
I guess they have a bar on the train.

204
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,775
You know, Graham. I lost my will
Vendin after death.

205
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:49,984
Woman, health ... that's all that matters.

206
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:01,582
Torn shirt. Must
he killed a man.

207
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,275
You are like to me.

208
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,185
You know that human life is important ...

209
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:15,265
It is important ... life!

210
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,865
... Murder, Graham.

211
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:26,125
What?

212
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,122
This day was the right murder.

213
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:32,987
They took me back-dated checks

214
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:37,157
so we still have a party.

215
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,851
Look at that.

216
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,109
Brljivko.

217
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:44,021
He threw you a good shirt.

218
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,062
Is torn.

219
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,320
Zakrpice the Esmeralda.

220
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:53,230
Then came Mr. Martel.

221
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,140
My machine is blocked.

222
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:59,224
The fuse has tripped.

223
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,092
Again fuse.

224
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,478
I g. Martel said. I paid him ...

225
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,346
... 153 dollars.

226
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,301
You need to save, Leslie.

227
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,516
What? The shirt?

228
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:16,556
Maybe a short circuit in my phone.

229
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:20,595
It is not torn.

230
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:23,853
I thought it was.

231
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,806
What's tonight?

232
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:31,367
Me? Nothing.

233
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,577
Graham.

234
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,315
Bob Bene and requests.

235
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,618
Good.

236
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:49,177
Mr. Bob. Sir Robert.

237
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,826
He D�ord�ovoj office.

238
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,516
Oh, King Bob!

239
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:14,719
I'm uncomfortable.
I know you wanted to place.

240
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:19,062
That we rival rulers, I would kill you.

241
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:25,186
It is not easy to kill and get away with it.

242
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,965
We could be found this weekend ...

243
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,528
in a cottage ...
You and Leslie, me and Tara.

244
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:34,787
It Tara.

245
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,565
It would be nice, Bob.

246
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:44,821
Being a bit of sailing, lots �deranja ...

247
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:50,337
and discuss the new order.

248
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,597
Got a light?

249
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:52,596
Yes, of course.

250
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,799
He expected that it

251
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,535
lightning strike.

252
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:15,357
Hey, do you have some spare change?

253
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:25,174
Thank you. God help you.

254
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:27,172
There was no thunder.

255
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:32,081
It felt right ... pure ... free.

256
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:38,031
As he fell to the burden on his back.

257
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,949
Because we are late for the train?

258
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:21,946
Where did you get of the train?

259
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,771
They are all so young.

260
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:27,550
Whiskey.

261
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,026
No, wait. I want something youthful.

262
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,718
Shirley Temple?

263
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:36,064
Light beer and a supplement for my dad.

264
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:39,017
No, I will still whiskey.

265
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:43,231
Who is the Bene?

266
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,404
Where?

267
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,881
There.

268
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:50,094
Henry Park. Kompjutera� the lower floors.

269
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:55,176
Safe drinking something lively.

270
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,479
You are my lively.

271
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,129
Nasty thing.

272
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,432
Mr. Marshals ...

273
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,648
You do not give that place.

274
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,774
You acted noble, lively.

275
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,073
I have not said a woman.

276
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:15,592
Why did not you?

277
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,502
I was afraid of the reaction.

278
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:23,107
Nonsense. It happens.

279
00:23:23,107 --> 00:23:25,105
Her husband does not.

280
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,404
Usually in front of me disappear obstacles.

281
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,396
She thinks she is a woman Merlin.

282
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,001
Merlin, the wizard of King Arthur.

283
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:47,910
Discreet is the same as dranje.

284
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:51,515
It is too expensive for us.

285
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,599
Is not a machine fault.

286
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,596
Why do we need machines "stepenicarka"
next steps?

287
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:01,202
I have to practice climbing

288
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,720
no, down the stairs.

289
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,802
It is wrong to ukljucuje�.

290
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,492
Very impressive, Einstein.

291
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:19,097
Should not that be a game?

292
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,184
Fuck!

293
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:24,310
Graham, I'll call again, Mr. Martelija.

294
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,482
No way!

295
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:30,956
Ubacicu switch and everything will work!

296
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:44,813
You know, I save money.
How long will it take?

297
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:49,590
I saw a check for 2157 dollars.

298
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,675
Repayment.

299
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:55,194
And the big one in 3300 dollars?

300
00:24:55,672 --> 00:24:57,409
Life insurance.

301
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,885
I've got a share.

302
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:05,185
Now, with a nice raise ...

303
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:11,266
I feel that it comes

304
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:15,653
male bias.

305
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,387
Reputation is that you have a fine woman.

306
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,037
And a nice house.

307
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:28,554
Do not blame me that sign
checks, when ...

308
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:30,552
Leslie ...

309
00:25:34,027 --> 00:25:37,545
Come to show you.

310
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:44,931
Do I need to know?
- Yes, you.

311
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,231
Hold up here.

312
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,140
Is that good?
- Are ...

313
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:56,876
Keep the right hand pipe ... firm.

314
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,873
Dirty and wet.

315
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:03,782
This is for balance.

316
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,295
Now your left hand firmly

317
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:16,987
pull the chain.

318
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:27,716
I see. There are fuses.

319
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,365
My hand is ... Poof ...

320
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:34,840
I did not get a place, Leslie.
- What now?

321
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:37,837
What?

322
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:41,486
I did not get promoted.

323
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:44,353
You have gained. I always get.

324
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:50,130
I'm sorry. I know lots of you meant.

325
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:55,255
I do not know, Graham.

326
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:58,730
You do not know what I meant.

327
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:03,465
Then he realized that she was a witch.

328
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,980
I would have to be
release of its seems.

329
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:19,537
Hey, where are you so?

330
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,317
I guess no traffic?

331
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,620
He lost.

332
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:30,961
This is Tara. Not plantations.

333
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:34,002
Tara Liston? Model?

334
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:36,478
I'm glad.

335
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,475
Ranch to show them?

336
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:41,473
We will have to.

337
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:42,994
Here you are.

338
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:55,546
It was perfect, it is perfect.
The house is perfect, everything is perfect!

339
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:57,849
The real American dream.

340
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,369
It looks closely,

341
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:01,889
but large for the night.

342
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,668
I want one.

343
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:07,362
Not bad, right?

344
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,271
No, really.

345
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:14,399
What he ...

346
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,558
Graham?

347
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,250
Can you help me?

348
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,467
Of course.

349
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,242
This gas. Stuck.

350
00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,327
Let me try.
- Here.

351
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,748
Thank you, noble sir.

352
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,831
Which lead department in the company, Graham?

353
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,047
I am in marketing.

354
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,262
Now you have the BOB?

355
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:09,955
Am.

356
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:43,402
Power was leaving him.
He had to glumata.

357
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:48,615
The dead, all the best,
But George is out of date.

358
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:54,218
Our hackers will connect us
with the world for six months.

359
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,867
Just do not overdo it.

360
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:01,602
It is exciting to plan.

361
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:03,340
Next week in San Francisco

362
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,381
you will see our plans.

363
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,030
When?

364
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,679
On Wednesday, I think.

365
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,111
On the day of the meeting of heads?

366
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:17,023
Actually, yes.

367
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,107
I lead the meeting.

368
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:22,366
He led him before you

369
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,928
George because he hated it.

370
00:30:25,797 --> 00:30:28,881
It was a meeting of heads.

371
00:30:31,227 --> 00:30:34,267
We're talking with George.

372
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:37,525
We cleared.

373
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,781
Graham.

374
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:46,083
You have a lighter in his pocket.

375
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,194
Bar one goes on vacation.

376
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,103
Have fun, sweetie.

377
00:31:57,233 --> 00:32:01,185
Remember once ... We had nothing.

378
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,357
Do not be so miserable.

379
00:32:09,352 --> 00:32:11,915
I forgive you what you did not succeed.

380
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,479
Graham.

381
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:16,606
I forgive you what you did not succeed.

382
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,817
I have the machine repaired.

383
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,337
Good.

384
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,639
Say goodbye to daddy.

385
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:47,751
He did not know what will happen.

386
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:51,009
In fact, for the first time trying.

387
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,962
He gambled with destiny.

388
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:57,394
Or none at all.

389
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,826
And we have created here ...

390
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:04,475
boundary of responsibility.

391
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:27,061
Damn, Graham.

392
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:36,965
Fuck!

393
00:34:32,957 --> 00:34:34,868
Hello?

394
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:36,866
Mr. Marshall ...

395
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:40,862
Unfortunately, we have for you is very bad news.

396
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:44,033
Accident?

397
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:48,681
Yes, really sorry.

398
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,154
My gosh .... what a terrible shock.

399
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:08,358
Do not want to say anything?

400
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:11,876
Yes ... course.

401
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,739
Leslie's favorite ...

402
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:24,473
Your mother and I have brought you here ...

403
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:27,905
to share the latest mutual ...

404
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:34,942
moment of sorrow and pain.

405
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,935
Are you going to say something or not?

406
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,296
Abracadabra!

407
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,813
Hocus pocus.
Bye bye, baby ...

408
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:21,594
Bam!

409
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,843
I have called you in San Francisco.
Larry Lejker.

410
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:36,102
Police from Connecticut.

411
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:37,318
Yes.

412
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,315
To stop by later?
- No, no.

413
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,051
I do not care.

414
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:51,522
Help about those wires to the bulb ...

415
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:54,737
Cursed stepenicarka.
My name is ...

416
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,039
Your mother in law told me.

417
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:00,861
But insulation tape ...

418
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,986
Insulating tape?

419
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,201
Below is all the dust.

420
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,329
At the bar there is no trace.

421
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:16,325
Mr. Marshall? I came by Katie and Jason.

422
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:19,105
Jason was there, Katie is with him.

423
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:23,188
Home to the dogs?

424
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,751
Yes. I am moving to town.

425
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:32,179
Well I found you.
I wonder the tape.

426
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:34,743
Below is all the dust.

427
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:38,478
This piece of hung without a trace of dust.

428
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:42,692
I was down ...

429
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:45,210
I fastened the tape ...

430
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,989
If I had done better ...

431
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:55,332
Do not criticize yourself, it happens.

432
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:57,590
You are only human.

433
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,414
If that's all ...

434
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:04,366
I would like to stay alone.

435
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,495
Absolutely. I wanted it to clear.

436
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,449
Continue with mourning.

437
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:03,485
Honey, coffee is wonderful.

438
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:10,304
I am the new secretary Mr Ben.

439
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,171
I heard about your wife, and I'm very sorry.

440
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:20,729
Graham, sorry I missed you.

441
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,772
Is Bob here? - Yes.

442
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:26,030
Sorry, I sent you a telegram.

443
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:28,375
Bob Has Come?

444
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,764
Yes there is. Does not receive anyone.

445
00:39:30,764 --> 00:39:34,109
Imagine what they did.

446
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,409
I'm sorry for your wife.

447
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:39,494
Thanks, I appreciate it.

448
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:41,319
Give it to me.

449
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:44,925
Bosbster asked to give it.
Do you know where?

450
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:48,574
I do not know. See D�ord�ovoj office.

451
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:51,744
Amy, does a couple of Bob
minutes for me?

452
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:53,786
He and his decorator.

453
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,044
Graham.

454
00:39:59,737 --> 00:40:03,776
It is hard. I am shocked.

455
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:05,861
You got a telegram?

456
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:07,208
Yes, thank you.

457
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:10,205
I keep thinking of you.

458
00:40:11,421 --> 00:40:13,724
I am, as they say ...

459
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:17,155
or less well.

460
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:22,455
Here's what you asked for.

461
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:31,316
Stella finds all Enderson.

462
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:43,175
Have dinner?

463
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:47,518
I give up. Vecerajmo together.

464
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:49,516
Tonight?

465
00:40:50,254 --> 00:40:52,122
Tonight.

466
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:04,937
You know what I think about these
people pods.

467
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:09,931
If you like them, you have no manhood.

468
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:11,930
The worst is when a business woman

469
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,015
suspect in masculinity.

470
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,751
Bene does not think about people as o. ..

471
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:18,750
Human beings.

472
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,487
You are different.

473
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,746
Good old Graham.

474
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,439
Bob would never appreciate Melanie.

475
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:26,916
Melanie?

476
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:30,087
It has long been prepared for the job.

477
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:35,125
For Bene, she's a loser,
... just like you.

478
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:38,514
Because of different
they treat people.

479
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:43,379
You have the power of observation.

480
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:51,589
You talk about people and listening to others.

481
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,977
But the self is never spoken.

482
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:57,453
Why?

483
00:41:57,453 --> 00:41:59,929
I'm afraid I can not discover.

484
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,447
Do not be afraid.

485
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,311
Good night.

486
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,385
The world has become

487
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:24,297
his oyster.

488
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:28,032
Now he is forcibly opened.

489
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:50,055
I will try to be polite, Henry.

490
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:54,355
What do you do that devil in my office?

491
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:57,569
Bob says to help you
some reorganization.

492
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:02,956
Also changed the question.

493
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,169
What the hell you looking at my office?

494
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,428
Bob insisted on the computer.

495
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:13,685
It's not about the computer, but on your desk!

496
00:43:14,945 --> 00:43:16,422
Bob thinks ...

497
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,289
I'll ask Bob.

498
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,966
What are you doing, George?

499
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,962
Bob asked me to wait outside.

500
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:46,394
And you're standing in the passage?

501
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:53,300
Busy, you know.
I did not want to challenge ...

502
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:59,729
What the hell asks Henry

503
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:02,074
in my office?

504
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:07,330
Wait a minute.

505
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,544
Anyway, hurry. I will send invoice.

506
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:22,230
It is highly sought after decorator.
What is it?

507
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:25,661
Someone in my office.

508
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:29,484
More effective is to collaborate more closely.

509
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:31,959
This is my office!

510
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:35,087
This is the office assistant boss!

511
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:38,128
It is your office.

512
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:41,863
Why do not you put here Pork?

513
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:43,080
It is already ...

514
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,730
What you do not bring Melanie?

515
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:49,726
Bring komunalci,
to do everything, cleaner ...

516
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,935
Yes, I need an assistant.

517
00:44:57,935 --> 00:45:01,497
What do you mean?
I do not do their job?

518
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,103
What I can not remove?

519
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:05,536
Bobby?

520
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:07,404
I can not let go

521
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:09,750
as a senior officer.

522
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:13,529
So I terrace piece?

523
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,657
Take away my rights ...

524
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:21,348
You want little by little to me razvlasti�.

525
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,865
Listen, bobster ...

526
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,905
Fuck it you can get it in power.

527
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,770
I have to hand over power

528
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:38,375
but as you know.

529
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:02,787
Get out of the passage, George.

530
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:08,912
HAPPY RETIREMENT

531
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:16,731
George?

532
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,902
Cheers. - Cheers.

533
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:24,680
Bob is another.

534
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:29,632
At night I wake up and pray that he dies.

535
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,627
It is the creation of legends, George.

536
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:37,841
These are the headlines.

537
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:39,752
Congratulations.

538
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,404
Thank you.

539
00:46:44,922 --> 00:46:47,354
It will not stop on the marketing ...

540
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,914
Hey, George, I congratulate you retire.

541
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,514
Pensions, for God's sake!

542
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:06,033
No job was dead within a year.

543
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:13,069
He was ready for the greatest
trick of his career.

544
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:21,800
Take care, Graham ...

545
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:25,883
No one is sure.

546
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:28,968
You are not safe, an old friend.

547
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:33,094
You did not.

548
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:35,439
Calm down, George.

549
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:38,393
Reorganization ...

550
00:47:38,393 --> 00:47:41,738
It comes from your office.

551
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:44,475
Lie down, George.

552
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,039
Relax.

553
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:53,857
George?

554
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:57,071
George?

555
00:48:26,218 --> 00:48:28,911
Happy those years, George.

556
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:37,859
Bob, Bob!

557
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,638
Bobster!

558
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:50,065
Evil Bobby.

559
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,318
Bobby Battle.

560
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,489
Bobby baby.

561
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,424
You might consider me too young.

562
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:28,725
Perhaps he believes de that is not interested.

563
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:32,286
Maybe you're right.
I'm interested. What should I do?

564
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:35,153
Give him the signal. - Signal?

565
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:38,411
The only possibility.
- Exactly. A clear signal ...

566
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:40,279
Hi, Graham.

567
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:42,277
Nice suit.

568
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:43,667
Hi Melanie.

569
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,926
Stella, can we talk?

570
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:54,178
We have not forgiven the party D�ord�ovoj.

571
00:49:55,048 --> 00:49:58,523
Have you played intoxicated and rude?

572
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:05,255
Can slubotu dinner?

573
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:07,775
Yes.

574
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,467
Svraticu about seven.

575
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,289
... I'll be there.

576
00:50:17,288 --> 00:50:20,589
Each wizard to a student.

577
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:29,884
Henry, Henry, Henry.

578
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:33,316
How klepeci, landara or berries ...

579
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,965
Not bad. - Good.

580
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:40,700
I would like to see the report
where we work.

581
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:44,958
I do not know. Bob I wear for the weekend.

582
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,824
There will be ascertained.

583
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:50,995
But this is my office.

584
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:55,425
I sign the report,
I want to see him.

585
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:57,945
Then ask Bob.

586
00:50:57,945 --> 00:51:00,160
You ask Bob.

587
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,026
Disobedience is a cause for dismissal.

588
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,587
Show me the report.

589
00:51:12,063 --> 00:51:14,104
I will talk with Bob.

590
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,103
Good.

591
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:32,825
Doctor Sims, please.

592
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:36,127
Here George Brewster.

593
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:42,642
Hocus pocus, bye bye baby, BOOM!

594
00:51:43,554 --> 00:51:45,944
Dr. Sims?

595
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:49,158
No, I'm fine.

596
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:52,720
I want a new recipe for Sekonal ...

597
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:59,627
So, I recently got.
I lost my bottle.

598
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:05,838
I understand the regulations ...

599
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,964
I have no luck?

600
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:14,178
I understand you, Doctor.

601
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:34,681
What do you want?

602
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:50,100
Get me one more tool
sleeping.

603

$ 100. There will be up to five hours.

604
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,877
It counts.

605
00:52:57,181 --> 00:52:58,789
Thank you.

606
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:21,766
Hudson car - a car?

607
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,068
Yes, I'll take the car on Saturday.

608
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:30,064
Yes, I am George Brewster.

609
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:32,930
The palace Gib.

610
00:53:33,452 --> 00:53:37,882
I pay in cash, you have all my data.

611
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:46,526
Graham, it's you ... is not
answering machine ...

612
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:52,217
Where are you? I know you're not looking.

613
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,126
What?

614
00:53:55,257 --> 00:53:57,602
The bad connection ...

615
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:13,544
Lily can not hear you.

616
00:54:35,046 --> 00:54:38,781
or want to proklinje� darkness?

617
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:47,251
George gave to me.
Had he fallen cigar.

618
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:51,291
Not sad about razmi�ljajmo
George and sad things ...

619
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:03,454
What's not forget the job?

620
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:06,538
As that did not exist.

621
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:16,441
It is wonderful. Larger than I expected.

622
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,829
Where's the drink?

623
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,133
In the kitchen.

624
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,343
What do you want?

625
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,339
Surprise me.

626
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,883
And the music? I have Frank
Sinatra ... Beatles ...

627
00:55:55,883 --> 00:55:58,229
Anything with the saxophone.

628
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,184
Okay.

629
00:56:37,844 --> 00:56:40,146
What poison?

630
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:48,008
White wine.

631
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:56,782
You are so beautiful, Stella.

632
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,213
After this ...

633
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,428
After this.

634
00:58:56,757 --> 00:58:58,363
Thank you, Mr. Brewster.

635
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:29,117
Come on, stop whining.
I want that I have two on board.

636
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:55,701
Graham?

637
01:00:01,304 --> 01:00:03,259
Graham?

638
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,646
What is it?

639
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,469
I do not remember anything from last night.

640
01:00:15,683 --> 01:00:17,724
I can remember.

641
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,154
How it was?

642
01:00:25,717 --> 01:00:27,671
You thought that was nice.

643
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:36,880
Will bring it out of the canal, so you
download stern. - Good.

644
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,398
Dole has a cafe.
- Great.

645
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:51,779
Sometimes you get stuck. Take stern.
- Good.

646
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,820
Administration according to that buoy.

647
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,095
It was magical.

648
01:01:39,213 --> 01:01:43,078
He felt like a god in human form.

649
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:47,162
He knew he was brilliant.

650
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:51,679
So when a man falls in love.

651
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:54,112
Stella is cute.

652
01:01:54,373 --> 01:01:57,500
Can wizards to fall in love?

653
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,845
They will have the reward.

654
01:02:03,537 --> 01:02:09,662
My father was a driver
buses in London.

655
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,702
As a small led me into the
Mayfair well-to-quarter.

656
01:02:15,093 --> 01:02:20,305
He told me:
"Son, there is no heaven.

657
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,127
This is very similar to the sky.

658
01:02:25,257 --> 01:02:27,733
Life is beautiful here.

659
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:30,426
Life there is difficult.

660
01:02:30,512 --> 01:02:35,552
So my son, who lives here. "

661
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:44,325
In severe accident this morning

662
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:47,974
private boat exploded.

663
01:02:47,974 --> 01:02:50,711
We spoke with Larry Lejkerom.

664
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,011
Lieutenant, what happened?

665
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:57,357
The boat ...

666
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:01,223
Tarin dream is destroyed ...

667
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:07,348
and will be difficult to determine
cause of the explosion ...

668
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:09,736
but the investigation continues.

669
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:12,126
The investigation continues.

670
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:15,731
I always say.
Should I say no trace?

671
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:22,681
I hate to watch myself. What do you think.

672
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:28,806
First, I need a new goalkeeper.

673
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:37,320
In the explosion killed
Robert Bene.

674
01:03:37,362 --> 01:03:39,274
It's not surprising you?

675
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:43,227
You mentioned the name of the ship.
I know it's Bob.

676
01:03:43,314 --> 01:03:45,702
He was your superior?

677
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:48,092
My boss.

678
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:56,476
Maybe now you'll get this place?

679
01:03:57,648 --> 01:03:59,646
Maybe.

680
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:06,943
You use this death.

681
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:11,853
What's that supposed to mean?

682
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,456
What do you think?

683
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:22,451
Where were you this morning?

684
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:28,054
Questioning me? I suspect?

685
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,266
Where were you?

686
01:04:39,696 --> 01:04:44,257
I spent a night with Stella Anderson.

687
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:49,990
Am I safe?

688
01:04:50,295 --> 01:04:53,465
Sorry. The question is indiscreet.

689
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,853
Yes, I was with him ... I'm sure.

690
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:01,284
You need someone to confirm where he was.

691
01:05:01,979 --> 01:05:04,151
Can I enter?

692
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:16,139
Bob Bene would get very far.

693
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,138
Certainly ... order.

694
01:05:18,529 --> 01:05:20,961
Life and business go on.

695
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:27,129
You will be acting head until we find a replacement.

696
01:05:27,477 --> 01:05:29,301
It does not bother you?

697
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:30,908
No, not at all.

698
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:33,471
Do not be angry?

699
01:05:33,906 --> 01:05:37,554
No. Best win in the end.

700
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:42,289
There was a madhouse.

701
01:05:42,289 --> 01:05:45,287
We need this proposal
for reorganization.

702
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:48,370
I do not know, and sailing ...

703
01:05:49,022 --> 01:05:51,454
My Cessna is safer.

704
01:05:51,845 --> 01:05:53,930
You fly?

705
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,493
Every weekend.

706
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:03,356
The lawyers are concerned.

707
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,528
They expect a report.

708
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:09,742
Just do not panic. You and your
panic. The other, calmly.

709
01:06:19,298 --> 01:06:22,426
It has long promotion you wanted?

710
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:25,857
Everything a man wants.

711
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,897
You hate champagne?

712
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:31,113
I love champagne.

713
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:40,886
I talk with a cop
was uncomfortable.

714
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:49,922
Why embarrassing? He does his job.

715
01:06:51,658 --> 01:06:56,610
If something is wrong,
I want to know that. And you?

716
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:00,868
Cheers!

717
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:09,990
Want some music?

718
01:07:10,728 --> 01:07:12,857
I want a little music.

719
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,872
Shit.

720
01:07:44,956 --> 01:07:46,347
What?

721
01:07:46,347 --> 01:07:48,779
I can not find a lighter.

722
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:58,813
Where is, what the hell?

723
01:08:12,582 --> 01:08:14,364
Here, Graham.

724
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:16,319
Great.

725
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:19,533
Matches.

726
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:25,397
The little things we should not spoil the evening.

727
01:09:02,536 --> 01:09:05,359
... Insist on changes.

728
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,053
Bob Bene, despite everything,

729
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:10,832
did not reduce costs.

730
01:09:12,093 --> 01:09:16,349
There's still room for huge savings.

731
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:18,912
So

732
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:21,736
to reorganize the entire marketing?

733
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:22,951
Yes.

734
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:27,642
I had the wrong opinion of you.

735
01:09:27,817 --> 01:09:31,509
I thought that you are obsolete
and George Brewster.

736
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:17,770
You mean the staff?

737
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:20,680
Yes, some are redundant.

738
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:22,678
Interesting.

739
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:26,327
In a rented car
forgotten lighter.

740
01:10:28,759 --> 01:10:32,147
Brewster argues that it is not rented car ...
company claims to be.

741
01:10:32,147 --> 01:10:33,929
I do not know.

742
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:38,272
Let Heights, Kim and Hordvel be
three for me.

743
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:44,006
To this day, and, say,
I never noticed.

744
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,915
Anyone whose job is on the first
place to go.

745
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:51,521
This man can teach us.

746
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:55,821
Miss Anderson ...

747
01:10:55,821 --> 01:11:00,513
we need to establish an alibi for Mr. Marsala.

748
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:05,681
Alibi? He was with me
all night on Saturday.

749
01:11:05,942 --> 01:11:07,983
I hurry to work.

750
01:11:11,459 --> 01:11:15,629
Here's my number in New York.

751
01:11:16,453 --> 01:11:18,017
Just in case.

752
01:11:19,494 --> 01:11:20,928
Good.

753
01:11:21,623 --> 01:11:23,578
Be careful.

754
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,183
Goodbye. Thank you.

755
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:37,955
Marshall. - Graham.

756
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,735
Hi Stella.

757
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:43,342
Have you found your lighter?

758
01:11:43,907 --> 01:11:45,513
Am.

759
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:50,900
He was under the sofa.

760
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,982
Now I have a job Stella.

761
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:08,622
Stella?

762
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:13,618
George Brewster draws you?

763
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:17,179
He received the package, and I have his address.

764
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:22,826
Message from Mr. Jones.

765
01:12:22,913 --> 01:12:24,825
Thank you.

766
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:28,430
Managers are always on the list.

767
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:34,163
As you put it where you need?

768
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:36,509
Let's see ... Brewster.

769
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,247
here it is ...

770
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:47,499
Please contact the secretary Mr Jones
I come to lunch.

771
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:48,975
Of course.

772
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:16,601
You, you, and you, panic.
Further, be calm.

773
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:49,528
One package for Brewster
Graham will deliver.

774
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,030
Joe.

775
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:15,156
Mistake.

776
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,241
It does not matter.

777
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:36,340
I'm out. As long as you stay?

778
01:15:36,514 --> 01:15:38,860
Just a little bit.

779
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:41,553
Joe has not taken a package?

780
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,115
Prepare it by morning.

781
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:59,058
Attempt.

782
01:15:59,753 --> 01:16:02,012
Good night.

783
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,746
Wearing work home?

784
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:09,744
No, I will send this.

785
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:34,590
I'm interested in something about
Bob Bene case.

786
01:16:37,457 --> 01:16:41,366
I remember. You came here.

787
01:16:45,015 --> 01:16:47,317
It was powerful.

788
01:16:47,404 --> 01:16:51,270
And women are not resisted.

789
01:16:52,617 --> 01:16:54,658
Beer in the fridge.

790
01:16:55,093 --> 01:16:56,048
Thank you.

791
01:16:58,611 --> 01:17:00,566
Sorry ...

792
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,389
here I am, now.

793
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,256
Have you found? - What?

794
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:10,512
Beer.

795
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:21,068
He barely managed to gather ...

796
01:17:22,631 --> 01:17:26,932
and remind ourselves that the package came.

797
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,365
Melani,

798
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:32,014
I have a job, so I have to hurry.

799
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:40,789
This I will throw you in the mail.

800
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,785
Go underground.

801
01:17:44,872 --> 01:17:46,436
I'll be there.

802
01:17:47,739 --> 01:17:50,171
Can I pick you?

803
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:53,299
Immediately.

804
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,806
Stella.

805
01:20:28,284 --> 01:20:30,456
Stella!

806
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:33,974
Graham!

807
01:20:48,092 --> 01:20:51,045
I think you have my lighter.

808
01:20:51,045 --> 01:20:53,781
I called the police ....
Lejkera.

809
01:20:53,825 --> 01:20:55,259
He comes ...

810
01:20:55,866 --> 01:20:57,647
She released me.

811
01:20:57,647 --> 01:21:01,600
Graham ...
You killed your wife, right?

812
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:05,162
You killed a woman and Bene.

813
01:21:06,031 --> 01:21:09,593
That's why I did not remembered anything on Saturday.

814
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:13,633
Lord.

815
01:21:15,848 --> 01:21:17,846
Issued are magic.

816
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:19,714
Magic?

817
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:25,795
I trusted you.

818
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:36,871
Give me a lighter.

819
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:15,618
She felt his power.

820
01:22:16,313 --> 01:22:19,180
Now no longer testify against him.

821
01:22:20,222 --> 01:22:22,524
There was no evidence.

822
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:29,648
Stella was a strong girl ... loyal.

823
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:33,775
He was wrong for her.

824
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:35,990
But what can you do.

825
01:22:45,546 --> 01:22:47,891
Help a man, a friend ...

826
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,406
God help you.

827
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:10,914
Poor Lieutenant Lejker.
All the alleged evidence of ...

828
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:13,781
And he can not overnight to arrest me.

829
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:21,469
Good evening, Lieutenant. Now what?

830
01:23:21,903 --> 01:23:24,336
I was untouchable.

831
01:23:24,857 --> 01:23:27,811
Hey, wake up.

832
01:23:28,549 --> 01:23:31,503
Then, unexpectedly

833
01:23:31,546 --> 01:23:35,543
and pathetic suicide of George.

834
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:42,015
It's ruined Lejkerov case.

835
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:47,097
Poor George, he could not fit.

836
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:51,354
I won them their weapons.

837
01:23:51,397 --> 01:23:54,090
I made some progress.

838
01:23:54,178 --> 01:23:58,695
I Odlebdeo to the board.

839
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:02,951
By the time I upgraded Stella
Los Angeles in.

840
01:24:03,907 --> 01:24:07,686
He remained just another boring detail.

841
01:24:07,686 --> 01:24:09,555
Jones.

842
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:13,420
No way to get out of those offices.
