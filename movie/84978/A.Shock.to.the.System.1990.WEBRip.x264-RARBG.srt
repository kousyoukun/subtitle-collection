00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,003

WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.

WHOO!

10
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,467
- WHAT DO I KNOW?
THEY JUST KEEP BLOWING.

11
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,426
- THE CIRCUIT IS OVERLOADED.

12
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,432
IT'S YOUR BLOODY
EXERCISE MACHINE.

13
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,102
- IT'S NOT MY STAIR STEPPER.

14
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,100
- I NEARLY GOT ELECTROCUTED
LAST NIGHT.

15
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,573
THIS WHOLE HOUSE NEEDS REWIRING.

16
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,067
- WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

17
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,597
MAYBE WITH YOUR RAISE...

18
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,069
- MY RAISE?

19
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,497
- I WANTED TO DO
A SURPRISE PARTY

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,930
FOR YOUR PROMOTION,

21
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,702
BUT THE DEPOSIT CHECK BOUNCED
AT MARIELA'S.

22
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,069
- THE JOB ISN'T MINE YET,
LESLIE.

23
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,627
- MARIELA'S SUPPOSED TO BE

24
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,702
THE ONLY CIVILIZED CATERER
OUT HERE.

25
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,169
I SAID TO HER,
"MARIELA, IT CAN'T BOUNCE.

26
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,297
IT'S ONE OF THE BROWN ONES."

27
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,700
- THE MONEY MARKET?
JESUS, LESLIE.

28
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:36,327
- OH, KATHY AND JASON.

29
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,972
OH, DOESN'T ANYBODY
IN THIS HOUSE

30
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,066
PAY ANY ATTENTION TO YOU?

31
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,697
- WELL, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
IT'S MY ACCOUNT.

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,600
I SAID TO HER,
"THE GREEN ONES BOUNCE.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,900
"THAT'S MY HUSBAND'S ACCOUNT.

34
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,829
MY BROWN ONES NEVER BOUNCE."

35
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,872
- ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU CHILDREN
RUN INTO THE KITCHEN,

36
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,966
AND GRANDMA'S GONNA GET YOU
SOME BREAKFAST.

37
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,466
- ANYWAY, I PRACTICALLY HAD
TO BEG HER TO TAKE PLASTIC,

38
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,896
AND YOU KNOW HOW BACKED UP
THAT IS.

39
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,999
- ARGUING WITH LESLIE
ABOUT HER MONEY AGAIN?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,130
- AH, LILLIAN.

41
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,073
AS ALWAYS,
YOUR TIMING IS IMPECCABLE.

42
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:08,967
- OH, DON'T TRY TO BE
SO SARCASTIC.

43
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,867
I ACTUALLY CAME OVER TO
CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR NEW--

44
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,427
- YOUR COFFEE'S HOT.

45
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:15,102
- [sighs]

46
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,399
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR US TO HAVE
A LITTLE CUP

47
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,829
BEFORE EXERCISE CLASS.

48
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,332
OH, AND THAT REMINDS ME.

49
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,832
I REMEMBERED SOME MORE NAMES
FOR HIS SURPRISE PARTY.

50
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,172
- OH, FABULOUS.

51
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,597
AND FOLDING CHAIRS, RIGHT?

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,070
HOW MANY DO WE NEED?
250?

53
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,067
[women talking]

54
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,667
- TRY TO UNDERSTAND

55
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,527
HE'D ALWAYS FANCIED HIMSELF
A SORCERER

56
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,603
CAPABLE OF FIXING ANYTHING.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,730
AND NOW, IN HIS OWN HOUSE,

58
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,632
THERE WERE CONSTANT FAILURES
OF POWER.

59
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,067
"GOOD-BYE, DARLING.

60
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,727
"LOVE YOU, DARLING.

61
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,832
SLAY THE DRAGONS, SWEETHEART."

62
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:53,372
IF A SORCERER'S HOUSE
ISN'T HIS CASTLE,

63
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,466
WHAT IS IT?

64
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:58,326
STILL, HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO HIS PROMOTION.

65
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,832
HE'D WORKED HARD FOR MANY YEARS

66
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:02,172
IN THE AMERICAN
CORPORATE STRUCTURE.

67
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,896
HE'D EARNED IT.

68
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,100
BUT THE MAGIC WAS JUST DRAINING
OUT OF HIM

69
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:09,699
EVERY TIME HE GOT
ON THAT COMMUTER TRAIN,

70
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,329
BACK AND FORTH FROM THE SUBURBS
EVERY DAY.

71
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,903
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

72
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,070
EVERY DAY.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,570
YOU LOOK FIT TODAY, GEORGE.

74
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,267
READY TO DO BATTLE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

75
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,366
IT'S ALL UP FOR ME,

76
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,327
AND I'VE DONE WHAT I CAN
FOR YOU.

77
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,302
NOW LET'S JUST READ OUR PAPERS.

78
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,799
- I THINK
YOU'RE JUMPING THE GUN.

79
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,899
- OH, COME ON.

80
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,229
THE WHOLE POINT
OF THESE TAKEOVERS

81
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:40,502
IS TO SELL OFF THE ASSETS

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,430
AND PUT OLD FARTS LIKE ME
OUT TO PASTURE.

83
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:48,072
I CAN HEAR THE FAT LADY SINGING,
GRAHAM.

84
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,597
I CAN HEAR HER SINGING.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,930
SPACE INVADERS, GRAHAM.

86
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:07,232
THE NEW PEOPLE ARE ALL GADGETS
AND THE BOTTOM LINE.

87
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:09,372
- I HEAR YOU, GEORGE.

88
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:12,827
- STOP THEM EARLY,
OR THEY'LL RUN RIGHT OVER YOU.

89
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,533
"WE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT
ON SUCH-AND-SUCH A PROGRAM."

BA, BA BA BA BA.

91
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,897
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT, GRAHAM,
SOUP TO NUTS.

92
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,199
IT'S CODE FOR MASS FIRINGS
AND LOW QUALITY.

93
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,329
JUST MELT THE MARKET DRY
AND GET OUT.

94
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:29,102
I MEAN, IF OUR SYSTEM
WASN'T ANY GOOD,

95
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,270
WHY DID THEY TAKE US OVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

96
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,066
RIGHT?

97
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,629
- HEY, BUDDY.
GIVE ME A BUCK, WILL YA?

98
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,773
WHAT DO YOU MAKE,
A MILLION A YEAR?

99
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,127
YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY.

100
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,073
- THIS CITY IS GETTING TO BE
LIKE CALCUTTA.

101
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,833
I REMEMBER WHEN NEW YORK WAS
A PLEASURE.

102
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,472
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS--
AH.

103
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,896
- NOW, THAT WAS TRUE.

104
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,969
NEW YORK WASN'T
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

105
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,703
- STELLA.

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
LEND ME $20.

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
I KNOW I CAN WIN THIS.

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,930
- I REFUSE TO KEEP BEING

109
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:10,502
THE ONLY PRACTICAL PERSON
I KNOW.

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,770
- MINUTE TO WIN, BABE.
MINUTE TO WIN.

111
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,696
- EVEN IN THEIR SUMMER DRESSES,

112
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,599
HE SCARCELY NOTICED
THE TEMPTATIONS ANYMORE.

113
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,900
GOD, HE COULD REMEMBER
WHEN IT WAS ALL HE NOTICED.

114
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,132
HE TRIED TO REMEMBER THAT POWER
HE USED TO HAVE OVER WOMEN

115
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,372
BACK IN HIS DANGEROUS DAYS.

116
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,767

CAME OVER FROM ENGLAND
IN THE '60s AND '70s,

118
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:34,826
I HAD NO PROBLEM.

119
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:35,872
- OH, I KNOW.

[elevator bell dings]

121
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,227
- I DON'T KNOW, GRAHAM.

122
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,102
THESE YOUNG TURKS, HELL.

123
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,400
THEIR EFFICIENCY SYSTEM
IS JUST A COVER.

124
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,799
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT FILM,

125
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,629
THE ONE ABOUT SPACE INVADERS
TAKING OVER LIVING PEOPLE?

126
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,433
- PODS.

127
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,002
POD PEOPLE.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,730
- BODY SNATCHERS.

129
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,203
- THAT'S IT,
INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.

130
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,230
- HEY, I SAW THAT MOVIE.

131
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:06,372
IT WAS PRETTY HAPPENIN'.

132
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,867

[telephones ringing]

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,130
- GRAHAM?

00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,202
CAN WE PUSH JAY WALTER TO 10:00?

136
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,469
- YEAH, CHECK WITH FRANK.
I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

WONDER OATS WANTS TO KILL

139
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,267
- HAVE WE GOT THE NUMBERS BACK
FROM THE WEST COAST YET?

140
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,066
- NOT YET. THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO GET BACK BY 4:00.

141
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,267
- DON'T TOUCH THE DOG.

142
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,896
- GRAHAM?
- YEAH?

143
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,069
- THE RESULTS OF THE GREAT
KENTUCKY GELATIN WARS.

144
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,567
- TELL ME THEY'RE NOT SHIT, AMY.

145
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,527
- THEY'RE NOT SHIT, GRAHAM.

146

- THEY'RE SHIT, AMY.

147
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,499
- I KNEW YOU HAD A CRUSH
ON SOMEBODY.

148
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,430
- WOULD YOU, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
BEHAVE YOURSELF?

149
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,372
- STELLA, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PLAY THIS PERSON,

150
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,296
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.

151
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:54,332
- IT'S NOT A ROLE.

152
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:55,732
IT'S A JOB, A RENT-PAYING JOB.

153
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:58,632
NOW COME ON; I WANT
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE BOSS.

154
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,533
- ALL RIGHT.

155
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,902
- DAVID, DAVID, CAN YOU
BRING THIS OVER TO JONES?

156
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,070
- GRAHAM MARSHALL'S OFFICE.

157
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,397
YES, I'LL BE HAPPY
TO TAKE A MESSAGE.

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
- GRAHAM.
- GRAHAM, HI.

159
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,069
- EXCUSE ME A MOMENT, STELLA.

160
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,067
- HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

161
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,897
THE NUMBER CRUNCHERS
DESIGNED IT,

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,330
BUT THE THINKING, BASICALLY,
IS MINE.

163
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:18,472
- WHAT IS THIS?

164
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,396
- A PROGRAM THAT PROJECTS
SURVEY RESPONSES

165
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,169
FROM PREPROCESSED DATA.

166
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,727
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT WHAT IS THIS?

167
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:24,933
- IT MAKES IT UNNECESSARY

168
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,232
TO GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC
WITH A NEW RELEASE.

169
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,703
IT PREDICTS HOW THEY'LL REACT.

170
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:29,169
- DOES IT BUY THE PRODUCT
FOR THEM?

171
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,567
- WELL, NOT YET.

172
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,927
- BRING IT BACK WHEN IT DOES,
AND WE'LL DO LUNCH.

173
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,072
- GRAHAM, SERIOUSLY,
THIS HAS HUGE COST-CUTTING--

174
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,797

00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,467
THAT'S THE THING: LIFE.

351
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,067
- MURDER, GRAHAM.

352
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,197
- WHAT?

353
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,269
- DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT A DAY

354
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,466
THAT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTE MURDER?

355
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:30,896
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,

356
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,299
I FINALLY GOT MARIELA TO TAKE
A POSTDATED BROWN CHECK,

357
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,699
SO YOUR SURPRISE PARTY
IS A DEFINITE AFTER ALL.

358
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,970
LOOK WHAT YOU DID,
MR. MCFUDDLEHEAD.

359
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:44,326
THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD SHIRT
YOU THREW AWAY.

360
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,472
- IT'S TORN.

361
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:49,396
- WELL, MAYBE
ESMERALDA CAN SEW IT.

362
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:53,269
OH, MR. MARTELLI,
HE CAME NEXT.

363
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,127
I WAS WORKING OUT
ON MY STAIR STEPPER,

364
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,433
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, FFFFFT!

365
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:59,372
IT JAMMED,
I BANGED MY SHIN,

366
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,296
AND EVERY AIR CONDITIONER
IN THE HOUSE WENT OFF.

367
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,900
- IT'S THAT DAMN FUSE BOX AGAIN.

368
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:04,869
- THAT'S JUST
WHAT MR. MARTELLI SAID,

369
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,197
EXCEPT SOMEHOW WHEN HE SAID IT,
IT COST $153.

370
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,499
- WE'VE GOT TO ECONOMIZE,
LESLIE.

371
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,600
- WHAT WAS I--

372
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,069
OH, THE SHIRT.
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

373
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,697
UM, YEAH, HE SAID
THERE'S PROBABLY A SHORT

374
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,069
IN THE STAIR STEPPER.

375
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,267
I DON'T SEE ANY RIP.

376
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,402
- OH, I THOUGHT THERE WAS ONE.

377
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,229
- HONESTLY, GRAHAM.

378
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,173
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
TONIGHT?

379
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,667
- ME?
NOTHING.

380
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,297
[laughs]

381
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,799
- GRAHAM,
BOB BENHAM WANTS TO SEE YOU.

382
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,799
- FINE.

383
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,067
MR. BOB.

384
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,667
SIR ROBERT.

385
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,897
- GRAHAM,
HE'S IN GEORGE'S OFFICE TODAY.

386
00:19:55,767 --> 00:20:00,997
- AH, THE EMPEROR BOB.

387
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,030
- MR. BENHAM WILL MEET HIM
AT THE RESTAURANT AT 1:00.

388
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,703
MM-HMM.
GOOD.

389
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,000
I'LL TELL HIM.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,830
OKAY.
I WILL.

391
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,103
- THIS ISN'T EXACTLY COMFORTABLE
FOR ME.

392
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,369
I KNOW YOU WANTED THIS JOB.

393
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,697
I SUPPOSE,
IF WE WERE RIVAL PRINCES,

394
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,499
I COULD JUST HAVE YOU KILLED.

395
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,570
SAVE A LOT OF POLITICS.
[chuckles]

396
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,167
- IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO KILL SOMEONE

397
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,997
AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

398
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,570
- I THOUGHT INSTEAD,
IT WOULD BE GOOD

399
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,497
IF WE COULD GET TOGETHER
THIS WEEKEND

400
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,870
OUT AT THE HOUSE--
YOU AND LESLIE, ME AND TARA.

401
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,396
- OH, THE ACTUAL TA-RA.

402
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,632
YES, THAT WOULD BE NICE, BOB.

403
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,103
- GOOD.

404
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,700
WE'LL DO A LITTLE SAILING,
A LOT OF EATING,

405
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,100
AND FIND THE TIME TO DISCUSS
THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS.

406
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,870
GRAHAM, DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
A LIGHT?

407
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,696
- YES, OF COURSE.

408
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,667
- HE KEPT EXPECTING
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING

409
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,226
TO COME OUT OF OF THE SKY
AND STRIKE HIM DEAD.

410
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,903
- HEY, BUDDY.

411
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,470
SPARE SOME CHANGE?

412
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,966
THANKS.

413
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,297
GOD BLESS YOU.

414
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,530
- BUT IT NEVER DID.

415
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,473
ALL HE FELT WAS GOOD, CLEAN,

416
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:33,196
FREE...

417
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,427
AS IF HE'D TAKEN

418
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:39,272
A THOUSAND-POUND LOAD
OFF HIS BACK.

419
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,267
[New Wave music playing]

420
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:50,197
*

421
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:20,267
- ARE WE MAKING THIS
THE 754 OR THE 813?

422
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,126
- WHERE DO THEY GET
THOSE NUMBERS?

423
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,302
- EVERYONE'S SO...YOUNG.

424
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,230
UH, SCOTCH, ROCKS, PLEASE.

425
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,503
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

426
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,570
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING
VIBRANT AND YOUTHFUL.

427
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,067
- DO YOU WANT A SHIRLEY TEMPLE?

428
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,327
- A LIGHT BEER WITH A TWIST
FOR MY FRIEND.

429
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:37,502
- NO, THE SCOTCH WILL BE FINE.

430
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,330
I'LL HAVE A SIDE ORDER
OF BRAN FLAKES.

431
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,602
WHO'S THAT WITH BENHAM?

432
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,330
- WHERE?
- OVER THERE.

433
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,632
- OH, THAT'S HENRY PARK,

434
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,873
MR. COMPUTER FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

435
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:52,626
- SOME OF THE HARDWARE
IS SO OUTDATED.

436
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:55,373
- I'LL BET HE'S DRINKING
SOMETHING VIBRANT AND YOUTHFUL.

437
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:57,696
- YOU LOOK VERY VIBRANT TO ME.

438
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,000
- WELL, I THINK IT'S ROTTEN,
MR. MARSHALL.

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,330
THE ONLY REASON
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT JOB

440
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,733
IS 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT
TO YOU.

441
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:08,502
- WELL, I THINK YOU'VE
HANDLED IT VERY GRACEFULLY

442
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,570
AND VIBRANTLY TOO.

443
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:13,227
- I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD
MY WIFE YET.

444
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:15,433
- YOU HAVEN'T?
GRAHAM, WHY NOT?

445
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,732
- DREAD, REALLY.

446
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,073
IT'S GOING TO BE A DISASTER.

447
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,327
- OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

448
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,572
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

449
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:26,227
- NOT TO HER HUSBAND,
IT DOESN'T.

450
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,303
USUALLY, I JUST REACH OUT
MY HAND,

451
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,730
AND OBSTACLES DISAPPEAR.

452
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:32,833
PSHEW!

453
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,432
- MMM, GREAT DRINK.

454
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,373
SHE THINKS SHE'S MRS. MERLIN.

455
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,726
- WHO?
- MERLIN.

456
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:44,202
THE WIZARD, KING ARTHUR.

457
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,770
- NOW, DON'T USE
THE QUIET VOICE, GRAHAM.

458
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,567
IT'S JUST THE SAME AS YELLING.

459
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:51,497
- IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE
TO MAINTAIN, LESLIE!

460
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,200
- AND DON'T YELL AT ME.

461
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,930
IT'S NOT THE MACHINE'S FAULT.

462
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:57,232
- I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY YOU NEED A STAIR MACHINE

463
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,972
WHEN WE HAD STAIRS!

464
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:01,666
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO KEEP
GOING UP, SILLY.

465
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,167
IF I HAD TO KEEP GOING DOWN,

466
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:05,466
I'D LOSE
THE WHOLE AEROBIC BENEFIT.

467
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,166
- IT'S LIKE A COMPUTER.

468
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,526
YOU'RE NOT TURNING IT ON RIGHT.

469
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,532
YOU TURN IT ON LIKE THIS.

470
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,702
- WELL, THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE,
MR. EINSTEIN.

471
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,069
[giggles]

472
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,497
BUT AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO SCREAM "BOOGA-BOOGA"

473
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
OR SOMETHING?

474
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,869
- FUCK!
- GRAHAM.

475
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,767
WELL, I GUESS IT'S BACK
TO MR. MARTELLI.

476
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:27,066
- THERE ISN'T GONNA BE
ANY MR. GOD DAMN MARTELLI.

477
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,797
I'M GOING TO FLICK A SWITCH
IN THE GOD DAMN FUSE BOX,

478
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,400
AND ALL THE LIGHTS
WILL MAGICALLY GO ON FOR FREE!

479
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,499
- GRAHAM...

480
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,730
- AND YOU ARE GOING
TO FOLLOW ME,

481
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,902
AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN
HOW TO DO IT!

482
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,269
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S LOTS OF MONEY

483
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:42,967
I DON'T SPEND AROUND HERE.

484
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:44,726
IS THIS GOING TO TAKE LONG?

485
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:49,802
THERE'S THAT BIG CHECK I SAW
FOR $2,157.

486
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,229
- THAT IS OUR MORTGAGE.

487
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:55,672
- AND THE BIG ONE?
THAT $3,300 ONE?

488
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,767
- THAT'S OUR LIFE INSURANCE,
LESLIE.

489
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,397
- WELL, IT'S NOT AS THOUGH

490
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:01,699
I DON'T PAY MY SHARE OF THINGS
AROUND HERE,

491
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,470
MORE THAN MY SHARE.

492
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:08,967
AND ANYWAY, YOU'RE FINALLY
GETTING A DECENT RAISE.

493
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,127
I MEAN, I'M JUST BEGINNING
TO FEEL

494
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,672
THAT THERE'S A GREAT BIG
WHOLE LOT

495
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:17,696
OF MALE CHAUVINIST PREJUDICE
IN OPERATION HERE.

496
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,529
I MEAN, PART OF WHAT HELPS YOU
GET AHEAD

497
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:22,803
IS HAVING A WIFE FROM
A GOOD FAMILY WHO LOOKS NICE

498
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,530
AND A HOUSE NEAR GEORGE
AND ALL THE PROPER THINGS,

499
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,103
AND YOU CAN'T BLAME ME
JUST BECAUSE I SIGN THE CHECKS

500
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,130
WHEN, REALLY--

501
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,432
- LESLIE?

502
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,196
COME UP HERE.

503
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,670
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO FIX THE LIGHTS.

504
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,127
- OH, GRAHAM.

505
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,203
- COME ON.
- WHY DO--

506
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,670
DO I NEED TO KNOW THIS?

507
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,767
- YES.
YES, YOU DO.

508
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,827
GET UP.

509
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,432
STAND ON THE TOP BOX.

510
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:50,572
GET ON THERE.

511
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,327
OKAY? YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

512
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,902
- NOW PUT OUT YOUR RIGHT HAND,

513
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:57,069
AND GET HOLD OF THAT PIPE
VERY, VERY FIRMLY.

514
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,997
- EW.
IT'S ALL FILTHY AND WET.

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,330
UGH.
YUCK.

516
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:03,272
- IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOUR BALANCE.

517
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:06,366
RIGHT?
GOT HOLD?

518
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,969
NOW REACH OUT
WITH YOUR LEFT HAND,

519
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,227
GET HOLD OF THAT CHAIN,

520
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,173
AND PULL DOWN HARD.

521
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,797
- OH.

522
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,070
OH, I SEE--

523
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,527
OH, I SEE, AND HERE'S
THE FUSE BOX RIGHT HERE.

524
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,573
EW, MY HANDS ARE ALL YUCK.

525
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,327
- I DIDN'T GET THE JOB, LESLIE.

526
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,432
- OH, I SEE.
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

527
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:36,802
JUST--

528
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,699
WHAT?

529
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
- THE PROMOTION.

530
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,770
I DIDN'T GET IT.

531
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,497
- NO, OF COURSE YOU GOT IT,
GRAHAM.

532
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,630
YOU ALWAYS GET IT.

533
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,602
- I'M SORRY.

534
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,070
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANT TO YOU.

535
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,397
- [sighs]

536
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,069
NO, YOU DON'T, GRAHAM.

537
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,327
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU DO KNOW
HOW MUCH IT MEANT TO ME.

538
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:04,702
- THAT'S WHEN HE REALIZED
SHE WAS A WITCH.

539
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:11,596
FOR HIS SURVIVAL, HE WAS GOING
TO HAVE TO GET RID OF HER SPELL.

540
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,869
- AH!
[laughs]

541
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,927
OH, YEAH.

542
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,069
- HEY, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

543
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,697
- I HOPE THE TRAFFIC
WASN'T TERRIBLE.

544
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,429
- HE MISSED THE TURN.

545
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,297
- GRAHAM.
LESLIE.

546
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,430
- BOB.
HOW ARE YOU?

547
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,072
- THIS IS TARA,
NOT THE PLANTATION.

548
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,367
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HELLO, TARA.

549
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,496
- TARA LISTON THE MODEL.

550
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,800
- TA-DA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

551
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,069
SHALL WE SHOW THEM THE RANCH?

552
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,797
- I THINK WE HAVE TO.

553
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,699
- COME ON UP.

554
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,270
- SHE WAS PERFECT.
HE WAS PERFECT.

555
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:55,197
THE HOUSE WAS PERFECT.
THE BOAT WAS PERFECT.

556
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,370
THE AMERICAN DREAM.

557
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:59,796
- SHE FEELS A BIT SMALL UP TOP,

558
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,469
BUT SHE'S SURPRISINGLY ROOMY
FOR OVERNIGHTS.

559
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,497
- OH, I WANT ONE.
I WANT ONE!

560
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,570
- CUTS ALONG ON A JOLLY CLIP
TOO, DOESN'T SHE?

561
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,067
- SHE JOLLY WELL DOES.

562
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,629
BY GOLLY.

563
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,067
- [laughs]

564
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,267
- OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

565
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,766
- GRAHAM?

566
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,566
COULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND
DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

567
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,267
- CERTAINLY.
LET ME.

568
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,330
- IT'S THIS GAS.
I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO...

569
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,572
- LET ME TRY.
- GET IT.

570
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,070
- [grunts]

571
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,067
THERE.

572
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,997
- THANK YOU, KIND SIR.

573
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,830
WHAT DEPARTMENT DO YOU HEAD
AT GIBB, GRAHAM?

574
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,633
- I'M IN MARKETING TOO.

575
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,173
- OH, SO YOU'RE UNDER BOB NOW.

576
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,070
- YEAH.

577
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:14,967
- [Tara moaning]

578
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,603
OH, DON'T STOP.

579
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,330
NO.
OH.

580
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:33,272
[moaning intensifies]

581
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,966
- THE POWER WAS DRAINING
OUT OF HIM AGAIN.

582
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:43,326
HE HAD TO ACT.

583
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:44,672
- OH!

584
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,097
- I DON'T MEAN TO SPEAK ILL
OF THE DEAD, GRAHAM,

585
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,070
BUT GEORGE WAS SIMPLY DEALING
WITH SMOKE SIGNALS AND DRUMS.

586
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,727
OUR HACKERS CAN HAVE
THE PRESENT HARDWARE

587
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:55,072
LINKED INTERNATIONALLY
SIX MONTHS, TOPS.

588
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,297
- GREAT.

589
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,769
AS LONG AS WE DON'T OVEREXTEND
OURSELVES.

590
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:02,197
- I THINK IT'S EXCITING
TO PLAN SO BIG.

591
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,130
- I'D LIKE YOU TO BE
AT THAT SAN FRANCISCO CONVENTION

592
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:05,633
NEXT WEEK.

593
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:08,033
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU THE REAL
OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

594
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:09,902
- WHAT DAY NEXT WEEK?

595
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,830
- UH, WEDNESDAY, I THINK.

596
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,873
- THE DAY OF THE HEAD OF
DEPARTMENTS MEETINGS.

597
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,967
- YES, ACTUALLY.
YES.

598
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:18,926
- I CHAIR THAT MEETING, BOB.

599
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:22,772
- WELL, ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE
CHAIRED IT IN THE PAST, GRAHAM,

600
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,796
AND, FRANKLY, THAT'S BECAUSE
GEORGE WAS TOO APATHETIC

601
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,300
TO TAKE CARE OF IT HIMSELF.

602
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,030
IT IS A MEETING
OF DEPARTMENT HEADS, AFTER ALL.

603
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:34,597
- MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
THIS ONE OVER WITH GEORGE.

604
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,900
- OH, I CLEARED IT WITH GEORGE.

605
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,927
- GRAHAM?

606
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,572
FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
YOU HAVE YOUR LIGHTER WITH YOU.

607
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,067
- WELL, THANK GOD

608
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,297
SOMEBODY AROUND HERE'S
GETTING A VACATION.

609
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:57,629
HAVE A GOOD TIME, SWEETHEART.

610
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,603
- DO YOU REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS,

611
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,570
WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY
AND WE SAID--

612
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,467
- OH, NOW, DON'T GET
ALL PITIFUL, GRAHAM.

613
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,503
- "I FORGIVE YOU FOR FAILING,
GRAHAM."

614
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,470
- GRAHAM?

615
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,597
I FORGIVE YOU FOR FAILING.

616
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,930
- UH-HUH.

617
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:22,072
BY THE WAY,

618
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,797
I FIXED YOUR STAIR STEPPER.

619
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,730
- OH, GOOD.

620
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,796
SAY BYE-BYE, NOW.
BYE TO DADDY.

621
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,797
[dog barking]

622
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,600
- BYE.

623
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,599
HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

624
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,900
ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE FIRST
BLACK MAGIC

625
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:53,069
HE'D EVER EVEN TRIED.

626
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:54,797
HE WAS GAMBLING WITH THE FATES,

627
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,269
ROLLING THE GREAT DICE.

628
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,827
- HOSTILITY IS DISSIPATED
THROUGH DISTANCE.

629
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:08,433
AND WE HAVE CREATED WHAT WE TERM
A WEDGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY,

630
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,132
SUCH AS WE SEE HERE.

631
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,273
[buttons beeping]

632
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:27,726
- OH, DARN IT, GRAHAM.

633
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,697
FUCK.

634
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:27,927
[telephone ringing]

635
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,066
- HELLO.

636
00:34:35,067 --> 00:34:38,267
- MR. MARSHALL.

637
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,467
I'M AFRAID WE HAVE
SOME VERY BAD NEWS FOR YOU.

638
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,869
- AN--AN ACCIDENT?

639
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,596
- EASY, JOE, EASY.
WATCH THE RUG.

640
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,800
- YES.

641
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,229
I'M VERY SORRY.

642
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:52,802
- OH, MY GOD.

643
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,829
WHAT A SHOCK.

644
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,367
[dog whimpering]

645
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,897
- DA!

646
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,730
AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING?

647
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,933
- YES, OF COURSE.

648
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:20,067
DEAREST LESLIE,

649
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:24,867
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE BROUGHT YOU TO THIS SPOT

650
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:29,697
TO SHARE THIS LAST PRIVATE--

651
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,729
THIS MOMENT OF...

652
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:35,732
GRIEF AND PAIN.

653
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:42,367
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING,
LILLIAN?

654
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:43,526
- NO.

655
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,697
[coughing]

656
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:16,603
ABRACADABRA.

657
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,230
SHALAKAZAM.

658
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,373
BYE-BYE, BABY.

659
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,627
BOOM.

660
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,232
[laughs]

661
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,099
- OH, I'M THE GUY WHO CALLED YOU
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

662
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,230
I'M LARRY LAKER.

663
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:36,302
I'M WITH
THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE.

664
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,899
- YEAH.

665
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,699
- IF YOU'D RATHER
I COME BACK LATER...

666
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,130
- OH, NO, NO.

667
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,733
NOW IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

668
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:47,929
- CAN YOU HELP ME OUT

669
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:51,302
WITH THIS CRAZY WIRING
ON THE SOCKET?

670
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,769
- AND THAT GOD DAMN
STAIR MACHINE.

671
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:55,067
IF I HAD JUST--

672
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,167
- YEAH, YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW
EXPLAINED THAT TO ME,

673
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,167
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE
THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION

674
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,497
ABOUT THERE NOT BEING ANY DUST
ON THE ELECTRICAL TAPE.

675
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
- ELECTRICAL TAPE?

676
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,229
- YEAH, YOU SEE,

677
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:08,702
BECAUSE BEING DOWN IN A BASEMENT
AND EVERYTHING,

678
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:10,069
EVERYTHING GETS VERY DUSTY,

679
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,267
BUT THE TAPE,
THERE WASN'T ANY DUST ON THAT.

680
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,670
- YES?

681
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,626
- MR. MARSHALL, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP KATHY AND JASON.

682
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,472
- OH, JASON JUST WENT
ROUND THERE.

683
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,726
I THINK KATHY FOLLOWED HIM.

684
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,903
- OKAY.

685
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:23,699
- BOARDING YOUR DOGS.

686
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,099
- YES, I'M LOOKING
FOR A PLACE IN TOWN.

687
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,530
- OH, WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
I CAUGHT YOU, THEN,

688
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,303
BECAUSE I REALLY DID HAVE
THIS QUESTION

689
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,930
ABOUT THIS ELECTRICAL TAPE
BEING DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

690
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,802
LIKE, I MEAN,
EVERYTHING'S DUSTY DOWN THERE,

691
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:37,399
AND THERE'S JUST THIS ONE PIECE
THAT'S HANGING LOOSE

692
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,269
THAT'S GOT NO DUST ON IT.

693
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:43,267
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I WAS DOWN THERE BEFORE.

694
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,667
I SAW THIS TAPE LOOSE,

695
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,467
AND--AND I REWRAPPED IT.

696
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,466
IF ONLY I'D DONE A BETTER JOB.

697
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,766
- OH, HEY, DON'T BE
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

698
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,727
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

699
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,372
YOU'RE AS HUMAN AS THE NEXT GUY.

700
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:03,096
- WELL, UM,
IF THERE'S NOTHING MORE, I--

701
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,070
I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE TIME
TO MYSELF.

702
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:06,067
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

703
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,467
I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR THAT UP.

704
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:10,196
YOU GO AHEAD AND LET
THE GRIEVING PROCESS HAPPEN.

705
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,129
- THANK YOU.

706
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:20,067
[singing indistinctly]

707
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,067
*

708
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,597
[whistling a tune]

709
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,867
OH, HONEY.

710
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:04,897
THAT IS REALLY GREAT COFFEE.

711
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,072
- OH, MR. MARSHALL,

712
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,067
I'M BOB BENHAM'S NEW SECRETARY,

713
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,427
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HOW SORRY HE WAS

714
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:15,102
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

715
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,569
- THANK YOU.

716
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
- GRAHAM.

717
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,330
OH, WE MISSED YOU, BUDDY.

718
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:23,072
IS BOB IN YET?
- YES, HE IS.

719
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,497
- HI, GRAHAM.

720
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,930
OH, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T GET
TO SEND YOU A CARD YET

721
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:27,372
ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

722
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,097
HAS BOBBY GOTTEN HERE YET?

723
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,130
- YES, BUT HE'S IN HIS OFFICE...

724
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,132
- GRAHAM, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

725
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:35,473
THEY JUST FAXED ME
THE CHEWGOOD NUMBERS.

726
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:37,926
OH, AND LISTEN,
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

727
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,172
- I APPRECIATE IT.

728
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,727
THE CHEWGOOD NUMBERS AT LAST.

729
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:42,172
GREAT, LET ME HAVE THEM.

730
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,327
- BOBSTER TOLD ME I SHOULD
GIVE THEM TO HIM RIGHT AWAY.

731
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,432
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

732
00:39:45,432 --> 00:39:47,572
- NO, I DON'T.

733
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,227
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
GEORGE'S OFFICE?

734
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:52,072
- AMY, HAS THE BIG, BAD BOBBY
GOT A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR ME?

735
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,197
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

736
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,870
- YES, BUT HE'S WITH
HIS DECORATOR.

737
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:58,326
- GRAHAM.

738
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
I FEEL SO BAD.

739
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,769
I'M SHOCKED.

740
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,297
DID YOU GET MY NOTE?

741
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:08,399
- YES, THANK YOU.

742
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,870
- I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

743
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:15,327
- WELL, I AM, AS WE SAY
IN THE GRIEF BUSINESS,

744
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,833
SWELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED.

745
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,427
- ANYWAY, HERE'S THE ARTWORK
YOU WANTED.

746
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,600
- STELLA HENDERSON.

747
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,430
SHE ALWAYS COMES THROUGH.

748
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:38,602
ALL RIGHT.

749
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,000
WHAT IF WE HAD DINNER?

750
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,470
- I GIVE UP.
WHAT IF WE HAD DINNER?

751
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,427
- TONIGHT.

752
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,727
- TONIGHT.

753
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:54,432
OKAY.

754
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,572
- OKAY.

755
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,366
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

756
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,497
ABOUT THESE POD PEOPLE,
THESE YUPPIES.

757
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,070
IF YOU DON'T TREAT PEOPLE
THE WAY THEY DO,

758
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:07,127
THEY QUESTION YOUR MANHOOD.

759
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,833
AND BELIEVE ME,
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE

760
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,103
FOR A WOMAN IN BUSINESS THAN
TO HAVE HER MANHOOD QUESTIONED.

761
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,069
BUT IT'S LIKE THIS BENHAM.

762
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,427
I MEAN, HE THINKS OF PEOPLE

763
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,102
AS THOUGH THEY'RE MADE
OF STYROFOAM,

764
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,200
NOT AS THOUGH THEY'RE--

765
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,199
- HUMAN BEINGS.

766
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,299
- WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE

767
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,600
OF THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE
UNDER YOU.

768
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,070
- SWEET OLD GRAHAM.

769
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:24,467
- NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

770
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,466
I MEAN, BOB, FOR INSTANCE,
WOULD NEVER APPRECIATE MELANIE.

771
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,826
- MELANIE?

772
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,702
- YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT SHE DOES
TO PREPARE FOR A ROLE.

773
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,199
BOB BENHAM WOULD JUST
WRITE HER OFF AS A LOSER,

774
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,970
WHICH IS WHY YOU DIDN'T GET
GEORGE'S JOB--

775
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:39,266
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T
TREAT PEOPLE THE WAY THEY DO.

776
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:42,867
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE.

777
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,470
YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE,

778
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:52,966
AND YOU LISTEN
TO OTHER PEOPLE TALK.

779
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:56,396
BUT YOU NEVER TALK
ABOUT YOURSELF.

780
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,699
WHY IS THAT?

781
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,000
- I GUESS I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL FIND ME OUT.

782
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,303
- DON'T BE AFRAID.

783
00:42:07,299 --> 00:42:09,299
- GOOD NIGHT.

784
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:25,132
- THE WORLD, AS THEY SAY,
HAD BECOME HIS OYSTER.

785
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:29,432
NOW HE WAS GOING TO PRY IT OPEN.

786
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,070
- HI.

787
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:51,797
- I WILL TRY AND PUT THIS
AS POLITELY AS POSSIBLE, HENRY.

788
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,969
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
IN MY OFFICE?

789
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:56,366
- BOB SAYS
I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP OUT

790
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,066
WITH THE REORGANIZATION REPORT.

791
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,997
- UH-HUH.

792
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,630
LET ME REPHRASE THE QUESTION.

793
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,633
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
IN MY OFFICE?

794
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:11,332
- BOB JUST FELT IT WAS CRAZY
NOT TO HAVE A COMPUTER IN HERE.

795
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:12,633
- IT'S NOT THE COMPUTER!

796
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,632
IT'S YOU AND YOUR GOD DAMN DESK!

797
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:18,072
- LOOK, BOB FELT THAT--

798
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,797
- I'LL TALK TO BOB.

799
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:38,697
GEORGE?

800
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,070
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GEORGE?

801
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:44,597
- OH, WELL, BOB ASKED ME
TO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT.

802
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,630
- IN THE--IN THE HALL?

803
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,973
YOU'RE STANDING IN THE HALL.

804
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,766
- YEAH, WELL, HE'S BUSY,
YOU KNOW.

805
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,567
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE WAVES.

806
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,000
- WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD

807
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,570
IS HENRY PARK DOING
IN MY OFFICE?

808
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,567
- EXCUSE US.
THIS'LL JUST BE A SECOND.

809
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,067
- I HAVE TO RUN ANYWAY.

810
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:11,297
YOU'LL GET THE ESTIMATES.

811
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:20,373
- THAT DECORATOR IS HARDER
TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH

812
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,397
THAN THE MAYOR.

813
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,829
TELL ME THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING.

814
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:26,172
- THERE IS A MAN IN MY OFFICE.

815
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,167
- I THOUGHT IT'D BE
MORE EFFICIENT

816
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:30,367
TO HAVE YOU AND HENRY
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER.

817
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,367
- IT IS MY OFFICE!

818
00:44:32,366 --> 00:44:36,796
IT IS THE ASSISTANT CHIEF'S
OFFICE!

819
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,699
- IT'S STILL YOUR OFFICE.

820
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,697
- WHY DON'T YOU BRING
HENRY PARK IN HERE, HUH?

821
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,770
- THAT'S ENTIRELY--

822
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,067
- WHY DON'T YOU BRING MELANIE IN

823
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,397
TO MAKE SURE
THE PHONE GETS ANSWERED?

824
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:47,629
HELL, WE COULD BRING IN

825
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:49,173
THE WHOLE GOD DAMN
NEW YORK KNICKS

826
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,727
JUST TO MAKE SURE
YOUR TRASH HITS THE BASKET!

827
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,372
HOW'S THAT?

828
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:58,472
- IF I THOUGHT I NEEDED
AN ASSISTANT TO DO MY JOB--

829
00:44:58,466 --> 00:44:59,996
- MEANING WHAT?

830
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,430
THAT I DON'T DO MY JOB?

831
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:06,202
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE ME REMOVED, BOBBY BOY?

832
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,170
- BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO SENIOR
IN THE COMPANY

833
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:11,066
TO BE FIRED FOR ANYTHING LESS
THAN GROSS INSUBORDINATION.

834
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:14,867
- SO YOU'VE DECIDED TO HAVE ME
REMOVED PIECE BY PIECE--

835
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:18,097
A PRIVILEGE HERE,
A RESPONSIBILITY THERE,

836
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,130
NEVER ENOUGH TO FIGHT OVER,

837
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:24,302
JUST A SUBTLE LITTLE DRAIN
OF POWER, RIGHT?

838
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,830
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
BOBSTER.

839
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:31,872
YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST
FUCKING THING ABOUT POWER.

840
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:35,527
I HAVE MORE POWER IN THIS HAND

841
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:39,103
THAN ALL YOU FUCKING KNOW.

842
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,230
GET OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HALLWAY,
GEORGE.

843
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,797
- BUT TAKE MY PICTURE.
TAKE MY PICTURE.

844
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:15,929
- BOBBY BOY.

845
00:46:15,932 --> 00:46:17,532
- GEORGE.

846
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:18,703
- AH.

847
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:20,069
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

848
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,267
- COULD YOU TAKE A PICTURE
WITH ME?

849
00:46:21,266 --> 00:46:23,496
- SURE.

850
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,870
- BOB HAS REALLY MADE
A DIFFERENCE.

851
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,767
LOOK AT THIS PARTY.

852
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:30,266
- I LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT
AND PRAY HE'LL DIE.

853
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:35,197
- WE ARE WITNESSING
THE MAKING OF A LEGEND, GEORGE,

854
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,330
THE KIND OF THING
THAT FRONT COVERS ARE MADE OF.

855
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:39,832
- CONGRATULATIONS, GEORGE.

856
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,632
- HEY, GREAT.
THANKS.

857
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,773
- I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, GEORGE.

858
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,267
- WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

859
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:48,667
AND HE WON'T STOP
WITH JUST MARKETING

860
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,927
OR EVEN WITH GIBB.

861
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,772
- DON'T GET STEPPED ON.

862
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,367
- HEY, GEORGE,
HAVE A WONDERFUL RETIREMENT.

863
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:57,066
- HEY, GREAT.
RIGHT.

864
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:03,669
RETIREMENT, CHRIST.

865
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,726
WITHOUT WORK,
I'LL BE DEAD IN A YEAR.

866
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,403
- HE WAS GETTING READY

867
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,330
TO TRY THE BIGGEST TRICK
OF HIS CAREER.

868
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:20,332
- [singing drunkenly]

869
00:47:20,332 --> 00:47:23,932
BEWARE, GRAHAM.

01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:32,072
- BIBBIDI...

1049
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,367
BOBBIDI...

1050
01:01:35,366 --> 01:01:36,526
BOO.

1051
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:41,399
HE FELT LIKE ONE OF THOSE GODS

1052
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:44,069
WHO APPEAR TO MAIDENS
IN HUMAN FORM.

1053
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:48,902
HE KNEW HE'D BEEN GREAT.

1054
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:52,399
- THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS
WHEN PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE.

1055
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:55,199
- AH, STELLA--
SUCH A SWEET GIRL, REALLY.

1056
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,070
- OR DIDN'T YOU THINK
MAGICIANS COULD FALL IN LOVE?

1057
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,997
- HE'D HAVE TO BE SURE
TO REWARD HER

1058
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,570
FOR BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

1059
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:07,067
MY FATHER HAD IT ALL
FIGURED OUT.

1060
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:09,197
HE WAS A LONDON BUS DRIVER,

1061
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:10,829
AND WHEN I WAS A BOY,

1062
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,303
HE USED TO TAKE ME
OVER THE RIVER TO MAYFAIR,

1063
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,670
WHERE THE RICH PEOPLE LIVED.

1064
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:19,666
AND HE USED TO SAY TO ME, "SON,

1065
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,867
"THERE IS NO HEAVEN.

1066
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:25,967
"HERE IS THE CLOSEST
YOU'LL EVER GET.

1067
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:28,866
"LIFE HERE IS SWEET.

1068
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:32,427
"LIFE BACK OVER THERE IS HARD.

1069
01:02:34,633 --> 01:02:36,403
SO LIVE OVER HERE, SON."

1070
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:38,329
[laughs]

1071
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,600
- IN A FREAKISH ACCIDENT

1072
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,600
OFF THE CONNECTICUT SHORELINE
THIS MORNING,

1073
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,530
A PRIVATELY OWNED SAILBOAT
BURST INTO FLAMES AND SANK.

1074
01:02:48,533 --> 01:02:50,433
WE SPOKE TO
POLICE LIEUTENANT LARRY LAKER

1075
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:52,702
AT THE SCENE THIS AFTERNOON.

1076
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,370
LIEUTENANT,
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE?

1077
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:59,496
- THE BOAT--
UH, TARA'S DREAM--

1078
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,300
WAS DEMOLISHED.

1079
01:03:02,299 --> 01:03:04,669
SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD
TO DETERMINE

1080
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:08,066
A PRECISE CAUSE
OF THE EXPLOSION.

1081
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,897
"THE INVESTIGATION
IS CONTINUING."

1082
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,570
[over television]
THE INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING.

1083
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:12,667
I ALWAYS SAY THAT.

1084
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,166
WHAT CAN I SAY?

1085
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,126
WE'RE TIRED,
AND WE HAVE NO CLUES.

1086
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:17,772
FUCK IT.

1087
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:22,096
YOU MIND?
I HATE WATCHING MYSELF.

1088
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,270
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1089
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,426
- WELL...

1090
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:29,602
FOR A START, I THINK I NEED
A NEW DOORMAN.

1091
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:36,396
- ROBERT BENHAM DIED
IN THAT EXPLOSION.

1092
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:38,069
WE HAVEN'T RELEASED THAT YET.

1093
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:40,097
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED.

1094
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,300
- WELL, YOU SAID THE NAME
OF THE BOAT ON TELEVISION.

1095
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:43,869
I KNEW IT WAS BOB'S.

1096
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,526
- HE WAS YOUR SUPERIOR,
WASN'T HE?

1097
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,173
- NO, HE WAS MY BOSS.

1098
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:52,197
- YEAH, HE WAS YOUR BOSS.
RIGHT.

1099
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,070
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN GET
HIS JOB

1100
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:58,067
NOW THAT HE'S GONE, HUH?

1101
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,997
- MAYBE.

1102
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:09,203
- YOU KNOW, SUDDEN DEATH
HASN'T BEEN ALL BAD TO YOU.

1103
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,499
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

1104
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,427
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1105
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:24,802
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?

1106
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,400
- YOU QUESTIONING ME?

1107
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:29,069
I MEAN, AM I A SUSPECT?

1108
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,430
- WHERE WERE YOU?

1109
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:42,329
- I SPENT THE NIGHT

1110
01:04:42,332 --> 01:04:44,832
WITH A GIRL
CALLED STELLA ANDERSON.

1111
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:50,429
- AM I SURE?

1112
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:53,902
- I APOLOGIZE.
A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION.

1113
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:56,899
- WELL, YES, ACTUALLY.
I WAS THERE.

1114
01:04:56,899 --> 01:04:58,429
I'M SURE.

1115
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:01,602
- WE JUST NEED A WITNESS
TO CONFIRM HIS WHEREABOUTS.

1116
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,626
MAY I COME IN?

1117
01:05:13,632 --> 01:05:16,632
- BOB BENHAM
WOULD HAVE GONE FAR.

1118
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:18,232
- I'M SURE HE DID.

1119
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:19,233
WOULD HAVE.

1120
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:20,803
- BUT LIFE GOES ON.

1121
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,270
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
BUSINESS GOES ON.

1122
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:25,726
I NEED YOU TO ACT AS HEAD

1123
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:28,173
UNTIL THE BOARD DECIDES
ON A REPLACEMENT.

1124
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,927
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.

1125
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:31,332
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

1126
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:34,572
- NO HARD FEELINGS ABOUT BOB
GETTING THE SPOT OVER YOU.

1127
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:38,597
- OH, NO, I BELIEVE THE BEST MAN
ALWAYS WINS IN THE END.

1128
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,730
- GOOD.

1129
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:41,572
WELL, YOU'D BETTER GET
BACK OUT THERE.

1130
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,667
IT'S BEEN A MADHOUSE TODAY,

1131
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,797
AND I NEED
THAT REORGANIZATION REPORT

1132
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,229
BENHAM PROMISED ME.

1133
01:05:46,232 --> 01:05:49,602
I DON'T KNOW THESE SAILBOATS.

1134
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,400
I THINK MY CESSNA
IS SAFER ANYTIME.

1135
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:54,329
- YOU FLY A PLANE?

1136
01:05:54,332 --> 01:05:56,932
- EVERY WEEKEND.

1137
01:05:56,932 --> 01:05:59,502
- MM-HMM.

1138
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,273
- MR. MARSHALL?

1139
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:04,066
- LEGAL'S HAVING FITS
ABOUT THE...

1140
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:05,367
- JIM WANTS TO KNOW...

1141
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:07,397
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
LET'S NOT ALL PANIC.

1142
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,570
YOU, YOU, AND YOU PANIC.
THE REST, STAY CALM.

1143
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:10,527
[laughter]

1144
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:13,072
NOW YOU.

1145
01:06:19,867 --> 01:06:21,497
- YOU'VE REALLY WANTED
THIS PROMOTION

1146
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,600
FOR A LONG TIME, HAVEN'T YOU?

1147
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,100
- A MAN WANTS A LOT OF THINGS.

1148
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,430
DO YOU HATE CHAMPAGNE?

1149
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:32,072
- I LOVE CHAMPAGNE.

1150
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,500
IT WAS SO STRANGE
TALKING TO THAT COP TODAY.

1151
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,730
IT'S LEFT ME
WITH SUCH A WEIRD FEELING.

1152
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:48,896
- I DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD.

1153
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:52,299
HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB.

1154
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:56,169
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG,
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

1155
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,367
DON'T YOU?

1156
01:06:59,899 --> 01:07:02,799
CHEERS.

1157
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:09,902
WOULD YOU LIKE MUSIC?

1158
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,429
- I'D LOVE SOME MUSIC.

1159
01:07:40,832 --> 01:07:43,402
- OH, SHIT.

1160
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:46,827
- WHAT?

1161
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:49,072
- IT'S MY GOD DAMN LIGHTER.

1162
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:50,767
I CAN'T FIND IT.

1163
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:59,527
WHERE THE BLOODY HELL IS IT?

1164
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:02,533
[tense music]

1165
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:10,472
*

1166
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,396
HERE, GRAHAM.

1167
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,430
- GREAT.

1168
01:08:17,432 --> 01:08:19,672
- MATCHES.

1169
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,070
- OF COURSE.

1170
01:08:23,067 --> 01:08:25,197
WE MUSTN'T LET A LITTLE THING
LIKE THIS

1171
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,669
RUIN OUR EVENING.

1172
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,770
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF
TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

1173
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,827
FOR ALL BOB BENHAM'S
UNDOUBTED SKILLS,

1174
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:12,273
COST-CUTTING WAS NOT
ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS.

1175
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:15,666
I'M AFRAID THERE'S STILL
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FAT

1176
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:18,096
TO BE CUT FROM THIS COMPANY.

1177
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,770
- SO DO YOU MEAN
YOU WANT TO REORGANIZE

1178
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:22,326
THE ENTIRE MARKETING DEPARTMENT?

1179
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:23,972
- YES.

1180
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:25,826
- IT'S FUNNY.
[chuckles]

1181
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,472
I HAD THE WRONG TAKE ON YOU,
MARSHALL.

1182
01:09:28,466 --> 01:09:29,866
I HAD YOU PEGGED

1183
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:33,267
AS ONE OF GEORGE BREWSTER'S
HOLD-THE-FORT BOYS.

1184
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:36,367
- [laughs]

1185
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:19,027
- YOU MEAN EXTRA WEIGHT
IN PERSONNEL?

1186
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:22,033
- I MEAN PEOPLE.
LET'S GET RID OF SOME OF THEM.

1187
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,903
- REGULAR COKE FOR ME, PLEASE.

1188
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:27,599
SOMEBODY LEFT A LIGHTER
IN THAT RENTAL CAR.

1189
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,199
GEORGE BREWSTER SAYS
HE DIDN'T RENT A CAR.

1190
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,669
THE RENTAL COMPANY SAYS HE DID.

1191
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,667
- WHATEVER.
I DON'T KNOW.

1192
01:10:34,667 --> 01:10:37,297
- WANDA, GET HOLTZ, KIM,
AND HARTWELL INTO MY OFFICE

1193
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,969
AT 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

1194
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:42,766
YOU KNOW, GRAHAM, IT'S FUNNY.

1195
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:44,927
UNTIL TODAY,
I'D NEVER REALLY NOTICED YOU.

1196
01:10:44,932 --> 01:10:46,302
- WE SHOULD GET RID OF ANYBODY

1197
01:10:46,299 --> 01:10:48,599
THAT DOESN'T PUT
THE COMPANY FIRST.

1198
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,530
- NOW, THIS MAN IS GOOD.

1199
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,733
HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO TELL
ALL OF US.

1200
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:57,199
- MISS ANDERSON, LISTEN.

1201
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,000
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

1202
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,170
IT'S JUST, WE REALLY NEED
TO ESTABLISH

1203
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:02,427
THIS ALIBI FOR MARSHALL--

1204
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:03,502
- AN ALIBI?

1205
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,100
I TOLD YOU HE WAS THERE,
AT MY HOUSE,

1206
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,269
SATURDAY NIGHT, ALL NIGHT.

1207
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:09,067
WHAT--WHAT CAN I SAY?

1208
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:10,627
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

1209
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:12,102
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

1210
01:11:12,099 --> 01:11:14,869
- YEAH, LISTEN, I WANT
TO GIVE YOU MY NUMBER

1211
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:15,967
HERE IN NEW YORK.

1212
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,427
I'M IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

1213
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:19,802
I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT.

1214
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,170
- [sighs]
FINE.

1215
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,627
- I REALLY MEAN IT

1216
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:25,602
WHEN I SAY BE CAREFUL.

1217
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,800
- BYE.
THANKS.

1218
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:36,503
[phone rings]

1219
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,970
- MARSHALL.
- GRAHAM.

1220
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,326
- HI, STELLA.

1221
01:11:40,332 --> 01:11:42,202
- I WAS JUST WONDERING--
I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME--

1222
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,070
BUT DID YOU FIND YOUR LIGHTER
LAST NIGHT?

1223
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,867
- UH, YEAH.

1224
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:51,367
IT WAS UNDER THE SOFA.

1225
01:11:51,366 --> 01:11:52,696
- OH.

1226
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,500
- NOW, STOP DISTRACTING ME.

1227
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,570
BYE, STELLA.

1228
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,527
- STELLA?

1229
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,166
STELLA, DOES GEORGE BREWSTER
EVER COME INTO THE OFFICE?

1230
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:15,966
'CAUSE WE JUST GOT A PACKAGE,

1231
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:18,697
AND I DON'T SEE HIS ADDRESS
HERE IN THE--

1232
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:19,929
OH.

1233
01:12:19,932 --> 01:12:23,532
MR. MARSHALL, THERE'S A MESSAGE
FROM MR. JONES.

1234
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:25,073
- THANK YOU.

1235
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,200
- EXECUTIVES ARE ALWAYS
ON PINK SLIPS,

1236
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,469
SO HE WOULD BE IN THIS ONE.

1237
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,070
- WHY CAN'T THEY PUT THEM
IN THE RIGHT PLACE?

1238
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:36,827
- LET'S SEE.
BREWSTER, BREWSTER, BREWSTER.

1239
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:40,202
THERE.

1240
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:46,067
- WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL
MR. JONES' SECRETARY

1241
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:48,597
I CAN MAKE LUNCH?

1242
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,430
- CERTAINLY WILL.

1243
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:03,567
OH, BOY.

1244
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:14,767
- YOU, YOU, AND YOU PANIC.

1245
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,466
THE REST OF YOU, STAY CALM.

1246
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:34,669
- THANKS, JOE.

1247
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,300
- MELANIE, YOU HAVE A PACKAGE
FOR GEORGE BREWSTER,

1248
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,599
AND GRAHAM SAID HE'D BE HAPPY
TO DELIVER IT.

1249
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,333
- JOE.

1250
01:14:12,932 --> 01:14:14,702
WHAT AN IDIOT.

1251
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:16,069
WRONG ONE.

1252
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:18,167
- NO BIG DEAL.

1253
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,830
- STELLA, I'M OUT OF HERE.

1254
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,702
HOW LATE ARE YOU GONNA STAY?

1255
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,900
- NOT TOO MUCH LONGER.

1256
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:42,969
- DIDN'T JOE PICK UP
THIS PACKAGE?

1257
01:15:42,966 --> 01:15:44,796
- I'M SURE YOU CAN GET
THESE NUMBERS

1258
01:15:44,799 --> 01:15:46,129
FOR THE MORNING, WANDA.

1259
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:48,803
- IT WILL BE TIGHT.

1260
01:15:57,767 --> 01:15:59,997
- GIVE IT A TRY.

1261
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,300
GOOD NIGHT.

1262
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,900
- TAKING WORK HOME, MELANIE?

1263
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,230
- OH, NO, I'M JUST GOING
TO MAIL THESE.

1264
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,803
- AH.

1265
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:37,066
- YES, I HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT THE BOB BENHAM CASE.

1266
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:40,533
- DON'T USUALLY
HAVE THE BOSS OVER.

1267
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:42,603
OF COURSE,
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

1268
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,097
- HE ALMOST LAUGHED ALOUD.

1269
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,400
HIS POWERS HAD BEEN SWITCHED ON

1270
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:53,329
TO THE POINT
NO WOMAN COULD RESIST HIM.

1271
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:55,902
- THE BEERS
ARE IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

1272
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:57,529
- THANK YOU.

1273
01:16:59,667 --> 01:17:01,697
- I'M SORRY TO TAKE SO LONG.

1274
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,670
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

1275
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,896
DID YOU FIND IT?

1276
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,600
- WHAT?

1277
01:17:08,599 --> 01:17:10,369
- DID YOU FIND THE BEER?

1278
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,467
- IT TOOK EVERY OUNCE
OF HIS SELF-CONTROL

1279
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:23,766
TO STOP HIMSELF FROM, UH--

1280
01:17:23,766 --> 01:17:25,226
TO REMIND HIMSELF

1281
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:27,503
HE HAD COME FOR
THAT GOD DAMN LIGHTER PACKAGE.

1282
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,330
YOU KNOW, MELANIE,
I'VE JUST REMEMBERED

1283
01:17:30,332 --> 01:17:32,372
I'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO TONIGHT,

1284
01:17:32,366 --> 01:17:35,926
SO I THINK I'LL BE GOING.

1285
01:17:35,932 --> 01:17:39,072
OH, I'LL--

1286
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:42,797
I'LL POST THESE LETTERS FOR YOU
ON THE WAY HOME.

1287
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,069
- NO, JUST TAKE THE TRAIN.

1288
01:17:45,067 --> 01:17:48,827
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

1289
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:52,532
THEN CAN I COME BY YOUR PLACE
TO PICK IT UP?

1290
01:17:52,533 --> 01:17:54,333
RIGHT AWAY.

1291
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,633
- STELLA.

1292
01:18:26,533 --> 01:18:28,973
[tires squeal]

1293
01:18:28,966 --> 01:18:31,896
[siren wailing]

1294
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:30,432
STELLA?

1295
01:20:32,932 --> 01:20:34,872
- GRAHAM.

1296
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:44,402
AH!

1297
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:51,167
- I THINK YOU HAVE MY LIGHTER.

1298
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:54,497
- I CALLED THE COP.
I CALLED LAKER.

1299
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,470
HE'S COMING.

1300
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:58,626
- YOU BETRAYED ME.

1301
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:00,003
- GRAHAM.

1302
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,770
YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE,
DIDN'T YOU?

1303
01:21:02,766 --> 01:21:05,226
YOU DID.
YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE.

1304
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:06,932
YOU KILLED BENHAM.

1305
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:08,732
THAT'S WHY HE WAS ASKING ME
ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

1306
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:11,073
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ON SATURDAY.

1307
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,066
OH, GOD.

1308
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,530
- YOU BETRAYED THE MAGIC.

1309
01:21:18,533 --> 01:21:20,633
- MAGIC?

1310
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,230
MAGIC.

1311
01:21:24,233 --> 01:21:26,703
I TRUSTED YOU.

1312
01:21:35,133 --> 01:21:37,603
- GIVE ME THE LIGHTER.

1313
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:17,066
SHE'D FELT HIS POWER.

1314
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:21,127
SHE'D NEVER TESTIFY
AGAINST HIM NOW.

1315
01:22:21,132 --> 01:22:24,302
AND, BESIDES,
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE.

1316
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,527
SHE WAS A TERRIFIC GIRL, STELLA.

1317
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:31,803
VERY LOYAL.

1318
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,630
I FELT BADLY FOR HER,

1319
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:37,273
BUT IT COULDN'T BE HELPED.

1320
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:49,303
- HELP A GUY OUT, BUDDY?

1321
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:58,066
GOD BLESS YOU.

1322
01:23:08,632 --> 01:23:10,202
- POOR LIEUTENANT LAKER.

1323
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,869
ALL HUNCHES
AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE,

1324
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:16,927
NOT EVEN ENOUGH
TO KEEP ME IN JAIL OVERNIGHT.

1325
01:23:16,932 --> 01:23:19,132
AH.

1326
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:21,302
GOOD EVENING, LIEUTENANT.

1327
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,900
AND WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

1328
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:24,969
I WAS UNTOUCHABLE.

1329
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:28,596
- HEY, WAKE UP.

1330
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,630
- AND THEN, OF COURSE,

1331
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:35,072
THERE WAS THE UNEXPECTED
AND, I MUST SAY, REGRETTABLE

1332
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:39,067
SUICIDE OF GEORGE BREWSTER.

1333
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:41,227
IT COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED
WHATEVER CASE

1334
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:43,832
LAKER MIGHT HAVE TRIED
TO PUT TOGETHER.

1335
01:23:43,832 --> 01:23:45,272
POOR OLD GEORGE.

1336
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:48,397
HE JUST COULDN'T ADAPT
TO THE NEW PEOPLE.

1337
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:50,199
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

1338
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,400
HAD BEATEN THEM
AT THEIR OWN SYSTEM

1339
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,199
AND SUBSEQUENTLY ROSE
RATHER EFFORTLESSLY,

1340
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,530
FLOATING UP FROM MERE MARKETING

1341
01:23:56,533 --> 01:24:00,003
THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF POLICY
AND ON TO THE BOARD

1342
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,130
AND ALONG THE WAY
PROMOTING STELLA

1343
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:04,933
TO THE LOS ANGELES OFFICE.

1344
01:24:04,932 --> 01:24:08,672
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
TIRESOME DETAIL:

1345
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:10,696
JONES.

1346
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:15,529
HE JUST WOULDN'T LET GO
OF THAT CORNER OFFICE.

1347
01:24:32,832 --> 01:24:35,572
ABRACADABRA.

1348
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:38,167
SHALAKAZAM.

1349
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:42,097
BYE-BYE, BABY.

1350
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,070
[explosion]

1351
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,772
BOOM.
