1
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,590
My mother died six months ago today.

2
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,260
At the hospital, they told us she'd had an aneurysm.

3
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,530
There was nothing I could do for her.

4
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,410
I guess I've gotten pretty good at pretending to be okay.

5
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,250
I don't think this stupid thing is even working.

6
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,590
You turn it on?

7
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,690
Of course I turned it on.

8
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,530
Did you take the lens cap off?

9
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,360
Yeah, that probably would help.

10
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,760
Okay, Phoebe, can you just...

11
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,900
Okay.

12
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,170
Ready?

13
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,870
Rolling, and action.

14
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,370
Video Diary, day 18.

15
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,680
Now, today is an extremely important day.

16
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Why?

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,610
Because here is my application to the University of Chicago,

18
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,310
where I'm hoping to study Classics in the fall.

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,910
Have you ever heard of the Internet?

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,750
I know nowadays you can submit this stuff online,

21
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,520
but personally, I prefer the more traditional route.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,420
As you can see, this envelope is seriously thick.

23
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,930
Why is that?

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,790
Well, question seven on the application asks you

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,530
to tell them what your best and worst qualities are,

26
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,500
but they only give you three-and-a-half inches.

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,800
Addy, watch the road.

28
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,470
Three-and-a-half inches on a page.

29
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,270
I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more

30
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,740
than three-and-a-half inches.

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,570
So I decided to throw in a few extra pages.

32
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,810
How many?

33
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,610
-Twenty-two to be exact. -Wow!

34
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,820
I realize that might seem a bit excessive.

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,240
It does.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,540
However, how are you expected

37
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,950
to express the very essence of your being

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,750
and your views on how insanely crazy this world is

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,650
in such a tiny space on a page?

40
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,220
-I mean, it's absurd. -Okay, Addy, shut up already.

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,520
There's a mailbox right there.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,860
Great.

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,530
Phoebe? Can you please film this?

44
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,260
You're on me, right?

45
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,600
Right.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,900
And now the moment we've all been waiting for.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,770
I know it's a moment you're very excited about, Phoebe.

48
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,240
You're very excited about this, aren't you?

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm excited to get some coffee.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
Just put it in the box already.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
Okay, give me the camera.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,510
Oh, Jesus, he's still not done.

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,580
Do it.

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,680
Hey! Move it!

55
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
You know what?

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,780
No. I'm not too worried about the extra pages

57
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,790
because wasn't it Virgil who said,

58
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,660
"Fortune sides with him who dares"?

59
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,390
Or perhaps even more apropos are the immortal words of David Bowie,

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,630
"I don't know where I'm going from here,

61
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,600
"but I promise it won't be boring."

62
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,540
They're never going to read 22 extra pages, Addison.

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,910
Well, for those of us who didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe,

64
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,010
we have to put in a little extra effort.

65
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,010
Two medium Americanos.

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,380
What's your name?

67
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,550
Add... Screw you, Brandon.

68
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,450
Are you seriously with this guy?

69
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,490
Do you seriously imagine I give a shit what you think?

70
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,790
Yeah, but the whole school thinks you lost your mind, so...

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,490
-Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos. -Got it.

72
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,560
-Are you going to pay for that? -Nope.

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Two medium Americanos for Addison coming right up.

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,900
-What's going on, brother? -How you doing, man?

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,470
-Good to see you, man. -Good to see you.

76
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,470
-Did you read it, yet? -Oh!

77
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,370
What? Dude, how are you so fast?

78
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,310
I don't understand. What did you think?

79
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,010
We'll talk about it after you've read the James Baldwin.

80
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,710
Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you.

81
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,440
Oh... Have you guys had your first kiss yet?

82
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,380
No, I'm waiting.

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,610
-Of course you would. -You should've seen this guy

84
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,520
in philosophy class the other day,

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,950
he nailed Miss Keneally to the wall. It was incredible.

86
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,520
-Why? -Because she was giving a stupid lecture

87
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,420
about why students cut class.

88
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,820
And he said, "You're the reason why students cut class."

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,760
-Kevin. -No. I said,

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,660
"People like Miss Keneally are the reason kids cut class."

91
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,330
I was joking obviously.

92
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,830
He wasn't joking. It was incredible.

93
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,730
No, she is what's wrong with the education system.

94
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,730
-Dude, I got to work. Okay? -Okay. Okay.

95
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,040
Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs.

96
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,800
You got it.

97
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,870
You stand up for the people, Kevin. You're a good man.

98
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,470
-Here you go. Sure. -Thanks.

99
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,710
Phoebe?

100
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,510
-Huh? What's up? -How's he doing?

101
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,480
He's okay.

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
I'll see you later.

103
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,000
It's chilly.

104
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,570
-Can I ask you something? -Mmm?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,800
I feel like you hanging out with me has, like,

106
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,610
a detrimental effect on your standing with the cool kids.

107
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,580
We've always hung out, Addison.

108
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,290
Not really. I mean, we haven't really since eighth grade.

109
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,080
I sort of went invisible there for a while.

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay. Well, maybe it's because I find every guy in high school

111
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,820
to be completely dull and predictable.

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,090
And why is that?

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,790
Are they predictable because they want to hook up?

114
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,830
Can we just get some music or something?

115
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,530
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

116
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,100
I feel like you see me as somehow sexually neutral

117
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,540
from the Latin "neuter," as in, without testicles.

118
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,740
No, I don't see you that way.

119
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,510
I hate to break it to you, Phoebe.

120
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,970
I don't want to disappoint you.

121
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,710
But guess what?

122
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,950
I want what all the other guys want, too.

123
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,420
That's okay.

124
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,550
Really?

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,620
Actually,

126
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,090
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

127
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,170
And I guess now is as good a time as any to tell you.

128
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,170
I don't want to go off to college as a...

129
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,440
As a what?

130
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,780
Without having, you know,

131
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,010
done it.

132
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,850
Done what?

133
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,880
Screw you, Addison.

134
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,950
I wanna get it over with.

135
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,990
All right? I want to have sex with a guy who I feel safe around.

136
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,660
You know? Who won't judge me.

137
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,560
And who is definitely a virgin, too.

138
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,130
You're talking about me?

139
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,170
Wait, what? What makes you think that I'm a virgin?

140
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,070
Addison, shut up.

141
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,610
So, my mom is in a meeting with the Secretary of Commerce until 6:00 p.m.

142
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,720
-You want to do this right now? -Yeah.

143
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,880
While there's a meeting between your mom and the Secretary of Commerce?

144
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,620
Addison, I swear to God, if you ask me another question,

145
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,020
-I'm gonna change my mind. -Okay, okay, okay.

146
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,810
Um...

147
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,980
Do you think we should kiss?

148
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,150
Uh...

149
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,080
I think we should kiss.

150
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,290
Okay.

151
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,610
Here.

152
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,030
-Shit! Be careful. -Sorry.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,130
Okay.

154
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,170
There.

155
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,740
Okay. So...

156
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,270
That's what this whole thing is about, right?

157
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,980
There? That's all you're gonna say?

158
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,610
There? I just gave myself to you.

159
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,220
There.

160
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,890
Should I keep going?

161
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,150
Sure.

162
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,090
-Sure? -Yeah?

163
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,660
Yeah?

164
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,760
Okay.

165
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,370
-Can I keep kissing you? -Okay.

166
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,790
Yeah, I wonder if you can.

167
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,920
My son is making a film with my old video camera

168
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,890
and he only has one tape left.

169
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,330
And your website says that you sell new old ones, so to speak.

170
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,940
Yeah, VHS-Cs. Sixty minutes.

171
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,070
Yeah, I'll hold.

172
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,680
We're here at the Seven Stars Bakery, and as you can tell,

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,950
it is a very active crime scene.

174
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,950
And what we've learned is that at least one person has died.

175
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,020
We'll continue to bring you information

176
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,490
and details as it becomes available.

177
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,360
Now, there has been significant discussion

178
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,430
about whether or not this could be gang related.

179
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,070
Hey.

180
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,070
Hey.

181
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,440
So, what do you think?

182
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,040
That was okay, right?

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,940
Yeah. I mean, that... That's gotta be some of the best sex I've ever had.

184
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,150
I can't believe we just did that.

185
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,420
Yeah.

186
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,020
Are you okay?

187
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,150
Yeah.

188
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,990
You know, I feel like...

189
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,230
I feel like I just checked a really important box.

190
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,930
I feel like I just checkmated it.

191
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,450
What's that noise?

192
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,820
-I think it's my pager. -Oh...

193
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,060
Okay. You should probably get that.

194
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,030
I can't believe you still actually use that thing.

195
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,360
My dad. Can I use your landline?

196
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,770
Yeah, sure.

197
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,470
My mom's calling me.

198
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,200
Oh, God, she never calls from work.

199
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,100
-Do you think she knows? -That's weird. I don't know.

200
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,110
I swear to God, she has a sixth sense about this stuff.

201
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,210
Hello?

202
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,910
Yeah.

203
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,410
Wait, wait. Mom, slow down. What?

204
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,310
There was a shooting at Seven Stars.

205
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,050
A kid named Kevin Broadus was killed.

206
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,820
Oh, my God. When?

207
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,880
What happened?

208
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,890
It's Kevin.

209
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,520
Kennedy High School student Kevin Broadus

210
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,290
was gunned down today by an unidentified assailant.

211
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,790
...fled the scene of the crime on a red Honda motorcycle.

212
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,400
Only one person was targeted. No money was stolen.

213
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,800
This has all the hallmarks of a gang killing.

214
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
We're gonna take you now live

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
to the Metro Police press conference,

216
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,840
where Detective Thompson is taking questions.

217
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,900
Still very early at this point. We're not ruling anything out.

218
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,610
Thank you all.

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,160
We'll be with you when we have more information. Thank you.

220
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,090
Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know if Detective Thompson's here?

221
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,960
No, I think he just left.

222
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,830
-Do they have any idea who did it? -I doubt it.

223
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,970
You know, these guys usually tend to close ranks.

224
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,500
Who? Which guys?

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,070
Whatever gang he's in.

226
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,070
They'll just hide him until no one cares anymore.

227
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,790
Why is everyone saying this is a gang thing?

228
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,480
It's D.C.

229
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,140
Addison!

230
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,980
Addison, why the hell didn't you call me back?

231
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,520
I paged you twice.

232
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,520
Something happened.

233
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,450
I know what happened.

234
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,860
It's all over the news. And I know you go to that place.

235
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,300
What?

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,230
Was he a friend of yours?

237
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,030
Oh, no.

238
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,470
Son. I'm sorry.

240
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go to bed.

241
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,310
Okay.

242
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,590
This is a community and neighborhood

243
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,990
that is concerned about the killing of a 17-year-old.

244
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,060
Well, this community should know they can rest assured

245
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,390
that the Metro D.C. Police Department

246
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,330
is doing everything in our power to find the people who did this.

247
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,930
-And we will find them. -Phoebe?

248
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,140
Honey? You almost ready?

249
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,670
I thought I'd take you to school.

250
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,070
No. I can... I can drive myself. It's fine.

251
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,610
-Just, please. -Mom, can you leave it on? Please?

252
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,280
No. It's really... It's not good for you to obsess about this.

253
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm not obsessing.

254
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,420
Listen, I called Denise last night, and we both agreed

255
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,060
that you should see her for just a couple of sessions, that it would be...

256
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,490
Mom, you're overreacting. Just drop it.

257
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,090
I'm not overreacting.

258
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,630
I just think it's a very traumatic experience

259
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,200
-and I think that you need to... -I'm not traumatized.

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,230
Well, I am! I'm traumatized.

261
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,100
Just call her! Okay?

262
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,640
I've had experience in this, you know?

263
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,170
I've learned the hard way

264
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,240
that you really can't pretend that this never happened.

265
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,510
You need to talk to somebody.

266
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,450
And, clearly,

267
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,520
you don't want it to be me.

268
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Addy.

269
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,440
Yeah.

270
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,310
Hey. Morning.

271
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,680
Hey, Dad.

272
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,080
If you want to stay home today, it's okay.

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,420
You know, I get it.

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,350
No, it's fine. I'm going in.

275
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,390
Well, then, why don't I drive you?

276
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,690
No, I can drive myself.

277
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,120
Mmm...

278
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,760
You... You all right?

279
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,160
Not really, but...

280
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,500
You want to talk about it?

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
No.

282
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,340
Thanks for this, by the way.

283
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,270
Oh, yeah. I'm glad you could find a use for it.

284
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,440
You know, when I pulled it out of the box,

285
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,310
I found all this footage of you, you know, when you were little.

286
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,520
The three of us.

287
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,580
Uh-huh...

288
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,380
Probably take a look at it sometime.

289
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,460
All right, well, I don't want to be late, so...

290
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,520
All right.

291
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,720
All right, Dad.

292
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,730
Take it easy.

293
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,370
Love you.

294
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,610
Grief counselors will be available throughout the day.

295
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,080
For those of you who knew Kevin Broadus,

296
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,620
please proceed to the first floor,

297
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,720
where the police are taking statements.

298
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,150
Go on in.

299
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Did you notice anything out of the ordinary

300
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,590
inside or outside the coffee shop before the shooting?

301
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,290
Um, no.

302
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,590
-Is there anything else you can tell us? -Yes.

303
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
Kevin Broadus was not in a gang.

304
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,700
How do you know that?

305
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,100
Well, if you knew Kevin, you would know he wasn't in a gang.

306
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,110
He wrote poetry, collected books, he was in the jazz band.

307
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,610
Okay. Thank you.

308
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,780
Um, did you get all that?

309
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,510
We appreciate your time.

310
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,680
Will you please send the next person in?

311
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,850
Uh, can I speak with Detective Thompson?

312
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,120
He's not available right now,

313
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,560
but if you remember anything, you should get in touch with us.

314
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,670
# I'll be going home

315
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:07,240
# See the light, see the sun

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,620
# I'm just going home

317
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,590
I don't suppose any of us got much sleep last night.

318
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,630
Like most of you probably,

319
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,470
I wept a little,

320
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,470
I prayed a little.

321
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,870
Kevin will be missed by the teachers for his diligence.

322
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,570
He will be missed by the jazz band,

323
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,180
who is short one excellent trombone player.

324
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,780
-Trumpet, but it's all brass. -A dear friend to many of you.

325
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,720
Mostly, he'll be missed by his loving parents.

326
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,350
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,820
Sir! I'm really sorry.

328
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,390
I didn't mean to be disrespectful or interrupt,

329
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,620
but I just had to say something

330
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,720
-that's really important. -Addison.

331
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,660
I saw Kevin at the coffee shop yesterday right before it happened.

332
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,460
Actually, Phoebe and I both did.

333
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,430
And then after I heard the news, I went back to coffee shop,

334
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,630
and one of the news crew guys told me that

335
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,200
they're going to write this whole thing off as a gang killing.

336
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,710
Which means they probably won't even go after the guy who did it

337
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,340
because there's such a small chance

338
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,770
of them actually solving the case.

339
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,840
Addison, could you sit down please?

340
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,280
I mean, if anyone here knew Kevin, they knew he wasn't in a gang.

341
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,750
Addison, please, enough.

342
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,250
I think this is something we should talk about.

343
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,950
Why am I the only one saying anything?

344
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,650
Addison, please. I've asked you politely. Sit down!

345
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,690
Does no one care?

346
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,220
I want to hear everything you have to say, in my office!

347
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,430
All right. Okay.

348
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,560
See me later.

349
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
Our emotions are raw.

350
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,240
Everybody in this room is hurting.

351
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,300
Really?

352
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,640
Respect is important.

353
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,550
So what's going on with you?

354
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,320
What do you mean, sir?

355
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,520
Look, there has been a marked deterioration of your behavior

356
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,260
and your attitude lately.

357
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,530
How are you doing?

358
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,930
I'm fine.

359
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,000
Loss of a parent is a big deal, Addison.

360
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,410
This has nothing to do with my mother, sir.

361
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,340
All right.

362
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,910
Here's what I suggest you do.

363
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,550
Cut the theatrics.

364
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,980
Let the police do their job.

365
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,550
And you work your ass off.

366
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,420
Make your mother proud.

367
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,490
And I'll talk to Chicago.

368
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,030
Tell them what an asset you are to the school.

369
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,340
-Hey, no cameras in here. Turn it off. -Sure.

370
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm here to see Detective Thompson.

371
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,710
I still see the red light.

372
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,980
Turn it off now.

373
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,380
Sorry. Sorry.

374
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,850
You have an appointment?

375
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,450
Not particularly, but I need to speak with him.

376
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,320
He's very busy right now.

377
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,690
Okay. I'm going to wait, all right?

378
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,710
Hi, Detective.

379
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,740
So you're the kid with the camera.

380
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,570
Yeah, that's right.

381
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,610
We've got your statement.

382
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,950
I understand that there's something that you'd like to add.

383
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,620
Yeah. Um, you guys know that Kevin Broadus was not in a gang, right?

384
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,850
We don't know that.

385
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,820
How do you know that?

386
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,660
Um, well, I mean, I went to...

387
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,620
You know, I've been friends with him for a while,

388
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,630
and I know that he wasn't in a gang.

389
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,560
Who told you that he was in a gang?

390
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,030
I thought you came here to tell us something.

391
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,640
I mean, I am here... I just... I need to know what's going on.

392
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,770
I don't have time for this. Could you deal with this kid?

393
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,570
-Yeah, I got it. -Please sir, listen!

394
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,680
My friend just got killed.

395
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,480
And you can't expect me just to sit around and not do anything about it, okay?

396
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,850
Listen, son. I know he was your friend,

397
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,560
and believe me, we want to catch whoever did this just as much as you do,

398
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,700
but right now, we're dealing with 24 homicides in this district alone,

399
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,500
and that's just in the past two weeks.

400
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm sorry, but if you don't have anything new to tell us,

401
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,970
I have to get back to work.

402
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,870
Take it easy now.

403
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Hey.

404
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,960
I was looking for you.

405
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,560
You okay?

406
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,070
Yeah, I'm all right.

407
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,440
Do you want to talk about it? Or...

408
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,110
The police have already made up their minds.

409
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,810
What?

410
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,510
You don't know that.

411
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,010
Listen, Phoebe, one second we were talking to him,

412
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,580
and the next he's gone. It just doesn't make any sense.

413
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,890
Everyone is just moving on like nothing happened.

414
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,050
Addy.

415
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,260
Someone needs to do something.

416
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,170
Addy, I know after what happened with your mom...

417
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,470
You know, sometimes

418
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,000
bad things, I don't know, Addy, they just happen.

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,170
Phoebe. That's really deep.

420
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,110
I feel so much better. Thank you.

421
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,980
Addison. I'm just trying to help you.

422
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,190
# Nowhere to run

423
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,820
# The whole world won't find you

424
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,590
# Six degrees of

425
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,470
# Separation from you

426
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,670
# I'm not moving

427
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,040
# Till the sun shines on me

428
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,510
# Said I've been longing

429
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,910
# Longing for apricity

430
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,910
# I'm not moving

431
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,880
# 'Til the sun shines on me

432
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,220
# I've been longing

433
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,990
Addison?

434
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,060
Hi.

435
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,530
Can I help you?

436
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,530
Yeah. Uh...

437
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Mr. Venderleun needs toner.

438
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,940
Again?

439
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,070
You wait here.

440
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,180
Okay.

441
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,100
You tell Mr. Venderleun from me that these resources

442
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,260
are for the entire school and not just for his class.

443
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,300
Okay, I will. Thank you so much.

444
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,740
# Call out your name

445
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,850
# I said I'd find you

446
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,750
Hey! Hey, there's something... There's something I gotta show you.

447
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,090
I have Mandarin in, like, five minutes.

448
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,690
-Mandarin? No. This is really important. -Yes. Look, I can't.

449
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,900
I skipped it last time so I could sleep with you.

450
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,200
-So I have to do it today. -Come on!

451
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,930
Look. This is from Mrs. Strauss.

452
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,230
"Kevin has begun to show signs of emotional trouble.

453
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,200
"The recent slide in academic results suggest

454
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,640
"he may be dealing with significant emotional difficulties

455
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,610
"outside of school,

456
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,040
"which he is reluctant to elaborate upon in our sessions."

457
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,710
Christ, Addison.

458
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,180
What do you think that means?

459
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,350
I don't know.

460
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,620
I think I should talk to Strauss.

461
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,020
And say what?

462
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,050
"Hi, I stole your file,

463
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,120
"and, you know, I would love if you could talk me through it"?

464
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,660
No, obviously not, but I think this could lead to something.

465
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,760
What if we could figure this out?

466
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,870
Don't you even care?

467
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,700
That's not what this is about.

468
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,040
Phoebe. Come on. We... Like...

469
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,910
I saw your posters today outside of the gym.

470
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,010
-I tore them down. -What? Why?

471
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,910
'Cause, Addison, everyone's making fun of you.

472
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
-They know it's you. -So you're embarrassed by me?

473
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,080
No, I'm not embarrassed by you.

474
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,750
It's okay to have sex with me,

475
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,790
but you don't want people to know we're friends?

476
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,660
Of course not! I mean, of course it's okay that we're friends.

477
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,390
Listen, if you're ashamed of me, just tell me, okay?

478
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,290
No, you idiot!

479
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,190
I did it because of in spite of how stupid you're being,

480
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,630
I actually give a shit about you.

481
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,340
Um, can I borrow your phone? This could be a lead.

482
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,780
Jesus Christ.

483
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,040
Come on! Let me borrow your phone.

484
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,060
-Hello? -Hello.

485
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,860
Addison?

486
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Addis...

487
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,830
-Who was it? -I don't know. They hung up.

488
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Addison, you don't seem to realize that I'm going through this, too.

489
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,210
And I can't stop thinking about it either, okay? But...

490
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,380
It's not about you.

491
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,780
And there's nothing you can do to change it, okay?

492
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,020
Now I'm late for class. I gotta go.

493
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Hi, you've reached the Schacht family,

494
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,420
Sarah, Theo and Addison.

495
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,820
We can't come to the phone right now.

496
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,460
So leave us a message, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

497
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,860
Uh, hello. This is Principal Karlstadt at Robert Kennedy High.

498
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,230
I would like, if you can, for you to come in tomorrow at 8:30 into my office.

499
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,040
It's a matter of some urgency.

500
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,140
Parents and children should be in touch with each other.

501
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,660
We are in touch with each other.

502
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,240
Through a pager.

503
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Except, he had to use my daughter's phone to call...

504
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,980
All kids borrow each other's phone all the time, don't they?

505
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,050
-He doesn't have a cell phone? -No. Is that a problem?

506
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,490
Why didn't you get him a cell phone?

507
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
Okay, let's all calm down. Let's stay very calm.

508
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,490
It's not a problem. It's a matter of...

509
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,990
-It's a safety issue. -Could we calm down please?

510
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,990
I'm just trying to make sense of this.

511
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,490
So, his son has put himself

512
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,800
smack dab in the middle of a murder case.

513
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,300
-Am I right? -Well...

514
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,170
Listen, my son is a good kid. Can I just say that?

515
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,500
I mean, he's been through a lot this last year.

516
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,170
Yes.

517
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,240
He's lost his mother and now he's lost a friend.

518
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,140
What I'm trying to say is that I think he's just trying to help.

519
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,010
Right. I am not gonna let his kid

520
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,010
jeopardize my daughter's life,

521
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,520
nor her future for that matter.

522
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,120
Okay. I'm gonna stop us right here.

523
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,090
This is a very, very precarious time for all of us.

524
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,490
So I'd like you to keep that in mind

525
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,220
when you discuss this with your children.

526
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,930
Yes. Of course.

527
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,960
Thank... Thank you for the meeting, Mr. Karlstadt.

528
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,830
It's been very educational. Thank you.

529
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,140
Okay, I'll speak to you again after you talk to your children.

530
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,110
Thank you very much. I'll talk with him tonight.

531
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,850
-Hi, beautiful. -Hi.

532
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,250
You doing okay?

533
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

534
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,490
Um, so, what's up with your asshole boyfriend?

535
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,830
It's just that I heard some weird stuff, that's all.

536
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,190
Do you want to talk about it?

537
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,330
No. Not really.

538
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,470
Oh... Okay.

539
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,440
-Hi. -Hey.

540
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,070
Uh, could I have a word with you?

541
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,270
Yeah, what's up?

542
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,310
Can I talk to you in private?

543
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,310
Yeah. Sure. Um...

544
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,110
Hey, Alex, will you just watch my stuff? I'll be right back.

545
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,150
Yeah, sure.

546
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,280
Thanks.

547
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,080
I kind of wanted your advice.

548
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,220
Yeah?

549
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,890
Something to do with Kevin.

550
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,920
Yeah. Um...

551
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,860
I was in the coffee shop when it happened.

552
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,530
-Really? -Yeah.

553
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,900
I saw something, and I don't know if I should tell Addison.

554
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,100
Tell him what?

555
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,400
Addison.

556
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,340
Mrs. Strauss. Do you have a minute?

557
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,640
Sure. Come in.

558
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,470
The guy who killed Kevin was white.

559
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,110
I saw his wrist when he pushed the door open.

560
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,480
I know something was going on with Kevin before he died.

561
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,450
And I heard that you and him were talking

562
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,090
because he was going through some emotional difficulties.

563
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,360
So, what do you think it means?

564
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,590
I don't know, but I told the cops,

565
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,390
but I don't think they're looking in the right place.

566
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,360
Why?

567
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,460
I mean, I heard Kevin was hanging out with that kid Noel.

568
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,200
-Noel? -Yeah.

569
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,300
And I know he's mixed up with some heavy people.

570
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,600
They're dangerous.

571
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,670
What we talked about was confidential.

572
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,470
Just like the conversation we're having right now is confidential.

573
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,340
Yeah, of course.

574
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,180
But I just want to know if there's anything,

575
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,020
you know, if you had any idea of what was going on with him.

576
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,550
Addison, if you want to talk about how you feel about what's happened,

577
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,690
we can do that.

578
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,520
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

579
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,490
Look, just promise me you won't tell any of this to Addison.

580
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,090
Just not right now, okay?

581
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,370
Yeah. Okay.

582
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
-Thanks, Bo. -Yeah. I'll see you.

583
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,540
Yeah.

584
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,370
I was at your school today.

585
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,410
And I was catching a lot of shit about you.

586
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,980
About this.

587
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,580
What's up with this, hmm?

588
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,490
What's going on?

589
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,690
Addison?

590
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,160
Remember that day

591
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,530
that Kevin was killed?

592
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,330
Yeah.

593
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,400
I drove back to the coffee shop after it happened.

594
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,540
That's why I didn't call you.

595
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,410
Okay.

596
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,070
And I...

597
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,680
I saw his body.

598
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,380
Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like, I saw them wheel him out.

599
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
Here's this kid.

600
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,220
He gets murdered,

601
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,720
and no one cares.

602
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,520
That's not true, Addy. You know that's not true.

603
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,020
No, it is! That's what it seems like.

604
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,160
People care. They do. They just...

605
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,430
Will you just do me a favor?

606
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,330
Just stop this nonsense. This is... This is crazy, Addison.

607
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,570
It's not nonsense. I'm just trying to do something good.

608
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,210
Yeah, I... I understand, I think I do, what you're trying to do.

609
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,610
But this is a murder investigation.

610
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,310
You don't know what could happen.

611
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,080
Nothing's gonna happen!

612
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,050
Well, I couldn't take it if anything did happen to you.

613
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,690
Just...

614
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,260
If you can't do it for me,

615
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,660
do it for her.

616
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,360
All right?

617
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,500
Yeah.

618
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,340
Video Diary. Day 23.

619
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,210
I don't know, maybe my dad's right.

620
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,490
Maybe I'm not thinking straight.

621
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,320
Maybe I shouldn't forget about the rest of my life.

622
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
Phoebe!

623
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,660
Hey.

624
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,220
What's up?

625
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,230
Hi.

626
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,830
What?

627
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:14,670
Look. So, I know the other night was purely a practical thing for you.

628
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,740
And, you know, I have nothing to compare it to,

629
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,480
except for maybe porn and stuff.

630
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,380
But I just have to say

631
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,120
that it really was sensational,

632
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,620
in the original meaning of the word.

633
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,760
And I have a strong and overwhelming desire

634
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,460
to do it again.

635
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,600
That's bad, huh?

636
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,570
Well, you know,

637
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,380
when I woke up this morning, I...

638
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,720
I looked over at the pillow where your head had been.

639
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,750
Uh...

640
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,750
And I...

641
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,590
And I kind of wished it was still there.

642
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,700
I don't know, we're probably

643
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,300
-just romanticizing it. -Romanticizing it. Yeah. That's classic.

644
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,440
But, uh...

645
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,570
Maybe if we did it again...

646
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,840
What? It might break the spell?

647
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,310
That works.

648
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,280
-Should we... -Yeah.

649
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,380
Okay.

650
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,350
Are you sure your dad's not home?

651
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,190
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

652
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,590
He's out shooting bridges for a Belgian tourist brochure.

653
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,700
Long way from the Washington Post, huh?

654
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,440
What?

655
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,770
That... That was pretty good. Right?

656
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,870
I mean, what do you think?

657
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,610
Better, same?

658
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,480
Worse?

659
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,550
Not worse, but...

660
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,390
Okay.

661
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,960
I mean, the spell is definitely broken.

662
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,490
Yeah.

663
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,630
Really?

664
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,540
No, Addy.

665
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,640
I want you to hold me.

666
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,790
Is it just a one-time thing? I mean, like...

667
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,430
I mean, if we do do this again, which I hope we will,

668
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,940
I mean, like, do you want to usually do the holding afterwards or beforehand?

669
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,010
Usually afterwards, I'm guessing. That's good.

670
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,310
I'm just curious, you know.

671
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,480
-I want to be... -Shut up.

672
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,250
Okay.

673
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,290
Okay. Um...

674
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,020
So, what? I guess we just keep...

675
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,820
We keep doing this until the feeling wears off?

676
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,390
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

677
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,490
Okay.

678
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,770
How are you getting home?

679
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,130
I'm gonna grab a cab. Don't worry about it. It's fine, okay?

680
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,810
Hi.

681
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,910
Hey.

682
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,050
I brought dinner.

683
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,980
Um, I already ate actually, but thank you.

684
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,450
Okay.

685
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,750
How was your trip?

686
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,860
Good.

687
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,990
How was class?

688
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,660
Fine.

689
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,560
I learned five more ways to say "hello."

690
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,330
It was eventful.

691
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,800
Should we talk about Addison Schacht?

692
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Wow!

693
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,740
-You really have people everywhere, huh? -Really?

694
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,510
Addison Schacht. Okay.

695
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,880
What?

696
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,750
What's the problem?

697
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,880
We moved up the hill and they moved down.

698
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,580
I went in to your school yesterday,

699
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,090
and I had a meeting with Karlstadt.

700
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,590
He told me about Addison's so-called "investigation"

701
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,560
into the Broadus murder and your involvement in it.

702
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm not involved in it.

703
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,770
He's a friend of mine. That's it.

704
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,700
So he's just a friend, huh?

705
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,070
What does it matter?

706
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,000
What do you have against him?

707
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,070
It's not his fault that his life has been so shitty.

708
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,610
His mom died.

709
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,380
I'm not talking about his mother dying.

710
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,750
I'm talking about you pulling this shit with your friend.

711
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,520
And I just don't want you to get involved in something

712
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,050
that will most definitely hurt you.

713
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,760
# Only memories remain

714
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,430
# Only memories remain

715
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,540
# For a time There by the sea

716
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,520
# There was only you and me

717
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,620
# In a land that time forgot

718
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,930
# You uttered sweet forget-me-nots

719
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,510
# And you know yeah, I never will

720
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,850
# But sometimes life has other ideas

721
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,980
# And though we both know...

722
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,850
Addison Schacht, please report to the Principal's office.

723
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,460
Addison Schacht to the Principal's office.

724
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,790
That's it, Addison. Last chance.

725
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,030
What happened?

726
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,960
They're suspending me for a week.

727
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,160
What?

728
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,070
Because they looked in my locker for posters and they found Kevin's file.

729
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,540
Okay. Well, what are you going to do about it?

730
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,140
Now I've got nothing to lose.

731
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,940
Addison, they didn't expel you, okay?

732
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,140
Just go home and... And chill out.

733
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,880
They might not put it on your record.

734
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,430
A suspect was arrested on Thursday

735
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,120
in connection to a separate robbery.

736
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,860
Sunday morning at 4:30,

737
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,490
violence was unleashed downtown on a taxi driver.

738
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,830
In other news tonight,

739
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,730
police are still looking for leads

740
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,500
in the case of slain Kennedy High School student Kevin Broadus,

741
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,100
whose killer fled the scene on a red Honda motorcycle.

742
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,770
-Hi. -Hi.

743
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,010
Um, is Addison home?

744
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,680
No. Well, he should be, but no, he's not.

745
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,710
Phoebe?

746
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,950
-Yeah. -Oh!

747
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,880
-Hi. -Hi.

748
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Well, why don't you come in? Yeah, yeah.

749
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,080
Come on in.

750
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,560
Yeah, okay. Um...

751
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,660
Don't mind me. It's chili night, and things tend to get out of control.

752
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,030
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

753
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,100
So, how are you doing?

754
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,270
Um...

755
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm okay. You know, considering everything.

756
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,740
Yeah, I'm sure.

757
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,740
Do you want to sit down? Yeah.

758
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,450
Sure. I don't mind standing, though, it's...

759
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,040
Here.

760
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,980
No...

761
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,750
Some of this stuff out of the way here.

762
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,750
Don't mind the mess.

763
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,990
It's okay.

764
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,590
How's your mom?

765
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,290
-You've known her for a while, right? -Mmm-hmm.

766
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,060
Yeah, since... Well, since she first came to Washington.

767
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,300
That's almost 20 years now.

768
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,130
Was she always so...

769
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,040
I don't know, like that?

770
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,610
Your mom's a perfectionist.

771
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,080
But she's had to work real hard to get where she's at,

772
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,210
and you seem to be turning out pretty good.

773
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,920
How do you think Addy's doing?

774
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,620
I don't know actually.

775
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,160
You know, I hope he's okay.

776
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,000
Addy?

777
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,270
-Hey, Dad. -Hey.

778
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,070
I saved some chili.

779
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,810
Uh, I'm not really hungry. I'm just gonna go to my room.

780
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,210
Hi, Addy.

781
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,050
What are you doing here?

782
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,320
Oh, we're just having some ice cream. Want some?

783
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,920
Just waiting on you.

784
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,360
Addison, come on!

785
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,760
Hey!

786
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,370
Addison?

787
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,300
Can I come in?

788
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,810
You have a nice little chat about me with my dad?

789
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,940
Come on, Addison.

790
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,080
Look, I'm just worried about you.

791
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,280
Well, if you came here to try to talk me out of doing anything crazy,

792
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,950
-don't bother. -That's not why I'm here.

793
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,950
I just came back from the police station.

794
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,060
And it was a complete waste of time.

795
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,790
I'm kidding myself.

796
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,390
No one's gonna solve this case,

797
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,100
and there's sure as shit nothing I can do about it.

798
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,040
All right. I heard something.

799
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,710
And I don't know if it's true or not,

800
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,710
but I've thought about it and I can't not tell you.

801
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,810
-What? -You can't overreact, all right?

802
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,350
Because I don't even know if it means anything yet.

803
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,660
I'm just giving you the information.

804
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,180
Yeah, what is it?

805
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,820
The guy was white.

806
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,250
The guy who killed Kevin.

807
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,860
Bo saw him. He said he was white.

808
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,330
What do you think, it was a race thing?

809
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,930
I don't know. Honestly, I don't think so.

810
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,000
Bo said that Kevin was hanging around with some pretty dangerous people.

811
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,170
Who?

812
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,970
Do you remember that kid Noel?

813
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,480
Fat Noel from eighth grade?

814
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,880
Yeah. That's who Kevin was hanging around with.

815
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,040
Phoebe, just because Noel listened to gangster rap when we were younger

816
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,780
doesn't make him dangerous.

817
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,380
All right, Addison. Well, look, that's what Bo told me.

818
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,620
He said Kevin was mixed up with some pretty heavy people.

819
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,020
So there. I told you.

820
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,420
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

821
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,320
Um, do you have Noel's number?

822
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:06,790
Why would I have Noel's number?

823
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,790
I don't... I don't know.

824
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,770
Do you think, um... Do you think Noel still has a Facebook?

825
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,970
Okay, so it's Tuesday night, around 11:15.

826
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,340
We're on our way to see our old friend Noel.

827
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,310
Earlier tonight, Phoebe told me that he might know something

828
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,110
about what happened to Kevin.

829
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,410
So, he invited us to this address, 267 Otis Street.

830
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,480
Um, this is... This is Otis Street here.

831
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,180
Wait, who are these guys? Maybe this is it.

832
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,050
I don't think this is it.

833
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,790
Oh, no, no, no. We're good. We're good.

834
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,360
Addison, this is super sketchy.

835
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,930
If they see that we're, you know, stressed out,

836
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,130
they're gonna think it's weird.

837
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,930
Just, you know, stay calm.

838
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,460
-Shit! Shit! Shit! -Go! Go!

839
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, my God!

840
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,970
Why the hell are we down here?

841
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,270
Just give me the address. What's the address again?

842
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,840
Addison, why are you turning...

843
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,070
No, that's it. That should be it.

844
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,440
There? That's an alleyway.

845
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Relax, okay? It's gonna be fine.

846
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,040
I'm not gonna relax.

847
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,810
It's gonna be fine. We know him.

848
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,380
-We don't know Noel. -Yes, we do!

849
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,080
We went to school with him for so long!

850
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,020
-You saw Noel five years ago. -Five, so what?

851
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,290
-Five years ago. -Do you see where we are right now?

852
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:07,920
Fine. You can wait in the car then.

853
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,020
No way. I'm not doing that.

854
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,330
Is this really where Noel's friend lives?

855
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,030
What's his name again?

856
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,970
He said to ask for some guy named D. Cash.

857
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,280
Yo, you got visitors.

858
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,450
Come on in.

859
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,150
Take your hands out your pockets, man. You're making me nervous.

860
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,420
-So, you're Addison. -Yeah.

861
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,160
-I'm D. -Hey, man. Good to meet you.

862
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,430
What's your name, baby? Who is this?

863
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,500
You brought me a little gift right here?

864
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,300
I'm Phoebe.

865
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,300
-Phoebe. -Yeah.

866
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,400
-You want to have some fun? -I'm okay.

867
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,410
She's with me, man.

868
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,140
Mmm?

869
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,480
-I'm okay. -What'd you say?

870
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,080
She's... She's with me.

871
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,410
Man, I will slap your nose off your face, man.

872
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,050
Shut up, Addison.

873
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,320
Yeah, you heard her. You better shut up, dude.

874
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,320
All right.

875
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,960
Hey, your friend's here.

876
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,890
Noel, wake up, man.

877
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,000
Hey, get your ass up, Noel. They're here. Wake up.

878
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,230
Is that Noel?

879
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,130
Who's this bitch?

880
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,870
Hey man, it's Addison.

881
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,040
Addison, yeah. Good to see you, man.

882
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,380
You look like shit.

883
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,080
Well, sit down, man.

884
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,590
Uh, so, how you been, man?

885
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,590
You high already man. I'll take this. Put that shit down.

886
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,090
It's crazy, right?

887
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:55,260
It's been, like, five years, six years.

888
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,430
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

889
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,370
Well, um, the reason why I'm here

890
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,200
is because I wanted to ask you about something.

891
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,000
-Okay. Uh... -Uh...

892
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,540
The shooting in Northwest at Seven Stars.

893
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,950
I don't know if you know or not, but this kid Kevin Broadus,

894
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,580
who we know, he was the one who got killed.

895
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,520
Yeah, what are you asking me for?

896
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,260
Well, I... I heard, you know, you guys were hanging out.

897
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,230
So, what do you think happened?

898
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,100
I mean, we just heard that the guy who did it was white...

899
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Enough of this shit, man.

900
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,670
Enough.

901
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,670
Noel, you got this kid's number?

902
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,070
No.

903
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,670
I have a pager.

904
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,380
You got a pager.

905
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,310
Where you live, son?

906
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,180
Uh, we're actually from Philadelphia.

907
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,280
We're just visiting.

908
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,280
I know where he lives. You're still at the same place, right, Addy?

909
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,290
Yeah. Same place.

910
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,900
Good. I think you kids better get going, man. Get out of here.

911
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,120
No problem.

912
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,260
If we hear something, who knows?

913
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,130
Maybe we'll give you a call.

914
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,330
All right, white boy?

915
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,260
Okay. Thank you. I'll send him my number.

916
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,430
Get your ass home, man.

917
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,000
Why the hell would you tell them where you live?

918
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,740
Noel still thinks we live in Chevy Chase.

919
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,310
We used to be rich, remember?

920
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,080
Well, that's just great.

921
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,720
Phoebe. I'm really sorry.

922
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:23,450
-I don't want to hear it from you. -Okay? I... I am.

923
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,220
-I don't want to hear it! -Okay.

924
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,330
I need a break.

925
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,430
I can't keep doing this.

926
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,660
I can't be a part of this anymore.

927
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,610
Yeah, hello. Who is this?

928
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,780
Oh, yeah. Yes. This is he.

929
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,120
Yeah, no.

930
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,090
Thank you, sir, for calling.

931
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,760
Yes.

932
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,520
Okay.

933
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,190
Okay. I'll see you then.

934
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,360
Phoebe! Hi. I'm in here.

935
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,230
Listen, I'm hanging up, all right? Call me if you start to panic.

936
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,230
Bye.

937
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,800
-Good morning. -Hey.

938
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,500
Can we talk for a minute?

939
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:53,500
We can talk later. I gotta go.

940
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,480
It'll only take a minute.

941
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,640
Okay.

942
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,280
Well,

943
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,650
Addison Schacht's father called me last night.

944
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,820
Yeah?

945
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,350
It was kind of illuminating.

946
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,620
I have to admit. I didn't...

947
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,520
I hated the fact that he knows

948
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:16,400
more about what my own daughter is doing than I do.

949
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,430
Did you like it over there?

950
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,840
I mean, yeah.

951
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,700
I don't know, Mom. It was... It was fine.

952
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,200
Theo's a nice guy.

953
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,540
Yeah, he's a nice person.

954
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,840
It's true.

955
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,450
-Okay, well... -I just want to say that I'm... I'm...

956
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,680
What?

957
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,420
What I want to say is I apologize. I'm very sorry

958
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,830
for not listening to you.

959
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,600
Sincerely, my intention was to help.

960
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,310
I'm gonna head out. I love you, Mom. I gotta go.

961
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,740
I love you, too.

962
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,680
Okay.

963
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,820
Here we are.

964
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,690
Uh, 775 McKinley.

965
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,320
Kevin's house.

966
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,430
Uh...

967
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,900
Hi, Mr. Broadus.

968
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,770
You must be Addison.

969
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,770
Come inside.

970
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,290
Would you like something to drink?

971
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,920
I'm okay. Thank you.

972
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,460
So,

973
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,890
you're a friend of Kevin's?

974
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,400
Yeah, I'd definitely say we were friends.

975
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,230
Enough of a friend to go to all this trouble?

976
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,570
Sorry to be blunt, but the fact is we'd like to know

977
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,470
why you're taking such an interest.

978
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,210
Do you think the police aren't doing their job?

979
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,920
-But... -Then why are you so interested?

980
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,790
Well, I...

981
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:29,300
I guess it just doesn't really make any sense why anyone would want to kill Kevin.

982
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,940
Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my dad. I'll turn it off.

983
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,680
Walter?

984
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,250
Come with me.

985
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,720
Come with me.

986
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,520
Walter.

987
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,970
My son valued his privacy.

988
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,000
He kept us out of here for the last year.

989
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,900
We had to break the locks.

990
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,710
Then when my wife could finally face coming in here...

991
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,450
She had to find this.

992
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,020
Open it.

993
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
Open it!

994
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,490
What is this?

995
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,690
You want a reason?

996
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,630
-There's your reason. -What is that?

997
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,360
-Look at me! -I don't know what that is!

998
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,530
-Why do you have a pager? -What?

999
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,660
-Are you a dealer? -No.

1000
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,030
Were you supplying my son?

1001
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,470
-No. Absolutely not! -Tell me!

1002
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:42,600
Walter, stop!

1003
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,640
Please.

1004
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,670
Stop! Please!

1005
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:57,890
What do you want from us, Addison?

1006
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,520
You want to know why my son was killed?

1007
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,330
I don't know why.

1008
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,530
But maybe we're just going to have to learn to live with that.

1009
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,940
I'm so sorry.

1010
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,680
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make it worse.

1011
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,060
# It's a god-awful small affair

1012
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,930
# To the girl with the mousy hair

1013
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:45,060
# But her mummy is yelling "No"

1014
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,430
# And her daddy has told her to go

1015
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,500
# But her friend is nowhere to be seen

1016
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:57,610
# Now she walks through her sunken dream

1017
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:01,750
# To the seat with the clearest view

1018
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,950
# And she's hooked to the silver screen

1019
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,950
# But the film is a saddening bore

1020
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,920
# For she's lived it ten times or more

1021
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:18,060
# She could spit in the eyes of fools

1022
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,970
# As they ask her to focus on

1023
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:25,570
# Sailors fighting in the dance hall

1024
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:29,110
# Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go

1025
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,980
# It's the freakiest show

1026
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,050
# Take a look at the lawman

1027
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,150
# Beating up the wrong guy

1028
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,930
# Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know

1029
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,430
# He's in the best-selling show

1030
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,570
# Is there life on Mars?

1031
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,170
-Ni hao. -Ni hao.

1032
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,580
Uh, Phoebe's been... Has early acceptance into Yale next year.

1033
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,780
Um, excuse me.

1034
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,990
-Hi. -Hey.

1035
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,120
-Hi. What's going on? -I need to talk to you.

1036
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,060
-Addy, this is a really bad time. -I need to talk to you.

1037
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,630
Shit. Okay, just come on.

1038
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:28,030
Addy, what? What's up?

1039
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,700
I just came back from Kevin's house.

1040
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,500
You know he was into drugs? Like, serious drugs?

1041
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,740
-Wait, what? -Yeah.

1042
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,610
I don't know. Maybe that's what Strauss meant by "emotional difficulties."

1043
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,010
Phoebe.

1044
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,780
Uh, hey.

1045
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,620
I'm sorry, Mom. Just one second.

1046
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,790
-Addy, I gotta go. I... -Wait. I just...

1047
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,230
Phoebe! Please.

1048
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,260
Addy, what is it?

1049
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:03,270
You know, I never told you what happened that day with my mom.

1050
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,970
No.

1051
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,740
She was fine.

1052
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,550
Nothing was wrong with her.

1053
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,250
That morning, we were having breakfast,

1054
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,590
and then I went to school, and when I came back she was...

1055
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,220
It's okay.

1056
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,930
She was still sitting in the same seat where I left her.

1057
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:35,040
At the hospital, they told us that she'd had an aneurysm.

1058
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,270
Then,

1059
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,770
last week, we see Kevin at the coffee shop.

1060
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,840
-He gave us our coffee. -Addison.

1061
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,080
He gave me back my book.

1062
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,610
It's not the same thing.

1063
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,920
Yes. It is.

1064
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,780
It is the same thing.

1065
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,860
He was fine, too.

1066
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,260
Don't you understand, Phoebe?

1067
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
I couldn't do anything about her.

1068
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,960
Addison.

1069
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,140
I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to solve something that can't be solved.

1070
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,740
Addison.

1071
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:59,180
Addison. Uh...

1072
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,290
Man, give me the damn phone.

1073
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,950
Yo, it's D.

1074
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,320
We got something you might want to know, man.

1075
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,990
Meet us in an hour.

1076
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,740
Hey. No alcohol for minors.

1077
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,950
No, we're good. Kid's with me.

1078
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:37,120
So, where's the girl at?

1079
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,960
You said you got something for me?

1080
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,730
We got something for you. It's right here.

1081
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:49,230
Just little errands, man. No big deal.

1082
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,370
Look, you do this for us, you get a name. That simple.

1083
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:57,940
Are you kidding me? I'm not... I'm not gonna do that.

1084
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,010
Do I look like I'm kidding, hmm?

1085
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,420
Hmm? Okay, well, you don't want to know nothing, man. I'm out of here.

1086
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,150
Go back.

1087
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,320
Hold on.

1088
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,430
Thatta boy. Yeah.

1089
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,030
Now we talking.

1090
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,730
You're saying if I do this for you,

1091
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,970
you're going to tell me who killed Kevin Broadus?

1092
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,170
No.

1093
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:29,240
But I will tell you the guy who knows the guy who did it.

1094
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,480
Okay. And...

1095
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,110
Where do I have to take it?

1096
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:37,250
Back to your neighborhood.

1097
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,220
We can't go down there, man.

1098
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,050
Not in Chevy.

1099
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:43,850
Police would be on our ass so tough. Sniff us out.

1100
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,260
But a kid like you?

1101
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,390
Golden.

1102
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,100
Yeah, and crispy.

1103
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,300
No. I'm gonna need a little more info.

1104
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,430
I told you. I told you. Addy's a quick learner, man.

1105
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,370
He's a quick learner. He ain't even got hair on his nuts.

1106
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,840
Look at him.

1107
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,310
Give him... Give him a taste.

1108
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,070
Give him a taste. Okay. Let me tell you.

1109
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,840
There's a guy, you know. He comes down, hangs out sometimes.

1110
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,450
Smack dealer from Maryland.

1111
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,250
He's out of his mind. He's...

1112
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,450
You know, he comes into D.C. and he parties at the clubs.

1113
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,520
-That's what he likes to do. -Yeah.

1114
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,700
And according to our friend, Kevin was down there to buy some shit.

1115
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,320
So dealer was sitting in his big chair, you know.

1116
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,920
He's sitting in the room with all his homies at a table.

1117
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,460
You know, he see Kevin. He decides to pick on him a little bit.

1118
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,430
Nothing too serious.

1119
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,400
The next thing you know, Kevin went right back at the guy,

1120
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,130
and shit, man. Like he was going back and forth.

1121
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,470
It made the guy look bad.

1122
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,000
Bad. Real bad.

1123
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,070
This kid disrespected the wrong guy.

1124
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,170
Disrespected him, man. I don't even know what Kevin said,

1125
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,410
but he said something because he got a big laugh.

1126
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,850
I mean, he... He signed his own death warrant. Shit.

1127
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,920
When... When was this?

1128
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,190
A couple of days before he got shot.

1129
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,360
You're saying that all he did

1130
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,100
was say the wrong thing to the wrong guy?

1131
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:02,170
Wrong damn thing, man.

1132
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,240
Oh, my God.

1133
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,620
Addison?

1134
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,320
Alex?

1135
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,590
-Uh... -What the hell are you doing here?

1136
01:03:57,590 --> 01:03:59,020
Is this 27... I think I have the...

1137
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,020
Shit. Really?

1138
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,030
Alex, who is it?

1139
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,300
Uh, okay. Okay. Um...

1140
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,930
Just act normal like I left my sports bag at school

1141
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,000
and you're dropping it off as a favor.

1142
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,430
This for you?

1143
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,040
Just give it to me for God's sake.

1144
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,340
All right. Thank you. Bye!

1145
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,210
No, you're funny. Get the hell out of here. Go. All right.

1146
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,310
See you later!

1147
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,620
Hey, D. I did it. What's the name?

1148
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,320
What name? What are you talking about, man?

1149
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,190
Come on, D. What's the name? We had a deal.

1150
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,320
Don't rush me, man.

1151
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,090
Now, the guy we told you about, his name is Mike.

1152
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,930
Mike Lorriner.

1153
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:40,000
He was there when Kevin got into it with that dealer.

1154
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,720
And what's the address?

1155
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,270
-Hey. -Phoebe! Phoebe. Mike Lorriner.

1156
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,440
Write this down, okay? Mike Lorriner. 9756 Fork Lute Road.

1157
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:54,680
This is the guy who knows who did it. D. just told me.

1158
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,610
Okay. So you already called the police, right?

1159
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,480
No, no, no. It's fine. I'm just gonna go talk to him.

1160
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,250
Addison, don't be stupid. Do not go there.

1161
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,350
Just give the police the address and let them go.

1162
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,350
-Phoebe, I got it covered. -Addison!

1163
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,110
Hey.

1164
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,150
Uh, hi. Are you Mike Lorriner?

1165
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,180
-Who are you? -Um...

1166
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:43,550
I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother you, but...

1167
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,220
I heard that you knew something about what happened in D.C.

1168
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,730
a few days ago.

1169
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:51,230
You know, the kid who got shot at the coffee shop.

1170
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,530
D.C.? I don't know anything, man.

1171
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,200
It's about Kevin Broadus.

1172
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Uh, he was a friend of mine.

1173
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,670
I don't know what you're talking about, man. Get out of here.

1174
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:02,270
I heard that he pissed off a drug dealer or something, and you...

1175
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,270
Do you know the guy?

1176
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,540
I don't know, I just... I just... What did I just say to you?

1177
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,350
Did you hear me?

1178
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,580
I... I said, I... I... I don't know nothing.

1179
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,580
-All right? Now... Now just get... -All right.

1180
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:15,120
Get off my property.

1181
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,520
Okay. Sorry, man. I'll go. I'm leaving.

1182
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,790
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Who... Who gave you my name?

1183
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,800
Who... Who told you to come here?

1184
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,700
I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay?

1185
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,430
Of course it was a mistake.

1186
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:30,540
Who told you?

1187
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:34,570
Uh...

1188
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,410
This guy I know, D. Cash. He just... He said that you were there when...

1189
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:39,140
D. Cash? D. Cash gave you my name?

1190
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,210
Yeah.

1191
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:44,580
Okay.

1192
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,380
Uh...

1193
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,550
Okay. Well, you... You... You tell D. Cash

1194
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,120
that he probably shouldn't be running his mouth.

1195
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,520
-You got it? -Okay.

1196
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,500
I'm gonna just go now. Okay?

1197
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,660
Whoa, what... What is that?

1198
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,600
What is that light?

1199
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,670
Are you... are you filming this?

1200
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:10,280
My man. Are we making a movie?

1201
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,120
Well, I... I guess I'm ready for my close-up.

1202
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,280
Look, man.

1203
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,680
If you don't know anything, it's fine. I can just leave.

1204
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:22,550
Do you think I will not use this?

1205
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,330
Bang!

1206
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:29,800
That was pretty good, huh?

1207
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:37,230
You don't even know who that dealer was, do you?

1208
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,870
The one your boy Kevin pissed off.

1209
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,840
That was D., you idiot.

1210
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,180
Oh, he played you.

1211
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:54,420
See, now I'm in a spot.

1212
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,450
Uh, you know, I... I...

1213
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,190
I did that ungrateful asshole a favor.

1214
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,730
And this is the thanks I get?

1215
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:13,210
Well, fuck the both of you.

1216
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,610
Why is that? Well, question seven on the application asks you

1217
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,750
to tell them what your best and worst qualities are,

1218
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,520
but they only give you three-and-a-half inches.

1219
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,090
Three-and-a-half inches on a page.

1220
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,550
I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more

1221
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:36,990
than three-and-a-half inches.

1222
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,720
So I decided to write a few extra pages.

1223
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,490
How many?

1224
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,660
-Twenty-two to be exact. -Wow!

1225
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,670
I realize that might seem a bit excessive.

1226
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,030
It does.

1227
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,630
However, how are you expected

1228
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:47,830
to express the very essence of your being

1229
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,740
and your views on how insanely crazy this world is

1230
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,980
in such a tiny space on a page?

1231
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,010
He's fine.

1232
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,650
-He's very drowsy, but he's stable. -Okay.

1233
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:08,970
Yeah, he's going to be all right.

1234
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,660
Well...

1235
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,990
Hi. Sorry. He's asking for Phoebe.

1236
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,530
Okay.

1237
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:28,340
Hmm.

1238
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,010
You want some coffee or something?

1239
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,480
Coffee? No.

1240
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,890
Phoebe's here.

1241
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,690
Thank you.

1242
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:52,760
Hi.

1243
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Hi.

1244
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,080
You smell nice.

1245
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,750
Did they find Lorriner?

1246
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,580
Yeah.

1247
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,490
They caught him. Somewhere in Virginia.

1248
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,660
He still had the gun on him, Addy.

1249
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,060
They think it's the same gun he used to kill Kevin.

1250
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,870
And they got D. Cash and Noel, too.

1251
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,070
The Broaduses know.

1252
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,940
They know who killed their son.

1253
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,610
You talked to them?

1254
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,010
Yeah, they came by.

1255
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,950
They left that letter for you.

1256
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,020
I'm still so mad at you.

1257
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,530
I know.

1258
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,700
I should thank you.

1259
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,630
Why?

1260
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,700
Because if it weren't for you, I'd probably be dead.

1261
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:08,870
Really? Because I totally thought you had it covered.

1262
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:23,910
Video Diary, day...

1263
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,880
I don't even know what day it is anymore.

1264
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,690
But guess what?

1265
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:30,950
Someone must have read those extra 22 pages

1266
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,090
because I got into Chicago.

1267
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:35,990
You know,

1268
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,030
these past few months I've come to realize

1269
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:41,130
that I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore.

1270
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,100
Because for the first time in a long time,

1271
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,510
I am really excited about the future.

1272
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,680
# Amazing grace, how sweet...

1273
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,150
But at the same time, it's never easy to say goodbye.

1274
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:06,060
# That saved a wretch like me

1275
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,830
# I once was lost

1276
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,600
# But now...

1277
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,660
Well, I'm...

1278
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm glad we could stay for that.

1279
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,300
Yeah.

1280
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,840
I can't believe we're leaving for college already.

1281
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,670
How do you feel?

1282
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:58,080
Well, you know, I just... I feel weird, I guess.

1283
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:10,690
What are your plans for the holidays?

1284
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,590
You think you'll be back?

1285
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:15,290
I don't know.

1286
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,970
-I'll... I'll walk you to the door. -Okay.

1287
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:36,780
-So... I guess... -Listen.

1288
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,120
I... I got you something.

1289
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,720
Maybe you can use it.

1290
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:38,050
Resynced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick.

1291
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:45,280
# Love me, love me love me, say you do

1292
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:55,820
# Let me fly away with you

1293
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:05,130
# For my love is like the wind

1294
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:11,070
# And wild is the wind

1295
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:17,280
# Wild is the wind

1296
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:24,980
# Like the leaf clings to the tree

1297
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:34,330
# Oh, my darling cling to me

1298
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:43,800
# For we're like creatures in the wind

1299
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,280
# And wild is the wind
