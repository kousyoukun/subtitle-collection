2
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,560
六年前的今天 我妈妈去世了
My mother died six months ago today.

3
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:08,233
我们在医院得知她得了动脉瘤
At the hospital, they told us she'd had an aneurysm.

4
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:14,506
我为她做不了什么
There was nothing I could do for her.

5
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:21,381
我现在已经很擅长伪装自己一切都好
I guess I've gotten pretty good at pretending to be okay.

6
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:39,228
这破玩意儿坏了吧
I don't think this stupid thing is even working.

7
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,564
你打开了吗
You turn it on?

8
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,666
当然打开了
Of course I turned it on.

9
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:45,502
你把镜头盖子去掉吗
Did you take the lens cap off?

10
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,338
这样就好了
Yeah, that probably would help.

11
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,738
Phoebe 你能...
Okay, Phoebe, can you just...

12
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,876
好的
Okay.

13
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:51,141
准备好了吗
Ready?

14
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,844
开拍
Rolling, and action.

15
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:56,345
视频日记 第18天
Video Diary, day 18.

16
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:59,650
今天是非常重要的一天
Now, today is an extremely important day.

17
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,451
为什么
Why?

18
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,586
因为这是我给芝加哥大学的申请资料
Because here is my application to the University of Chicago,

19
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,288
我希望秋天的时候去芝加哥大学学习古希腊古罗马文学
where I'm hoping to study Classics in the fall.

20
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,889
你有听说过网络吗
Have you ever heard of the Internet?

21
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,726
我知道现如今都是在网上提交申请
I know nowadays you can submit this stuff online,

22
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,495
但是我个人更喜欢传统的方式
but personally, I prefer the more traditional route.

23
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,398
你也看到了 这个信封非常厚
As you can see, this envelope is seriously thick.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,901
为什么呢
Why is that?

25
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,768
申请表上的第七个问题是
Well, question seven on the application asks you

26
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,504
说说你的优点和缺点
to tell them what your best and worst qualities are,

27
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,471
但是3.5英寸的空间
but they only give you three-and-a-half inches.

28
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:22,773
addy 看路
Addy, watch the road.

29
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,441
纸张上只有3.5英寸的空间
Three-and-a-half inches on a page.

30
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,243
抱歉 但是我的缺点好多的
I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more

31
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,710
那点儿地方根本不够
than three-and-a-half inches.

32
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,547
所以我就决定增加几页
So I decided to throw in a few extra pages.

33
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,780
你增加了多少
How many?

34
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,582
-整整22页  -哇
-Twenty-two to be exact. -Wow!

35
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,217
-我知道可能有点过分了  -没错
-I realize that might seem a bit excessive. -It does.

36
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,519
但是 那3.5英寸的空间太小了
However, how are you expected

37
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,924
根本就不够表达自我
to express the very essence of your being

38
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:41,726
这个世界这么疯狂 那点儿空间
and your views on how insanely crazy this world is

39
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,626
根本不够写
in such a tiny space on a page?

40
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,195
-太疯狂了  -好了 addy 闭嘴吧
-I mean, it's absurd. -Okay, Addy, shut up already.

41
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,496
那有个邮箱
There's a mailbox right there.

42
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:47,830
太棒了
Great.

43
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:50,500
Phoebe 你能拍下来这个吗
Phoebe? Can you please film this?

44
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,235
你有在拍吗
You're on me, right?

45
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,572
是的
Right.

46
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,874
这就是我们一直在等待的时刻
And now the moment we've all been waiting for.

47
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,741
我知道你对这一刻是很激动的 Phoebe
I know it's a moment you're very excited about, Phoebe.

48
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,210
没错吧
You're very excited about this, aren't you?

49
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,612
我只想去买咖啡啊
I'm excited to get some coffee.

50
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,413
放邮箱里了
Just put it in the box already.

51
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:04,815
好了 给我相机
Okay, give me the camera.

52
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,486
天哪 他还没完事儿
Oh, Jesus, he's still not done.

53
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:10,554
开始吧
Do it.

54
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:11,655
让开
Hey! Move it!

55
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,490
知道吗
You know what?

56
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,758
我不是很担心增加的那么多页
No. I'm not too worried about the extra pages

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,762
因为古罗马诗人维吉尔不是说过吗
because wasn't it Virgil who said,

58
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,630
"勇者得财"
"Fortune sides with him who dares"?

59
00:03:20,632 --> 00:03:26,369
或者更恰当的说法是 大卫 鲍伊的不朽名言
Or perhaps even more apropos are the immortal words of David Bowie,

60
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:28,604
我不知道我将去往哪里
"I don't know where I'm going from here,

61
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:31,578
但是我保证旅途不会舞曲
"but I promise it won't be boring."

62
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,513
招生人员才不会读你那22页的东西呢 Addison
They're never going to read 22 extra pages, Addison.

63
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:38,881
我们没有早早地进入耶鲁大学 Phoebe
Well, for those of us who didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe,

64
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,987
所以当然要更努力一点
we have to put in a little extra effort.

65
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,989
两中杯美式咖啡
Two medium Americanos.

66
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,356
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

67
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,524
去你的 Brandon
Add... Screw you, Brandon.

68
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,427
你真的要跟这家伙在一起吗
Are you seriously with this guy?

69
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,461
你真的觉得我在乎你怎么想吗
Do you seriously imagine I give a shit what you think?

70
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,763
但是整个学校的人都觉得你疯了 居然...
Yeah, but the whole school thinks you lost your mind, so...

71
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,466
-Kevin 两中杯美式咖啡  -好的
-Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos. -Got it.

72
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,536
-你要付钱吗  -不
-Are you going to pay for that? -Nope.

73
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,537
addison的两中杯美式咖啡马上好
Two medium Americanos for Addison coming right up.

74
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,873
-你好啊 兄弟  -你好啊
-What's going on, brother? -How you doing, man?

75
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,441
-很高兴见到你  -很高兴见到你
-Good to see you, man. -Good to see you.

76
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,443
-你读了吗  -嗯
-Did you read it, yet? -Oh!

77
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,345
什么 你怎么这么快
What? Dude, how are you so fast?

78
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,280
我不懂 你怎么想
I don't understand. What did you think?

79
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,982
等你把詹姆斯 鲍德温的书读了以后我们再说
We'll talk about it after you've read the James Baldwin.

80
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:13,684
拜托 老兄 我没有你那么快啦
Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you.

81
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,418
你们俩初吻过了吗
Oh... Have you guys had your first kiss yet?

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,353
还没有 我还在等
No, I'm waiting.

83
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,589
-是哦  -你真应该看看他
-Of course you would. -You should've seen this guy

84
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,490
前几天在哲学课上的表现
in philosophy class the other day,

85
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,925
他怼得Keneally老师哑口无言 太不可思议了
he nailed Miss Keneally to the wall. It was incredible.

86
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,493
-为什么  -因为她在讲什么
-Why? -Because she was giving a stupid lecture

87
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,394
学生为什么翘课
about why students cut class.

88
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,796
然后他回了一句 "就因为你 学生才翘课"
And he said, "You're the reason why students cut class."

89
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:29,733
-Kevin  -不 我说的是
-Kevin. -No. I said,

90
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,635
"Keneally老师那样的人就是学生翘课的原因"
"People like Miss Keneally are the reason kids cut class."

91
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,303
我开玩笑的
I was joking obviously.

92
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,805
他不是开玩笑 太大胆了
He wasn't joking. It was incredible.

93
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,707
不 她就是整个教育系统的毛病所在
No, she is what's wrong with the education system.

94
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,709
-老兄 我还得工作 好吗  -好的 好的
-Dude, I got to work. Okay? -Okay. Okay.

95
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,010
谢谢 很高兴见到你 Phoebe
Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs.

96
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,779
好的
You got it.

97
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,848
Kevin 你敢为大家说话 好样的
You stand up for the people, Kevin. You're a good man.

98
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,449
-给你 好的  -谢谢*
-Here you go. Sure. -Thanks.

99
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,685
Phoebe
Phoebe?

100
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,485
-嗯 怎么了  -他怎么样
-Huh? What's up? -How's he doing?

101
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,454
他挺好的
He's okay.

102
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,058
那稍后见
I'll see you later.

103
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:06,972
好冷
It's chilly.

104
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,543
-我能问你点东西吗  -嗯
-Can I ask you something? -Mmm?

105
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:16,779
我感觉你跟我在一起
I feel like you hanging out with me has, like,

106
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,582
不利于你跟学校里那些酷家伙的关系
a detrimental effect on your standing with the cool kids.

107
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,551
我们总是一起玩的 addison
We've always hung out, Addison.

108
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,054
不是的 我们从八年级才开始在一起
Not really. I mean, we haven't really since eighth grade.

109
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,057
我之前都像是隐形的*
I sort of went invisible there for a while.

110
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,658
好的 那也许是我发现高中的男生
Okay. Well, maybe it's because I find every guy in high school

111
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,798
全都无聊 太容易看透
to be completely dull and predictable.

112
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,066
为什么
And why is that?

113
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,769
他们太容易看透是因为他们只想跟你交往吗
Are they predictable because they want to hook up?

114
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,803
能听点音乐什么的吗
Can we just get some music or something?

115
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,505
等等 等等
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

116
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,074
我感觉你把我当中性人
I feel like you see me as somehow sexually neutral

117
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,512
中性这个词源于拉丁文 就是没有睾丸的意思
from the Latin "neuter," as in, without testicles.

118
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,714
我没有那样想你啦
No, I don't see you that way.

119
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,481
很抱歉告诉你 Phoebe
I hate to break it to you, Phoebe.

120
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:53,949
我不想让你失望
I don't want to disappoint you.

121
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,685
但是你猜怎么着
But guess what?

122
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,924
我想要的和其他人一样
I want what all the other guys want, too.

123
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,395
可以啊
That's okay.

124
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,529
真的吗
Really?

125
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,598
其实
Actually,

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,067
我最近也一直在想这个
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

127
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,140
现在可能也是时候告诉你了
And I guess now is as good a time as any to tell you.

128
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,146
我不想上大学的时候还是个...
I don't want to go off to college as a...

129
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,415
什么
As a what?

130
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,750
就是没有...
Without having, you know,

131
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:28,987
做啦
done it.

132
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,822
做什么
Done what?

133
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,856
去你的 addison
Screw you, Addison.

134
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,925
我想赶紧完事儿
I wanna get it over with.

135
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:41,964
好吗 我想跟一个让我觉得安全的人做
All right? I want to have sex with a guy who I feel safe around.

136
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,632
就是不会评判我的人
You know? Who won't judge me.

137
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:47,539
而且也是个处男
And who is definitely a virgin, too.

138
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,108
你是说我吗
You're talking about me?

139

00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,416
我找到那个盒子的时候

咖啡店里面或外面有什么异常吗

301
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:19,268
没有
Um, no.

302
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,569
-你还有什么想告诉我们吗  -是的
-Is there anything else you can tell us? -Yes.

跟大家一样
Like most of you probably,

00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,440
我也流泪
I wept a little,

320
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,441
祷告
I prayed a little.

321
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:36,847
老师们会怀念Kevin的勤奋
Kevin will be missed by the teachers for his diligence.

322
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,548
爵士乐队也会怀念他
He will be missed by the jazz band,

323
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,151
他是一名优秀的长号手

324
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,754
-是小号* 虽然都是铜管乐器  -是很多人的朋友
-Trumpet, but it's all brass. -A dear friend to many of you.

325
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,690
当然 最怀念他的肯定是他的父母
Mostly, he'll be missed by his loving parents.

326
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,324
抱歉
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:50,793
校长 很抱歉
Sir! I'm really sorry.

328
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,362
我不是想无礼或打断您
I didn't mean to be disrespectful or interrupt,

329
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,595
但是我有话要说
but I just had to say something

330
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:55,698
-很重要的  -addison
-that's really important. -Addison.

331
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,634
昨天 在事情发生之前 我在咖啡店见过Kevin
I saw Kevin at the coffee shop yesterday right before it happened.

332
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,436
其实 我和Phoebe都见过他
Actually, Phoebe and I both did.

333
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:03,405
听到新闻之后 我返回了咖啡店
And then after I heard the news, I went back to coffee shop,

334
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:06,609
那里的新闻人说
and one of the news crew guys told me that

335
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,179
他们会把整个故事写成是帮派仇杀
they're going to write this whole thing off as a gang killing.

336
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,680
也就是说警方可能跟不会追查凶手
Which means they probably won't even go after the guy who did it

337
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,315
因为他们真正破案的几率
because there's such a small chance

338
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,749
非常非常小
of them actually solving the case.

339
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,819
addison 请你坐下
Addison, could you sit down please?

340
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,255
凡是认识Kevin的人都会知道他不是黑帮的
I mean, if anyone here knew Kevin, they knew he wasn't in a gang.

341
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,722
addison 请坐 够了
Addison, please, enough.

342
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,225
我们应该好好谈谈这个
I think this is something we should talk about.

343
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,929
-为什么只有我为Kevin说话  -addison 够了 
-Why am I the only one saying anything? -Addison, please. 

344
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,628
我已经礼貌地请你坐下了 坐下
I've asked you politely. Sit down!

345
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,663
没人在乎吗
Does no one care?

346
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:29,198
我会认真听你说完 在我的办公室
I want to hear everything you have to say, in my office!

347
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,402
好吧
All right. Okay.

348
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,536
稍后去找我
See me later.

349
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,875
我们的心情很悲痛
Our emotions are raw.

350
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:43,211
在座的各位都很受伤
Everybody in this room is hurting.

351
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,279
你干什么啊
Really?

352
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,616
尊重是很重要的
Respect is important.

353
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,521
你怎么回事
So what's going on with you?

354
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,290
你什么意思 校长
What do you mean, sir?

355
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,497
听着 你最近的行为和态度
Look, there has been a marked deterioration of your behavior

356
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,235
有明显的恶化
and your attitude lately.

357
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,505
你还好吗
How are you doing?

358
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,904
我很好
I'm fine.

359
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,979
失去母亲是会造成重大打击 addison
Loss of a parent is a big deal, Addison.

360
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:18,383
这事和我妈妈无关 校长
This has nothing to do with my mother, sir.

361
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:22,317
好的
All right.

362
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,888
我建议你这么做...
Here's what I suggest you do.

363
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,523
别再那样找事儿
Cut the theatrics.

让警察去破案
Let the police do their job.

365

让你妈妈骄傲
Make your mother proud.

367
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,465
我会去跟芝加哥大学谈

368
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,003
告诉他们你是学校的宝贵资产
Tell them what an asset you are to the school.

369
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,318

我来找Thompson探长

378
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,680
警探
Hi, Detective.

379
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,713
你就是那个拿相机的孩子
So you're the kid with the camera.

380
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:26,548
是的
Yeah, that's right.

381
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,584
我们收到你的消息了
We've got your statement.

382
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,920
你说要补充信息
I understand that there's something that you'd like to add.

383
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:35,591
是的 你们知道Kevin Broadus不是黑帮的 对吧
Yeah. Um, you guys know that Kevin Broadus was not in a gang, right?

384
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,826
我们不知道
We don't know that.

385
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:39,795
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

386
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,631
嗯 我去过...
Um, well, I mean, I went to...

387
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,599
我跟他做朋友很久了
You know, I've been friends with him for a while,

388
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,602
我知道他不是黑帮的
and I know that he wasn't in a gang.

389
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:49,538
谁跟你们说他是黑帮成员的
Who told you that he was in a gang?

390
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,007
你不是说有信息要补充吗
I thought you came here to tell us something.

391
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:55,611
我来...只是想...我需要知道到底怎么回事
I mean, I am here... I just... I need to know what's going on.

392
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,747
我没时间搭理你 你来处理吧
I don't have time for this. Could you deal with this kid?

393
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,548
-好的  -长官 拜托了

我朋友刚刚被杀
My friend just got killed.

395
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:05,457

And you can't expect me just to sit around and not do anything about it, okay?

396
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,827
听着 孩子 我知道他是你朋友
Listen, son. I know he was your friend,

397

相信我 我们也像你一样 想赶紧抓住凶手
and believe me, we want to catch whoever did this just as much as you do,

398
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:20,670
但是现在 我们要处理辖区内的24起谋杀
but right now, we're dealing with 24 homicides in this district alone,

399
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,471
这还仅仅是过去两周发生的事
and that's just in the past two weeks.

400
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:25,874
抱歉 但是如果你没有新信息要补充
I'm sorry, but if you don't have anything new to tell us,

00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,415
你想谈谈吗 或者...
Do you want to talk about it? Or...

408
00:23:06,116 --> 00:23:08,083
警方已经下定决心了
The police have already made up their minds.

什么
What?

410
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,487
你可不知道
You don't know that.

411
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,988
Phoebe 前一秒我们还在跟他说话
Listen, Phoebe, one second we were talking to him,

412
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,556
后一秒他就走了 这完全讲不通啊
and the next he's gone. It just doesn't make any sense.

413
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:18,861
大家都继续各自生活 好像什么都没有发生一样
Everyone is just moving on like nothing happened.

You know, sometimes

418
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,976
坏事就那样发生了 就是那样而已 addy

有什么事吗
Can I help you?

425
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,509
嗯
Yeah.

426
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,979
Venderleun先生需要炭粉
Mr. Venderleun needs toner.

427
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:43,915
又要
Again?

428
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,048
你等一下
You wait here.

429
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,153
好的
Okay.

430
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:08,071
你告诉Venderleun这些东西
You tell Mr. Venderleun from me that these resources

431
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,239
是供全学校的 不是只给他的班用的
are for the entire school and not just for his class.

432
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,277
好 我会的 非常感谢
Okay, I will. Thank you so much.

433
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:33,728
上车 我有东西给你看
Hey! Hey, there's something... There's something I gotta show you.

434
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,065
我一会儿就要上汉语课了
I have Mandarin in, like, five minutes.

435
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,667
-汉语 别去了 这很重要的  -不行
-Mandarin? No. This is really important. -Yes. Look, I can't.

436
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,870
我上次翘课 为了跟你睡
I skipped it last time so I could sleep with you.

437
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,672
-今天必须得去了  -上车啦
-So I have to do it today. -Come on!

438
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:45,908
听着 这是Strauss女士的记录
Look. This is from Mrs. Strauss.

439
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,209
Kevin有情绪困扰的征兆
"Kevin has begun to show signs of emotional trouble.

440
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,179
他最近的成绩下滑也表明
"The recent slide in academic results suggest

441
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,615
他可能在经历一些重大的情感困难
"he may be dealing with significant emotional difficulties

442
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,584
在校外
"outside of school,

443
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:58,019
但是他不愿意在心理咨询室细说
"which he is reluctant to elaborate upon in our sessions."

444
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:59,688
天哪 addison
Christ, Addison.

445
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,157
你觉得这意味着什么
What do you think that means?

446
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,326
我不知道
I don't know.

447
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,594
我觉得我得跟Strauss聊聊
I think I should talk to Strauss.

448
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,995
说什么
And say what?

449
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,029
我偷了你的资料
"Hi, I stole your file,

450
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,099
希望你能给我详细解释一下
"and, you know, I would love if you could talk me through it"?

451
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,634
不 显然不是 但是这可能会带领我们发现一些东西
No, obviously not, but I think this could lead to something.

452
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:14,739
如果我们能弄清楚这一切呢
What if we could figure this out?

453
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:21,844
你在乎吗
Don't you even care?

454
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,679
这不是问题的重点
That's not what this is about.

455
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:26,015
Phoebe 拜托 我们...得...
Phoebe. Come on. We... Like...

456
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,884
我今天在体育馆外看到你贴的单子了
I saw your posters today outside of the gym.

457
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,986
-我把它们扯下来了  -什么 为什么
-I tore them down. -What? Why?

458
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:32,888
因为大家都在取笑你
'Cause, Addison, everyone's making fun of you.

459
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,890
-他们知道是你干的  -所以你因为我觉得很丢脸
-They know it's you. -So you're embarrassed by me?

460
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,057
不是啦 我没有
No, I'm not embarrassed by you.

461
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,726
可以跟我做爱
It's okay to have sex with me,

462
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,760
-但是却不让别人知道我们是朋友  -当然不是了
-but you don't want people to know we're friends? -Of course not!

463
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:41,631
我们当然是朋友
I mean, of course it's okay that we're friends.

464
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,364
听着 如果你觉得我丢脸 那就告诉我啊
Listen, if you're ashamed of me, just tell me, okay?

465
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,266
不是的 笨蛋
No, you idiot!

466
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:46,168
我觉得丢脸的是 虽然你很蠢
I did it because of in spite of how stupid you're being,

467
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,606
可我还是在乎你
I actually give a shit about you.

468
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,315
我能用用你的手机吗 这可能是线索
Um, can I borrow your phone? This could be a lead.

469
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:01,750
天哪
Jesus Christ.

470
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:04,019
快啦 让我用用你的手机
Come on! Let me borrow your phone.

471
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,034
-喂  -喂
-Hello? -Hello.

472
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,834
Addison
Addison?

473
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,939
Addison
Addis...

474
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,808
-谁啊  -不知道 他挂断了
-Who was it? -I don't know. They hung up.

475
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,813
Addison 你好像没明白 我也在经历这一切
Addison, you don't seem to realize that I'm going through this, too.

476
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,182
我也一直在想这事 但是...
And I can't stop thinking about it either, okay? But...

477
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,353
这事跟你无关
It's not about you.

478
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:41,759
你也无力改变什么
And there's nothing you can do to change it, okay?

479
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:45,997
我上课要迟到了 我得走了
Now I'm late for class. I gotta go.

480
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,257
你好 这里是Schacht一家
Hi, you've reached the Schacht family,

481
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,393
Sarah Theo和Addison
Sarah, Theo and Addison.

482
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:20,796
我们现在无法接电话
We can't come to the phone right now.

483
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,398
请留言 我们会尽快回电
So leave us a message, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

484
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,837
喂 我是肯尼迪高中的Karlstadt校长
Uh, hello. This is Principal Karlstadt at Robert Kennedy High.

485
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:34,209
如果可以 请明天8点30来一趟我办公室
I would like, if you can, for you to come in tomorrow at 8:30 into my office.

486
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:37,011
是紧急事件
It's a matter of some urgency.

487
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:39,114
家长和孩子就应该多联系
Parents and children should be in touch with each other.

488
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,451
我们有联系啊
We are in touch with each other.

489
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:42,217
用寻呼机联系
Through a pager.

490
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,219
他用我女儿的电话打电话
Except, he had to use my daughter's phone to call...

491
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:45,953
孩子都经常借电话用的
All kids borrow each other's phone all the time, don't they?

492
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,023
-他没有手机吗  -没有 怎么了
-He doesn't have a cell phone? -No. Is that a problem?

493
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:49,460
你为什么不给他买手机
Why didn't you get him a cell phone?

494
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:50,892
冷静 冷静
Okay, let's all calm down. Let's stay very calm.

495
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,460
我的意思是这...
It's not a problem. It's a matter of...

496
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,962
-是安全问题  -冷静 好吗
-It's a safety issue. -Could we calm down please?

497
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:55,963
我只是在想弄清楚这一切
I'm just trying to make sense of this.

498
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:59,468
他儿子愣生生地
So, his son has put himself

499
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,770
把自己扯进一桩谋杀案里
smack dab in the middle of a murder case.

500
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:03,271
-对吗  -嗯...
-Am I right? -Well...

501
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,140
我儿子是个好孩子 我可以这么说吗
Listen, my son is a good kid. Can I just say that?

502
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:06,475
他去年经历了太多事
I mean, he's been through a lot this last year.

503
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,142
是
Yes.

504
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:10,211
他失去了母亲 现在又失去了朋友
He's lost his mother and now he's lost a friend.

505
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:13,114
我的意思是 他只是想帮忙
What I'm trying to say is that I think he's just trying to help.

506
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,985
是 我不会让他儿子
Right. I am not gonna let his kid

507
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,987
威胁到我女儿的生命安全
jeopardize my daughter's life,

508
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,490
或是她的未来
nor her future for that matter.

509
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:23,091
好了 我们别说了
Okay. I'm gonna stop us right here.

510
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:27,062
现在是非常非常不稳定的时刻
This is a very, very precarious time for all of us.

511
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,462
我希望你们在跟孩子谈话的时候
So I'd like you to keep that in mind

512
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:31,199
谨记这一点
when you discuss this with your children.

513
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:32,901
好的 当然
Yes. Of course.

514
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,937
谢谢您找我们来 校长先生
Thank... Thank you for the meeting, Mr. Karlstadt.

515
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,806
很受教育 谢谢
It's been very educational. Thank you.

516
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:42,110
等你们跟孩子们聊过之后我再跟你们谈谈
Okay, I'll speak to you again after you talk to your children.

517
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:45,083
非常感谢 我今晚就跟他谈
Thank you very much. I'll talk with him tonight.

518
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,821
-嗨 美女  -嗨
-Hi, beautiful. -Hi.

519
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,222
你还好吗
You doing okay?

520
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,225
嗯 我没事
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

521
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,463
你那个混蛋男友是怎么回事
Um, so, what's up with your asshole boyfriend?

522
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,801
只是我听说了一些奇怪的事
It's just that I heard some weird stuff, that's all.

523
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,167
你想聊聊吗
Do you want to talk about it?

524
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,305
不 不用了
No. Not really.

525
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:10,440
哦 好的
Oh... Okay.

526
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:15,411
-Hi. -Hey.

527
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,046
Uh, could I have a word with you?

528
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,248
Yeah, what's up?

529
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,283
Can I talk to you in private?

530
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,285
Yeah. Sure. Um...

531
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:26,087
Hey, Alex, will you just watch my stuff? I'll be right back.

532
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,122
Yeah, sure.

533
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:28,257
Thanks.

534
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,057
I kind of wanted your advice.

535
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,192
Yeah?

536
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,864
Something to do with Kevin.

537
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,896
Yeah. Um...

538
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,835
I was in the coffee shop when it happened.

539
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,503
-Really? -Yeah.

540
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,875
I saw something, and I don't know if I should tell Addison.

541
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,076
Tell him what?

542
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,376
Addison.

543
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:50,312
Mrs. Strauss. Do you have a minute?

544
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:51,615
Sure. Come in.

545
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:54,449
The guy who killed Kevin was white.

546
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,085
I saw his wrist when he pushed the door open.

547
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:00,456
I know something was going on with Kevin before he died.

548
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,423
And I heard that you and him were talking

549
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:06,061
because he was going through some emotional difficulties.

550
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,330
So, what do you think it means?

551
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,565
I don't know, but I told the cops,

552
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,366
but I don't think they're looking in the right place.

553
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:14,335
Why?

554
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:16,438
I mean, I heard Kevin was hanging out with that kid Noel.

555
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,172
-Noel? -Yeah.

556
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:21,276
And I know he's mixed up with some heavy people.

557
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:22,577
They're dangerous.

558
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:24,647
What we talked about was confidential.

559
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,449
Just like the conversation we're having right now is confidential.

560
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,318
Yeah, of course.

561
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,154
But I just want to know if there's anything,

562
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:35,990
you know, if you had any idea of what was going on with him.

563
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:39,527
Addison, if you want to talk about how you feel about what's happened,

564
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:40,663
we can do that.

565
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,498
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

566
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,468
Look, just promise me you won't tell any of this to Addison.

567
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,069
Just not right now, okay?

568
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:50,340
Yeah. Okay.

569
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,476
-Thanks, Bo. -Yeah. I'll see you.

570
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,512
Yeah.

571
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,345
I was at your school today.

572
00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:02,386
And I was catching a lot of shit about you.

573
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:04,956
About this.

574
00:32:06,957 --> 00:32:08,559
What's up with this, hmm?

575
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,462
What's going on?

576
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,667
Addison?

577
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:21,138
Remember that day

578
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,506
that Kevin was killed?

579
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,307
Yeah.

580
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,378
I drove back to the coffee shop after it happened.

581
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,516
That's why I didn't call you.

582
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,382
Okay.

583
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,049
And I...

584
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,652
I saw his body.

585
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:40,357
Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like, I saw them wheel him out.

586
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,392
Here's this kid.

587
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,193
He gets murdered,

588
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:47,697
and no one cares.

589
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,498
That's not true, Addy. You know that's not true.

590
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,999
No, it is! That's what it seems like.

591
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:53,136
People care. They do. They just...

592
00:32:54,403 --> 00:32:56,404
Will you just do me a favor?

593
00:32:56,406 --> 00:32:59,306
Just stop this nonsense. This is... This is crazy, Addison.

594
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,543
It's not nonsense. I'm just trying to do something good.

595
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:05,180
Yeah, I... I understand, I think I do, what you're trying to do.

596
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,583
But this is a murder investigation.

597
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,284
You don't know what could happen.

598
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,053
Nothing's gonna happen!

599
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,025
Well, I couldn't take it if anything did happen to you.

600
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,661
Just...

601
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:22,230
If you can't do it for me,

602
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:23,634
do it for her.

603
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:26,334
All right?

604
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,471
Yeah.

605
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:41,316
Video Diary. Day 23.

606
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,184
I don't know, maybe my dad's right.

607
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,454
Maybe I'm not thinking straight.

608
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,294
Maybe I shouldn't forget about the rest of my life.

609
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,297
Phoebe!

610
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,631
Hey.

611
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:58,199
What's up?

612
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,202
Hi.

613
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:03,807
What?

614
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:13,648
Look. So, I know the other night was purely a practical thing for you.

615
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,719
And, you know, I have nothing to compare it to,

616
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,454
except for maybe porn and stuff.

617
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,358
But I just have to say

618
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,094
that it really was sensational,

619
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,597
in the original meaning of the word.

620
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,736
And I have a strong and overwhelming desire

621
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,438
to do it again.

622
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,575
That's bad, huh?

623
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:43,547
Well, you know,

624
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:49,351
when I woke up this morning, I...

625
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,690
I looked over at the pillow where your head had been.

626
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:54,722
Uh...

627
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:55,726
And I...

628
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,565
And I kind of wished it was still there.

629
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,673
I don't know, we're probably

630
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,775
-just romanticizing it. -Romanticizing it. Yeah. That's classic.

631
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,412
But, uh...

632
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:19,548
Maybe if we did it again...

633
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,818
What? It might break the spell?

634
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,287
That works.

635
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,255
-Should we... -Yeah.

636
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:28,358
Okay.

637
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:33,327
Are you sure your dad's not home?

638
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,162
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

639
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:37,566
He's out shooting bridges for a Belgian tourist brochure.

640
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,670
Long way from the Washington Post, huh?

641
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,411
What?

642
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:52,748
That... That was pretty good. Right?

643
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,849
I mean, what do you think?

644
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,586
Better, same?

645
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,457
Worse?

646
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:03,525
Not worse, but...

647
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,360
Okay.

648
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,932
I mean, the spell is definitely broken.

649
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,467
Yeah.

650
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:14,605
Really?

651
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,515
No, Addy.

652
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,619
I want you to hold me.

653
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,769
Is it just a one-time thing? I mean, like...

654
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:50,405
I mean, if we do do this again, which I hope we will,

655
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:54,912
I mean, like, do you want to usually do the holding afterwards or beforehand?

656
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,982
Usually afterwards, I'm guessing. That's good.

657
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,284
I'm just curious, you know.

658
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,454
-I want to be... -Shut up.

659
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,224
Okay.

660
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:11,260
Okay. Um...

661
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,997
So, what? I guess we just keep...

662
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,796
We keep doing this until the feeling wears off?

663
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:18,365
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

664
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:19,469
Okay.

665
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,740
How are you getting home?

666
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:28,411
I'm gonna grab a cab. Don't worry about it. It's fine, okay?

667
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:35,784
Hi.

668
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,887
Hey.

669
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,021
I brought dinner.

670
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,956
Um, I already ate actually, but thank you.

671
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,423
Okay.

672
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:44,728
How was your trip?

673
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:46,830
Good.

674
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:49,966
How was class?

675
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,633
Fine.

676
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:56,537
I learned five more ways to say "hello."

677
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:59,307
It was eventful.

678
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,778
Should we talk about Addison Schacht?

679
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,579
Wow!

680
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,715
-You really have people everywhere, huh? -Really?

681
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,483
Addison Schacht. Okay.

682
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:09,851
What?

683
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,720
What's the problem?

684
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,856
We moved up the hill and they moved down.

685
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,557
I went in to your school yesterday,

686
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,063
and I had a meeting with Karlstadt.

687
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:23,565
He told me about Addison's so-called "investigation"

688
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,534
into the Broadus murder and your involvement in it.

689
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,637
I'm not involved in it.

690
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,740
He's a friend of mine. That's it.

691
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:33,675
So he's just a friend, huh?

692
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,046
What does it matter?

693
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,979
What do you have against him?

694
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,048
It's not his fault that his life has been so shitty.

695
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,583
His mom died.

696
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,351
I'm not talking about his mother dying.

697
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:46,722
I'm talking about you pulling this shit with your friend.

698
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,490
And I just don't want you to get involved in something

699
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:52,028
that will most definitely hurt you.

700
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,827
Addison Schacht, please report to the Principal's office.

701
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:02,432
Addison Schacht to the Principal's office.

702
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,769
That's it, Addison. Last chance.

703
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,003
What happened?

704
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:09,938
They're suspending me for a week.

705
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,139
What?

706
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,041
Because they looked in my locker for posters and they found Kevin's file.

707
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,513
Okay. Well, what are you going to do about it?

708
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:21,115
Now I've got nothing to lose.

709
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,916
Addison, they didn't expel you, okay?

710
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:26,119
Just go home and... And chill out.

711
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:28,858
They might not put it on your record.

712
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,197
A suspect was arrested on Thursday

713
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,095
in connection to a separate robbery.

714
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,831
Sunday morning at 4:30,

715
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,467
violence was unleashed downtown on a taxi driver.

716
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:40,802
In other news tonight,

717
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:42,702
police are still looking for leads

718
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:45,472
in the case of slain Kennedy High School student Kevin Broadus,

719
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:48,075
whose killer fled the scene on a red Honda motorcycle.

720
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,744
-Hi. -Hi.

721
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:25,981
Um, is Addison home?

722
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,653
No. Well, he should be, but no, he's not.

723
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,686
Phoebe?

724
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:32,920
-Yeah. -Oh!

725
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:34,856
-Hi. -Hi.

726
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:36,858
Well, why don't you come in? Yeah, yeah.

727
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,059
Come on in.

728
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,530
Yeah, okay. Um...

729
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:48,637
Don't mind me. It's chili night, and things tend to get out of control.

730
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,005
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

731
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:53,077
So, how are you doing?

732
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,242
Um...

733
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:58,679
I'm okay. You know, considering everything.

734
00:41:58,681 --> 00:41:59,717
Yeah, I'm sure.

735
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,717
Do you want to sit down? Yeah.

736
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:06,019
-Sure. I don't mind standing, though, it's... -Here.

737
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:07,956
No...

738
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,724
Some of this stuff out of the way here.

739
00:42:10,726 --> 00:42:12,726
Don't mind the mess.

740
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:13,961
It's okay.

741
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,563
How's your mom?

742
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:18,268
-You've known her for a while, right? -Mmm-hmm.

743
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:22,036
Yeah, since... Well, since she first came to Washington.

744
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,271
That's almost 20 years now.

745
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:28,108
Was she always so...

746
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,012
I don't know, like that?

747
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:33,581
Your mom's a perfectionist.

748
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,050
But she's had to work real hard to get where she's at,

749
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:39,189
and you seem to be turning out pretty good.

750
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:43,891
How do you think Addy's doing?

751
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,594
I don't know actually.

752
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,132
You know, I hope he's okay.

753
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,973
Addy?

754
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,242
-Hey, Dad. -Hey.

755
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,043
I saved some chili.

756
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:05,780
Uh, I'm not really hungry. I'm just gonna go to my room.

757
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:07,184
Hi, Addy.

758
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,025
What are you doing here?

759
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:19,293
Oh, we're just having some ice cream. Want some?

760
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,897
Just waiting on you.

761
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:24,335
Addison, come on!

762
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,738
Hey!

763
00:43:33,108 --> 00:43:34,344
Addison?

764
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:37,278
Can I come in?

765
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:41,782
You have a nice little chat about me with my dad?

766
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,918
Come on, Addison.

767
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,054
Look, I'm just worried about you.

768
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,255
Well, if you came here to try to talk me out of doing anything crazy,

769
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,925
-don't bother. -That's not why I'm here.

770
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,927
I just came back from the police station.

771
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,032
And it was a complete waste of time.

772
00:43:58,601 --> 00:43:59,766
I'm kidding myself.

773
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:01,369
No one's gonna solve this case,

774
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,074
and there's sure as shit nothing I can do about it.

775
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:13,014
All right. I heard something.

776
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:16,684
And I don't know if it's true or not,

777
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:19,688
but I've thought about it and I can't not tell you.

778
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,789
-What? -You can't overreact, all right?

779
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,324
Because I don't even know if it means anything yet.

780
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,427
I'm just giving you the information.

781
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,159
Yeah, what is it?

782
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,795
The guy was white.

783
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,229
The guy who killed Kevin.

784
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,835
Bo saw him. He said he was white.

785
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,302
What do you think, it was a race thing?

786
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:38,907
I don't know. Honestly, I don't think so.

787
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,976
Bo said that Kevin was hanging around with some pretty dangerous people.

788
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:43,144
Who?

789
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,948
Do you remember that kid Noel?

790
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:47,451
Fat Noel from eighth grade?

791
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,851
Yeah. That's who Kevin was hanging around with.

792
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,019
Phoebe, just because Noel listened to gangster rap when we were younger

793
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:53,755
doesn't make him dangerous.

794
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,356
All right, Addison. Well, look, that's what Bo told me.

795
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,461
He said Kevin was mixed up with some pretty heavy people.

796
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:58,992
So there. I told you.

797
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:01,396
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

798
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,298
Um, do you have Noel's number?

799
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,766
Why would I have Noel's number?

800
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,769
I don't... I don't know.

801
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,740
Do you think, um... Do you think Noel still has a Facebook?

802
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:15,943
Okay, so it's Tuesday night, around 11:15.

803
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:18,313
We're on our way to see our old friend Noel.

804
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,282
Earlier tonight, Phoebe told me that he might know something

805
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:23,083
about what happened to Kevin.

806
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:27,387
So, he invited us to this address, 267 Otis Street.

807
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:30,458
Um, this is... This is Otis Street here.

808
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,159
Wait, who are these guys? Maybe this is it.

809
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,028
I don't think this is it.

810
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,762
Oh, no, no, no. We're good. We're good.

811
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:37,331
Addison, this is super sketchy.

812
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,900
If they see that we're, you know, stressed out,

813
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,101
they're gonna think it's weird.

814
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:41,903
Just, you know, stay calm.

815
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:44,438
-Shit! Shit! Shit! -Go! Go!

816
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,974
Oh, my God!

817
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,943
Why the hell are we down here?

818
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,244
Just give me the address. What's the address again?

819
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,811
Addison, why are you turning...

820
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,045
No, that's it. That should be it.

821
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:53,414
There? That's an alleyway.

822
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:54,414
Relax, okay? It's gonna be fine.

823
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,016
I'm not gonna relax.

824
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:57,784
It's gonna be fine. We know him.

825
00:45:57,786 --> 00:45:59,354
-We don't know Noel. -Yes, we do!

826
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,055
We went to school with him for so long!

827
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:02,990
-You saw Noel five years ago. -Five, so what?

828
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:05,260
-Five years ago. -Do you see where we are right now?

829
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,894
Fine. You can wait in the car then.

830
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,999
No way. I'm not doing that.

831
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,304
Is this really where Noel's friend lives?

832
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,005
What's his name again?

833
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,941
He said to ask for some guy named D. Cash.

834
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:27,251
Yo, you got visitors.

835
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:32,420
Come on in.

836
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:36,126
Take your hands out your pockets, man. You're making me nervous.

837
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:40,394
-So, you're Addison. -Yeah.

838
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:42,132
-I'm D. -Hey, man. Good to meet you.

839
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:48,403
What's your name, baby? Who is this?

840
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,470
You brought me a little gift right here?

841
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:52,273
I'm Phoebe.

842
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:54,275
-Phoebe. -Yeah.

843
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,376
-You want to have some fun? -I'm okay.

844
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:57,380
She's with me, man.

845
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:00,115
Mmm?

846
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,450
-I'm okay. -What'd you say?

847
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:05,052
She's... She's with me.

848
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:07,387
Man, I will slap your nose off your face, man.

849
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,023
Shut up, Addison.

850
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:11,291
Yeah, you heard her. You better shut up, dude.

851
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:12,295
All right.

852
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,932
Hey, your friend's here.

853
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,867
Noel, wake up, man.

854
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,970
Hey, get your ass up, Noel. They're here. Wake up.

855
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:25,208
Is that Noel?

856
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,108
Who's this bitch?

857
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,847
Hey man, it's Addison.

858
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:35,018
Addison, yeah. Good to see you, man.

859
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,354
You look like shit.

860
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,058
Well, sit down, man.

861
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:47,561
Uh, so, how you been, man?

862
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:50,563
You high already man. I'll take this. Put that shit down.

863
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,066
It's crazy, right?

864
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:54,237
It's been, like, five years, six years.

865
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:58,405
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

866
00:47:58,407 --> 00:48:00,342
Well, um, the reason why I'm here

867
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,177
is because I wanted to ask you about something.

868
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,979
-Okay. Uh... -Uh...

869
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:09,516
The shooting in Northwest at Seven Stars.

870
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:12,922
I don't know if you know or not, but this kid Kevin Broadus,

871
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,559
who we know, he was the one who got killed.

872
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,494
Yeah, what are you asking me for?

873
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:25,234
Well, I... I heard, you know, you guys were hanging out.

874
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,204
So, what do you think happened?

875
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,072
I mean, we just heard that the guy who did it was white...

876
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,075
Enough of this shit, man.

877
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,645
Enough.

878
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,646
Noel, you got this kid's number?

879
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,045
No.

880
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:40,649
I have a pager.

881
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,351
You got a pager.

882
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,286
Where you live, son?

883
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:47,155
Uh, we're actually from Philadelphia.

884
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,255
We're just visiting.

885
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:51,258
I know where he lives. You're still at the same place, right, Addy?

886
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Yeah. Same place.

887
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:54,663
Good. I think you kids better get going, man. Get out of here.

888
00:48:54,896 --> 00:48:56,097
No problem.

889
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,231
If we hear something, who knows?

890
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:00,101
Maybe we'll give you a call.

891
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,302
All right, white boy?

892
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:04,237
Okay. Thank you. I'll send him my number.

893
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,409
Get your ass home, man.

894
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,978
Why the hell would you tell them where you live?

895
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,713
Noel still thinks we live in Chevy Chase.

896
00:49:11,947 --> 00:49:14,282
We used to be rich, remember?

897
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,052
Well, that's just great.

898
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:20,690
Phoebe. I'm really sorry.

899
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:22,423
-I don't want to hear it from you. -Okay? I... I am.

900
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,193
-I don't want to hear it! -Okay.

901
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,301
I need a break.

902
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,403
I can't keep doing this.

903
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,639
I can't be a part of this anymore.

904
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,588
Yeah, hello. Who is this?

905
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:27,755
Oh, yeah. Yes. This is he.

906
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:29,090
Yeah, no.

907
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,061
Thank you, sir, for calling.

908
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:33,730
Yes.

909
00:50:35,498 --> 00:50:37,499
Okay.

910
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,168
Okay. I'll see you then.

911
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,336
Phoebe! Hi. I'm in here.

912
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:45,206
Listen, I'm hanging up, all right? Call me if you start to panic.

913
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,209
Bye.

914
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:48,775
-Good morning. -Hey.

915
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:50,478
Can we talk for a minute?

916
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,479
We can talk later. I gotta go.

917
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:54,451
It'll only take a minute.

918
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,617
Okay.

919
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,253
Well,

920
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,625
Addison Schacht's father called me last night.

921
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:04,794
Yeah?

922
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:08,329
It was kind of illuminating.

923
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,597
I have to admit. I didn't...

924
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,499
I hated the fact that he knows

925
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:15,371
more about what my own daughter is doing than I do.

926
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:18,407
Did you like it over there?

927
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,811
I mean, yeah.

928
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,677
I don't know, Mom. It was... It was fine.

929
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:26,179
Theo's a nice guy.

930
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,516
Yeah, he's a nice person.

931
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,818
It's true.

932
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,423
-Okay, well... -I just want to say that I'm... I'm...

933
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:38,659
What?

934
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,398
What I want to say is I apologize. I'm very sorry

935
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:46,800
for not listening to you.

936
00:51:46,802 --> 00:51:49,570
Sincerely, my intention was to help.

937
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,280
I'm gonna head out. I love you, Mom. I gotta go.

938
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:00,717
I love you, too.

939
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:04,653
Okay.

940
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:07,791
Here we are.

941
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,661
Uh, 775 McKinley.

942
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:17,299
Kevin's house.

943
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,400
Uh...

944
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:28,878
Hi, Mr. Broadus.

945
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,747
You must be Addison.

946
00:52:31,547 --> 00:52:32,749
Come inside.

947
00:52:42,858 --> 00:52:46,260
Would you like something to drink?

948
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:47,898
I'm okay. Thank you.

949
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:53,434
So,

950
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,869
you're a friend of Kevin's?

951
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:58,373
Yeah, I'd definitely say we were friends.

952
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,209
Enough of a friend to go to all this trouble?

953
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:04,545
Sorry to be blunt, but the fact is we'd like to know

954
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:07,447
why you're taking such an interest.

955
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:10,186
Do you think the police aren't doing their job?

956
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,891
-But... -Then why are you so interested?

957
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:21,762
Well, I...

958
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:28,271
I guess it just doesn't really make any sense why anyone would want to kill Kevin.

959
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,914
Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my dad. I'll turn it off.

960
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,650
Walter?

961
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,221
Come with me.

962
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,690
Come with me.

963
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,492
Walter.

964
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,940
My son valued his privacy.

965
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,974
He kept us out of here for the last year.

966
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:09,876
We had to break the locks.

967
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:12,681
Then when my wife could finally face coming in here...

968
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,423
She had to find this.

969
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:22,992
Open it.

970
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:24,694
Open it!

971
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:28,461
What is this?

972
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:29,666
You want a reason?

973
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,601
-There's your reason. -What is that?

974
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,336
-Look at me! -I don't know what that is!

975
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,503
-Why do you have a pager? -What?

976
00:54:36,505 --> 00:54:37,637
-Are you a dealer? -No.

977
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:39,005
Were you supplying my son?

978
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:40,441
-No. Absolutely not! -Tell me!

979
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,575
Walter, stop!

980
00:54:41,577 --> 00:54:42,612
Please.

981
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,646
Stop! Please!

982
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,860
What do you want from us, Addison?

983
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,498
You want to know why my son was killed?

984
00:55:04,532 --> 00:55:06,302
I don't know why.

985
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:12,509
But maybe we're just going to have to learn to live with that.

986
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,916
I'm so sorry.

987
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,653
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make it worse.

988
00:56:59,847 --> 00:57:02,148
-Ni hao. -Ni hao.

989
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,555
Uh, Phoebe's been... Has early acceptance into Yale next year.

990
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:09,755
Um, excuse me.

991
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:15,963
-Hi. -Hey.

992
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,097
-Hi. What's going on? -I need to talk to you.

993
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:21,034
-Addy, this is a really bad time. -I need to talk to you.

994
00:57:21,036 --> 00:57:22,605
Shit. Okay, just come on.

995
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,007
Addy, what? What's up?

996
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:30,677
I just came back from Kevin's house.

997
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:33,479
You know he was into drugs? Like, serious drugs?

998
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:35,715
-Wait, what? -Yeah.

999
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:38,586
I don't know. Maybe that's what Strauss meant by "emotional difficulties."

1000
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,987
Phoebe.

1001
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,757
Uh, hey.

1002
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,594
I'm sorry, Mom. Just one second.

1003
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,762
-Addy, I gotta go. I... -Wait. I just...

1004
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:50,200
Phoebe! Please.

1005
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,237
Addy, what is it?

1006
00:57:57,606 --> 00:58:02,245
You know, I never told you what happened that day with my mom.

1007
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:04,947
No.

1008
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,719
She was fine.

1009
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:14,521
Nothing was wrong with her.

1010
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:16,225
That morning, we were having breakfast,

1011
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:19,561
and then I went to school, and when I came back she was...

1012
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,199
It's okay.

1013
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,903
She was still sitting in the same seat where I left her.

1014
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:34,010
At the hospital, they told us that she'd had an aneurysm.

1015
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:38,244
Then,

1016
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:41,748
last week, we see Kevin at the coffee shop.

1017
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,818
-He gave us our coffee. -Addison.

1018
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,052
He gave me back my book.

1019
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,586
It's not the same thing.

1020
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:47,891
Yes. It is.

1021
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:50,759
It is the same thing.

1022
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:54,830
He was fine, too.

1023
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:59,233
Don't you understand, Phoebe?

1024
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,237
I couldn't do anything about her.

1025
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:05,938
Addison.

1026
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:10,112
I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to solve something that can't be solved.

1027
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,715
Addison.

1028
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:58,157
Addison. Uh...

1029
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,260
Man, give me the damn phone.

1030
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,929
Yo, it's D.

1031
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,298
We got something you might want to know, man.

1032
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,969
Meet us in an hour.

1033
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:23,717
Hey. No alcohol for minors.

1034
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,922
No, we're good. Kid's with me.

1035
01:00:33,795 --> 01:00:36,095
So, where's the girl at?

1036
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:37,933
You said you got something for me?

1037
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,703
We got something for you. It's right here.

1038
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,208
Just little errands, man. No big deal.

1039
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,346
Look, you do this for us, you get a name. That simple.

1040
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,916
Are you kidding me? I'm not... I'm not gonna do that.

1041
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:58,987
Do I look like I'm kidding, hmm?

1042
01:01:02,023 --> 01:01:05,394
Hmm? Okay, well, you don't want to know nothing, man. I'm out of here.

1043
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,128
Go back.

1044
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,298
Hold on.

1045
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,403
Thatta boy. Yeah.

1046
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:19,005
Now we talking.

1047
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,708
You're saying if I do this for you,

1048
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,945
you're going to tell me who killed Kevin Broadus?

1049
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,144
No.

1050
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:28,217
But I will tell you the guy who knows the guy who did it.

1051
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:32,454
Okay. And...

1052
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:34,086
Where do I have to take it?

1053
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:36,222
Back to your neighborhood.

1054
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:38,191
We can't go down there, man.

1055
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:40,025
Not in Chevy.

1056
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:42,829
Police would be on our ass so tough. Sniff us out.

1057
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,231
But a kid like you?

1058
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,365
Golden.

1059
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:47,070
Yeah, and crispy.

1060
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,271
No. I'm gonna need a little more info.

1061
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:55,409
I told you. I told you. Addy's a quick learner, man.

1062
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,344
He's a quick learner. He ain't even got hair on his nuts.

1063
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,811
Look at him.

1064
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,280
Give him... Give him a taste.

1065
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:02,048
Give him a taste. Okay. Let me tell you.

1066
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,818
There's a guy, you know. He comes down, hangs out sometimes.

1067
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,420
Smack dealer from Maryland.

1068
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,222
He's out of his mind. He's...

1069
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,423
You know, he comes into D.C. and he parties at the clubs.

1070
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,494
-That's what he likes to do. -Yeah.

1071
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:13,461
And according to our friend, Kevin was down there to buy some shit.

1072
01:02:13,695 --> 01:02:15,295
So dealer was sitting in his big chair, you know.

1073
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,898
He's sitting in the room with all his homies at a table.

1074
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,434
You know, he see Kevin. He decides to pick on him a little bit.

1075
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,403
Nothing too serious.

1076
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,371
The next thing you know, Kevin went right back at the guy,

1077
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,106
and shit, man. Like he was going back and forth.

1078
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,441
It made the guy look bad.

1079
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:29,976
Bad. Real bad.

1080
01:02:29,978 --> 01:02:32,045
This kid disrespected the wrong guy.

1081
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:34,148
Disrespected him, man. I don't even know what Kevin said,

1082
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,383
but he said something because he got a big laugh.

1083
01:02:37,385 --> 01:02:40,822
I mean, he... He signed his own death warrant. Shit.

1084
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,891
When... When was this?

1085
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:47,162
A couple of days before he got shot.

1086
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,334
You're saying that all he did

1087
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:58,074
was say the wrong thing to the wrong guy?

1088
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,143
Wrong damn thing, man.

1089
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:38,213
Oh, my God.

1090
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:53,596
Addison?

1091
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,295
Alex?

1092
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:56,563
-Uh... -What the hell are you doing here?

1093
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:57,998
Is this 27... I think I have the...

1094
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,999
Shit. Really?

1095
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,001
Alex, who is it?

1096
01:04:02,003 --> 01:04:04,271
Uh, okay. Okay. Um...

1097
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,907
Just act normal like I left my sports bag at school

1098
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:07,974
and you're dropping it off as a favor.

1099
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:09,409
This for you?

1100
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,010
Just give it to me for God's sake.

1101
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:13,313
All right. Thank you. Bye!

1102
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:16,182
No, you're funny. Get the hell out of here. Go. All right.

1103
01:04:16,184 --> 01:04:17,286
See you later!

1104
01:04:21,956 --> 01:04:25,592
Hey, D. I did it. What's the name?

1105
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:28,295
What name? What are you talking about, man?

1106
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,162
Come on, D. What's the name? We had a deal.

1107
01:04:30,164 --> 01:04:32,298
Don't rush me, man.

1108
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,068
Now, the guy we told you about, his name is Mike.

1109
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,903
Mike Lorriner.

1110
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,972
He was there when Kevin got into it with that dealer.

1111
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:40,576
And what's the address?

1112
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:48,248
-Hey. -Phoebe! Phoebe. Mike Lorriner.

1113
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,418
Write this down, okay? Mike Lorriner. 9756 Fork Lute Road.

1114
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,655
This is the guy who knows who did it. D. just told me.

1115
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,588
Okay. So you already called the police, right?

1116
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,456
No, no, no. It's fine. I'm just gonna go talk to him.

1117
01:04:57,458 --> 01:04:59,226
Addison, don't be stupid. Do not go there.

1118
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,327
Just give the police the address and let them go.

1119
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:03,329
-Phoebe, I got it covered. -Addison!

1120
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,084
Hey.

1121
01:06:32,086 --> 01:06:34,123
Uh, hi. Are you Mike Lorriner?

1122
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:38,157
-Who are you? -Um...

1123
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,528
I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother you, but...

1124
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:46,199
I heard that you knew something about what happened in D.C.

1125
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:47,700
a few days ago.

1126
01:06:47,702 --> 01:06:50,204
You know, the kid who got shot at the coffee shop.

1127
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,505
D.C.? I don't know anything, man.

1128
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:54,175
It's about Kevin Broadus.

1129
01:06:55,577 --> 01:06:57,577
Uh, he was a friend of mine.

1130
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,646
I don't know what you're talking about, man. Get out of here.

1131
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,248
I heard that he pissed off a drug dealer or something, and you...

1132
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,249
Do you know the guy?

1133
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,517
I don't know, I just... I just... What did I just say to you?

1134
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,320
Did you hear me?

1135
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:10,555
I... I said, I... I... I don't know nothing.

1136
01:07:10,557 --> 01:07:12,559
-All right? Now... Now just get... -All right.

1137
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,094
Get off my property.

1138
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,496
Okay. Sorry, man. I'll go. I'm leaving.

1139
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:19,769
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Who... Who gave you my name?

1140
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,771
Who... Who told you to come here?

1141
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:24,670
I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay?

1142
01:07:24,672 --> 01:07:26,408
Of course it was a mistake.

1143
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,512
Who told you?

1144
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,545
Uh...

1145
01:07:33,547 --> 01:07:35,382
This guy I know, D. Cash. He just... He said that you were there when...

1146
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,119
D. Cash? D. Cash gave you my name?

1147
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,186
Yeah.

1148
01:07:41,188 --> 01:07:42,421
Okay.

1149
01:07:42,423 --> 01:07:43,555
Okay.

1150
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,358
Uh...

1151
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,526
Okay. Well, you... You... You tell D. Cash

1152
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:50,099
that he probably shouldn't be running his mouth.

1153
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,499
-You got it? -Okay.

1154
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:56,470
I'm gonna just go now. Okay?

1155
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,637
Whoa, what... What is that?

1156
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:59,575
What is that light?

1157
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,646
Are you... are you filming this?

1158
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:09,251
My man. Are we making a movie?

1159
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:14,090
Well, I... I guess I'm ready for my close-up.

1160
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:17,257
Look, man.

1161
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,659
If you don't know anything, it's fine. I can just leave.

1162
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,529
Do you think I will not use this?

1163
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:25,301
Bang!

1164
01:08:27,301 --> 01:08:28,770
That was pretty good, huh?

1165
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:36,209
You don't even know who that dealer was, do you?

1166
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,847
The one your boy Kevin pissed off.

1167
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,819
That was D., you idiot.

1168
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,158
Oh, he played you.

1169
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,393
See, now I'm in a spot.

1170
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,428
Uh, you know, I... I...

1171
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:59,167
I did that ungrateful asshole a favor.

1172
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,707
And this is the thanks I get?

1173
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:12,180
Well, fuck the both of you.

1174
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:25,585
Why is that? Well, question seven on the application asks you

1175
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,720
to tell them what your best and worst qualities are,

1176
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:30,490
but they only give you three-and-a-half inches.

1177
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,060
Three-and-a-half inches on a page.

1178
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,527
I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more

1179
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:35,961
than three-and-a-half inches.

1180
01:10:35,963 --> 01:10:37,696
So I decided to write a few extra pages.

1181
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:39,465
How many?

1182
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:41,634
-Twenty-two to be exact. -Wow!

1183
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:43,003
-I realize that might seem a bit excessive. -It does.

1184
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,603
However, how are you expected

1185
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:46,805
to express the very essence of your being

1186
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:49,710
and your views on how insanely crazy this world is

1187
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,713
in such a tiny space on a page?

1188
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:02,988
He's fine.

1189
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,626
-He's very drowsy, but he's stable. -Okay.

1190
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:07,895
Yeah, he's going to be all right.

1191
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,630
Well...

1192
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:13,969
Hi. Sorry. He's asking for Phoebe.

1193
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:19,508
Okay.

1194
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:27,312
Hmm.

1195
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:28,982
You want some coffee or something?

1196
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,452
Coffee? No.

1197
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,860
Phoebe's here.

1198
01:11:43,398 --> 01:11:44,667
Thank you.

1199
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:51,739
Hi.

1200
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,475
Hi.

1201
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:02,050
You smell nice.

1202
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,721
Did they find Lorriner?

1203
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:10,557
Yeah.

1204
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:13,462
They caught him. Somewhere in Virginia.

1205
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,632
He still had the gun on him, Addy.

1206
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:21,036
They think it's the same gun he used to kill Kevin.

1207
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,841
And they got D. Cash and Noel, too.

1208
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:32,047
The Broaduses know.

1209
01:12:34,515 --> 01:12:35,917
They know who killed their son.

1210
01:12:37,551 --> 01:12:39,585
You talked to them?

1211
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,987
Yeah, they came by.

1212
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:43,925
They left that letter for you.

1213
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,997
I'm still so mad at you.

1214
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,500
I know.

1215
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,671
I should thank you.

1216
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,603
Why?

1217
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:01,676
Because if it weren't for you, I'd probably be dead.

1218
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:07,847
Really? Because I totally thought you had it covered.

1219
01:14:20,488 --> 01:14:22,888
Video Diary, day...

1220
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,857
I don't even know what day it is anymore.

1221
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:27,660
But guess what?

1222
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:29,928
Someone must have read those extra 22 pages

1223
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,067
because I got into Chicago.

1224
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,968
You know,

1225
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,003
these past few months I've come to realize

1226
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,108
that I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore.

1227
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,077
Because for the first time in a long time,

1228
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,484
I am really excited about the future.

1229
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,652
?Amazing grace, how sweet...

1230
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:58,124
But at the same time, it's never easy to say goodbye.

1231
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:05,033
?That saved a wretch like me

1232
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:15,808
?I once was lost

1233
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:17,579
?But now... ?/i>

1234
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:40,633
Well, I'm...

1235
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:42,971
I'm glad we could stay for that.

1236
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,274
Yeah.

1237
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,811
I can't believe we're leaving for college already.

1238
01:15:51,578 --> 01:15:53,646
How do you feel?

1239
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:57,052
Well, you know, I just... I feel weird, I guess.

1240
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:09,661
What are your plans for the holidays?

1241
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:11,567
You think you'll be back?

1242
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,269
I don't know.

1243
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:21,943
-I'll... I'll walk you to the door. -Okay.

1244
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,757
-So... I guess... -Listen.

1245
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:39,094
I... I got you something.

1246
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:42,698
Maybe you can use it.
