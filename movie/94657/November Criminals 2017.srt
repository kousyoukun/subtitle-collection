00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,660
<i>My mother died
six months ago today.</i>

3
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:09,333
<i>At the hospital, they told
us she'd had an aneurysm.</i>

4
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:15,606
<i>There was nothing
I could do for her.</i>

5
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:22,481
<i>I guess I've gotten pretty
good at pretending to be okay.</i>

6
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,328
<i>I don't think this
stupid thing is even working.</i>

7
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,664
<i>You turn it on?</i>

8
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,766
<i>Of course I turned it on.</i>

9
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:46,602
<i>Did you take
the lens cap off?</i>

10
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:48,438
<i>Yeah, that
probably would help.</i>

11
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,838
<i>Okay, Phoebe,
can you just...</i>

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,976
<i>Okay.</i>

13
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,241
<i>Ready?</i>

14
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,944
<i>Rolling, and action.</i>

15
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:57,445
<i>Video Diary, day 18.</i>

16
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,750
<i>Now, today is an
extremely important day.</i>

17
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,551
<i>Why?</i>

18
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,686
<i>Because here is my application
to the University of Chicago,</i>

19
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,388
<i>where I'm hoping to study
Classics in the fall.</i>

20
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,989
<i>Have you ever heard of the Internet?</i>

21
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,826
<i>I know nowadays you can
submit this stuff online,</i>

22
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:12,595
<i>but personally, I prefer
the more traditional route.</i>

23
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:15,498
<i>As you can see, this
envelope is seriously thick.</i>

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,001
<i>Why is that?</i>

25
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,868
<i>Well, question seven on
the application asks you</i>

26
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,604
<i>to tell them what your best
and worst qualities are,</i>

27
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:22,571
<i>but they only give you
three-and-a-half inches.</i>

28
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:23,873
<i>Addy, watch the road.</i>

29
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,541
<i>Three-and-a-half
inches on a page.</i>

30
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,343
<i>I'm sorry, but my worst
qualities took up a lot more</i>

31
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:28,810
<i>than three-and-a-half
inches.</i>

32
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:30,647
<i>So I decided to throw
in a few extra pages.</i>

33
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:31,880
<i>How many?</i>

34
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,682
<i>- Twenty-two to be exact.
- Wow!</i>

35
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,317
<i>- I realize that might seem a bit excessive.
- It does.</i>

36
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,619
<i>However, how are you expected</i>

37
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,024
<i>to express the very
essence of your being</i>

38
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:42,826
<i>and your views on how
insanely crazy this world is</i>

39
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,726
<i>in such a tiny space on a page?</i>

40
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,295
<i>- I mean, it's absurd.
- Okay, Addy, shut up already.</i>

41
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:47,596
<i>There's a mailbox right there.</i>

42
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:48,930
<i>Great.</i>

43
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>Phoebe? Can you please film this?</i>

44
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,335
<i>You're on me, right?</i>

45
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,672
<i>Right.</i>

46
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,974
<i>And now the moment we've
all been waiting for.</i>

47
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,841
<i>I know it's a moment you're
very excited about, Phoebe.</i>

48
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:01,310
<i>You're very excited
about this, aren't you?</i>

49
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,712
<i>I'm excited to get some coffee.</i>

50
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,513
<i>Just put it in the box already.</i>

51
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,915
<i>Okay, give me the camera.</i>

52
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,586
<i>Oh, Jesus, he's still not done.</i>

53
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,654
<i>Do it.</i>

54
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:12,755
<i>Hey! Move it!</i>

55
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,590
<i>You know what?</i>

56
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,858
<i>No. I'm not too worried
about the extra pages</i>

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,862
<i>because wasn't it Virgil who said,</i>

58
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,730
<i>"Fortune sides with him who dares"?</i>

59
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:27,469
<i>Or perhaps even more apropos are
the immortal words of David Bowie,</i>

60
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,704
<i>"I don't know where
I'm going from here,</i>

61
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,678
<i>"but I promise it won't be boring."</i>

62
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,613
<i>They're never going to
read 22 extra pages, Addison.</i>

63
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,981
<i>Well, for those of us who
didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe,</i>

64
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:43,087
we have to put in a little extra effort.

65
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,089
Two medium Americanos.

66
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:46,456
What's your name?

67
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,624
Add... Screw you, Brandon.

68
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,527
Are you seriously with this guy?

69
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,561
Do you seriously imagine I
give a shit what you think?

70
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,863
Yeah, but the whole school
thinks you lost your mind, so...

71
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,566
- Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos.
- Got it.

72
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,636
- Are you going to pay for that?
- Nope.

73
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:02,637
Two medium Americanos for
Addison coming right up.

74
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,973
- What's going on, brother?
- How you doing, man?

75
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,541
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

76
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:07,543
- Did you read it, yet?
- Oh!

77
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,445
What? Dude, how are you so fast?

78
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,380
I don't understand. What did you think?

79
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,082
We'll talk about it after
you've read the James Baldwin.

80
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,784
Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you.

81
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,518
Oh... Have you guys
had your first kiss yet?

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,453
No, I'm waiting.

83
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:19,689
- Of course you would.
- You should've seen this guy

84
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:21,590
in philosophy class the other day,

85
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,025
he nailed Miss Keneally to
the wall. It was incredible.

86
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,593
- Why?
- Because she was giving a stupid lecture

87
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,494
about why students cut class.

88
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,896
And he said, "You're the
reason why students cut class."

89
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:30,833
- Kevin.
- No. I said,

90
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:32,735
"People like Miss Keneally
are the reason kids cut class."

91
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,403
I was joking obviously.

92
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,905
He wasn't joking. It was incredible.

93
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,807
No, she is what's wrong
with the education system.

94
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,809
- Dude, I got to work. Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

95
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,110
Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs.

96
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,879
You got it.

97
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,948
You stand up for the people,
Kevin. You're a good man.

98
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,549
- Here you go. Sure.
- Thanks.

99
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:48,785
Phoebe?

100
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,585
- Huh? What's up?
- How's he doing?

101
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,554
He's okay.

102
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,158
I'll see you later.

103
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,072
It's chilly.

104
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:11,643
- Can I ask you something?
- Mmm?

105
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:17,879
I feel like you hanging
out with me has, like,

106
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,682
a detrimental effect on your
standing with the cool kids.

107
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,651
We've always hung out, Addison.

108
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,364
Not really. I mean, we haven't
really since eighth grade.

109
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,157
I sort of went invisible there for a while.

110
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,758
Okay. Well, maybe it's because
I find every guy in high school

111
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,898
to be completely dull and predictable.

112
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,166
And why is that?

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,869
Are they predictable
because they want to hook up?

114
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:40,903
Can we just get some music or something?

115
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,605
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

116
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:46,174
I feel like you see me as
somehow sexually neutral

117
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:49,612
from the Latin "neuter,"
as in, without testicles.

118
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:51,814
No, I don't see you that way.

119
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,581
I hate to break it to you, Phoebe.

120
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,049
I don't want to disappoint you.

121
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,785
But guess what?

122
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:59,024
I want what all the other guys want, too.

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,495
That's okay.

124
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,629
Really?

125
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,698
Actually,

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,167
I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

127
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,240
And I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you.

128
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:21,246
I don't want to go off to college as a...

129
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,515
As a what?

130
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:28,850
Without having, you know,

131
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,087
done it.

132
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:32,922
Done what?

133
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,956
Screw you, Addison.

134
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,025
I wanna get it over with.

135
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:43,064
All right? I want to have sex
with a guy who I feel safe around.

136
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,732
You know? Who won't judge me.

137
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:48,639
And who is definitely a virgin, too.

138
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:54,208
You're talking about me?

139
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,244
Wait, what? What makes you
think that I'm a virgin?

140
00:06:56,246 --> 00:07:00,148
Addison, shut up.

141
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,687
So, my mom is in a meeting with the
Secretary of Commerce until 6:00 p.m.

142
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,790
- You want to do this right now?
- Yeah.

143
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,958
While there's a meeting between your
mom and the Secretary of Commerce?

144
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,693
Addison, I swear to God, if
you ask me another question,

145
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:14,095
- I'm gonna change my mind.
- Okay, okay, okay.

146
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,884
Um...

147
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:11,052
Do you think we should kiss?

148
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,222
Uh...

149
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,158
I think we should kiss.

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,362
Okay.

151
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,685
Here.

152
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,104
- Shit! Be careful.
- Sorry.

153
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:02,206
Okay.

154
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,245
There.

155
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:11,814
Okay. So...

156
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,348
That's what this whole
thing is about, right?

157
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,051
There? That's all you're gonna say?

158
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:18,689
There? I just gave myself to you.

159
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,293
There.

160
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,961
Should I keep going?

161
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,228
Sure.

162
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,165
- Sure?
- Yeah?

163
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,732
Yeah?

164
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:31,835
Okay.

165
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,446
- Can I keep kissing you?
- Okay.

166
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,861
Yeah, I wonder if you can.

167
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:01,997
My son is making a film
with my old video camera

168
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,966
and he only has one tape left.

169
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:09,407
And your website says that you
sell new old ones, so to speak.

170
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:15,013
Yeah, VHS-Cs. Sixty minutes.

171
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,147
Yeah, I'll hold.

Stars Bakery, and as you can tell,</i>

174
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:29,024
<i>And what we've learned is that
at least one person has died.</i>

significant discussion</i>

178

could be gang related.</i>

179
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,141
Hey.

180
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,141
Hey.

181
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,512
So, what do you think?

182
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:51,112
That was okay, right?

183
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:55,016
Yeah. I mean, that... That's gotta
be some of the best sex I've ever had.

184
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:01,223
I can't believe we just did that.

185
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:02,493
Yeah.

186
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,095
Are you okay?

187
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,228
Yeah.

188
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,064
You know, I feel like...

189
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:12,300
I feel like I just checked
a really important box.

190
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:16,005
I feel like I just checkmated it.

191
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:32,523
What's that noise?

192
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,893
- I think it's my pager.
- Oh...

193
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:44,132
Okay. You should probably get that.

194
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:46,101
I can't believe you still
actually use that thing.

195
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,435
My dad. Can I use your landline?

196
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah, sure.

197
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,542
My mom's calling me.

198
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:54,275
Oh, God, she never calls from work.

199
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,178
- Do you think she knows?
- That's weird. I don't know.

200
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,184
I swear to God, she has a
sixth sense about this stuff.

201
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,285
Hello?

202
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:03,986
Yeah.

203
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,487
Wait, wait. Mom, slow down. What?

204
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,389
<i>There was a
shooting at Seven Stars.</i>

205

207
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:11,959
What happened?

208
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:13,962

00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,034
No, I think he just left.

They'll just hide him

this is a gang thing?

Honey? You almost ready?

I thought I'd take you to school.

250
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,149
No. I can... I can drive myself. It's fine.

251
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,684
- Just, please.
- Mom, can you leave it on? Please?

252
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:53,354
No. It's really... It's not good

I'm not obsessing.

254
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,493
Listen, I called Denise last
night, and we both agreed

255
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:02,131
that you should see her for just a
couple of sessions, that it would be...

256
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,564
Mom, you're overreacting. Just drop it.

257
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,166
I'm not overreacting.

258
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:07,702
I just think it's a
very traumatic experience

259
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,271
- and I think that you need to...
- I'm not traumatized.

260
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,309
Well, I am! I'm traumatized.

261
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,178
Just call her! Okay?

262
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,713
I've had experience in this, you know?

263
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,248
I've learned the hard way

264
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,319
that you really can't pretend
that this never happened.

265
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,588
You need to talk to somebody.

266

And, clearly,

267
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,595

No, it's fine. I'm going in.

275
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:07,463
Well, then, why don't I drive you?

276
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,766
No, I can drive myself.

277
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,198
Mmm...

279
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:17,238
Not really, but...

280
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,575
You want to talk about it?

281
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,776
No.

282
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,411
Thanks for this, by the way.

283
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,347
Oh, yeah. I'm glad you
could find a use for it.

284
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:27,516
You know, when I pulled it out of the box,

285

<i>♪ I'm just going home ♪</i>

317
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:27,668
<i>I don't suppose any of us
got much sleep last night.</i>

318
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,705
<i>Like most of you probably,</i>

319
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,540
<i>I wept a little,</i>

320
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,541
<i>I prayed a little.</i>

321
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:37,947
<i>Kevin will be missed by the
teachers for his diligence.</i>

322
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,648
<i>He will be missed by the jazz band,</i>

323
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,251
<i>who is short one
excellent trombone player.</i>

324
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:45,854
- Trumpet, but it's all brass.
- <i>A dear friend to many of you.</i>

325
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,790
<i>Mostly, he'll be missed
by his loving parents.</i>

326
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,424
I'm sorry.

327
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:51,893
Sir! I'm really sorry.

328
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,462
I didn't mean to be
disrespectful or interrupt,

329
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:54,695
but I just had to say something

330
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:56,798
- that's really important.
- <i>Addison.</i>

331
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,734
I saw Kevin at the coffee shop
yesterday right before it happened.

332
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,536
Actually, Phoebe and I both did.

333
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:04,505
And then after I heard the
news, I went back to coffee shop,

334
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,709
and one of the news crew guys told me that

335
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,279
they're going to write this
whole thing off as a gang killing.

336
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,780
Which means they probably won't
even go after the guy who did it

337
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,415
because there's such a small chance

338
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,849
of them actually solving the case.

339
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,919
<i>Addison, could you sit down please?</i>

340
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:20,355
I mean, if anyone here knew Kevin,
they knew he wasn't in a gang.

341
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:21,822
<i>Addison, please, enough.</i>

342
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,325
I think this is something
we should talk about.

343
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,029
Why am I the only one saying anything?

344
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:26,728
<i>Addison, please. I've asked
you politely. Sit down!</i>

345
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,763
Does no one care?

346
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,298
<i>I want to hear everything you
have to say, in my office!</i>

347
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,502
All right. Okay.

348
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,636
<i>See me later.</i>

349
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,975
<i>Our emotions are raw.</i>

350
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,311
<i>Everybody in this room is hurting.</i>

351
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,379
Really?

352
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:46,716
<i>Respect is important.</i>

353
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,621
So what's going on with you?

354
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,390
What do you mean, sir?

355
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:02,597
Look, there has been a marked
deterioration of your behavior

356
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,335
and your attitude lately.

357
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:07,605
How are you doing?

358
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,004
I'm fine.

359
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:15,079
Loss of a parent is a big deal, Addison.

360
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,483
This has nothing to do with my mother, sir.

361
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,417
All right.

362
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,988
Here's what I suggest you do.

363
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,623
Cut the theatrics.

364
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,059
Let the police do their job.

365
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,627
And you work your ass off.

366
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,495
Make your mother proud.

367
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,565
And I'll talk to Chicago.

368
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,103
Tell them what an asset
you are to the school.

369
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:57,418
<i>- Hey, no cameras in here. Turn it off.
- Sure.</i>

370
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,386
<i>I'm here to see Detective Thompson.</i>

371
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,789
<i>I still see the red light.</i>

372
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,057
<i>Turn it off now.</i>

373
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,459
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

374
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,925
You have an appointment?

375
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,529
Not particularly, but I
need to speak with him.

376
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:10,398
He's very busy right now.

377
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,769
Okay. I'm going to wait, all right?

378
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,780
Hi, Detective.

379
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:25,813
So you're the kid with the camera.

380
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,648
Yeah, that's right.

381
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,684
We've got your statement.

382
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:32,020
I understand that there's
something that you'd like to add.

383
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:36,691
Yeah. Um, you guys know that Kevin
Broadus was not in a gang, right?

384
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,926
We don't know that.

385
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:40,895
How do you know that?

386
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,731
Um, well, I mean, I went to...

387
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,699
You know, I've been friends
with him for a while,

388
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,702
and I know that he wasn't in a gang.

389
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:50,638
Who told you that he was in a gang?

390
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,107
I thought you came here
to tell us something.

391
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,711
I mean, I am here... I just...
I need to know what's going on.

392
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,847
I don't have time for this.
Could you deal with this kid?

393
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:00,648
- Yeah, I got it.
- Please sir, listen!

394
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,750
My friend just got killed.

395
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,557
And you can't expect me just to sit
around and not do anything about it, okay?

396
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:13,927
Listen, son. I know he was your friend,

397
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,632
and believe me, we want to catch
whoever did this just as much as you do,

398
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:21,770
but right now, we're dealing with
24 homicides in this district alone,

399
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:24,571
and that's just in the past two weeks.

400
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,974
I'm sorry, but if you don't
have anything new to tell us,

401
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:29,045
I have to get back to work.

402
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:31,948
Take it easy now.

403
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:47,631
Hey.

404
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:57,038
I was looking for you.

405
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,639
You okay?

406
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,143
Yeah, I'm all right.

407
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,515
Do you want to talk about it? Or...

408
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,183
The police have already
made up their minds.

409
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,886
What?

410
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,587
You don't know that.

411
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,088
Listen, Phoebe, one second
we were talking to him,

412
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,656
and the next he's gone. It
just doesn't make any sense.

413
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:19,961
Everyone is just moving
on like nothing happened.

414
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,128
Addy.

415
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,330
Someone needs to do something.

416
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,240
Addy, I know after what
happened with your mom...

417
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,540
You know, sometimes

418
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:35,076
bad things, I don't know,
Addy, they just happen.

419
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,245
Phoebe. That's really deep.

420
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,182
I feel so much better. Thank you.

421
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:43,053

Okay.

441
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,171

from me that these resources

There's something I gotta show you.

447
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,165
I have Mandarin in, like, five minutes.

448
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,767
- Mandarin? No. This is really important.
- Yes. Look, I can't.

449
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:41,970
I skipped it last time
so I could sleep with you.

- So I have to do it today.
- Come on!

<i>Look. This
is from Mrs. Strauss.</i>

452
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,309
"Kevin has begun to show
signs of emotional trouble.

453
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,279
"The recent slide in
academic results suggest

454

"he may be dealing with
significant emotional difficulties

Christ, Addison.

458

What do you think that means?

459
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,426
I don't know.

460
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,694
I think I should talk to Strauss.

461
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,095
And say what?

462
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:09,129

you could talk me through it"?

No, obviously not, but I think
this could lead to something.

What if we could figure this out?

466

Don't you even care?

467
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,779
That's not what this is about.

00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:27,115
Phoebe. Come on. We... Like...

469
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,984
I saw your posters
today outside of the gym.

470
00:26:29,986 --> 00:26:32,086
- I tore them down.
- What? Why?

471
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:33,988
'Cause, Addison, everyone's
making fun of you.

472
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,990
- They know it's you.
- So you're embarrassed by me?

473
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:37,157
No, I'm not embarrassed by you.

474
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,826
It's okay to have sex with me,

475
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,860
but you don't want people
to know we're friends?

476
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:42,731
Of course not! I mean, of course
it's okay that we're friends.

477
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:43,464
Listen, if you're ashamed
of me, just tell me, okay?

478
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:45,366
No, you idiot!

479
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:47,268
I did it because of in spite
of how stupid you're being,

480
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,706
I actually give a shit about you.

481
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,415
Um, can I borrow your
phone? This could be a lead.

482
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,850
Jesus Christ.

483
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:05,119
Come on! Let me borrow your phone.

484
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,134
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

485
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:19,934
Addison?

486
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,039
Addis...

487
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:27,908
- Who was it?
- I don't know. They hung up.

488
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,913
Addison, you don't seem to realize
that I'm going through this, too.

489
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:35,282
And I can't stop thinking
about it either, okay? But...

490
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,453
It's not about you.

491
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:42,859
And there's nothing you
can do to change it, okay?

492
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,097
Now I'm late for class. I gotta go.

493
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:17,357
<i>Hi, you've
reached the Schacht family,</i>

494
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,493
<i>Sarah, Theo and Addison.</i>

495
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:21,896
<i>We can't come to
the phone right now.</i>

496
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:24,538
<i>So leave us a message, and we'll
get back to you as soon as we can.</i>

497
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:29,937
<i>Uh, hello. This is Principal
Karlstadt at Robert Kennedy High.</i>

498
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:35,309
<i>I would like, if you can, for you to
come in tomorrow at 8:30 into my office.</i>

499
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:38,111
<i>It's a matter of some urgency.</i>

500
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:40,214
Parents and children
should be in touch with each other.

501
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:41,736
We are in touch with each other.

502
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:43,317
Through a pager.

503
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,319
Except, he had to use my
daughter's phone to call...

504
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:47,053
All kids borrow each other's
phone all the time, don't they?

505
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:49,123
- He doesn't have a cell phone?
- No. Is that a problem?

506
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,565
Why didn't you get him a cell phone?

507
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:51,992
Okay, let's all calm
down. Let's stay very calm.

508
00:28:51,994 --> 00:28:53,560
It's not a problem. It's a matter of...

509
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:55,062
- It's a safety issue.
- Could we calm down please?

510
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:57,063
I'm just trying to make sense of this.

511
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:00,568
So, his son has put himself

512
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,870
smack dab in the middle of a murder case.

513
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,371
- Am I right?
- Well...

514
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,240
Listen, my son is a good
kid. Can I just say that?

515
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:07,575
I mean, he's been through
a lot this last year.

516
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:09,242
Yes.

517
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:11,311
He's lost his mother and
now he's lost a friend.

518
00:29:11,313 --> 00:29:14,214
What I'm trying to say is that
I think he's just trying to help.

519
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:17,085
Right. I am not gonna let his kid

520
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,087
jeopardize my daughter's life,

521
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:20,590
nor her future for that matter.

522
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:24,191
Okay. I'm gonna stop us right here.

523
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:28,162
This is a very, very
precarious time for all of us.

524
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,562
So I'd like you to keep that in mind

525
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:32,299
when you discuss this with your children.

526
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:34,001
Yes. Of course.

527
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:36,037
Thank... Thank you for
the meeting, Mr. Karlstadt.

528
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,906
It's been very educational. Thank you.

529
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:43,210
Okay, I'll speak to you again
after you talk to your children.

530
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:46,183
Thank you very much. I'll
talk with him tonight.

531
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,921
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi.

532
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:55,322
You doing okay?

533
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,325
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

534
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,563
Um, so, what's up with
your asshole boyfriend?

535
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,901
It's just that I heard some
weird stuff, that's all.

536
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,267
Do you want to talk about it?

537
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,405
No. Not really.

538
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,540
Oh... Okay.

539
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:16,511
- Hi.
- Hey.

540
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:19,146
Uh, could I have a word with you?

541
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:20,348
Yeah, what's up?

542
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,383
Can I talk to you in private?

543
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,385
Yeah. Sure. Um...

544
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:27,187
Hey, Alex, will you just watch
my stuff? I'll be right back.

545
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,222
Yeah, sure.

546
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,357
Thanks.

547
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,157
I kind of wanted your advice.

548
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,292
Yeah?

549
00:30:32,294 --> 00:30:33,964
Something to do with Kevin.

550
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,996
Yeah. Um...

551
00:30:36,998 --> 00:30:38,935
I was in the coffee shop when it happened.

552
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

553
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:44,975
I saw something, and I don't
know if I should tell Addison.

554
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,176
Tell him what?

555
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:49,476
Addison.

556
00:30:49,478 --> 00:30:51,412
Mrs. Strauss. Do you have a minute?

557
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,715
Sure. Come in.

558
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,549
The guy who killed Kevin was white.

559
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:58,185
I saw his wrist when
he pushed the door open.

560
00:30:58,187 --> 00:31:01,556
I know something was going
on with Kevin before he died.

561
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,523
And I heard that you and him were talking

562
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:07,161
because he was going through
some emotional difficulties.

563
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,430
So, what do you think it means?

564
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,665
I don't know, but I told the cops,

565
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,466
but I don't think they're
looking in the right place.

566
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,435
Why?

567
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:17,538
I mean, I heard Kevin was
hanging out with that kid Noel.

568
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,272
- Noel?
- Yeah.

569
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:22,376
And I know he's mixed up
with some heavy people.

570
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:23,677
They're dangerous.

571
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,747
What we talked about was confidential.

572
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:29,549
Just like the conversation we're
having right now is confidential.

573
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,418
Yeah, of course.

574
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,254
But I just want to know
if there's anything,

575
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:37,090
you know, if you had any idea
of what was going on with him.

576
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:40,627
Addison, if you want to talk about
how you feel about what's happened,

577
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:41,763
we can do that.

578
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,598
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

579
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,568
Look, just promise me you won't
tell any of this to Addison.

580
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,169
Just not right now, okay?

581
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,440
Yeah. Okay.

582
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,576
- Thanks, Bo.
- Yeah. I'll see you.

583
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:55,612
Yeah.

584
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,445
I was at your school today.

585
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:03,486
And I was catching a lot of shit about you.

586
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:06,056
About this.

587
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:09,659
What's up with this, hmm?

588
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,562
What's going on?

589
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:17,767
Addison?

590
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,238
Remember that day

591
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,606
that Kevin was killed?

592
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,407
Yeah.

593
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:30,478
I drove back to the coffee
shop after it happened.

594
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,616
That's why I didn't call you.

595
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,482
Okay.

596
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,149
And I...

597
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,752
I saw his body.

598
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:41,457
Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like,
I saw them wheel him out.

599
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,492
Here's this kid.

600
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:47,293
He gets murdered,

601
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:48,797
and no one cares.

602
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:50,598
That's not true, Addy.
You know that's not true.

603
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,099
No, it is! That's what it seems like.

604
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,236
People care. They do. They just...

605
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,504
Will you just do me a favor?

606
00:32:57,506 --> 00:33:00,406
Just stop this nonsense. This
is... This is crazy, Addison.

607
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:02,643
It's not nonsense. I'm just
trying to do something good.

608
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:06,280
Yeah, I... I understand, I think
I do, what you're trying to do.

609
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:08,683
But this is a murder investigation.

610
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:10,384
You don't know what could happen.

611
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,153
Nothing's gonna happen!

612
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:15,125
Well, I couldn't take it if
anything did happen to you.

613
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,761
Just...

614
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:23,330
If you can't do it for me,

615
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:24,734
do it for her.

616
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,434
All right?

617
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,571
Yeah.

618
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:42,416
<i>Video Diary. Day 23.</i>

619
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:44,284
<i>I don't know, maybe my dad's right.</i>

620
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:45,566
<i>Maybe I'm not thinking straight.</i>

621
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,394
Maybe I shouldn't forget
about the rest of my life.

622
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:54,397
Phoebe!

623
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:57,731
Hey.

624
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:59,299
What's up?

625
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:00,302
Hi.

626
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:04,907
What?

627
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:14,748
Look. So, I know the other night
was purely a practical thing for you.

628
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,819
And, you know, I have
nothing to compare it to,

629
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,554
except for maybe porn and stuff.

630
00:34:20,556 --> 00:34:22,458
But I just have to say

631
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:27,194
that it really was sensational,

632
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,697
in the original meaning of the word.

633
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,836
And I have a strong and overwhelming desire

634
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,538
to do it again.

635
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,675
That's bad, huh?

636
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:44,647
Well, you know,

637
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:50,451
when I woke up this morning, I...

638
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:53,790
I looked over at the pillow
where your head had been.

639
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:55,822
Uh...

640
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:56,826
And I...

641
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:01,665
And I kind of wished it was still there.

642
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,773
I don't know, we're probably

643
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,375
- just romanticizing it.
- Romanticizing it. Yeah. That's classic.

644
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,512
But, uh...

645
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:20,648
Maybe if we did it again...

646
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,918
What? It might break the spell?

647
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:26,387
That works.

648
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:28,355
- Should we...
- Yeah.

649
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,458
Okay.

650
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,427
Are you sure your dad's not home?

651
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,262
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

652
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,666
He's out shooting bridges for
a Belgian tourist brochure.

653
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:40,770
Long way from the
<i>Washington Post, huh?</i>

654
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:48,511
What?

655
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:53,848
That... That
was pretty good. Right?

656
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,949
I mean, what do you think?

657
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,686
Better, same?

658
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:00,557
Worse?

659
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:04,625
Not worse, but...

660
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:06,460
Okay.

661
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:09,032
I mean, the spell is definitely broken.

662
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:11,567
Yeah.

663
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:15,705
Really?

664
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,615
No, Addy.

665
00:36:28,683 --> 00:36:30,719
I want you to hold me.

666
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,869
Is it just a one-time
thing? I mean, like...

667
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:51,505
I mean, if we do do this
again, which I hope we will,

668
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:56,012
I mean, like, do you want to usually
do the holding afterwards or beforehand?

669
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,082
Usually afterwards, I'm
guessing. That's good.

670
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:03,384
I'm just curious, you know.

671
00:37:03,386 --> 00:37:05,554
- I want to be...
- Shut up.

672
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,324
Okay.

673
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,360
Okay. Um...

674
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:14,097
So, what? I guess we just keep...

675
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,896
We keep doing this until
the feeling wears off?

676
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:19,465
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

677
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,569
Okay.

678
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,840
How are you getting home?

679
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,202
I'm gonna grab a cab. Don't
worry about it. It's fine, okay?

680
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:36,884
Hi.

681
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:37,987
Hey.

682
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:41,121
I brought dinner.

683
00:37:41,123 --> 00:37:43,056
Um, I already ate actually, but thank you.

684
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:44,523
Okay.

685
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:45,828
How was your trip?

686
00:37:46,828 --> 00:37:47,930
Good.

687
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:51,066
How was class?

688
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,733
Fine.

689
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:57,637
I learned five more ways to say "hello."

690
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,407
It was eventful.

691
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,878
Should we talk about Addison Schacht?

692
00:38:03,913 --> 00:38:05,679
Wow!

693
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:07,815
- You really have people everywhere, huh?
- Really?

694
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:09,583
Addison Schacht. Okay.

695
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:10,951
What?

696
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:12,820
What's the problem?

697
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,956
We moved up the hill and they moved down.

698
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,657
I went in to your school yesterday,

699
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:21,163
and I had a meeting with Karlstadt.

700
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:24,665
He told me about Addison's
so-called "investigation"

701
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,634
into the Broadus murder
and your involvement in it.

702
00:38:27,636 --> 00:38:29,737
I'm not involved in it.

703
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,840
He's a friend of mine. That's it.

704
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:34,775
So he's just a friend, huh?

705
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:37,146
What does it matter?

706
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,079
What do you have against him?

707
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:41,148
It's not his fault that
his life has been so shitty.

708
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,683
His mom died.

709
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,451
I'm not talking about his mother dying.

710
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:47,822
I'm talking about you pulling
this shit with your friend.

711
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:50,590
And I just don't want you
to get involved in something

712
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,128
that will most definitely hurt you.

724
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:08,869
That's it, Addison. Last chance.

725
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:10,103
What happened?

726
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:11,038
They're suspending me for a week.

727
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,239
What?

728
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:15,141
Because they looked in my locker for
posters and they found Kevin's file.

729
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:17,613
Okay. Well, what are you
going to do about it?

730
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:22,215
Now I've got nothing to lose.

731
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:24,016
Addison, they didn't expel you, okay?

732
00:40:24,018 --> 00:40:27,219
Just go home and... And chill out.

733
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,958
They might not put it on your record.

- Hi.
- Hi.

743
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:27,081
Um, is Addison home?

744
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:30,753
No. Well, he should be, but no, he's not.

745
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:32,786
Phoebe?

746
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,020
- Yeah.
- Oh!

747
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:35,956
- Hi.
- Hi.

748
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,958
Well, why don't you come in? Yeah, yeah.

749
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,159
Come on in.

750
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,630
Yeah, okay. Um...

751
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:49,737
Don't mind me. It's chili night, and
things tend to get out of control.

752
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:52,105
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

753
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:54,177
So, how are you doing?

754
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,342
Um...

755
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:59,779
I'm okay. You know, considering everything.

756
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:00,817
Yeah, I'm sure.

757
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:04,817
Do you want to sit down? Yeah.

758
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,119
- Sure. I don't mind standing, though, it's...
- Here.

759
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:09,056
No...

760
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,824
Some of this stuff out of the way here.

761
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:13,826
Don't mind the mess.

762
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:15,061
It's okay.

763
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:16,663
How's your mom?

764
00:42:16,665 --> 00:42:19,368
- You've known her for a while, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

765
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:23,136
Yeah, since... Well, since
she first came to Washington.

766
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,371
That's almost 20 years now.

767
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:29,208
Was she always so...

768
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,112
I don't know, like that?

769
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,681
Your mom's a perfectionist.

770
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:37,150
But she's had to work real
hard to get where she's at,

771
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:40,289
and you seem to be turning out pretty good.

772
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:44,991
How do you think Addy's doing?

773
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:47,694
I don't know actually.

774
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:49,232
You know, I hope he's okay.

775
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,073
Addy?

776
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:02,342
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

777
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:04,143
I saved some chili.

778
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:06,880
Uh, I'm not really hungry.
I'm just gonna go to my room.

779
00:43:06,882 --> 00:43:08,284
Hi, Addy.

780
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:19,125
What are you doing here?

781
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:20,393
Oh, we're just having
some ice cream. Want some?

782
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:21,997
Just waiting on you.

783
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,435
Addison, come on!

784
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:28,838
Hey!

785
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,444
Addison?

786
00:43:36,878 --> 00:43:38,378
Can I come in?

787
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,882
You have a nice little
chat about me with my dad?

788
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:45,018
Come on, Addison.

789
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,154
Look, I'm just worried about you.

790
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:49,355
Well, if you came here to try to
talk me out of doing anything crazy,

791
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:51,025
- don't bother.
- That's not why I'm here.

792
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:54,027
I just came back from the police station.

793
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:57,132
And it was a complete waste of time.

794
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:00,866
I'm kidding myself.

795
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,469
No one's gonna solve this case,

796
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:05,174
and there's sure as shit
nothing I can do about it.

797
00:44:11,846 --> 00:44:14,114
All right. I heard something.

798
00:44:14,116 --> 00:44:17,784
And I don't know if it's true or not,

799
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,788
but I've thought about it
and I can't not tell you.

800
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,889
- What?
- You can't overreact, all right?

801
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:24,424
Because I don't even know
if it means anything yet.

802
00:44:24,426 --> 00:44:25,737
I'm just giving you the information.

803
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,259
Yeah, what is it?

804
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,895
The guy was white.

805
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:30,329
The guy who killed Kevin.

806
00:44:30,331 --> 00:44:32,935
Bo saw him. He said he was white.

807
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,402
What do you think, it was a race thing?

808
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:40,007
I don't know. Honestly, I don't think so.

809
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:43,076
Bo said that Kevin was hanging around
with some pretty dangerous people.

810
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:44,244
Who?

811
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,048
Do you remember that kid Noel?

812
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,551
Fat Noel from eighth grade?

813
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,951
Yeah. That's who Kevin
was hanging around with.

814
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:53,119
Phoebe, just because Noel listened
to gangster rap when we were younger

815
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:54,855
doesn't make him dangerous.

816
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,456
All right, Addison. Well,
look, that's what Bo told me.

817
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,698
He said Kevin was mixed up
with some pretty heavy people.

818
00:44:58,793 --> 00:45:00,092
So there. I told you.

819
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:02,496
Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

820
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,398
Um, do you have Noel's number?

821
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,866
Why would I have Noel's number?

822
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:08,869
I don't... I don't know.

823
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:11,840
Do you think, um... Do you
think Noel still has a Facebook?

824
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:17,043
Okay, so it's Tuesday night, around 11:15.

825
00:45:17,045 --> 00:45:19,413
<i>We're on our way to see
our old friend Noel.</i>

826
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:22,382
<i>Earlier tonight, Phoebe told
me that he might know something</i>

827
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,183
<i>about what happened to Kevin.</i>

828
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:28,487
<i>So, he invited us to this
address, 267 Otis Street.</i>

829
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:31,558
Um, this is... This is Otis Street here.

830
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,259
Wait, who are these guys? Maybe this is it.

831
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:35,128
<i>I don't think this is it.</i>

832
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,862
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
We're good. We're good.</i>

833
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,431
<i>Addison, this
is super sketchy.</i>

834
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:40,000
<i>If they see that we're,
you know, stressed out,</i>

835
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:41,201
<i>they're gonna think it's weird.</i>

836
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:43,003
<i>Just, you know, stay calm.</i>

837
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:45,538
<i>- Shit! Shit! Shit!
- Go! Go!</i>

838
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,074
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

839
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:49,043
<i>Why the hell are we down here?</i>

840
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:50,344
<i>Just give me the
address. What's the address again?</i>

841
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,911
<i>Addison, why are you turning...</i>

842
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:53,145
<i>No, that's
it. That should be it.</i>

843
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:54,514
<i>There? That's an alleyway.</i>

844
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:55,514
Relax, okay? It's gonna be fine.

845
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:57,116
I'm not gonna relax.

846
00:45:57,118 --> 00:45:58,884
It's gonna be fine. We know him.

847
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:00,454
- We don't know Noel.
- Yes, we do!

848
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:02,155
We went to school with him for so long!

849
00:46:02,157 --> 00:46:04,090
- You saw Noel five years ago.
- Five, so what?

850
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:06,360
- Five years ago.
- Do you see where we are right now?

851
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,994
Fine. You can wait in the car then.

852
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:10,099
No way. I'm not doing that.

853
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:17,404
Is this really
where Noel's friend lives?

854
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,105
What's his name again?

855
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:21,041
He said to ask
for some guy named D. Cash.

856
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:28,351
Yo, you got visitors.

857
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:33,520
Come on in.

858
00:46:33,522 --> 00:46:37,226
Take your hands out your pockets,
man. You're making me nervous.

859
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:41,494
- So, you're Addison.
- Yeah.

860
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,232
- I'm D.
- Hey, man. Good to meet you.

861
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:49,503
What's your name, baby? Who is this?

862
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:51,570
You brought me a little gift right here?

863
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,373
I'm Phoebe.

864
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,375
- Phoebe.
- Yeah.

865
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,476
- You want to have some fun?
- I'm okay.

866
00:46:57,478 --> 00:46:58,480
She's with me, man.

867
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:01,215
Mmm?

868
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:03,550
- I'm okay.
- What'd you say?

869
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:06,152
She's... She's with me.

870
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:08,487
Man, I will slap your
nose off your face, man.

871
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,123
Shut up, Addison.

872
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:12,391
Yeah, you heard her.
You better shut up, dude.

873
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:13,395
All right.

874
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:16,032
Hey, your friend's here.

875
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,967
Noel, wake up, man.

876
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:24,070
Hey, get your ass up,
Noel. They're here. Wake up.

877
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:26,308
Is that Noel?

878
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,208
Who's this bitch?

879
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,947
Hey man, it's Addison.

880
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:36,118
Addison, yeah. Good to see you, man.

881
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,454
You look like shit.

882
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,158
Well, sit down, man.

883
00:47:46,494 --> 00:47:48,661
Uh, so, how you been, man?

884
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:51,663
You high already man. I'll
take this. Put that shit down.

885
00:47:51,665 --> 00:47:53,166
It's crazy, right?

886
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:55,337
It's been, like, five years, six years.

887
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,505
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?

888
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,442
Well, um, the reason why I'm here

889
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,277
is because I wanted to
ask you about something.

890
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:07,079
- Okay. Uh...
- Uh...

891
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:10,616
The shooting in Northwest at Seven Stars.

892
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:14,022
I don't know if you know or
not, but this kid Kevin Broadus,

893
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,659
who we know, he was the one who got killed.

894
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:21,594
Yeah, what are you asking me for?

895
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:26,334
Well, I... I heard, you know,
you guys were hanging out.

896
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:30,304
So, what do you think happened?

897
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:33,172
I mean, we just heard that
the guy who did it was white...

898
00:48:33,174 --> 00:48:35,175
Enough of this shit, man.

899
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:36,745
Enough.

900
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:38,746
Noel, you got this kid's number?

901
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:40,145
No.

902
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:41,749
I have a pager.

903
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,451
You got a pager.

904
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:46,386
Where you live, son?

905
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:48,255
Uh, we're actually from Philadelphia.

906
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,355
We're just visiting.

907
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:52,358
I know where he lives. You're still
at the same place, right, Addy?

908
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Yeah. Same place.

909
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:55,972
Good. I think you kids better
get going, man. Get out of here.

910
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,197
No problem.

911
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,331
If we hear something, who knows?

912
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,201
Maybe we'll give you a call.

913
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:02,402
All right, white boy?

914
00:49:02,404 --> 00:49:05,337
Okay. Thank you. I'll send him my number.

915
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:08,509
Get your ass home, man.

916
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,078
<i>Why the hell would
you tell them where you live?</i>

917
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,813
Noel still thinks we live in Chevy Chase.

918
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:15,382
We used to be rich, remember?

919
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:17,152
Well, that's just great.

920
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:21,790
Phoebe. I'm really sorry.

921
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:23,523
- I don't want to hear it from you.
- Okay? I... I am.

922
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,293
- I don't want to hear it!
- Okay.

923
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:32,401
I need a break.

924
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,503
I can't keep doing this.

925
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:39,739
I can't be a part of this anymore.

926
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,688
Yeah, hello. Who is this?

927
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,855
Oh, yeah. Yes. This is he.

928
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,190
Yeah, no.

929
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:32,161
Thank you, sir, for calling.

930
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:34,830
Yes.

931
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,599
Okay.

932
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,268
Okay. I'll see you then.

933
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,436
Phoebe! Hi. I'm in here.

934
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:46,306
Listen, I'm hanging up, all right?
Call me if you start to panic.

935
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:47,309
Bye.

936
00:50:48,643 --> 00:50:49,875
- Good morning.
- Hey.

937
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:51,578
Can we talk for a minute?

938
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,579
We can talk later. I gotta go.

939
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:55,551
It'll only take a minute.

940
00:50:57,453 --> 00:50:58,717
Okay.

941
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:00,353
Well,

942
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:02,725
Addison Schacht's father
called me last night.

943
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:05,894
Yeah?

944
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,429
It was kind of illuminating.

945
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,697
I have to admit. I didn't...

946
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:13,599
I hated the fact that he knows

947
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:16,471
more about what my own
daughter is doing than I do.

948
00:51:17,471 --> 00:51:19,507
Did you like it over there?

949
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:21,911
I mean, yeah.

950
00:51:23,578 --> 00:51:25,777
I don't know, Mom. It was... It was fine.

951
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:27,279
Theo's a nice guy.

952
00:51:27,281 --> 00:51:29,616
Yeah, he's a nice person.

953
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:31,918
It's true.

954
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,523
- Okay, well...
- I just want to say that I'm... I'm...

955
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:39,759
What?

956
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:43,498
What I want to say is I
apologize. I'm very sorry

957
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:47,900
for not listening to you.

958
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:50,670
Sincerely, my intention was to help.

959
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,380
I'm gonna head out. I
love you, Mom. I gotta go.

960
00:52:00,348 --> 00:52:01,817
I love you, too.

961
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:05,753
<i>Okay.</i>

962
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:08,891
<i>Here we are.</i>

963
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:12,761
<i>Uh, 775 McKinley.</i>

964
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:18,399
<i>Kevin's house.</i>

965
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,500
<i>Uh...</i>

966
00:52:28,743 --> 00:52:29,978
Hi, Mr. Broadus.

967
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,847
You must be Addison.

968
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:33,849
Come inside.

969
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:47,360
Would you like something to drink?

970
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:48,998
I'm okay. Thank you.

971
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:54,534
So,

972
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,969
you're a friend of Kevin's?

973
00:52:56,971 --> 00:52:59,473
Yeah, I'd definitely say we were friends.

974
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:03,309
Enough of a friend to
go to all this trouble?

975
00:53:03,311 --> 00:53:05,645
Sorry to be blunt, but the
fact is we'd like to know

976
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:08,547
why you're taking such an interest.

977
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:11,286
Do you think the police
aren't doing their job?

978
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:15,991
- But...
- Then why are you so interested?

979
00:53:20,494 --> 00:53:22,862
Well, I...

980
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:29,371
I guess it just doesn't really make any
sense why anyone would want to kill Kevin.

981
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,014
Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's
my dad. I'll turn it off.

982
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:43,750
Walter?

983
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:45,321
Come with me.

984
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,790
Come with me.

985
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:50,592
Walter.

986
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:07,040
My son valued his privacy.

987
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:09,074
He kept us out of here for the last year.

988
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:10,976
We had to break the locks.

989
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:13,781
Then when my wife could
finally face coming in here...

990
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:22,523
She had to find this.

991
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:24,092
Open it.

992
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:25,794
Open it!

993
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:29,561
What is this?

994
00:54:29,563 --> 00:54:30,766
You want a reason?

995
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:34,701
- There's your reason.
- What is that?

996
00:54:34,703 --> 00:54:36,436
- Look at me!
- I don't know what that is!

997
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:37,603
- Why do you have a pager?
- What?

998
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:38,737
- Are you a dealer?
- No.

999
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:40,105
Were you supplying my son?

1000
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,541
- No. Absolutely not!
- Tell me!

1001
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:42,675
Walter, stop!

1002
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:43,712
Please.

1003
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:46,746
Stop! Please!

1004
00:54:55,924 --> 00:54:57,960
What do you want from us, Addison?

1005
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:02,598
You want to know why my son was killed?

1006
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:07,402
I don't know why.

1007
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:13,609
But maybe we're just going to
have to learn to live with that.

1008
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:23,016
I'm so sorry.

1009
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:25,753
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to make it worse.

Uh, Phoebe's been... Has
early acceptance into Yale next year.

1032
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:10,855
Um, excuse me.

1033
00:57:15,763 --> 00:57:17,063
- Hi.
- Hey.

1034
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,197
- Hi. What's going on?
- I need to talk to you.

1035
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,134
- Addy, this is a really bad time.
- I need to talk to you.

1036
00:57:22,136 --> 00:57:23,705
Shit. Okay, just come on.

1037
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,107
Addy, what? What's up?

1038
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,777
I just came back from Kevin's house.

1039
00:57:31,779 --> 00:57:34,579
You know he was into
drugs? Like, serious drugs?

1040
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,815
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

1041
00:57:36,817 --> 00:57:39,686
I don't know. Maybe that's what Strauss
meant by "emotional difficulties."

1042
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,087
Phoebe.

1043
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:42,857
Uh, hey.

1044
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:47,694
I'm sorry, Mom. Just one second.

1045
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:49,862
- Addy, I gotta go. I...
- Wait. I just...

1046
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:51,300
Phoebe! Please.

1047
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:55,337
Addy, what is it?

1048
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:03,345
You know, I never told you what
happened that day with my mom.

1049
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:06,047
No.

1050
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,819
She was fine.

1051
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:15,621
Nothing was wrong with her.

1052
00:58:15,623 --> 00:58:17,325
That morning, we were having breakfast,

1053
00:58:17,558 --> 00:58:20,661
and then I went to school,
and when I came back she was...

1054
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:24,299
It's okay.

1055
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:31,003
She was still sitting in the
same seat where I left her.

1056
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:35,110
At the hospital, they told
us that she'd had an aneurysm.

1057
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:39,344
Then,

1058
00:58:39,346 --> 00:58:42,848
last week, we see Kevin at the coffee shop.

1059
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,918
- He gave us our coffee.
- Addison.

1060
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,152
He gave me back my book.

1061
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:47,686
It's not the same thing.

1062
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:48,991
Yes. It is.

1063
00:58:50,023 --> 00:58:51,859
It is the same thing.

1064
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:55,930
He was fine, too.

1065
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,333
Don't you understand, Phoebe?

1066
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:02,337
I couldn't do anything about her.

1067
00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:07,038
Addison.

1068
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,212
I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to
solve something that can't be solved.

1069
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,815
Addison.

1070
00:59:56,424 --> 00:59:59,257
<i>Addison. Uh...</i>

1071
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:01,360
<i>Man, give
me the damn phone.</i>

1072
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:03,029
<i>Yo, it's D.</i>

1073
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:05,398
<i>We got something you
might want to know, man.</i>

1074
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,069
<i>Meet us in an hour.</i>

1075
01:00:22,282 --> 01:00:24,817
Hey. No alcohol for minors.

1076
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:27,022
No, we're good. Kid's with me.

1077
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:37,195
So, where's the girl at?

1078
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:39,033
You said you got something for me?

1079
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,803
We got something for you. It's right here.

1080
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:49,308
Just little errands, man. No big deal.

1081
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,446
Look, you do this for us,
you get a name. That simple.

1082
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:58,016
Are you kidding me? I'm
not... I'm not gonna do that.

1083
01:00:58,018 --> 01:01:00,087
Do I look like I'm kidding, hmm?

1084
01:01:03,123 --> 01:01:06,494
Hmm? Okay, well, you don't want to
know nothing, man. I'm out of here.

1085
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,228
Go back.

1086
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,398
Hold on.

1087
01:01:13,467 --> 01:01:15,503
Thatta boy. Yeah.

1088
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:20,105
Now we talking.

1089
01:01:20,107 --> 01:01:21,808
You're saying if I do this for you,

1090
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,045
you're going to tell me
who killed Kevin Broadus?

1091
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:26,244
No.

1092
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:29,317
But I will tell you the guy
who knows the guy who did it.

1093
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:33,554
Okay. And...

1094
01:01:33,788 --> 01:01:35,186
Where do I have to take it?

1095
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,322
Back to your neighborhood.

1096
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,291
We can't go down there, man.

1097
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:41,125
Not in Chevy.

1098
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:43,929
Police would be on our
ass so tough. Sniff us out.

1099
01:01:43,931 --> 01:01:45,331
But a kid like you?

1100
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,465
Golden.

1101
01:01:46,467 --> 01:01:48,170
Yeah, and crispy.

1102
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:53,371
No. I'm gonna need a little more info.

1103
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:56,509
I told you. I told you.
Addy's a quick learner, man.

1104
01:01:56,511 --> 01:01:58,444
He's a quick learner. He ain't
even got hair on his nuts.

1105
01:01:58,446 --> 01:01:59,911
Look at him.

1106
01:01:59,913 --> 01:02:01,380
Give him... Give him a taste.

1107
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:03,148
Give him a taste.
Okay. Let me tell you.

1108
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,918
There's a guy, you know. He
comes down, hangs out sometimes.

1109
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,520
Smack dealer from Maryland.

1110
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:09,322
He's out of his mind. He's...

1111
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:10,523
You know, he comes into D.C.
and he parties at the clubs.

1112
01:02:10,525 --> 01:02:12,594
- That's what he likes to do.
- Yeah.

1113
01:02:12,826 --> 01:02:14,771
And according to our friend, Kevin
was down there to buy some shit.

1114
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:16,395
So dealer was sitting in
his big chair, you know.

1115
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:18,998
He's sitting in the room with
all his homies at a table.

1116
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,534
You know, he see Kevin. He decides
to pick on him a little bit.

1117
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,503
Nothing too serious.

1118
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:25,471
The next thing you know, Kevin
went right back at the guy,

1119
01:02:25,473 --> 01:02:28,206
and shit, man. Like he
was going back and forth.

1120
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,541
It made the guy look bad.

1121
01:02:29,543 --> 01:02:31,076
Bad. Real bad.

1122
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:33,145
This kid disrespected the wrong guy.

1123
01:02:33,147 --> 01:02:35,248
Disrespected him, man.
I don't even know what Kevin said,

1124
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,483
but he said something
because he got a big laugh.

1125
01:02:38,485 --> 01:02:41,922
I mean, he... He signed
his own death warrant. Shit.

1126
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,991
When... When was this?

1127
01:02:45,993 --> 01:02:48,262
A couple of days before he got shot.

1128
01:02:52,299 --> 01:02:56,434
You're saying that all he did

1129
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:59,174
was say the wrong thing to the wrong guy?

1130
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,243
Wrong damn thing, man.

1131
01:03:38,011 --> 01:03:39,313
Oh, my God.

1132
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:54,696
Addison?

1133
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:56,395
Alex?

1134
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:57,663
- Uh...
- What the hell are you doing here?

1135
01:03:57,665 --> 01:03:59,098
Is this 27... I think I have the...

1136
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,099
Shit. Really?

1137
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:03,101
Alex, who is it?

1138
01:04:03,103 --> 01:04:05,371
Uh, okay. Okay. Um...

1139
01:04:05,373 --> 01:04:08,007
Just act normal like I
left my sports bag at school

1140
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,074
and you're dropping it off as a favor.

1141
01:04:09,076 --> 01:04:10,509
This for you?

1142
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,110
Just give it to me for God's sake.

1143
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:14,413
All right. Thank you. Bye!

1144
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:17,282
No, you're funny. Get
the hell out of here. Go. All right.

1145
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:18,386
See you later!

1146
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:26,692
Hey, D. I did it. What's the name?

1147
01:04:26,694 --> 01:04:29,395
<i>What name? What
are you talking about, man?</i>

1148
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:31,262
Come on, D. What's
the name? We had a deal.

1149
01:04:31,264 --> 01:04:33,398
<i>Don't rush me, man.</i>

1150
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,168
<i>Now, the guy we told you
about, his name is Mike.</i>

1151
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,003
<i>Mike Lorriner.</i>

1152
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:40,072
<i>He was there when Kevin got
into it with that dealer.</i>

1153
01:04:40,074 --> 01:04:41,794
And what's the address?

1154
01:04:47,147 --> 01:04:49,348
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Phoebe! Phoebe. Mike Lorriner.

1155
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,518
Write this down, okay? Mike
Lorriner. 9756 Fork Lute Road.

1156
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,755
This is the guy who knows
who did it. D. just told me.

1157
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:56,688
<i>Okay. So you already
called the police, right?</i>

1158
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,556
No, no, no. It's fine. I'm
just gonna go talk to him.

1159
01:04:58,558 --> 01:05:00,326
<i>Addison, don't be
stupid. Do not go there.</i>

1160
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:02,427
<i>Just give the police the
address and let them go.</i>

1161
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:04,429
- Phoebe, I got it covered.
- <i>Addison!</i>

1162
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:33,184
Hey.

1163
01:06:33,186 --> 01:06:35,223
Uh, hi. Are you Mike Lorriner?

1164
01:06:37,491 --> 01:06:39,257
- Who are you?
- Um...

1165
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:43,628
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to bother you, but...

1166
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:47,299
I heard that you knew something
about what happened in D.C.

1167
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:48,800
a few days ago.

1168
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:51,304
You know, the kid who got
shot at the coffee shop.

1169
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,605
D.C.? I don't know anything, man.

1170
01:06:53,607 --> 01:06:55,275
It's about Kevin Broadus.

1171
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:58,677
Uh, he was a friend of mine.

1172
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,746
I don't know what you're talking
about, man. Get out of here.

1173
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:02,348
I heard that he pissed off a drug
dealer or something, and you...

1174
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,349
Do you know the guy?

1175
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:06,617
I don't know, I just... I just...
What did I just say to you?

1176
01:07:06,619 --> 01:07:08,420
Did you hear me?

1177
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:11,655
I... I said, I... I...
I don't know nothing.

1178
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:13,659
- All right? Now... Now just get...
- All right.

1179
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:15,194
Get off my property.

1180
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:17,596
Okay. Sorry, man. I'll go. I'm leaving.

1181
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:20,869
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Who... Who gave you my name?

1182
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:23,871
Who... Who told you to come here?

1183
01:07:24,103 --> 01:07:25,770
I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay?

1184
01:07:25,772 --> 01:07:27,508
Of course it was a mistake.

1185
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,612
Who told you?

1186
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:34,645
Uh...

1187
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:36,482
This guy I know, D. Cash. He just...
He said that you were there when...

1188
01:07:36,484 --> 01:07:39,219
D. Cash? D. Cash gave you my name?

1189
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:42,286
Yeah.

1190
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:43,521
Okay.

1191
01:07:43,523 --> 01:07:44,655
Okay.

1192
01:07:44,657 --> 01:07:46,458
Uh...

1193
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,626
Okay. Well, you... You... You tell D. Cash

1194
01:07:48,628 --> 01:07:51,199
that he probably shouldn't
be running his mouth.

1195
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:54,599
- You got it?
- Okay.

1196
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:57,570
I'm gonna just go now. Okay?

1197
01:07:57,572 --> 01:07:58,737
Whoa, what... What is that?

1198
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:00,675
What is that light?

1199
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,746
Are you... are you filming this?

1200
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:10,351
My man. Are we making a movie?

1201
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:15,190
Well, I... I guess I'm
ready for my close-up.

1202
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:18,357
Look, man.

1203
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:19,759
If you don't know anything,
it's fine. I can just leave.

1204
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:22,629
Do you think I will not use this?

1205
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:26,401
Bang!

1206
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:29,870
That was pretty good, huh?

1207
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:37,309
You don't even know who
that dealer was, do you?

1208
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:39,947
The one your boy Kevin pissed off.

1209
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,919
That was D., you idiot.

1210
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:50,258
Oh, he played you.

1211
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:54,493
See, now I'm in a spot.

1212
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:56,528
Uh, you know, I... I...

1213
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,267
I did that ungrateful asshole a favor.

1214
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:05,807
And this is the thanks I get?

1215
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:13,280
Well, fuck the both of you.

1216
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:26,685
<i>Why is that? Well, question
seven on the application asks you</i>

1217
01:10:26,687 --> 01:10:28,820
<i>to tell them what your best
and worst qualities are,</i>

1218
01:10:28,822 --> 01:10:31,590
<i>but they only give you
three-and-a-half inches.</i>

1219
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:33,160
<i>Three-and-a-half
inches on a page.</i>

1220
01:10:33,392 --> 01:10:35,627
<i>I'm sorry, but my worst
qualities took up a lot more</i>

1221
01:10:35,629 --> 01:10:37,061
<i>than three-and-a-half
inches.</i>

1222
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:38,796
<i>So I decided to write
a few extra pages.</i>

1223
01:10:38,798 --> 01:10:40,565
<i>How many?</i>

1224
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:42,734
<i>- Twenty-two to be exact.
- Wow!</i>

1225
01:10:42,736 --> 01:10:44,103
<i>- I realize that might seem a bit excessive.
- It does.</i>

1226
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:45,703
<i>However,
how are you expected</i>

1227
01:10:45,705 --> 01:10:47,905
<i>to express the very
essence of your being</i>

1228
01:10:47,907 --> 01:10:50,810
<i>and your views on how
insanely crazy this world is</i>

1229
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:52,052
<i>in such a tiny space on a page?</i>

1230
01:11:02,623 --> 01:11:04,088
He's fine.

1231
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,726
- He's very drowsy, but he's stable.
- Okay.

1232
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:09,048
Yeah, he's going to be all right.

1233
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:12,730
Well...

1234
01:11:12,732 --> 01:11:15,069
Hi. Sorry. He's asking for Phoebe.

1235
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:20,608
Okay.

1236
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:28,412
Hmm.

1237
01:11:28,414 --> 01:11:30,082
You want some coffee or something?

1238
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:31,552
Coffee? No.

1239
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:39,960
Phoebe's here.

1240
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:45,767
Thank you.

1241
01:11:51,806 --> 01:11:52,839
Hi.

1242
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:54,575
Hi.

1243
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:03,150
You smell nice.

1244
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,821
Did they find Lorriner?

1245
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:11,657
Yeah.

1246
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:14,562
They caught him. Somewhere in Virginia.

1247
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:19,732
He still had the gun on him, Addy.

1248
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,136
They think it's the same
gun he used to kill Kevin.

1249
01:12:24,538 --> 01:12:26,941
And they got D. Cash and Noel, too.

1250
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:33,147
The Broaduses know.

1251
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:37,017
They know who killed their son.

1252
01:12:38,651 --> 01:12:40,685
You talked to them?

1253
01:12:40,687 --> 01:12:43,087
Yeah, they came by.

1254
01:12:43,089 --> 01:12:45,025
They left that letter for you.

1255
01:12:48,062 --> 01:12:50,097
I'm still so mad at you.

1256
01:12:51,499 --> 01:12:52,600
I know.

1257
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:56,771
I should thank you.

1258
01:12:57,972 --> 01:12:59,703
Why?

1259
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:02,776
Because if it weren't for
you, I'd probably be dead.

1260
01:13:05,612 --> 01:13:08,947
Really? Because I totally
thought you had it covered.
