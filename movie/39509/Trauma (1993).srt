1
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>Hello?</i>

2
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,500
<i>Hi, sweetheart.
When am I gonna see you?</i>

3
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:56,116
<i>Huh-uh. I won't
be ready by then.</i>

4
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,051
<i>I've got one last patient.</i>

5
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:01,697
I know it's late, but...

6
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:05,245
<i>This is someone new.
I couldn't say no.</i>

7
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:07,719
They were really insistent,
what could I do?

8
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,724
I... I've got healing
powers in my hands.

9
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,732
Mm-hmm. For you too, babe.

10
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,736
But with you, I'm rough.

11
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,629
Hi, welcome. Please come in.

12
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,193
<i>Before we begin,</i>

13
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:27,279
I like to get a thorough
history of all new patients.

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,621
If you'll fill out this questionnaire...
put your coat over there...

15
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,422
Fill out this questionnaire for me.
We can get started.

16
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,802
So, from what you
said on the phone

17
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:37,840
it sounds like you
have a herniated disk.

18
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,916
I know you're in a lot of pain.

19
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,319
I haven't treated
you before, have I?

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,723
You look familiar.

21
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,530
I almost never forget a face.

22
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,385
- Give me your hand.
- Leave me alone!

23
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,119
Come on, I can help you.

24
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,244
Come on! What do you
want to do, kill yourself?

25
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,643
- Yeah.
- No. Come on, come on, come on.

26
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:22,349
Yeah, that's it.

27
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,593
I don't want your help!
Let me go.

28
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,467
- Let me go, please.
- <i>No no no.</i>

29
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:29,002
- Shh, shh.
- Oh my god.

30
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,046
<i>Stay with me! Stay with me!</i>

31
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,850
<i>Hey hey hey hey!</i>

32
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,194
Come on, stop struggling.

33
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,961
I can help you.
You don't want to do this.

34
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:41,347
- Yes, I want to.
- Everything's gonna be okay. Just give me your hand.

35
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,093
- Come over here.
- I want to.

36
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:49,202
That's it. Come on.

37
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:52,409
Okay. Oh, yeah.
Oh my god.

38
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,185
- Oh, god.
- What are you looking at?

39
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,594
I was looking at this beautiful
bracelet you got there.

40
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:04,173
- You want to get something to eat?
- I had lunch.

41
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:05,791
We could get some ice cream.

42
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,190
- No, I gotta go away.
- What's your hurry?

43
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,194
What's it to you?

44
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:13,402
I thought maybe we could get
some coffee or something.

45
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,375
No?

46
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,621
Hey, man, why don't you just mind
your own business, all right?

47
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,027
Everything's all right.

48
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,445
Everything's okay, huh?

49
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:27,449
Come on, don't worry.

50
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,057
Get in the car.
Everything's gonna be okay.

51
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,738
- There you go.
- Thank you.

52
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,731
- You want this one?
- No, thanks.

53
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,865
Well, then...

54
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,813
Which one do I eat first?

55
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:52,759
- They both look so good, don't they?
- No, not to me.

56
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,368
- You give this much grief to your parents?
- I don't see my parents.

57
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,445
- You don't live at home?
- No, I live on my own.

58
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,892
- I've got my own money.
- How old are you, 14 or 15?

59
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:06,697
<i>16.</i>

60
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,142
Still go to school?

61
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:11,146
Stop grilling me.

62
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,050
Stop, okay?

63
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,325
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,005
It's just that...

65
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,414
I used to have some track
marks like that myself.

66
00:06:24,424 --> 00:06:26,438
You don't
know anything about me.

67
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,034
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

68
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,409
If you've got a drug
problem, I can help you out.

69
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,816
I don't have a problem with drugs.
I just...

70
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,663
Are you happy? Hmm?

71
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,168
Are you happy
that I'm eating? Hmm?

72
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,072
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fine.

73
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,548
I'm going to the bathroom.

74
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,595
Hold it, miss. We
want to talk to you.

75
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:38,401
Me? I haven't done anything.
You're making a mistake.

76
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,050
I'm a visiting
student from Romania.

77
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:43,651
- Looks like we got the winning ticket.
- I haven't committed any crime.

78
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:46,066
- We just want to take you back to the Farraday Clinic.
- No! No!

79
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,471
- Aura Petrescu, come on.
- No. No, please.

80
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:51,276
Don't take me back,
I got lots of money.

81
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,280
I can give you thousands
of dollars. Please!

82
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,285
Don't worry. We're not
gonna take you back.

83
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:58,441
- The law says we gotta bring you to your parents.
- We'll take you to the clinic.

84
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:01,638
No! No!

85
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,723
- We have to take you to your parents.
- No! Fuck you!

86
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:07,158
You can't do that!

87
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,132
Break it up. Everything's
under control.

88
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,610
<i>Break it up, guys.
Let's move on.</i>

89
00:08:21,307 --> 00:08:23,321
Little bitch.

90
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,523
Home sweet home, huh?

91
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,174
<i>Yes, what do you want?</i>

92
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,579
Good afternoon, we're from
Metro youth services.

93
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,953
<i>- Yes?
- We have aura.</i>

94
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,398
<i>Aura? You have aura?</i>

95
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,463
Aura!

96
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:57,779
Oh, my poor little baby!

97
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,515
I am the mother
of this difficult

98
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:04,132
but very beautiful little girl.

99
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:07,739
My thanks to both you gentlemen
for bringing my baby back home.

100
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,144
<i>Very kind, thank you.</i>

101
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:17,198
It's for your own good that
we put you in the clinic.

102
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,673
That's where you stay...
You understand?

103
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,678
...Until <i>we decide.</i>

104
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:24,092
Mamica, I hate the cell.

105
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,867
Please don't make me
go back. I'll die.

106
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:31,246
Look who's come back to us.

107
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,250
Two policeman brought her home.

108
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:38,061
What a surprise.

109
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,881
Always
making trouble for your mother.

110
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:44,082
I'm sorry, Tata, but they're
horrible at the clinic.

111
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,486
They're trying to kill me.

112
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:49,302
Take her upstairs.

113
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,307
Bring her some tea.

114
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,674
This is too much.
Your mother's very angry.

115
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:07,959
- I know, Tata, but please let me stay...
- aura, enough.

116
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,177
- I swear I'll be better.
- Your mother has a lot to think about.

117
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,842
- Another seance?
- A big one.

118
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,322
I'll bring you
some dinner later, huh?

119
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,326
Try to eat.

120
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,731
- Make your mother happy.
- I'm not hungry.

121
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,736
Aura... you have to eat.

122
00:10:25,746 --> 00:10:28,562
- No.
- That's why you're going back to the clinic.

123
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:32,529
No. No!

124
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,632
Good evening!

125
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:05,530
- Hello.
- So good to see you. Let me take your umbrella.

126
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,071
It's a foul night, Stefan, but
maybe the spirits will like it.

127
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:11,376
She's very good.

128
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:16,958
When Nicolas starts talking...
Watch my hands.

129
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:21,537
- I'm the one who telephoned.
- Ah!

130
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,816
Oh my god.

131
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,517
Am I late?

132
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,619
Aura?

133
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,507
Where's George?

134
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,531
Will we be able
to contact my mother?

135
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:57,198
- Shh!
- We have so many questions.

136
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,004
<i>We, who are gathered here.</i>

137
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,550
Nicolas...

138
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,155
My precious...

139
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,762
Will you help us?

140
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:16,146
<i>Nicolas...</i>

141
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:18,631
<i>Are you here with us tonight?</i>

142
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,074
<i>I am searching for you.</i>

143
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,967
Let... me...

144
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:35,144
In!

145
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:43,069
This is not Nicolas.

146
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,576
<i>Some other soul
is here with us tonight,</i>

147
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,912
trying to break though.

148
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:55,504
<i>Some... some soul.</i>

149
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:59,582
One of... Those who follow...

150
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,456
The recent dead,

151
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:04,031
who followed their killers.

152
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:07,238
Speak!

153
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,643
- My head.
<i>- My head.</i>

154
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,995
- Took my head.
- <i>Took my head.</i>

155
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,747
- Murdered me!
- <i>Murdered me!</i>

156
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:25,655
A monster with a noose.

157
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,875
I wasn't the first,

158
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:34,883
and I won't be the last.

159
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:41,537
I know who the killer is!

160
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:48,361
I'm the only one who knows!

161
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:53,070
The killer is present!

162
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,666
- Don't break the chain!
- <i>Don't move!</i>

163
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,640
I see you!

164
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,917
<i>You can't hide from me!</i>

165
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:09,692
<i>I know you!</i>

166
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:16,346
Mama!

167
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,882
<i>Mama!</i>

168
00:15:18,892 --> 00:15:20,254
Mama!

169
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:23,630
Tata! Stop!

170
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,605
<i>Stop!</i>

171
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:32,860
Papa!

172
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,922
<i>Aura!</i>

173
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,425
Dad! Mama!

174
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:48,891
What did you see?
You've got to tell me!

175
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:50,764
You must have seen something!

176
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,798
Who was it?

177
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,673
I... I didn't see anything.

178
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,919
He had... he had

179
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,224
their heads
in front of his face.

180
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:06,576
Check these weird
things out on the wall.

181
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,581
They may be something
from the occult.

182
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:13,060
It is getting late.
Take me home.

183
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:20,053
There was something wrong tonight from the
beginning. I could feel it in the room.

184
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:22,268
So neither of you
heard anything?

185
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:38,139
Did she have any other
relatives besides her parents?

186
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,503
No one.

187
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:43,450
<i>You know, captain,
until her recent escape,</i>

188
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:45,454
<i>sh... she was under my care.</i>

189
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:48,129
- Is that so?
- <i>She was a patient of mine</i>

190
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,404
at the Farraday Clinic.

191
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,881
- It was her parents' wish.
- What was wrong with her?

192
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,556
I'm afraid I'm not
at Liberty to say, captain.

193
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,964
<i>But it has nothing
to do with this case.</i>

194
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:01,787
We're prepared to take her back.

195
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:04,913
<i>Sh... she needs our help.</i>

196
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:09,061
Well, tomorrow you go downtown and
file papers with youth services.

197
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,005
<i>I'm sure they'll
hand her over to you</i>

198
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,611
after we're done
questioning her.

199
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,544
A bizarre double-murder brings
a madman's total to four.

200
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:28,349
Striking steel workers go
back to the bargaining table.

201
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,429
<i>Warm weather price-hikes put
a dent in your pocketbook.</i>

202
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,848
Sounds like you could have
some fun with that one.

203
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,247
They say they're calling
him "the headhunter."

204
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:40,053
So I've heard.

205
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,257
I suppose grace told you, huh?

206
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:44,271
Yeah, we communicate
now and then.

207
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:47,077
I suppose she told you
what the guy looks like?

208
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:49,081
Don't worry about it,
nobody saw you, mark.

209
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:52,689
Oh, very funny!
You're a laugh-riot.

210
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,916
Now could we do some actual
work around here, please?

211
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,838
Arnie, what are you doing?

212
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,843
Besides putting on pounds.

213
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,816
Ha-ha. We've got a, uh...

214
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:05,363
Leading composite using
last night's KKK rally...

215
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,510
- - <i>...And
the space shuttle landing</i>

216
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:11,646
and the president's
trip to Belgrade

217
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,592
hmm. Any sex?

218
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,997
Hmm. Probably. The first
lady's not going.

219
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,600
Forget it. I think there was sex

220
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,816
on that tour de France item.
Go with that.

221
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:25,654
- I am <i>not going on in front of this.
- Welcome back, grace.</i>

222
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:29,702
Can't we go with something
a little more stylized?

223
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,007
I did do this but it's
not finished yet.

224
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,081
- Oh, much better.
- No, that is not better.

225
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,086
I'd prefer just plain type.

226
00:19:36,096 --> 00:19:38,105
Maybe something
like "headhunter."

227
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,064
- Perfect, great idea.
- Keep it tasteful.

228
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,079
I have to get back.

229
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,686
Ben needs me to rehearse
some of his ad libs.

230
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:54,612
Hey, grace, that is
a fabulous outfit on you.

231
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,516
I know what to give her.

232
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:59,623
<i>- What?
- Big blood-red letters.</i>

233
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,108
Three feet high.

234
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,722
Hello.

235
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:12,127
Yes, it is.

236
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,873
Of course I want it back.
Where the hell are you?

237
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,822
I only took $6.

238
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:22,227
I... I needed some food.

239
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,502
I've been wandering
around since last night.

240
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:28,209
- How'd you find me?
- Your I.D. Card.

241
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,515
I tried your home first.

242
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,539
You haven't got any place to go?

243
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,205
- No.
- You looking for a place to stay?

244
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:39,482
No. I need something else.

245
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,886
You kept trying to help me,

246
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:44,161
so I thought...

247
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:46,797
- Okay, so you need some more money.
- <i>No.</i>

248
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:52,317
<i>What?</i>

249
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,921
I want to go home.

250
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:57,798
You want to go home?
I'll take you home.

251
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:03,219
<i>Come up to my office and call your parents.
It's gonna be okay.</i>

252
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,058
No?

253
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:11,477
You don't want to come upstairs
and call your parents?

254
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:16,687
Hey. Hey hey hey hey.

255
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:19,101
It's okay. It's okay. Look...

256
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:21,506
I'm gonna go upstairs and
get my keys, all right?

257
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,638
You okay?

258
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,155
Two more decapitation victims
were claimed last night

259
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:29,191
<i>at a home adjacent to Inverness
Park on the northwest side.</i>

260
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:31,866
<i>The victims are believed
to be professional mediums.</i>

261
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,810
<i>Stefan and Adriana Petrescu.</i>

262
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:36,485
<i>Captain Travis, do
you know if the victims</i>

263
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,720
were randomly chosen
or part of a pattern?

264
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:41,195
<i>All we know is the victims
were paralyzed by a blow</i>

265
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:44,402
<i>to the spine and were probably
conscious during their murder.</i>

266
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,426
See, they never get anything
out of these assholes.

267
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:49,351
- Guys, I'm gonna take off.
- ...From Romania 10 years ago

268
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:52,768
and are survived by their
only daughter, aura, age 16.

269
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,371
Tell grace I had to leave.

270
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,607
I got a lead
on a real good story.

271
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:59,533
Their daughter has also been
missing since last evening.

272
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:03,811
I don't know why you
want to go home, aura.

273
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:06,436
I need to get some clothes.

274
00:22:06,446 --> 00:22:08,379
How do you know my name?

275
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,915
I saw it on the news.

276
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,333
Hey, I'm really sorry.

277
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,039
I can't imagine how
you're feeling right now.

278
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,982
<i>Don't you have some relatives</i>

279
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,387
<i>or family you could
go stay with?</i>

280
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,392
Look, it's none
of your business.

281
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:28,008
<i>I'm just trying to help you out.</i>

282
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,572
I don't need your help.

283
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,317
I don't think we should
be going to this house.

284
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,992
I think you should be
going to see a doctor.

285
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,866
Doctors!

286
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,870
Look... look...

287
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,874
I don't need more doctors.

288
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,892
I just got out
of the Farraday Clinic.

289
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:46,897
I really don't
need more doctors.

290
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,706
I need answers.

291
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:53,681
I want to know
who killed my parents.

292
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,164
Stop here! Don't park too near.

293
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:54,092
Power's out.

294
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,917
Must have been that
storm last night.

295
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,517
You sure you want to do this?

296
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,932
Yes.

297
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,337
All right, show me
where the basement is.

298
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,342
It's down here.

299
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,033
It's in here, I think.

300
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,813
All right.

301
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,414
I'll be right back.

302
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:51,677
Mama. Mama!

303
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:09,872
<i>And I won't be the last!</i>

304
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:15,755
<i>I know who the killer is!</i>

305
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:22,178
<i>I'm the only who knows!</i>

306
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,986
<i>The killer is present!</i>

307
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,810
I... I barely recognize.

308
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:37,418
Recognize who?

309
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,827
My mother.

310
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:45,053
It's the first time
I've heard this.

311
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,050
It's okay.

312
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:51,055
Hey.

313
00:26:51,065 --> 00:26:53,068
It's okay.

314
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,940
Come on! Come on!

315
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:29,371
What happened?

316
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,315
Someone broke my fucking window.

317
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,389
Must have been a warning.

318
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,194
- God damn it!
- The police!

319
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:38,199
Okay, just stay down. Stay down.

320
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:55,152
<i>Hi. I hear you've
got a big story for me.</i>

321
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:58,390
<i>Trying to muscle in
on my turf, huh?</i>

322
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,215
<i>Listen, call me at the station
if you're back by 10:00.</i>

323
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,812
<i>Then I'm on the air again.</i>

324
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,816
<i>Bye.</i>

325
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,557
Gabriel, what are you doing?

326
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,363
- Go to bed.
- Mom...

327
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:57,768
Some lady in that house
keeps looking at me.

328
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,381
She doesn't move.

329
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:01,787
Go to bed.

330
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:14,121
There's no lady there.

331
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:26,555
Yes, there is.

332
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,771
She keeps looking at me.
A black lady.

333
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:33,779
I'm sorry to call so late
Mr. Farraday,

334
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,783
but you've been out.

335
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:38,189
<i>Well, we had a
board meeting tonight.</i>

336
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,808
<i>One subject I need
hardly tell you</i>

337
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,666
<i>was that young woman
who escaped.</i>

338
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:43,940
Aura Petrescu.

339
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:47,557
<i>Dr. Judd, the clinic doesn't
need this kind of publicity.</i>

340
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:49,561
Leave it to me, Mr.
Farraday.

341
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:51,837
I'll find her.

342
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:55,714
<i>My head...</i>

343
00:29:57,247 --> 00:30:00,925
<i>Took... My... Head...</i>

344
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:19,682
- Hello?
<i>- I was thinking about coming over tonight.</i>

345
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:24,260
Not tonight, grace.

346
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:27,077
<i>You don't want to see me?</i>

347
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,485
Well, actually, there's...

348
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:34,692
There's someone else here.
She's asleep in the other room.

349
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:37,106
<i>Someone I know?</i>

350
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:39,110
No.

351
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,114
This girl I met, she...

352
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:43,118
She had no place else to go.

353
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:45,123
<i>Well, goodbye then.</i>

354
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:47,136
Hey...

355
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,241
Grace.

356
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,436
She told me she's anorexic.

357
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,843
I don't know why I didn't
figure it out myself.

358
00:31:45,844 --> 00:31:47,847
<i>Don't beat yourself up about it.</i>

359
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:49,851
<i>Anorexics are always secretive.</i>

360
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:52,658
<i>They're good little girls.
They hide their problems.</i>

361
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:54,601
Really?

362
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:56,775
What else?

363
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:59,250
Well, let's see...

364
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,056
Deeply attached
to an unstable mother.

365
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:04,461
Upper-middle class girls.
Boys too, actually.

366
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:07,276
Usually the brighter
artistic ones.

367
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:10,082
Let's see. What else? Oh, yeah.

368
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,328
- How can I forget? Sex.
- What about sex?

369
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,034
<i>- Did you get in her pants?
- Arnie, she's just a kid.</i>

370
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,809
- <i>Okay, did you get in her play clothes?
- No!</i>

371
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,846
Didn't think so.
Anorexics are afraid of sex.

372
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,865
They want to get back
their childhood

373
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,463
before all
the scary stuff started.

374
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,737
Something like eight million
of 'em out there.

375
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,811
How do you know all this?

376
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:32,447
'Cause I watch Oprah and Donahue.
Doesn't everybody?

377
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:35,493
- <i>No, I don't watch those shows.
- Ah, there's your problem.</i>

378
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:38,128
This is television!
This is a big deal!

379
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:40,402
This is not something
you can just walk in...

380
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:43,579
See, you should be watching that
thing and eating this stuff.

381
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,096
That's one way
to fend off anorexia.

382
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,972
Look, seriously, your friend
may be in real danger.

383
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:53,408
<i>A lot of anorexics die.
A lot of 'em commit suicide.</i>

384
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:55,013
<i>Worst part is...</i>

385
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,026
She won't let you help her.

386
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:59,330
I mean, she wants you to
help her, but she won't.

387
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:02,236
How did she end up that way?

388
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,080
Trouble with her parents.

389
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:07,286
It's said these girls will even
have like a classic dream.

390
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,963
She'll dream her father's leaning
over her about to kiss her.

391
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,616
Catocala promethea.

392
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:34,632
Telea Polyphemus.

393
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:21,867
Steve, we are ready.

394
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:28,926
Grace, can you hear me?

395
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:31,315
That little girl...
is she still with you?

396
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:32,215
Yes.

397
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,328
You don't seem so sure.

398
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,228
Believe me, I have
nothing to hide.

399
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:38,362
If you'd lke, you
can see me tonight.

400
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,739
Who knows?
Maybe I will.

401
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:44,514
Hi there.
How are you?

402
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:48,619
<i>David, is it you? That same scene
keeps running through my mind.</i>

403
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:52,807
I'll be back soon. Would you
like me to bring you something?

404
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,186
<i>No. I just ate.</i>

405
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:56,893
Really?

406
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,996
<i>Yes. You won't believe the mess
I made. Roast chicken with fries.</i>

407
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,015
<i>I'm full. I am tired
now. I am going to sleep.</i>

408
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:08,887
Aura...

409
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:10,861
<i>...I am a little
worried about you.</i>

410
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:14,793
No, you shouldn't be. I'll see
you later. Ok? Bye.

411
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,172
She just cooked
herself a meal, Arnie,

412
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:34,161
she's got to be making progress.

413
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,515
No. She was probably
lying, David.

414
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,736
They're not easy to cure. That's
why a lot of them end up dead.

415
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:46,167
<i>A lot of anorexics die.</i>

416
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,239
<i>There's something like eight
million of them out there.</i>

417
00:38:57,874 --> 00:39:00,557
<i>Deeply attached
to an unstable mother.</i>

418
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,900
<i>She'll dream her father
is leaning over her</i>

419
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,266
<i>about to kiss her.</i>

420
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,240
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

421
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,645
No, I heard something.

422
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:29,694
What was it?

423
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,679
- She's gone.
- <i>So?</i>

424
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,567
So, I'm going after her.

425
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:37,455
Don't be ridiculous.

426
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:39,383
She's not that easily shocked.

427
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:42,494
Grace, come on,
she's just a kid.

428
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:46,082
<i>She's exploiting you
like everybody else.</i>

429
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,093
Believe me, grace, she needs help.
She's suicidal.

430
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,114
<i>She's been in that goddamn Farraday
Clinic for the past month.</i>

431
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:54,440
The Farraday Clinic? No kidding.

432
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,985
Yeah, they abused her,
so she ran away.

433
00:40:56,995 --> 00:41:00,343
She's a manipulative
little psycho.

434
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:02,331
<i>Let her go.</i>

435
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,518
- Fuck you, grace.
- <i>David!</i>

436
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,060
<i>David! Damn!</i>

437
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,190
No.

438
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,599
I'm sorry about last night.

439
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,999
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

440
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,909
Are you angry with me?

441
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,239
No.

442
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,040
- Are you angry with me?
- No, I'm not angry at you.

443
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,849
Okay, good, 'cause
I have to go to work.

444
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,879
Why?

445
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,680
Why? Because I have to pretend
like I'm a regular person.

446
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,089
Why don't you go over
to the farmer's market?

447
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,889
Find some vegetables, some
fruit that looks good to you

448
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,490
and buy it.

449
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,859
Okay.

450
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,700
I'll try to make you dinner.

451
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,080
Aura! Aura! You have to
talk to me. Don't be afraid.

452
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,780
I am here to help you.
Aura! Aura! Aura!

453
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,608
Do you see it?

454
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,455
I told you, you can get everything
you need from watching TV.

455
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:17,507
The 18th, the 23rd and the 29th.

456
00:44:17,508 --> 00:44:19,863
<i>Don't you get it?</i>

457
00:44:19,864 --> 00:44:22,378
My god.

458
00:44:24,377 --> 00:44:26,872
<i>He only kills when it's raining.</i>

459
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:30,042
So stay out of the rain.

460
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,030
Yeah?

461
00:44:32,031 --> 00:44:34,019
Yeah, he's here.
Hang on. It's for you.

462
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:36,425
It's your new girlfriend.

463
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:42,776
<i>David, I went to that market</i>

464
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:44,505
<i>and there I saw Dr. Judd!</i>

465
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:46,493
<i>He chased me. I ran away and...</i>

466
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:50,072
<i>No! No! Let me go!</i>

467
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:10,620
Aura?

468
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,189
Aura, are you back there?

469
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:21,086
Aura?

470
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:22,716
She's not here

471
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:25,500
what do you mean she's not here?
Where the hell is she?

472
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:28,253
Well, I was concerned.

473
00:45:28,254 --> 00:45:31,037
Concerned about you.

474
00:45:31,038 --> 00:45:33,423
Concerned about her.

475
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,829
You told me yourself
the child was suicidal.

476
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,889
So I did what any normal
responsible person would do.

477
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:45,202
I called the Farraday Clinic.

478
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:47,985
They just came
and took her away.

479
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:49,577
<i>You called the Farraday Clinic!?</i>

480
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:56,426
I hope you're
ashamed of yourself.

481
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,934
Who'd have thought
we'd meet again so soon?

482
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:09,149
Shall I attribute it
to my charm and personality?

483
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,137
Sit.

484
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:15,083
You can go. Miss Petrescu
is an old friend.

485
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,807
Aura...

486
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,292
You're all alone now,

487
00:46:20,293 --> 00:46:22,250
and I must take care of you.

488
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:26,694
But everything depends upon you.

489
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:30,273
On whether you're willing
to look inside yourself

490
00:46:30,283 --> 00:46:33,065
and confront the past.

491
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:35,054
No, you're not interested in me.

492
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:36,545
There is something you want.

493
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:38,831
I want you to get well.

494
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:39,895
That's all I want.

495
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:42,151
But the secret

496
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:44,071
lies in there.

497
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:48,027
Don't be afraid.

498
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,002
You see...

499
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:55,582
<i>Each human being's head...</i>

500
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:59,527
Contains a soul.

501
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:03,574
The one remaining
riddle of the universe.

502
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:06,436
Look inside the head,

503
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:09,219
unlock the memory

504
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,605
and the universe

505
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:13,594
lies open like a map.

506
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:19,180
Aura.

507
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:23,415
You see this?

508
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:28,424
This will help you
remember everything.

509
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:31,734
- What is it?
- <i>A very rare Berry.</i>

510
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:34,090
A potent psychotropic.

511
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:35,979
It's a drug.
I don't want any drug.

512
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,703
It's not a drug!
It works on the memory.

513
00:47:38,704 --> 00:47:43,345
<i>Removes all obstacles.</i>

514
00:47:43,346 --> 00:47:45,999
Don't be afraid.

515
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,057
Go on. Take it.

516
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:49,479
Mm-mmm.

517
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:53,335
Crush the Berry with your teeth

518
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:55,949
and swallow the liquid.

519
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:58,007
No. Please.

520
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,796
Here.

521
00:47:59,797 --> 00:48:02,122
- Come on! Come on!
- No!

522
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,925
That's it, now crush it!
Crush it!

523
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:10,542
The power of your brain
and imagination

524
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,929
is stronger than a Vulcan!

525
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,993
I remember now. It was you.

526
00:49:33,994 --> 00:49:36,716
Go on! Go on!

527
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:40,633
I don't want to see.

528
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:56,181
His face...

529
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,586
His face was hidden...

530
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:03,218
Behind mama's and papa's head.

531
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:07,094
Whose face? You saw him!

532
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:10,415
Tell me whose face, aura?

533
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:13,765
- I didn't see anything.
- I don't believe you.

534
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:15,823
It's the truth.

535
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:30,446
Damn it!

536
00:50:40,593 --> 00:50:45,835
Come in. Take her back to the
room. Start over with the I.V.

537
00:50:46,284 --> 00:50:46,984
No.

538
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,431
Where are you taking me?

539
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:55,554
Don't hurt her.

540
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,064
Please...

541
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,202
Please, let me go.

542
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:24,328
Oh, no!

543
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,939
No.

544
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:43,003
You get it.

545
00:52:43,004 --> 00:52:45,764
No, miss, please.

546
00:52:50,078 --> 00:52:51,672
Come on, honey.

547
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:57,271
Hold still or I'm just gonna
have to stick it in again.

548
00:52:57,272 --> 00:53:00,187
No!

549
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:02,016
The more you fight

550
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:04,336
the longer you're gonna be in here.
Now, come on.

551
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:11,838
Evening.

552
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:15,091
Come on.

553
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:18,544
Please.

554
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,692
<i>Come on.</i>

555
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:27,081
<i>Come on, honey, hold still.</i>

556
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,916
<i>Okay. That's got it.</i>

557
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:14,647
- Hi.
- I'm looking for aura Petrescu.

558
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:16,238
Her room number please.

559
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,228
Okay.

560
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:20,219
I can't give out
that information.

561
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,681
Besides, visiting
hours are over.

562
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:24,239
Right.

563
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:35,422
Hi. Where were you?

564
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,332
I don't even want
hear any excuses.

565
00:58:23,811 --> 00:58:26,198
Shh!

566
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:28,587
It's me.

567
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:30,586
Are you okay?

568
00:58:30,587 --> 00:58:32,576
- They drugged me.
- They drugged you?

569
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:36,556
Where'd you get these?

570
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:39,751
- I stole them.
- You stole them?

571
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:43,332
Okay.

572
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,117
You wait right here, okay?

573
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:48,506
Wait right here.
You gonna be okay?

574
00:58:48,516 --> 00:58:50,465
Yeah? Okay.

575
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,496
Stay right here.

576
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:00,029
Hi.

577
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,339
You did it! You did it!

578
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:27,320
You did it! You did it!
You did it! You did it!

579
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,678
You did it! You did it!
You did it!

580
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,105
You did it! You did it!

581
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:34,096
You did it! You did it...

582
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,235
We need to get out of here.

583
00:59:42,126 --> 00:59:44,752
<i>You did it!
You did it! You did it!</i>

584
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,424
Tonight, the prestigious
Farraday Clinic

585
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:52,837
<i>was the scene of the latest in a
series of gruesome decapitations</i>

586
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:55,235
- <i>which have terrorized the city for weeks.
- Aura!</i>

587
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:58,320
- Aura, come here.
- <i>Officials at the clinic are not saying much.</i>

588
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,105
Someone from the Farraday
clinic was killed. I knew it!

589
01:01:01,106 --> 01:01:03,434
She was my nurse.

590
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,752
- <i>Volkmann was apparently attacked...
- She was your nurse?</i>

591
01:01:05,753 --> 01:01:09,303
- <i>...and beheaded while on night duty.
- She worked with Dr. Judd.</i>

592
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:11,164
She put the needles in my arms.

593
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:14,189
Well, did you see anything?
Did you hear anything?

594
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:16,180
No.

595
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:27,940
Wherever I go,
people get killed.

596
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,054
Oh, come on.

597
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,273
You're not responsible
for her death.

598
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:36,894
Dr. Leopold Judd, could not
be reached for comment.

599
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,084
You're not a murderer.

600
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,879
You're a thief.

601
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,864
<i>On the local scene,
the weather is now clearing.</i>

602
01:01:44,865 --> 01:01:47,650
<i>But the rain was the cause
of a major traffic tie-up...</i>

603
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:49,243
These are her keys.

604
01:01:51,243 --> 01:01:53,242
It's all my fault.

605
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:58,206
<i>Witnesses say the
large truck and trailer,</i>

606
01:01:58,207 --> 01:01:59,838
<i>which was delivering new cars...</i>

607
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,254
Marigold, I know this place.
It's a storage place.

608
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:19,457
<i>Now, it's time
to shut off the TV and go to bed.</i>

609
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:22,395
<i>I want you asleep
by the time I come home.</i>

610
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:25,522
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>You're not scared to go to bed alone, are you?</i>

611
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:29,122
- No, mom.
- <i>Bye-bye. I love you.</i>

612
01:02:29,123 --> 01:02:31,200
Bye.

613
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:33,522
<i>He had her head in front of his face.</i>

614
01:03:35,867 --> 01:03:39,003
<i>I couldn't see him.
That's the truth.</i>

615
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:55,641
Cops might have
been here already.

616
01:03:55,642 --> 01:03:59,202
No way. They don't
know about this place.

617
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:01,418
Yeah, well, they're
gonna find out about it.

618
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:04,614
They're gonna find something Hilda's
apartment, a key or a receipt.

619
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,879
Come on, we can't
stay here all day.

620
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,161
The broad who rents this space,

621
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,167
she's been here seven,
maybe eight years.

622
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:19,531
<i>I can count the number
of times she showed up</i>

623
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:22,143
on one hand.

624
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:03,729
Hey, the cops.
Come on, let's go!

625
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,946
Come on, now, let's go.

626
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:10,932
- Wait! Wait! The key!
- Leave it for the cops!

627
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:17,262
Look, this is strange.
All these people are dead.

628
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:19,242
Oh my god.

629
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:22,328
She's dead, she's dead
and she's dead.

630
01:05:23,773 --> 01:05:25,681
"Dear Hilda,

631
01:05:25,682 --> 01:05:28,451
in memory of the crazy times
we used to have. Love, Linda."

632
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,813
That must be her.

633
01:05:32,814 --> 01:05:34,267
L. Quirk.

634
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,108
Linda Quirk, 992 Benton road,

635
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:38,002
she lives like a mile from here.

636
01:05:38,003 --> 01:05:40,371
At least she did when
this picture was taken.

637
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:42,845
What do you think this is?

638
01:05:44,002 --> 01:05:47,266
Some sort of insignia
or crest or something.

639
01:05:47,267 --> 01:05:49,610
I think he's the killer.
The doctor.

640
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:52,252
How do you know that?
She could be the killer.

641
01:05:52,253 --> 01:05:55,288
She doesn't look like a killer.

642
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:57,662
You don't know
what a killer looks like.

643
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:59,642
Anybody could be a killer.

644
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:03,212
I'm gonna send this
to the cops tomorrow.

645
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,815
Anonymously.

646
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:08,209
Tomorrow could be too late.

647
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,935
I knew her, Alice.

648
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,520
I knew Georgia
and Catherine, too.

649
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:17,745
That's what's so damn
scary about this.

650
01:06:17,746 --> 01:06:20,603
- We were all involved in it.
- In what?

651
01:06:20,604 --> 01:06:22,423
An accident.

652
01:06:22,424 --> 01:06:25,164
Before you met me?

653
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:28,161
Electro-convulsive therapy.

654
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:30,674
That was my specialty.

655
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:32,949
You mean shock treatment?

656
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:36,115
I thought I knew all
there was to know about it.

657
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:40,348
Including how
to make people forget.

658
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:42,555
Quirk... Quirk...

659
01:06:44,138 --> 01:06:46,116
Quirk. There it is.

660
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,110
Yeah, there's
an l. Quirk, but...

661
01:06:48,111 --> 01:06:50,083
But it's on sunset Lane,
I don't know.

662
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,852
But why? What did you do?

663
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:56,384
Something awful.

664
01:06:58,373 --> 01:07:01,706
I don't know how we thought
we'd get away with it.

665
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:07,641
- Hello.
<i>- Linda Quirk?</i>

666
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:11,202
Just a second. It's a guy.

667
01:07:11,203 --> 01:07:13,587
He's asking for you.

668
01:07:17,544 --> 01:07:20,313
- Hello?
- <i>I'm looking for a Linda Quirk.</i>

669
01:07:20,314 --> 01:07:22,293
Why? Who's this?

670
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:24,687
<i>Would you happen
to know a Hilda Volkmann?</i>

671
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:30,018
<i>She hung up.</i>

672
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:33,322
Try again.

673
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:50,120
It's her all right.

674
01:07:52,267 --> 01:07:53,621
We'd better head out there.

675
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:58,606
There they are!

676
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,685
It's them!

677
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,249
Come here! Come here!

678
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,623
What! What! What the fu...

679
01:08:13,624 --> 01:08:15,602
I just want to talk to you.

680
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:18,837
David!

681
01:08:44,983 --> 01:08:47,584
God damn it. I don't see her.

682
01:08:47,594 --> 01:08:50,225
I think we should turn left.

683
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,213
Uh...

684
01:08:52,214 --> 01:08:54,588
I'm gonna make a right.

685
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:13,433
- Shit. We lost her.
- Turn around.

686
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,058
There it is. It's...

687
01:09:45,059 --> 01:09:47,729
- <i>it's there.
- That's it. Okay.</i>

688
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:49,936
- I knew it.
- Okay.

689
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:55,922
Can I help you?

690
01:09:56,865 --> 01:10:00,142
Yes. I'm looking for a woman
with short hair and a blue bag.

691
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:01,576
I think she got here
a short time ago.

692
01:10:01,883 --> 01:10:02,805
Can you tell me her name?

693
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:05,102
Quirk. Linda Quirk.

694
01:10:05,557 --> 01:10:07,494
We don't have anyone
registered under that name.

695
01:10:07,699 --> 01:10:09,080
That's strange. I had an
appointment here.

696
01:10:09,657 --> 01:10:10,990
She probably hasn't arrived yet.

697
01:10:11,585 --> 01:10:12,500
Would you like a room?

698
01:10:14,284 --> 01:10:16,994
Sure, for me and my sister.

699
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:23,234
Mark Linear. 140 West
View Crescent, Oak Park.

700
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:26,202
I'd like a room with a
view of the parking lot.

701
01:10:26,611 --> 01:10:27,533
Of the parking lot?

702
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,537
Yes, of the parking lot.

703
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,516
Ok.

704
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,102
Room 201. I'll have the
luggage brought up.

705
01:10:37,528 --> 01:10:38,865
I don't have any luggage.

706
01:10:46,005 --> 01:10:52,448
You can see her car perfectly.

707
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,449
You can see her car perfectly.

708
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,549
You think it's gonna rain?

709
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,490
It was a beautiful day,
it's definitely not gonna rain.

710
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,329
Hello, Linda, is that you?

711
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:04,529
<i>Oh, thank god you're okay.
I checked into a hotel</i>

712
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,939
<i>and I want you to get out of
there and over here right now.</i>

713
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,739
Slow down. I think you
overreacted earlier.

714
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,709
It was just a couple of kids.

715
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,379
They didn't look dangerous at all.
You're jumping at shadows.

716
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,379
<i>Look, I don't know
who those two were.</i>

717
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,379
<i>All I know is that I'm
in danger and so are you</i>

718
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,980
<i>if you're in my house.
Please, just get over here.</i>

719
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,395
Jesus, maybe we should
call the police.

720
01:11:25,396 --> 01:11:27,219
<i>We'll talk about it
when you get here.</i>

721
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,029
Okay, where are you?

722
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,229
<i>The Hopkins house, room 301.</i>

723
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:36,029
<i>Right by the airport.</i>

724
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,029
- I'm on my way.
- <i>Be careful.</i>

725
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,043
Bye.

726
01:12:40,303 --> 01:12:42,352
<i>David!</i>

727
01:12:42,353 --> 01:12:44,764
What is it?

728
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:48,671
<i>Nothing, I just wanted to know
if you were still here.</i>

729
01:13:01,383 --> 01:13:03,335
Of course I'm still here.

730
01:13:03,336 --> 01:13:05,512
Go away.

731
01:13:05,513 --> 01:13:08,306
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because I don't want you to get rained on.

732
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:26,082
Hello?

733
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,014
Yes, send her right up.

734
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,459
Mary, hello.
Listen dear, I'm sorry.

735
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,428
No! No!

736
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,801
Lloyd.

737
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:40,039
Lloyd.

738
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,482
Lloyd.

739
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,801
<i>That's Dr. Lloyd.</i>

740
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:11,920
<i>Dr. Lloyd? Does
he still work here?</i>

741
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:14,321
No, he left a long time ago.

742
01:16:14,322 --> 01:16:17,907
But, he showed up again
a few years back.

743
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:20,269
Looked terrible.

744
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:22,691
Tried to sneak away

745
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:26,228
with some stuff out of the
dispensary, if you catch my drift.

746
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:28,279
Yeah, I catch your drift.

747
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,272
You know where I can find him?

748
01:16:30,273 --> 01:16:31,866
Last I heard

749
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:35,024
he was living down
in the warehouse district.

750
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:37,853
You might look into
some of the bars there.

751
01:16:37,854 --> 01:16:40,445
Okay, thanks.

752
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:02,483
<i>That's Hilda Volkmann.</i>

753
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:04,445
She used to work here.

754
01:17:04,446 --> 01:17:07,328
- Linda Quirk...
- Harry, I know who the women are.

755
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:09,863
I'm interested in
who the man is.

756
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:12,125
<i>Oh, Dr. Lloyd.</i>

757
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:14,058
<i>Funny.</i>

758
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:16,450
<i>Young fella by here
a little while ago</i>

759
01:17:16,451 --> 01:17:18,841
- <i>had the same picture.
- What did you tell him?</i>

760
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,676
Sent him over
to the warehouse district.

761
01:18:06,852 --> 01:18:08,446
- Hey.
- You want something?

762
01:18:08,456 --> 01:18:10,448
- Are you Dr. Lloyd?
- Yeah,

763
01:18:10,449 --> 01:18:12,840
maybe in another lifetime.

764
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:14,764
- Linda Quirk...
- Hey, you got any money?

765
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:17,599
No, I ain't got no money, but
Linda Quirk, Hilda Volkmann...

766
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,586
Do those names
sound familiar to you?

767
01:18:19,587 --> 01:18:22,017
- Catherine Duran, Georgia Jackson...
- leave me alone.

768
01:18:22,018 --> 01:18:24,010
They're dead, you know that?

769
01:18:24,011 --> 01:18:26,003
So? People die.
It happens every day.

770
01:18:26,004 --> 01:18:27,997
They were decapitated.

771
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:31,992
- What?!
- I said they were decapitated.

772
01:18:31,993 --> 01:18:35,180
Oh, man. Man, that
wasn't my fault.

773
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:38,439
I know, but if you're Dr. Lloyd,
you've got to tell me something.

774
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,830
Look, man,
it's already too late.

775
01:18:40,831 --> 01:18:43,232
Come on, please, you've
got to know something.

776
01:18:43,233 --> 01:18:46,023
I don't! Now leave
me the fuck alone!

777
01:18:48,415 --> 01:18:50,805
I wrote my number down.
If you change your mind,

778
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:53,168
please call me.

779
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:46,180
This used to be
the nice neighborhood.

780
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:50,934
This is all we found
on him, a phone number.

781
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:54,521
David.

782
01:22:56,913 --> 01:22:59,713
What's that?

783
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:06,827
<i>Aura.</i>

784
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:09,916
Hey, wake up.

785
01:23:14,012 --> 01:23:18,196
It's me, aura. Wake up, aura.

786
01:23:18,197 --> 01:23:20,120
Aura, wake up.

787
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:22,322
<i>Aura. Aura, come on.</i>

788
01:23:22,323 --> 01:23:24,376
Aura, come with me.

789
01:23:24,385 --> 01:23:26,776
No! No!

790
01:23:26,777 --> 01:23:29,138
<i>No! <i>Stop! <i>Don't!</i>

791
01:23:32,098 --> 01:23:35,784
<i>Stop! Stop! No no no!</i>

792
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:37,609
No! No!

793
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:41,075
No! Don't!

794
01:23:41,076 --> 01:23:43,109
Oh, stop!

795
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,384
Come!

796
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,467
<i>Stop! Police!</i>

797
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:36,459
Onto her.

798
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,522
Onto her.

799
01:24:57,017 --> 01:24:59,080
Guys! Come take a look at this!

800
01:24:59,081 --> 01:25:01,869
Whoa, buddy, stop right here.

801
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:05,057
It's off limits.
Come on, move out of here.

802
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,882
- Restricted area.
- All right. All right.

803
01:25:19,158 --> 01:25:22,316
<i>Don't look at it!</i>

804
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:24,768
We got two in the trunk!

805
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:30,757
Aura!

806
01:25:34,115 --> 01:25:36,078
<i>Aura!</i>

807
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:48,514
No!

808
01:25:50,906 --> 01:25:53,266
Aura!

809
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:55,260
Aura!

810
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:58,090
Aura!

811
01:26:07,268 --> 01:26:09,261
Aura!

812
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:16,844
Aura! Come back!

813
01:26:20,032 --> 01:26:22,024
Aura!

814
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:24,018
Aura!

815
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,497
Aura! Aura, where are you?!

816
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,490
Aura!

817
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:50,852
Aura!

818
01:27:00,997 --> 01:27:02,990
<i>Aura!</i>

819
01:27:10,972 --> 01:27:13,363
<i>Aura!</i>

820
01:27:27,433 --> 01:27:29,286
Save her.

821
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:32,713
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "save her."

822
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,946
- A little late for that.
<i>- Save her.</i>

823
01:27:34,947 --> 01:27:37,965
Save her. Save her.

824
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,959
<i>The headhunter terror</i>

825
01:27:39,969 --> 01:27:42,425
which has gripped the city
for the last several weeks

826
01:27:42,426 --> 01:27:45,219
ended early this morning
when a late model Cadillac

827
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,806
burst through a police barrier
and slammed into a guard rail

828
01:27:48,807 --> 01:27:50,731
near lake Veronica.

829
01:27:50,741 --> 01:27:54,327
The driver, Dr. Leopold Judd,
was killed instantly.

830
01:27:54,328 --> 01:27:57,117
The severed heads of all
seven headhunter victims

831
01:27:57,118 --> 01:27:59,110
were found in the trunk
of his car.

832
01:27:59,111 --> 01:28:01,104
Ben Aldridge was on the scene

833
01:28:01,114 --> 01:28:02,972
and spoke with
police authorities.

834
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:05,228
Captain Travis,
was Dr. Judd the killer?

835
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:07,521
Well, with the evidence
we found here,

836
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:09,534
it definitely connects him
to these murders.

837
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:11,346
And what was his motive?

838
01:28:11,347 --> 01:28:15,970
<i>Apparently, he had this ghoulish
obsession with the occult.</i>

839
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:18,362
<i>Besides that,
I see no other motive.</i>

840
01:28:18,363 --> 01:28:21,153
<i>Are you going to continue
your investigation, captain?</i>

841
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:25,147
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
this case is closed.</i>

842
01:28:25,148 --> 01:28:28,974
<i>What drove the esteemed Leopold
Judd... a brilliant psychiatrist,</i>

843
01:28:28,975 --> 01:28:32,561
<i>specialist in the treatment of
anorexia and longtime chief executive</i>

844
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:35,022
<i>at Farraday Clinic...
To commit these crimes?</i>

845
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:37,644
What did the victims
have in common?

846
01:28:37,654 --> 01:28:39,712
Did they share
a secret or a past

847
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:42,506
which finally reunited them
through their grizzly fates?

848
01:28:42,507 --> 01:28:45,296
These and many other
questions will be

849
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:48,485
the subject of our upcoming
special report.

850
01:28:48,486 --> 01:28:52,481
The nightmare is over.

851
01:29:21,867 --> 01:29:24,727
Grace Harrington, please.

852
01:29:27,657 --> 01:29:29,650
Grace, it's me, David.

853
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:33,237
I need some of those forms.

854
01:29:35,638 --> 01:29:37,631
Come on, grace!

855
01:29:38,827 --> 01:29:40,819
Please?

856
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:42,813
Just a couple of 'em, please?

857
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:46,809
Okay, okay. Fine, yeah.

858
01:29:48,403 --> 01:29:50,326
Yeah, fine.

859
01:30:35,317 --> 01:30:37,708
Out of 19.

860
01:30:46,886 --> 01:30:49,277
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

861
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:52,634
<i>Mike, come here.</i>

862
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:54,697
This prescription's phony.

863
01:30:54,698 --> 01:30:57,030
- That guy there!
<i>- Hey, buddy!</i>

864
01:31:01,713 --> 01:31:04,105
Hey! That prescription
was a fake.

865
01:31:04,114 --> 01:31:06,915
- Just give it back, all right?
- Screw you, man.

866
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:09,296
- Give it back!
- Fuck you!

867
01:31:20,935 --> 01:31:22,928
<i>You're a bum!</i>

868
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:30,839
Look at that
goddamn drug addict.

869
01:31:47,202 --> 01:31:50,022
<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

870
01:32:23,513 --> 01:32:25,465
Hi.

871
01:32:25,466 --> 01:32:29,163
Have you seen a girl
in a dark coat go by here?

872
01:32:32,282 --> 01:32:34,185
You sure?

873
01:32:36,307 --> 01:32:38,898
I'll be your best friend.

874
01:33:01,747 --> 01:33:03,739
Oh, I'm sorry.

875
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,732
I thought you
were somebody else.

876
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:08,463
Someone who wore
a bracelet just...

877
01:34:29,028 --> 01:34:30,961
Shh.

878
01:35:39,248 --> 01:35:42,009
Oh my god.

879
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:52,541
Aura!

880
01:35:54,136 --> 01:35:56,069
Aura.

881
01:35:59,457 --> 01:36:02,247
<i>Nicholas.</i>

882
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:05,713
<i>Nicholas, Nicholas.</i>

883
01:36:05,714 --> 01:36:10,795
<i>Nicholas. Nicholas.</i>

884
01:36:10,796 --> 01:36:14,483
<i>Nicholas. Nicholas...</i>

885
01:36:50,994 --> 01:36:54,820
You thought I was aura?
It was only me.

886
01:36:56,983 --> 01:36:59,205
You wanted to see aura.

887
01:37:18,257 --> 01:37:19,782
<i>Aura.</i>

888
01:37:20,948 --> 01:37:23,348
Aura.

889
01:37:23,349 --> 01:37:25,601
I knew I would see you again.

890
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:28,061
I knew I would
see you again too.

891
01:37:28,062 --> 01:37:30,293
Where are we?

892
01:37:30,294 --> 01:37:33,084
In my mother's house.

893
01:37:35,087 --> 01:37:37,478
That was her up there?

894
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:41,065
She's alive?

895
01:37:42,661 --> 01:37:44,652
Christ, where is she now?

896
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:46,655
She's upstairs.

897
01:37:46,656 --> 01:37:49,047
Quick, quick, quick.

898
01:37:49,048 --> 01:37:52,137
There isn't much time.

899
01:38:01,613 --> 01:38:04,005
Trying to keep her out.

900
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,458
At least we try.

901
01:38:18,503 --> 01:38:20,894
Are you okay?

902
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,489
I'm okay.

903
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,691
But I still don't get it.

904
01:38:35,692 --> 01:38:37,684
I thought your mother was dead.

905
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:39,678
You said you saw
her, didn't you?

906
01:38:39,688 --> 01:38:41,680
I saw a corpse.

907
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:44,072
But it was not hers,

908
01:38:44,073 --> 01:38:47,659
it was... A neighbor woman.

909
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,254
Oh my god.

910
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:53,648
She faked her own death.

911
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:56,039
I should have seen the truth.

912
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,628
It was... Right in
front of my face.

913
01:38:59,637 --> 01:39:02,397
- - Aura's
voice: <i>In the dark it looked</i>

914
01:39:02,398 --> 01:39:05,596
<i>as if someone was holding
up two severed heads,</i>

915
01:39:05,597 --> 01:39:08,506
<i>but there was
only one... my father's.</i>

916
01:39:08,516 --> 01:39:13,298
I was sure that Judd
had murdered your mother.

917
01:39:13,299 --> 01:39:15,291
No. No.

918
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:18,081
He never killed anyone,

919
01:39:18,082 --> 01:39:22,078
but he knew who
the murderer was.

920
01:39:23,672 --> 01:39:25,664
Mama.

921
01:41:05,312 --> 01:41:10,562
<i>- Help!
- Somebody help us!</i>

922
01:41:10,563 --> 01:41:13,622
<i>Help us get out of here!</i>

923
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,779
I can't believe your mother
killed those people.

924
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,197
- She did.
- Are you sure she killed your father?

925
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:24,892
Yes!

926
01:41:24,902 --> 01:41:26,954
Why?!

927
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:29,356
Why?!

928
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:35,603
She's coming. She's coming.

929
01:41:42,091 --> 01:41:43,925
Remove the chain.

930
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:48,698
Don't do it.

931
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:51,726
Don't lock your mother outside.

932
01:41:51,727 --> 01:41:55,981
<i>Oh, aura, you know...</i>

933
01:41:55,982 --> 01:41:57,975
I'm not listening to you.

934
01:41:59,579 --> 01:42:02,737
...you know I would
never hurt you.

935
01:42:02,738 --> 01:42:04,691
Now remove it.

936
01:42:06,624 --> 01:42:08,586
<i>Remove the chain.</i>

937
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:11,407
- No.
- <i>Remove it!</i>

938
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:13,110
No!

939
01:42:13,111 --> 01:42:16,498
Remove it <i>now!</i>

940
01:42:16,499 --> 01:42:18,721
<i>Now!</i>

941
01:42:23,883 --> 01:42:25,407
<i>Now!</i>

942
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:33,518
- <i>Now!
- Why are you doing this?</i>

943
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:49,910
I thought after
the others I would stop.

944
01:42:49,911 --> 01:42:52,003
Please! Please! Please!

945
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:54,633
- Please.
- Why did you kill them?

946
01:42:54,634 --> 01:42:56,964
Because of...

947
01:42:56,965 --> 01:43:02,445
Nicholas. Nicholas.

948
01:43:02,446 --> 01:43:05,137
- <i>Nicholas...
- Good. Good. Come on.</i>

949
01:43:05,146 --> 01:43:07,866
<i>Push. Push.</i>

950
01:43:07,867 --> 01:43:11,393
Okay, stop stop.
People, we've got trouble.

951
01:43:17,273 --> 01:43:19,574
Fuck!

952
01:43:19,575 --> 01:43:21,827
<i>Get back! What happened?</i>

953
01:43:25,993 --> 01:43:29,410
Oh my god... decapitated!

954
01:43:45,643 --> 01:43:47,994
<i>Help her!
Somebody help her!</i>

955
01:43:48,004 --> 01:43:50,395
<i>We've got to do something!</i>

956
01:43:58,906 --> 01:44:02,333
Come on, doctor.
Pull it together here.

957
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:04,754
<i>Just do it. Do it.</i>

958
01:44:04,755 --> 01:44:08,442
My son!

959
01:44:08,452 --> 01:44:10,654
What?

960
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,161
Say yes.

961
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:22,412
<i>Do it!</i>

962
01:44:39,233 --> 01:44:42,790
They thought they
could make me forget.

963
01:44:44,255 --> 01:44:46,914
<i>But Nicholas came to me.</i>

964
01:44:46,915 --> 01:44:49,974
He ordered
the deaths of those...

965
01:44:49,975 --> 01:44:52,435
Who had murdered him.

966
01:44:52,436 --> 01:44:55,524
And so, I've done it.

967
01:44:55,525 --> 01:44:57,817
And you know my secret!

968
01:45:12,116 --> 01:45:13,979
Oh god!

969
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:22,061
- Nicholas, Nicholas...
- No! Mama!

970
01:45:44,601 --> 01:45:46,991
Miss Petrescu...

971
01:45:46,992 --> 01:45:49,722
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

972
01:45:49,723 --> 01:45:53,209
Can you tell me...
What you were doing...

973
01:45:53,210 --> 01:45:56,040
Get these goddamn
reporters out of here.

974
01:46:00,464 --> 01:46:02,456
You knew Dr. Judd.

975
01:46:02,457 --> 01:46:04,450
Is there anything you
can tell me about him?

976
01:46:05,646 --> 01:46:08,038
Dr. Judd?

977
01:46:08,048 --> 01:46:10,050
D-Dr. Judd.

978
01:46:15,621 --> 01:46:17,614
Was he working with your mother?

979
01:46:17,624 --> 01:46:19,627
Working.

980
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:25,027
Were they lovers?

981
01:46:26,163 --> 01:46:28,854
Lovers.

982
01:46:32,451 --> 01:46:34,443
Did your mother
commit the murders?

983
01:46:34,444 --> 01:46:36,007
Commit the murders.

984
01:46:36,008 --> 01:46:38,231
<i>Did your mother
commit these murders?!</i>

985
01:46:43,253 --> 01:46:45,246
Let him go! Let him go!

986
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:49,998
Aura! It's over.

987
01:46:49,999 --> 01:46:52,032
It's me... David.

988
01:46:52,829 --> 01:46:55,858
It's over.

989
01:47:08,892 --> 01:47:11,283
I'm never gonna hurt you.

990
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:15,667
I looked all over for you.

991
01:47:15,668 --> 01:47:17,900
I love you.
