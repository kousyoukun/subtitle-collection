1
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:35,862
Give me a hand over here!

2
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,946
Right.

3
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,255
I'll be over there. I can't deal with it now.

4
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,053
Right! Load it up in the back!

5
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,993
Hello, Doris.

6
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,414
Wanna do me a favour?
Help me load the next order.

7
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:47,876
You are no lady, Doris.

8
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,922
Far from it.

9
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:58,916
Good morning, boys and girls!

10
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,790
Did we all remember
to bring our homework today?

11
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,342
We didn't?

12
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:14,769
We know what happens to little boys
and girls who don't do their homework.

13
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,418
Okay, class is over.

14
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:50,258
Do you hear me? Class is over!

15
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,850
Okay, I'm just gonna have to make
another example.

16
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,207
Surprise!

17
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,455
I know you're there, Warwick.

18
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,674
You know something?
You just saved me a trip to your office.

19
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,211
I may be desperate for work,
but not desperate enough to...

20
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,678
Everything's set down here!

21
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,204
Okay, let her rip.

22
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,955
God damn!

23
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,632
<i>Adiós, motherfuckers!</i>

24
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,899
Excuse us, please.

25
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,075
Thanks.

26
00:10:18,874 --> 00:10:21,580
Wouldn't mind having his boots
resting under my bed.

27
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:24,457
One more pair of boots,
you'll have to open a boot shop.

28
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:26,291
Anyway, he's married.

29
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,882
Daisy May, more coffee.

30
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:44,107
Daisy May,
let's make us a baby doggie-style.

31
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:54,575
They found him in pieces.
The rats were all over him.

32
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,822
It was really unbelievable.

33
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,706
What have you got in the bag, pal?

34
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,834
Not very friendly, is he?

35
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:23,269
I bet his mummy packs his lunch.

36
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:25,814
Peanut butter and jelly.

37
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,984
Without the crust.

38
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:30,235
Looks like a boy scout to me.

39
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,412
Maybe a girl scout.

40
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,492
See you around, girl scout!

41
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:41,211
You ought to see who they're hiring.
She's one cute little chick.

42
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:45,839
<i>The accidental death at Bachman Textile
has opened the restored mill...</i>

43
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:48,964
<i>to a series of investigations
and probable lawsuits.</i>

44
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:53,809
<i>Jason Reed was working the night shift
when the mysterious accidents occurred.</i>

45
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,146
- Good morning, Mr. Warwick!
- Hello.

46
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,510
God, this is bad!

47
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:28,256
Extreme safety hazard.

48
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,848
Exterminator's working round the clock.

49
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,056
He's tired.

50
00:12:35,774 --> 00:12:38,941
- Needs more time.
- There's already been one accident.

51
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:43,405
This place must be cleared before
another worker steps foot in this death trap.

52
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:44,778
Damn!

53
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,953
July fourth holiday.

54
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,213
I'll organise a cleanup.

55
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,133
I'll hold on to this till then.

56
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:12,020
I'll be back.

57
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:18,770
To be honest, I don't think
you'll find a crew that would work here.

58
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,571
Not down here.

59
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,817
We'll see.

60
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:49,849
Come shower with me. We can save water.

61
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:51,729
Get a load of the new guy.

62
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,389
Better get up!

63
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,656
This will work out just fine.

64
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,618
- See you later.
- 'Bye.

65
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,375
'Morning.

66
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,128
Good morning.

67
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,888
Do you take coffee, Mr...

68
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:26,513
Hall. No, thanks. I'll pass today.

69
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,137
Me, too.

70
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:34,486
Can't be more than an instant enema
by now.

71
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,319
You here by car or by thumb?

72
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:45,825
By Greyhound.

73
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:48,823
I see you got a real problem staying put.

74
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,540
Lots of movement over the past five years.

75
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,129
Starts down in Florida,
comes all the way up the map.

76
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,917
Are you on the run, friend?

77
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,047
I'm here for a fresh start.

78
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:05,013
College boy.

79
00:15:06,354 --> 00:15:08,477
No, that's not the problem.

80
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:11,234
With all due respect, what is?

81
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,731
Fair enough.

82
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,905
Putting it plainly, Mr. Hall, you're a drifter.

83
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,617
I get no guarantees with a drifter.

84
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:26,280
You get no guarantees with any man.

85
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:28,079
There's only instinct.

86
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:33,043
You spent some time at Munson Textile.

87
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,837
You ever run the picker?

88
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:38,419
I know how.

89
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,302
Then you also know
it's a one-man operation.

90
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,513
This mill depends on that machine.

91
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:48,515
And what's left of Gates Falls
depends on this mill.

92
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:52,856
We don't do better than minimum to start.

93
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:57,322
Four weeks before the union
comes knocking at your door.

94
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,488
Are you still interested?

95
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,987
- Sounds fair to start.
- All right, then.

96
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,292
That's it, except for the hours.

97
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:10,293
Because of the heat,
we only run that sucker through the night.

98
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:12,625
11:00 p.m. To 7:00 a.m.

99
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,380
The graveyard shift.

100
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,071
Spread the word, fucker.

101
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,703
Mice.

102
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:54,383
Damn! That's good shooting.

103
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:59,475
Tucker Cleveland, Martial Extermination.

104
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,613
John Hall.

105
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:09,612
Looks like one of your buddies
got a little too close to the blower.

106
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:13,153
I'd love to know how many
of them bean town executives...

107
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:16,332
are wearing one of your rat-lined overcoats.

108
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,879
No, thanks. Gave that up with the wife.

109
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,882
I should miss her as much.

110
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:29,006
- You work late hours.
- I have no choice.

111
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:32,557
The Yellow Pages
are thick with competitors.

112
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,265
I don't mind telling you...

113
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:41,268
this place is infested.

114
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,234
That may be the understatement of the year.

115
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:46,565
The schmuck you work for
don't wanna hear that.

116
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,197
Afraid of what it's gonna cost the mill.

117
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:53,035
He thinks a little tracking poison
will do the trick.

118
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,121
I've been dealing with these things
for more than 20 years...

119
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,961
and we ain't talking about
no candy-ass field mice.

120
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:06,170
These sons of bitches
piss on tracking poison...

121
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,675
piss on it to warn their little fucker friends.

122
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,429
Take it from me.

123
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,185
There's only one way to deal with their kind.

124
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,861
On their own terms.

125
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:34,666
I first met up with them back in Con Tien.

126
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,751
Big as puppies, and they had no fear.

127
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,214
Not of death, nothing, like the Cong.

128
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:48,682
And I ain't one of them burning-baby,
flashback fuck-ups...

129
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:51,685
you see Bruce Dern playing,
so quit your grinning.

130
00:20:53,564 --> 00:20:54,727
Anyways...

131
00:20:57,277 --> 00:21:01,275
Conditions being what they were back then,
we had little choice.

132
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,527
We shared the land...

133
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:08,235
we shared our food with the fuckers...

134
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:11,083
and they turn around,
stabbing us in the back...

135
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,456
by going to work for the VC.

136
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,166
That's right.

137
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:21,294
Because the VC would reward them
with a hot meal.

138
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:29,061
Do you have any idea what a VC rat eats?

139
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,607
Try raw, American...

140
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:40,526
"Hold the mayo, thank you."

141
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,531
The Cong...

142
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:50,158
had a way of serving up a meal...

143
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,700
real nice and fancy.

144
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,885
They would stake one of our boys
to the ground...

145
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:03,382
through his hands, through his feet...

146
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,432
and stake him like Jesus.

147
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,226
And then...

148
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,695
they would make a cut
just above the abdomen.

149
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,401
Now, this wasn't a fatal cut.

150
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:22,661
This was merely an entry wound.

151
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:28,661
Then, they'd get a rat...

152
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:32,338
a real hungry rat.

153
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:35,751
One they hadn't been feeding
for about a week.

154
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,251
And they'd put it on the wound...

155
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:43,471
and they'd stick its nose down inside.

156
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,186
And if the damned thing
wasn't starving enough...

157
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:50,560
they'd cover it with a flaming rice bowl.

158
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,608
And let me tell you...

159
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:56,313
that grey-black son of a bitch...

160
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:59,324
would have nowhere else to go but inside.

161
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:03,155
He'd start clawing his way through...

162
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,783
Looking to put an end
to that loud beating sound.

163
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,581
Like a human artichoke.

164
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,711
So warm, so juicy.

165
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:29,393
Maybe I'm a little prejudiced.

166
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,149
Anybody call a break?

167
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,152
No laughing on company hours.

168
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:46,747
Looks like you just bought yourself a shift...

169
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,996
scrubbing the latrines.

170
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:58,927
I should be downstairs humiliating
the college boy by now.

171
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:02,470
Bravo, Ippeston!

172
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:07,058
<i>Now we can get you that audition
on Star Search.</i>

173
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,943
Come here, boy.

174
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:19,742
We got commitments to our
New York sales office due on Wednesday.

175
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,997
Are we on schedule?

176
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:31,542
- Yes, Mr. Warwick.
- Fetch me the work order, boy.

177
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,526
- 'Evening.
- 'Evening.

178
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,147
How are you tonight?

179
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,116
We're on time.

180
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,446
In fact, we're slightly ahead.

181
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,784
I'm asking about you, Jane.

182
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,337
How are you?

183
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,465
I'm managing, thanks.

184
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,968
You look tired.

185
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,548
Like you're losing too much
of your beauty sleep or something.

186
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:20,437
The night shift will do that to a girl.

187
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:31,400
I try to do my job.
Do you have a problem with that?

188
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,775
Who said anything about a deal?

189
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:38,203
I'm talking about a promotion.

190
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:42,248
A cool office, a desk!

191
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:51,506
This cleanup ain't gonna be pretty, darling.

192
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,683
I got Stevenson down there now,
stringing the lights.

193
00:25:56,144 --> 00:25:58,896
He's pissing and moaning about the heat.

194
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:02,226
- And it's gonna get hotter.
- I can handle it.

195
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:05,354
It's double pay, so back off, man.

196
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:08,649
- Why don't you wisen up?
- Like Nardello?

197
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,538
I'm gonna see you down in the basement.

198
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:53,325
There ain't no way
they'll get this place settled in a week.

199
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,413
Goddamn rats!

200
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:03,835
This is a whole bunch of bullshit.

201
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:10,056
Brogan?

202
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:14,178
Is that you?

203
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:19,984
Shit.

204
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:23,487
Very funny! I'm laughing my ass off.

205
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:26,901
How about picking up a...

206
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:29,781
Oh, damn.

207
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,498
- So what about Stevenson?
- He left in the middle of the job...

208
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:22,300
and didn't pick up his pay.

209
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,378
Lookee who's here.

210
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,598
Still alive.

211
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:35,727
- How you doing? Want some coffee?
- Please, coffee and toast.

212
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,532
We got you a little something to nibble on.

213
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,031
Enjoy.

214
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,792
Special order
for the Commander of the Rat Patrol.

215
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:19,436
Bastards.

216
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:38,461
Do you need a lift?

217
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,241
Hi, sweetheart.

218
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:10,247
Don't wanna be doing that
in broad daylight.

219
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,329
Then let's do it in the dark.

220
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:17,583
Mr. Warwick?

221
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:19,506
Who wants to know?

222
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:22,972
Tony Carmichael.
I hear you're looking for a few good men.

223
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,057
Come this way.

224
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:32,815
I'll talk to you later about that there thing.

225
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:37,315
Nice meeting you, ma'am.

226
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:44,662
Those guys are assholes.

227
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,875
Every town has them.

228
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,916
That's a depressing thought.

229
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:51,328
- Which town are you from?
- Wheeling.

230
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:54,424
West Virginia? That's nice.

231
00:30:58,805 --> 00:31:00,929
How about you?
You lived here your whole life?

232
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:03,009
No way. I'm from Castle Rock.

233
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:07,314
Castle Rock. Sounds very Norman Rockwell.

234
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:10,270
No, it's just Castle Rock.

235
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,741
I'll see you around.

236
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,538
You're on the basement cleanup crew,
no doubt.

237
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:29,380
- Not that I know of.
- You will be.

238
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:32,999
I know Warwick,
and you're a prime candidate.

239
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:37,510
I bet your wife ain't too thrilled.

240
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,262
Losing you through the night, and all.

241
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,386
We gotta do what we gotta do, right?

242
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,767
My wife's dead.

243
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:47,895
I'm sorry.

244
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:52,522
Thank you for the ride.

245
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,271
Take care.

246
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:29,568
Keep the lights as high up to the ceiling
as possible.

247
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:35,858
We'll get a water vac in here tomorrow.
Mop this shit up.

248
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:39,246
Welcome aboard.

249
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:40,021
You're jumpy, aren't you, kid?

250
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,849
Not to worry. The rats don't bite.

251
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:55,862
What happened to the fellow
who started this job?

252
00:33:55,956 --> 00:33:57,534
What happened?

253
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:00,244
He didn't work out.

254
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,066
He needs this typed right away.

255
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:24,358
- What is it?
- Cleanup crew.

256
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,985
Looks like you made the list, Nardello.

257
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,661
Basement cleanup!

258
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,752
Clean up this, Warwick!

259
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:49,387
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Where's Warwick?

260
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,225
He's right there.

261
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,468
He's gonna be wicked pissed.

262
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:15,366
How can you do this to me?

263
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,411
You like it rough, don't you, Nardello?

264
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,171
You can't put me down there.
You can't put anybody down there!

265
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,588
I know things.

266
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,592
What are you talking about?

267
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:31,221
You better watch what you're saying.

268
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,639
I don't think so.

269
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:36,145
I think from now on
you better watch what you're saying.

270
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:56,244
Come on. I'll take you home.

271
00:35:58,465 --> 00:35:59,840
All right.

272
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,252
The show's over.

273
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,605
Everybody go back to doing
what you were doing.

274
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,277
I'm sorry. I thought you were a rat.

275
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,407
You're not the first.

276
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,962
I wanted to drop in and thank you.

277
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,582
Sorry about that situation with Nardello.

278
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:13,336
Tempers flared.

279
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,053
It was a big misunderstanding.
You know how it is.

280
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,140
Anyway...

281
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,640
As a show of gratitude...

282
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:29,266
I want to offer you the chance
to earn some extra cash.

283
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:34,107
Next week is the July fourth holiday.

284
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:36,525
The mill is shut down.

285
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,486
That means vacation week
for most of our people...

286
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,537
those with the union.

287
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,790
Layoff week for the rest.

288
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:50,460
But there is work available for a select few.

289
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:54,925
We got that cleanup thing
going on down in the basement.

290
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:59,429
Regular graveyard shift hours,
and I'm handpicking the crew.

291
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,558
To tell you the truth...

292
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:11,027
I've watched you work...

293
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,650
and I like your style.

294
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:19,247
Gonna be a mess, no doubt about it.

295
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,375
That bastard ain't been touched
since Christ was a kid.

296
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:26,122
But it's for double pay.

297
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:31,928
Now you tell me
if an educated guy like you...

298
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,845
can't use double pay.

299
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,327
- Thank you, Mr. Warwick.
- You are so welcome, Mr. Hall.

300
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,377
Hey, Commander.

301
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:11,125
Hey, rat man.

302
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,923
You must feel awful special.

303
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,392
You're gonna be down in the shit pit
with the rest of us.

304
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,681
I bet he likes your style.

305
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:23,691
Wait a minute, he said he liked my style!

306
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,269
What's going on?

307
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:31,366
Guess who finally made
Warwick's cleanup crew?

308
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,665
Congratulations.

309
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,621
Do you want to get out of here?

310
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:44,788
Yeah.

311
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:55,472
Thanks.

312
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,666
- You were hungry.
- Yeah, for decent food.

313
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:18,917
It's been a while.

314
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,502
I worked a spell
as a short order cook in Miami.

315
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:24,668
Mostly burgers.

316
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,503
I want to hear the rest of your story.

317
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:33,552
You got married and left Castle Rock
against your father's advice.

318
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:37,561
Why are dads always right?

319
00:42:38,274 --> 00:42:39,685
I don't know.

320
00:42:46,575 --> 00:42:47,903
Anyway...

321
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:52,282
It wasn't too long after my divorce...

322
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:54,662
Warwick came sniffing around.

323
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:57,784
He said he wanted to help. He felt bad.

324
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:00,750
So he offered me a promotion
to office manager...

325
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:05,174
to ease my emotional
as well as financial burdens.

326
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:07,132
All I'd have to do in return...

327
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:10,805
was perform a couple of days a week
on the couch in his office.

328
00:43:11,227 --> 00:43:13,220
He even had them picked out.

329
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:15,770
Monday and Wednesday.

330
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:20,518
- Son of a bitch.
- Should've brought him up on charges.

331
00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:23,863
I tried, and was advised by Personnel
to see a therapist.

332
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,617
They couldn't get rid of me.

333
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:38,662
I was saved by the union and the fact
Warwick would look like the shit he is.

334
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,753
So I'm still here.

335
00:43:44,262 --> 00:43:46,385
On borrowed time, I guess.

336
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:35,984
I bet you hate him, too, Mrs. Warwick.

337
00:45:03,224 --> 00:45:06,639
This will teach you to fire me,
you son of a bitch.

338
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:10,636
Shit.

339
00:45:50,775 --> 00:45:51,890
Pull.

340
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:02,237
Do you want to try it?

341
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:16,338
Leave the ghetto blaster back in the ghetto.

342
00:46:16,428 --> 00:46:17,757
Yes, sir.

343
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,475
Don't want anybody being cute
with one of these.

344
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:27,595
You'll end up spraying
one of your buddies back onto a slab.

345
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:33,150
Work areas are listed over there
just like we talked about.

346
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,235
Jobs are split evenly night by night.

347
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:39,865
Tried to keep it interesting.

348
00:46:39,953 --> 00:46:41,495
Any questions?

349
00:46:42,664 --> 00:46:44,040
Basically...

350
00:46:44,124 --> 00:46:48,169
we need to have this basement
in a workable state by next Thursday.

351
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:51,255
We only have the chain hoist for one night.

352
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,667
Execute these orders,
you'll get through it without a snag.

353
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:59,760
And then what happens?
Do we get a gold watch or something?

354
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:13,232
Sure beats nailing them with soda pop.

355
00:48:03,168 --> 00:48:04,960
What are you doing?

356
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:15,177
Warwick said to list everything.

357
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:19,263
Fifty-year-old files are crap.
List them as fifty-year-old crap.

358
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:22,138
It's not salvageable.

359
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,750
Hey, check this out.

360
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,669
Come on, take a break.

361
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:54,631
The longer it takes,
the longer we'll be down here doing it.

362
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,011
This thing's in great shape.

363
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:48,355
Rats.

364
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:51,577
No problem.

365
00:50:22,612 --> 00:50:24,570
Where are you going, asshole?

366
00:50:58,025 --> 00:51:00,351
You goddamn ignoramus,
you almost killed me!

367
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:03,399
What the hell is your problem, Brogan?

368
00:51:03,656 --> 00:51:05,566
I ain't got a problem.

369
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:08,236
You got a problem?

370
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:29,052
Look, guys, this is crazy.

371
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:33,768
We were hired as a cleanup crew,
not as exterminators.

372
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:39,985
I need this money as bad as the next guy,
but we are not damn exterminators!

373
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,730
What's your problem, boy?

374
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:47,996
- We were hired to clean the basement up.
- "We"?

375
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:54,875
Are you speaking for everybody?

376
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:56,916
Or just yourself?

377
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:19,944
Just me, Mr. Warwick.

378
00:52:21,282 --> 00:52:23,240
"Just me, Mr. Warwick."

379
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:33,003
You'd best be punching out your time card.

380
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:35,666
Permanently.

381
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:38,460
Is that clear, boy?

382
00:52:52,984 --> 00:52:55,023
Did somebody call a break?

383
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:19,799
Control that sack of fleas, Cleveland.

384
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,128
Please.

385
00:53:21,223 --> 00:53:23,299
Moxy, come on over here.

386
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:28,437
Moxy here is a real special breed.

387
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,851
A rat terrier.

388
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:36,228
He didn't waste his puppy years
down at the beach...

389
00:53:36,323 --> 00:53:39,241
playing Frisbee with Frankie and Annette.

390
00:53:40,911 --> 00:53:42,988
He was too busy training.

391
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:46,123
Tracking rats through walls,
through concrete.

392
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:49,746
Looks to me like he doesn't always win.

393
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:54,130
Moxy, cut that out!

394
00:53:55,802 --> 00:53:59,052
We've got ourselves a little problem,
you and me.

395
00:53:59,305 --> 00:54:02,307
Our sister mills along the river
don't take too kindly...

396
00:54:02,392 --> 00:54:05,762
to having their backyards
polluted by rat stew.

397
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:11,650
Our own Mr. Bachman
has graciously agreed...

398
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:14,903
to keep your name
out of any impending lawsuit.

399
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:18,900
You are legally responsible...

400
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:22,200
when it comes right down to it.

401
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:28,452
Ain't you a kick in the nuts.

402
00:54:29,672 --> 00:54:30,870
First off...

403
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:34,212
I was called personally by Bachman...

404
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:37,837
and told to pump directly
into the river because...

405
00:54:38,348 --> 00:54:40,970
just between you, me, and Moxy...

406
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:44,975
he was too cheap
to spring for the dumping charges himself.

407
00:54:45,064 --> 00:54:47,436
I hope you got that in writing.

408
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,026
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

409
00:54:53,115 --> 00:54:57,029
This kind of thing can cost you
your exterminator's license.

410
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:58,828
But again...

411
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:02,328
no one's naming names.

412
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:07,368
We're only asking you
to provide one additional service.

413
00:55:08,882 --> 00:55:12,216
I got an idea where them things are nesting.

414
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:15,673
It shouldn't take you more than a night.

415
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:38,236
What is it you got me doing?

416
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:44,412
When was the last time
you been to a graveyard?

417
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:57,765
Come on, Moxy!

418
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:01,556
The sooner we find their little home...

419
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:04,604
the sooner we can get back to ours.

420
00:56:14,828 --> 00:56:18,079
Go on, Moxy, get them.
Eat them for breakfast!

421
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:56,240
Come on, Moxy.

422
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:59,537
There just ain't no job worth this.

423
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,345
Ain't no dog worth it, either.

424
00:58:13,415 --> 00:58:15,989
- Just a few more hours.
- I know.

425
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:39,401
The break's over.

426
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:41,605
Back to work!

427
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,616
- It's almost over.
- I thought it would never end.

428
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,785
Place still looks like shit.
What do they want to put down here?

429
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,828
- A nightclub.
- Really?

430
00:58:52,124 --> 00:58:54,959
You must've been
at the top of your class, Brogan.

431
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:57,796
Truth is, they're expanding for offices.

432
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,122
Who would have an office down here?

433
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,226
- Hey!
- What?

434
00:59:10,686 --> 00:59:12,180
Look at this.

435
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,060
What you got, kids?

436
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:18,861
A trapdoor.

437
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,857
Ain't that interesting?

438
00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:23,609
It certainly is.

439
00:59:24,034 --> 00:59:26,490
That's where your rats are coming from.

440
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,868
They're breeding underground.

441
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:31,489
You know it all, don't you?

442
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,954
Hey, boys...

443
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,461
come on over here!

444
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:44,844
- I can't get at it.
- Brogan, give me a hand!

445
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:55,809
I wonder what's down there.

446
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,027
Fetch a lamp.

447
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,324
You're not thinking of going down?

448
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,983
Me? No, sir.

449
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:08,995
Johnny's on hoses tonight.

450
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,333
I trust his judgment,
him being a college boy and all.

451
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:14,623
On one condition.

452
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,878
I'll need an extra body
to help me carry the line.

453
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:19,592
Name your body.

454
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:30,519
You, Mr. Foreman.

455
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:36,860
The management should be represented
in this little adventure.

456
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:38,322
Don't you think?

457
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,071
In case there is buried treasure,
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

458
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:46,283
You first.

459
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:49,075
I'll be right after you.

460
01:00:50,628 --> 01:00:52,039
I'm going.

461
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:00,591
Danson, Carmichael, come on, get up!

462
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:02,924
Brogan, you too!

463
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:07,894
At Bachman
we're just one big happy family.

464
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:14,731
Yeah, the Manson Family.

465
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:40,801
You all right?

466
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:45,271
Let's go over there to set you down.

467
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:47,552
Come on.

468
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:51,773
Brogan, watch your step.

469
01:02:00,454 --> 01:02:02,862
What the hell have we got here?

470
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:05,958
A bygone power source. Water power.

471
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,577
Looks like it hasn't worked in years.

472
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:12,835
Smells like stale piss down here.
I say we turn around right now.

473
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:15,713
So much for your breeding ground, Hall.

474
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:18,097
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

475
01:02:31,821 --> 01:02:34,394
Brogan, you're a regular bug light.

476
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,452
I see him!

477
01:03:24,212 --> 01:03:26,169
Grab hold of the wood!

478
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:30,335
I'm coming down!

479
01:03:36,976 --> 01:03:38,767
There's something down here!

480
01:03:38,853 --> 01:03:40,181
Hold on!

481
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:45,943
Oh, Jesus.

482
01:03:46,194 --> 01:03:48,685
- There he is!
- Please help me!

483
01:03:52,117 --> 01:03:53,446
Come on.

484
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,919
He's dead. Brogan's dead!

485
01:04:12,222 --> 01:04:14,428
Shut up, Carmichael!

486
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,687
Give me that.

487
01:04:49,179 --> 01:04:51,468
We can use these for weapons.

488
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:56,091
Something our friend Hall hasn't got.

489
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,262
I'll deal with her and Hall.

490
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:02,813
Fuck Hall. Forget about Hall.

491
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:06,402
Start thinking about
whatever the hell is down here.

492
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:09,233
He found the opening.

493
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:13,613
He brought us down here.

494
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:18,584
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

495
01:05:22,632 --> 01:05:25,205
So don't go telling me my business.

496
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,793
You're going out of your mind, Warwick.

497
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:31,801
You just stood there
and watched Brogan die.

498
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:35,436
You didn't.

499
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:45,151
Move.

500
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,914
It's a dead end.

501
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:03,670
There must be some other way out of here.

502
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:08,508
Wait, listen.

503
01:06:11,143 --> 01:06:12,685
Wait a second!

504
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:19,434
There's gotta be a way out.

505
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:36,033
Here. Grab a hold of this.

506
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,357
Which way do we go?

507
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:05,117
What do you have there?

508
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:07,028
Water. Pretty loud.

509
01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:11,160
Do you hear it?

510
01:07:13,836 --> 01:07:15,745
Sounds like the river.

511
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:18,336
I knew this was a way out.

512
01:07:18,716 --> 01:07:21,717
It's your moment, Carmichael. You go first.

513
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:25,557
Go on. We'll be right in back of you.

514
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:37,895
There's a hole here.

515
01:07:45,037 --> 01:07:47,029
I think we can break through.

516
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:51,579
It's wet.

517
01:07:55,381 --> 01:07:57,374
Something's got my arm!

518
01:07:57,467 --> 01:07:58,795
Help me!

519
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:01,084
What is it?

520
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:03,587
Help me! Something's got my arm!

521
01:08:07,478 --> 01:08:08,972
Danson, move!

522
01:08:09,313 --> 01:08:11,436
Please, somebody help me!

523
01:08:14,736 --> 01:08:15,934
Move!

524
01:08:25,413 --> 01:08:26,908
It's blocked!

525
01:08:27,457 --> 01:08:28,620
Wait!

526
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:46,477
The river!

527
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:51,972
Help me!

528
01:08:55,363 --> 01:08:56,643
Help me!

529
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,954
All right, now.

530
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:16,793
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

531
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,217
No more! No more!

532
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:25,344
I'm not going! I'm not going anymore!

533
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:27,229
Do you want to die?

534
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:29,891
I'm not going anywhere!

535
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:34,231
It ain't that bad.

536
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:51,167
It's ice cold.

537
01:09:52,091 --> 01:09:53,669
I'm very close.

538
01:10:00,058 --> 01:10:02,264
We'll never get through that way.

539
01:10:02,853 --> 01:10:04,892
At least not with that thing.

540
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:04,408
Help me!

541
01:11:50,178 --> 01:11:52,254
We're going to make it.

542
01:11:53,306 --> 01:11:54,551
I know.

543
01:11:56,852 --> 01:11:58,928
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

544
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,797
This must be where it lives.

545
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,893
Come on, let's go.

546
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:58,077
Mr. Foreman.

547
01:12:58,585 --> 01:13:00,744
Come on, let's lift him up.

548
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:08,717
- It's really bad.
- We should let the bastard bleed.

549
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:11,222
Hold this for a second.

550
01:14:46,953 --> 01:14:48,151
Here!

551
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:49,042
We are going to hell.

552
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,920
Together!

553
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:09,070
There's only one way
to deal with these fuckers.
