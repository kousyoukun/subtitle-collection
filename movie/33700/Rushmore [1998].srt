1
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:32,007
<i>If, and only if,</i>
<i>both sides of the numerator...</i>

2
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,677
<i>is divisible by the inverse</i>
<i>of the square root...</i>

3
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,221
<i>of the two unassigned variables.</i>

4
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,558
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate...

5
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,686
is equal to or less than
the value of one.

6
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,022
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

7
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:49,567
Oh, that?
Don't worry about that.

8
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,069
- "M" is...
- Wait. Why?

9
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:56,699
I just put that up as a joke. That's probably
the hardest geometry equation in the world.

10
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,368
How much extra credit is it worth?

11
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,371
Well, considering I've never
seen anyone get it right,

12
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:05,499
including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T.,

13
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,169
I guess if anyone here
can solve that problem,

14
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:11,338
I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again...

15
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,175
for the rest of your lives.

16
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:24,268
Max? Care to try it?

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,855
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

18
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,020
You got it.

19
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,112
Fischer! Fischer!
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

20
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,210
Thank you.

21
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:35,005
You guys have it real easy.

22
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:39,176
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

23
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:42,721
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is,

24
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:45,516
you go to one of the best
schools in the country:

25
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,518
- Rushmore.
- Shh.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,687
Now, for some of you,

27
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:51,939
it doesn't matter.

28
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:55,693
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

29
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,737
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

30
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:04,577
Take dead aim
on the rich boys.

31
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,204
Get them
in the crosshairs...

32
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,707
and take them down.

33
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:14,003
Just remember:
They can buy anything,

34
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:17,173
but they can't buy backbone.

35
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,675
Don't let them forget that.

36
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,969
Thank you.

37
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,687
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

38
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:34,231
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

39
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,983
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

40
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,861
The least these little pricks
can do is hear me out.

41
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,405
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

42
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:43,532
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

43
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:47,953
I just wanted to say that I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,831
Um... your speech
was excellent.

45
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,543
- Thank you.
- Hello.

47
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,214
Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my
chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

48
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,382
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

49
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,426
Well, thanks.

50
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,099
You know...

51
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,561
I really think you're
right about Rushmore.

52
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,772
Come on, Dirk.

53
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,027
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

54
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,197
Sharp little guy.

55
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:29,036
He's one of the worst
students we've got.

56
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:17,460
<i>You! You're out!</i>

57
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:49,283
We're putting you on what we call
"sudden death academic probation".

58
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:51,994
And what does that entail?

59
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,455
It entails that if you
fail another class,

60
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,874
you'll be asked
to leave Rushmore.

61
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,709
In other words,
I'll be expelled.

62
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,127
That's correct.

63
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:02,880
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

64
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,675
Too many extracurricular
activities, Max.

65
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,928
Not enough studying.

66
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,435
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job,

67
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,479
but, the fact is,
no matter how hard I try,

68
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:20,564
I still might
flunk another class.

69
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,485
If that means I have to stay on for a
postgraduate year, then so be it, but...

70
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,654
We don't offer
a postgraduate year.

71
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:29,782
Well... we don't offer it yet.

72
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,867
Just bring up the grades.

73
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:35,704
Do you remember how
I got into this school?

74
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:39,875
- Yes. You wrote a play.
- That's right.

75
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,088
Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate.

76
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,590
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

77
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,760
And you read it, and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

78
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,929
Mm-hmm.

79
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,974
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

80
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,685
But I still might
have to expel you.

81
00:06:57,893 --> 00:06:59,645
Couldn't...

82
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,398
Couldn't we just
let me float by?

83
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,650
For old time's sake?

84
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,861
Can't do it, Max.

85
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,323
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no, not again.

86
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,993
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

87
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:16,579
try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

88
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,003
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

89
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,088
That's the rumor.

90
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,215
And they're canceling Latin.

91
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,925
What?

92
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:33,012
I tried to get Latin
canceled for five years.

93
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,181
"It's a dead language,"
I'd always say.

94
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:38,309
Well, I guess
they finally heard you.

95
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:54,784
Excuse me.

96
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,536
Could I please see a list
of all the people...

97
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,747
who've checked out this book
in the past year?

98
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,540
Why?

99
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,710
Look at that.

100
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:49,213
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both;

101
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:52,007
"and I believe they both
get paid in the end.

102
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,593
"But the fools first.

103
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:58,764
Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button."

104
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:04,145
- Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
- Where are you going?

105
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,272
I'll tell you
in the squad car.

106
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,315
Oh, and, Willie,

107
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,693
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

108
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,154
He died in his sleep.

109
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,739
Excellent. That was excellent.

110
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,741
That was great.
That was great.

111
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:21,328
Um, Irving... could you get some
root beers for anybody who wants one?

112
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:23,122
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

113
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,166
All right, next scene.

114
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,420
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

115
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:32,214
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are...

116
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:35,342
- to have someone like you
looking out for Dirk.
- Oh, don't be silly.

117
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,928
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart...

118
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:42,183
some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

119
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,477
This has my number on it
if you need to call me...

120
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:47,605
or need help with Dirk
or anything like that.

121
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,232
Well, thank you very much.
Hello, Dirk.

122
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,401
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, honey?

123
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,195
- Fine.
- Bye.

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,780
It was so nice
to see you again.

125
00:09:56,781 --> 00:10:00,367
- Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?
- What math test?

126
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,037
- I thought you had a math test today.
- No.

127
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,790
Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

128
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,500
Yeah, I got an extension.

129
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,628
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

130
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,714
- We shook hands.
- Big deal.

131
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,883
And I gave her
my phone number.

132
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,344
Buchan said he'd have
already banged her by now.

133
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,720
What?

134
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:23,057
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

135
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:26,352
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

136
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:30,106
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

137
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:32,358
What are you, a lawyer?

138
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:36,403
Hey, Mr. Blume.
Hey, it's Max Fischer.

139
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:39,198
- Oh, hi.
<i>- Hey, Max, my mom just showed up.</i>

140
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,117
<i>Is it okay if I leave early? Over.</i>

141
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,993
Sure, Charlie.

142
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,835
What's the secret, Max?

143
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,586
- "The secret"?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,090
Well, you seem to have it
pretty figured out.

145
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,467
The secret.
I don't know. Uh...

146
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,970
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do,

147
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:04,640
and then do it
for the rest of your life.

148
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,143
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

149
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:10,062
Shotgun.

150
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:13,691
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys...
- Get in the back. I said, "Shotgun".

151
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,776
Get in the back, Donny.

152
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,738
Let's go.

153
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,618
Did you invite that kid
to your party?

154
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:27,121
- Max Fischer?
- Come on, Dad.
There's gonna be girls there.

155
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:29,957
- I'd rather die.
- Pull your head out of your ass.

156
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,545
- Good night, Mr. Littlejeans.
- Good night, Max.

157
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,505
I'll see you tomorrow.

158
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,474
May I see the back, please?

159
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,477
Certainly.

160
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:53,606
How's that?

161
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,941
Thank you.

162
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,821
I need a signature on this
geometry test, by the way.

163
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,573
Let's see.

164
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,827
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

165
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,829
A 37.

166
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,709
Oh, I don't know
what to do anymore.

167
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,838
It could have been worse.

168
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,174
You almost got the "A".

169
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:23,093
"Almost got the 'A"'?
Dad, what are you writing?

170
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,686
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs...

171
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,939
and putting on plays.

172
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,024
That's possible.

173
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,028
I should probably be trying
harder to score chicks.

174
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,073
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

175
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,034
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

176
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:49,245
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

177
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,914
You're like one
of those clipper ship captains.

178
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:54,250
You're married to the sea.

179
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,293
Yes, that's true.

180
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:59,797
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

181
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,056
- Hello.
- Hi.

182
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,358
I like your hat.

183
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:22,236
Oh, thank you.

184
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,406
You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

185
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,577
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

186
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,745
Uh-huh.

187
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,541
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

188
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,336
Well, let's see now.
How old are you?

189
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,754
Fifteen.

190
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:44,049
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

191
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,718
You should quit.

192
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,345
You're right.

193
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:51,265
And I should mind my own business.

194
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,065
Where did you go
to school, by the way?

195
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,359
- Harvard.
- Really?

196
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,861
That's a coincidence.

197
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:07,615
My top schools where I want
to apply to are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

198
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,034
My safety's Harvard.

199
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,495
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

200
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,622
What do you want to study?

201
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,375
Well... I haven't
decided for sure,

202
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,214
but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

203
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,216
What was your major?

204
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,137
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

205
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:34,558
Oh, that's interesting.
Did you hear they're not going
to teach Latin here anymore?

206
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,394
This was more like Central America.

207
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:40,397
Oh, Central America
and whatnot. Hmm.

208
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,234
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

209
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,403
They've got
to make room for Japanese.

210
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:50,574
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages were based on Latin.

211
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,660
Yeah, they are,
aren't they?

212
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,663
Nihilo sanctum estne?

213
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,416
What's that?
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?

214
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,418
What does that mean?

215
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,547
"Is nothing sacred?"

216
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:14,974
Sic transit gloria.
Glory fades.

217
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:17,601
I'm Max Fischer.

218
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,312
- Hi.
- Hi.

219
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,903
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

220
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:29,738
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

221
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:39,915
In summation,
I have only one question:

222
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,626
Is Latin dead?

223
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:51,594
Why don't you just piss off,
Fischer, you dotty skid mark?

224
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,053
Was that Latin?

225
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,772
Never in my wildest
imagination...

226
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:06,192
did I ever dream
I would have sons like these.

227
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,571
What's your dad do, Max?

228
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:16,118
He's a neurosurgeon...
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

229
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,163
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain,

230
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:22,082
but he seems to enjoy it.

231
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,211
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

232
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:30,549
- So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:34,720
Were you in the shit?

234
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,181
Yeah, I was in the shit.

235
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:39,975
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

236
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,895
- All right.
- What's on Sunday?

237
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,564
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

238
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,943
Do you want to come?

239
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:52,905
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

240
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:56,283
Yeah. Thanks for
the invitation, though.

241
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,663
Come work for me.

242
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,835
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I could use someone like you.

243
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:09,672
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

244
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,633
My father may only be
a doctor, but we manage.

245
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:16,345
- One-twelves!
- Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking to you.

246
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,349
You're on the team?

247
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,351
I'm an alternate.

248
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:26,397
How you doin'?
Good to see you again.

249
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:38,325
Whoa. Neat.

250
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,657
<i>Miss Cross?</i>

251
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:02,910
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation, the other day...

252
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,663
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

253
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,499
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

254
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, you did?

255
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,838
I understand you made
a very convincing argument.

256
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:19,468
I just thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're gonna continue the Latin program.

257
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:21,512
I'm very impressed.

258
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,265
Well, thank you very much.

259
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:26,934
Hey, you need an assistant?

260
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:30,688
- Do we get to have
an assistant around here?
- No, I doubt it.

261
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:33,190
I'm on scholarship, though...
academic scholarship...

262
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,860
so I get to do odd jobs and...

263
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,529
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

264
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,531
My husband went here.

265
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,455
I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

266
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,540
Well, he's dead now.

267
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,542
So I'm not, actually.

268
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,878
When did he die?

269
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,713
Last year.

270
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,216
My mother's dead.

271
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,344
I'm sorry to hear that.

272
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:05,139
She died when I was seven.

273
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:08,392
I guess we both have
dead people in our families.

274
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,399
What's going on in here?

275
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:19,779
These were just born.

276
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,034
I don't want alloys. I want steel.

277
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:29,413
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

278
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,542
Steel, Harry.

279
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:37,421
- So you've changed your mind,
and you want the job?
- No.

280
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,757
But I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

281
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,426
What Rushmore
needs is an aquarium...

282
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,095
a first-class aquarium...
where the scientists can lecture...

283
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,432
and the students can observe
the marine life in its natural habitat.

284
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:51,060
- I don't know.
What do you think, Ernie?
- An aquarium?

285
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:55,106
- What kind of fish?
- Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout,

286
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,109
hammerheads, piranhas,
giant squid, octopi...

287
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:02,196
- Piranhas? Really?
- Yes, I'm talking
to a guy in South America.

288
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,991
- What'd Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.

289
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:07,993
Why?

290
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,747
Because at this moment, I feel the
best strategy is to keep it low profile.

291
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,750
The more preparation work I can do,
the stronger our case will be...

292
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,795
- when we take it to the administration.
- How much money do you want?

293
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:22,091
Thirty-five thousand dollars,
for the initial plans.

294
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:33,978
I'll give you 2,500.

295
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:35,521
Okay.

296
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,696
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

297
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:05,903
- Max.
- Mm-hmm?

298
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,448
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

299
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:14,286
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

300
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,003
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

301
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:25,464
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student...

302
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:28,509
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

303
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:32,471
- I'm surprised you
brought it up so bluntly.
- I just want to make sure...

304
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:38,060
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

305
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:39,854
Good.

306
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,648
And, um...

307
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:46,277
the... the truth is, neither
one of us has the slightest idea...

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,195
where this relationship is going.

309
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,907
- We can't predict the future.
- We don't have a relationship, Max.

310
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:54,827
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

311
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,496
That's all I meant by "relationship".

312
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,373
You want me to grab a dictionary?

313
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:03,210
No, I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

314
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:05,296
I understand.

315
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:08,466
You're not attracted to me.

316
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:10,551
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

317
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,762
Max, you're 15 years old.

318
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,057
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

319
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,101
If you say so.

320
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,437
Look, all I'm getting at is that...

321
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:26,942
that I've never met anyone like you.

322
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:31,322
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

323
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:38,162
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

324
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,876
You haven't, have you?

325
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:48,881
Want to shake hands?

326
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,843
I'm glad we had this conversation.

327
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,345
So am I.

328
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:58,182
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

329
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:01,143
Oh, come on, Frank.
You'll have complete protection.

330
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,104
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

331
00:25:03,187 --> 00:25:05,272
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

332
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,692
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

333
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:12,154
- Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court...
- No!

334
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,491
- No, what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify.

335
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,034
Go, go, go.

336
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:20,955
I'll expect your gun
and your badge on my desk...

337
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,999
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

338
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:26,752
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end...

339
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:29,130
of the line... where I got to be.

340
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:30,923
So help me God.

341
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,050
<i>- Someone coming out of the building.</i>
- I've got something!

342
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:36,178
<i>- Wait. This could be it.</i>
- There's action across the street.

343
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,597
<i>- Yeah, it's him.</i>
- It's Snowman.

344
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,144
- He's getting on the "L" train!
- Take him!

345
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,648
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max...

346
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:50,943
You're supposed to say,
"Forget about it, Sanchez.
The old man likes his cannolis".

347
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:53,654
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

348
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,323
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

349
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,993
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

350
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,036
Don't fuck with my play!

351
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:03,664
- You fucking cocksucker...
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

352
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,541
I'm gonna kill you.

353
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:15,092
Max. Max.

354
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,745
- I thought the acting
tonight was excellent.
- Thanks.

355
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,456
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

356
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:48,250
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

357
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,670
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

358
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:54,799
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

359
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:00,721
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

360
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:04,058
- There he is. Max, that was great.
- I'm so glad you could come.

361
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:07,144
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

362
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:09,605
- Hi.
- Who's this guy?

363
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:16,237
- Peter.
- I really liked your play.
It was really cool.

364
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:19,782
- Yeah.
- What happened to your nose?

365
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,285
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

366
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,705
- What's your excuse?
- Hey, author.

367
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:28,332
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

368
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:30,960
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

369
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:33,003
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

370
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,005
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross...

371
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:38,008
and I didn't catch
this young gentleman's name.

372
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:42,221
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

373
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:44,807
These are O.R. scrubs.

374
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,101
"O.R." they?

375
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,772
Well, they're totally
inappropriate for the occasion.

376
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:54,150
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

377
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:56,569
That's because you weren't invited.

378
00:27:56,735 --> 00:28:01,157
- Take it easy, Max.
- You were the one that ordered
him a whiskey and soda.

379
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:03,033
So what's wrong with that?

380
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,413
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

381
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,917
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

382
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,086
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

383
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:16,130
I wrote a hit play
and directed it.

384
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,549
So I'm not sweating it either.

385
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:20,134
Can we get a check, please?

386
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:22,428
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

387
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,472
No, you're not. Excuse me.

388
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:26,599
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

389
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,768
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three,

390
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:32,271
but, uh, someone invited
himself along, so I apologize.

391
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:35,775
- Quite all right, sir. Very well.
- Okay.

392
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:37,610
You're being rude, Max.

393
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:39,153
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

394
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:42,656
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play...

395
00:28:42,782 --> 00:28:45,701
and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

396
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:49,205
- Would you like me
to pass you the creamer, Doc?
- Yes, please.

397
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:53,292
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

398
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:57,254
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

399
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,381
How did I hurt your feelings?

400
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:03,844
Oh, my God!
I wrote a hit play!

401
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:10,434
And I'm in love with you.

402
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,112
Put that a little bit there.

403
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:44,218
- Hi.
- Were you hiding over there?

404
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:47,471
Uh, I didn't want
to disrupt class.

405
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,975
What's that you're painting?

406
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:54,270
That's a... a jellyfish.

407
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:57,231
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

408
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,442
Max wants to talk to you.

409
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:03,279
- What for?
- To apologize, I think.

410
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,781
Should we talk over here?

411
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,326
He sent you?

412
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:10,995
Yeah.

413
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,914
Are you his messenger?

414
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,251
No, I'm his friend.

415
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:21,964
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

416
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:27,303
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

417
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,014
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

418
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:32,808
No. No, I know, but...

419
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:35,811
I think I let him
get too attached.

420
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,147
What do you think?

421
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:41,484
Well, I think
you did your best.

422
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:47,656
Tell him I'm sorry.

423
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:55,039
Okay.

424
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,794
What is your first name?

425
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,590
Rosemary. What's yours?

426
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,133
Herman.

427
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:12,431
He wrote you a letter.

428
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:14,308
<i>Dear Miss Cross,</i>

429
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,811
<i>I would like to take this opportunity</i>
<i>to formally apologize...</i>

430
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,438
<i>for the events</i>
<i>of the night of the 23rd.</i>

431
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:22,149
<i>I'm not accustomed</i>
<i>to drinking alcohol.</i>

432
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:26,445
<i>Please do me the service</i>
<i>of coming to the unveiling of</i>
<i>a new venture I've undertaken.</i>

433
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:29,406
<i>I hope you will attend,</i>
<i>if possible.</i>

434
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:32,868
<i>I remain your friend, Max Fischer.</i>

435
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,336
Cut the music and no more pictures.

436
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,630
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

437
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:47,758
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

438
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,343
Did you see her?

439
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,679
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

440
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:54,181
- Shall I go ahead
and take care of this tree?
- Let's wait a few minutes.

441
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:57,143
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Oh, hey, Coach Beck. Good to see you.

442
00:31:57,268 --> 00:31:58,853
This is where we're
putting in the new aquarium.

443
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,855
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

444
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:03,607
This is my baseball diamond.

445
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:07,695
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

446
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:10,489
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

447
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:14,368
- Where did you hear that?
- My source indicated
that it was a possibility.

448
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:16,954
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

449
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:19,790
- Max?
- Excuse me, George.

450
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:21,792
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

451
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:24,128
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

452
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:27,631
- I guess she got sick.
- You know she's not sick.
Give me the phone.

453
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,971
Janet, Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

454
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:37,391
Well, where is he?

455
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:39,935
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

456
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,605
I don't give a shit
about the barracudas,

457
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:45,149
but, fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

458
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,152
Max!

459
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,154
Where are those damn
chain saws coming from?

460
00:32:50,237 --> 00:32:52,156
- He's right over there!
- Max!

461
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:54,325
- Max!
- Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

462
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,994
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- We're having a fund-raiser for the...

463
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:59,079
Turn that damn thing off!

464
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,624
Tell me this isn't happening.

465
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:04,752
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

466
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:30,986
...chapter seven.

467
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,533
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

468
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:39,036
His name's Max Fischer,
and he's actually asked...

469
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:41,413
to say a few words to the class.

470
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:44,333
Max, you want to take it away?

471
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:47,128
Sure. Thanks very much.

472
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:50,840
I just wanted to introduce myself.

473
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,347
I'm Max Fischer.

474
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:01,183
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy,

475
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,936
which I recently
got expelled from.

476
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:08,649
This is my first time
in a public school.

477
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:12,111
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,

478
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:14,321
but I'm no elitist.

479
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:16,782
I think you've got
some great facilities,

480
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:20,369
and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

481
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,788
One footnote.

482
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:25,332
I notice you don't have
a fencing team.

483
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,669
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

484
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,801
- Max?
- Yes?

485
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:38,888
Hi, I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

486
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:42,183
- I just wanted to tell you
that I liked your speech.
- Thank you.

487
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:46,312
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

488
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,481
No? How unfortunate.

489
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:51,817
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way,

490
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,736
- but I think I know...
- What do you mean?

491
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,321
- Well...
- You know what?

492
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:58,824
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

493
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,246
En garde!

494
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:16,050
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

495
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:21,931
Yeah?

496
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,099
Okay.

497
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:26,310
Hey, Max, how's it going?

498
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:29,063
Terrible. Tell me something. When you
talked to Miss Cross the other day...

499
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,524
Do you have a telephone pass?

500
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,693
- Excuse me.
Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

501
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:38,781
I gotta tell ya, I don't know what you
see in her. I don't think she's right for you.

502
00:35:38,864 --> 00:35:40,449
What's that supposed to mean?

503
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:45,287
I mean, she's not
that beautiful.

504
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,707
She's not that intriguing.

505
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:52,628
I mean, she has something that
you can't put your finger on, but...

506
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:55,339
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments are
valuable, but let's get to the point.

507
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:58,300
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

508
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:01,095
- No.
- Hang on.

509
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,098
I'm talking on the telephone.

510
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:06,684
Oh, come on.

511
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,436
That's rude.

512
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:25,870
Hey, Fischer.

513
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:29,206
You better beat it, sonny.

514
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:32,293
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

515
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,629
Showboat. Always talkin'.

516
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:40,050
Picking a kid like Dirk because his mother's
a great piece, and then getting nowhere.

517
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:42,136
Like everything you do.

518
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:45,264
Big show. No results.

519
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:49,935
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

520
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:52,313
A fucking lie.

521
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,151
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium? Nah.

522
00:36:57,276 --> 00:37:00,905
It was the hand job.
You want to know something else?

523
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:02,740
It was worth it.

524
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,953
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

525
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:11,373
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

526
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:15,669
I will. You okay?

527
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:19,590
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I miss Rushmore.

528
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:21,717
I miss the seasons.

529
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:24,720
Watching the leaves change.

530
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:27,932
By the way, what time
does the library close?

531
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,726
I've got an overdue book
to turn in.

532
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,777
That is your handwriting,
isn't it?

533
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,571
My husband gave me this book...

534
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:46,117
when he came to visit England
when I was 13 and he went to Rushmore.

535
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,786
So when he died,
I gave it to the library here.

536
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,083
You remind me of him, you know?

537
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,585
I do?

538
00:37:57,086 --> 00:37:58,754
How?

539
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:00,840
Well...

540
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:05,803
you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

541
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:08,556
Yeah. I was president of them.

542
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,558
He founded that club.

543
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,860
Do you think we can be
friends again, Miss Cross?

544
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:25,656
- In-In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course I do.

545
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:29,743
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

546
00:38:30,578 --> 00:38:33,622
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

547
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,764
Fighting Owls, let's go!

548
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:41,482
Let's go!

549
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:46,904
Let's go!

550
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,451
Okay, what else do we got?

551
00:39:52,535 --> 00:39:55,204
- Alan's got the birds for your approval.
- I'll take the green one.

552
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,665
- And here's the knife.
- That's too fake.

553
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,917
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

554
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,088
What's your name again?

555
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,090
- Margaret Yang.
- Margaret Yang.

556
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:08,092
What are you doing seventh period,
Margaret Yang?

557
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:11,262
- I have guitar lessons.
- Classical guitar or... In what school?

558
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:14,598
- Rock.
- Ro... That's good.
We can get you out of that.

559
00:40:15,057 --> 00:40:17,101
Could I see you without
your glasses on, please?

560
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:21,355
Let's put Margaret down for 3:30
in the auditorium, Woody.

561
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,441
Thank you.

562
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:25,609
And-And bring
a head shot, please.

563
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:39,540
Hello, Herman.

564
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:42,126
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

565
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:46,547
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

566
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:50,926
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

567
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:54,472
Nice house.

568
00:40:54,638 --> 00:40:59,643
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

569
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:04,690
Um... you were
in the neighborhood?

570
00:41:05,816 --> 00:41:08,652
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

571
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:11,614
A trip to the museum
or something?

572
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,451
No, I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight.

573
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:18,204
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

574
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,998
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

575
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:23,709
Yeah, he's doing very well,
isn't he?

576
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,089
Do you want a carrot?

577
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,675
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

578
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:35,471
Thank you.

579
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:48,984
Well, I'll probably
be seeing you soon.

580
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:55,449
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

581
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:07,711
Sure.

582
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,048
The weather's nice, isn't it?

583
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,759
A little brisk.

584
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:17,096
I'll just get a sweater.
I'll be back in a minute.

585
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,212
Dirk?

586
00:42:50,713 --> 00:42:53,382
I know about you
and the teacher.

587
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,897
- Does Max know?
- No, and I don't want him to know, ever.

588
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,025
I just want it
to stop right now.

589
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:13,360
You're a married man, Blume,

590
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:15,780
and you're supposed
to be his friend.

591
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:18,657
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

592
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:21,577
Oh, yeah. And with friends
like you, who needs friends?

593
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,092
Unlock it!

594
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,599
Little Calloway.

595
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:51,273
You're standing up
for the wrong guy.

596
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,275
Fischer ain't your mate.

597
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,236
What are you talking about, Buchan?

598
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:57,363
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

599
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:00,366
That's the only reason he picked you
as his chapel partner.

600
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:03,828
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

601
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:08,040
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

602
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:13,546
- Max would never say that.
- Yeah.

603
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:15,548
I suppose you're right.

604
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:20,177
After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't
need to impress anybody now, does he?

605
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:25,141
The killing's gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

606
00:44:25,307 --> 00:44:27,601
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

607
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:31,564
People be trying to kill you.
Are you talkin' about you're
gonna get rid of your gun?

608
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,317
It's time, homey.

609
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:37,069
Kiss me, Little Juan.

610
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:39,530
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

611
00:44:39,655 --> 00:44:41,240
Is that for me?

612
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:44,910
<i>Dear Max, I am sorry to say</i>
<i>that I have secretly found out...</i>

613
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:47,913
<i>that Mr. Blume is having</i>
<i>an affair with Miss Cross.</i>

614
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,875
<i>My first suspicions came when I saw them</i>
<i>Frenching in front of her house,</i>

615
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:54,211
<i>and then I knew for sure</i>
<i>when they went skinny-dipping</i>
<i>in Mr. Blume's swimming pool,</i>

616
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:58,591
<i>giving each other hand jobs while you</i>
<i>were taking a nap on the front porch.</i>

617
00:44:58,757 --> 00:45:00,968
<i>Why am I telling you this now?</i>

618
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:03,679
<i>Because you're such a good friend.</i>

619
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:05,347
<i>Take care, pal.</i>

620
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:08,601
<i>Fondly, Dirk Calloway.</i>

621
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:12,396
God.

622
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:16,358
How was she, Herman?

623
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:18,694
Jesus Christ.

624
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:21,363
Was she good?
I bet she was.

625
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:24,366
Although, I wouldn't know
because I never screwed her.

626
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:28,954
Going skinny-dipping
while I took a nap.

627
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:32,166
"Are you comfortable, Max?
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude,

628
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,668
getting hand jobs
from the woman you love."

629
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:37,379
We never went skinny-dipping.

630
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:39,965
Sure, you didn't.
And next you're gonna tell me...

631
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:43,052
you didn't just walk out of her house
at 2:00 in the morning.

632
00:45:46,305 --> 00:45:48,557
I'm in love with her.

633
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:53,562
Well, I was in love
with her first.

634
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:59,902
And all that crap about,
"I don't think she's that great.

635
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:01,695
I don't think she's right
for you, Max."

636
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,198
That was all bullshit,
wasn't it?

637
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:08,369
Do you think
she's in love with you?

638
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:12,581
I don't know.

639
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:16,877
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

640
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:20,714
Max.

641
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:25,719
I saved Latin.

642
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,058
What did you ever do?

643
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:36,063
On the planet I come from...

644
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:38,649
the sun only comes out once a year.

645
00:46:40,818 --> 00:46:42,736
- That is why my skin...
- Excuse me.

646
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,488
Oh, I'm sorry.

647
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:47,283
I just came by to thank you
for wrecking my life.

648
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:54,748
Max, what are you doing?

649
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:11,098
<i>Hello, Mrs. Blume.</i>

650
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:15,144
<i>This is Max Fischer. I have some</i>
<i>information regarding your husband.</i>

651
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:19,482
<i>Please return my call on my voice mail:</i>
<i>Grover Cleveland High School, extension 23.</i>

652
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:21,358
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

653
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:27,323
Thank you for meeting me.

654
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:29,617
You're welcome.

655
00:47:31,368 --> 00:47:33,871
Would you like a sandwich?

656
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,458
All right.

657
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:44,131
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

658
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:46,133
Sorry it's not
something more exotic.

659
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:48,969
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

660
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:52,389
Milk or apple juice?

661
00:47:52,515 --> 00:47:54,558
Get to the point.

662
00:47:56,393 --> 00:47:58,354
Okay.

663
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:02,525
Your husband's...

664
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:13,661
- How long will you be staying
with us, Mr. Blume?
- Indefinitely.

665
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:16,330
- I'm being sued for divorce.
- Very good, sir.

666
00:48:16,455 --> 00:48:18,457
Yo, shorty.

667
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,668
Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

668
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:23,379
I might want to take a dip
after I have dinner and hit the bar.

669
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,214
It's on the roof, sir.

670
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:07,084
He's about five foot three,
112 pounds,

671
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:11,172
black hair, glasses, oval face.

672
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:29,857
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad.
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

673
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:33,277
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

674
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:47,208
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

675
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:50,544
- This is private property! You're trespassing!
- What, are you crazy?

676
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:54,586
Wait a minute!

677
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:56,926
Stop!

678
00:51:57,009 --> 00:52:01,806
- Let's have a truce for a second.
- Wait! Truce! Truce!

679
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:13,150
What's this all about?

680
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:17,196
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

681
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:19,573
- What?
- Did you say it?

682
00:52:19,698 --> 00:52:22,493
Who told you
that goddamn lie?

683
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,662
Never mind.
I know who said it.

684
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:26,205
I think I'm gonna stick
a knife in his heart,

685
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,457
then I'm gonna send him back to Ireland
in a body bag.

686
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:30,167
He's from Scotland.

687
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:34,505
Well, tell that stupid Mick he just
made my list of things to do today.

688
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,175
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

689
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:43,514
So you received the package?

690
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,266
Good.

691
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:48,686
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

692
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:54,358
I never took you
for an informer, Max.

693
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,027
What's that supposed to mean?

694
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:59,363
"What's that supposed to mean?"

695
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:06,871
She resigned this morning before
I even got your little snapshots.

696
00:53:06,996 --> 00:53:09,081
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

697
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:12,001
But she's one of the best teachers
you've got. How could you let her go?

698
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,670
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

699
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,964
I'm trying to win her back!

700
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:35,691
Miss Cross?

701
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:37,693
Hi, Max.

702
00:53:42,907 --> 00:53:45,367
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

703
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:51,874
- Oh, here, let me see.
- No. Please. Look, I don't think
you should come in here.

704
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:56,504
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

705
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,549
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but...

706
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:04,762
- Please, Max...
- You honestly believe
you love Blume instead of me?

707
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,722
Yes.

708
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:08,974
Well, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

709
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,684
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross...

710
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:15,356
- Listen, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't...
- It's too late.

711
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:17,358
It's too late.

712
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,572
Wait. Please.

713
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,955
I got kicked out
because of you.

714
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,458
- No, you got kicked out...
- Rushmore was my life.

715
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:37,837
- Now you are.
- No, I'm not.

716
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:43,134
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

717
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:46,262
Do you think
we're gonna have sex?

718
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:51,934
That's a kind
of cheap way to put it.

719
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:54,478
Not if you've ever
fucked before, it isn't.

720
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:59,400
Oh, my God.

721
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:02,945
How would you describe it
to your friends?

722
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:05,239
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

723
00:55:05,322 --> 00:55:08,868
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

724
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,831
Please get out of my classroom.

725
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:25,593
Fresh are you, sporty, me fuck-up.

726
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:27,136
Hey, Magnus.

727
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:30,139
Got any good hand jobs lately?

728
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:37,271
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

729
00:55:37,354 --> 00:55:41,150
It's your stepfather, waiting
for your mom so that he can get a piece.

730
00:55:43,402 --> 00:55:46,489
Your mind's as warped
as your ear, Buchan.

731
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:53,871
Don't get nasty, brother.

732
00:56:11,514 --> 00:56:16,852
We got him, Dirk.
We got him.

733
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:34,161
Max?

734
00:56:35,496 --> 00:56:37,540
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

735
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,170
You said you wanted to meet?

736
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,757
W-When?

737
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:48,717
Right now.

738
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:51,929
You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

739
00:56:52,429 --> 00:56:57,935
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and
have that tree over there fall on you.

740
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:01,272
- That big one?
- Yup.

741
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:03,607
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

742
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:05,609
What stopped you?

743
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:09,321
I don't know.
What's the point?

744
00:57:09,488 --> 00:57:11,490
She loves you.

745
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:28,424
She's my Rushmore, Max.

746
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:32,720
Yeah, I know.
She was mine too.

747
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:38,953
Hello.

748
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:41,705
Hi. I was wondering
if Max was home.

749
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:46,794
He's not in.

750
00:58:53,884 --> 00:58:56,470
I'm sorry.

751
00:59:54,737 --> 00:59:57,782
Good night, Stan. Merry Christmas.

752
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,784
See you next time.

753
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:09,084
It's been nice having
your company here at the shop, Max.

754
01:00:09,835 --> 01:00:11,712
You put any more thought...

755
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:14,965
- into giving school another shot?
- No.

756
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:21,222
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

757
01:00:21,305 --> 01:00:24,475
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

758
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,562
You talked about being
a senator or a diplomat.

759
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:30,981
Pipe dreams, Dad.

760
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:33,275
I'm a barber's son.

761
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:40,282
See you at dinner.

762
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:02,054
Hello, Dirk.

763
01:01:02,221 --> 01:01:05,391
- Hi, Max.
- What can I do for you?

764
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:09,019
- I thought I might get a haircut.
- We're closed.

765
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:13,899
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

766
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:16,360
But I guess I'll go now.

767
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,079
Merry Christmas.

768
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:29,123
What in the hell's that?

769
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,351
So, did you hear the news?

770
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:53,397
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

771
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:55,775
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

772
01:01:57,026 --> 01:02:00,196
I'll send him a box of candy.

773
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:03,199
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

774
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:15,544
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in.

775
01:02:20,716 --> 01:02:23,135
It's so good to see you.

776
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:29,058
Oh, these are glorious.
I'll put them in some water.

777
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:31,268
Have a seat.

778
01:02:31,852 --> 01:02:34,647
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

779
01:02:34,772 --> 01:02:36,607
No, he can hear you.

780
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:48,410
Hey, old-timer.
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

781
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:53,040
You probably can't hear me because...

782
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:56,293
- I don't know if your brain is damaged or...
- What do you want?

783
01:03:00,131 --> 01:03:02,633
Nelson?

784
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:10,724
That's the first thing
he's said in ten days.

785
01:03:12,726 --> 01:03:14,645
Do you think he recognized me?

786
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:19,024
- Oh, I don't think so.
- It's Fischer.

787
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:38,210
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

788
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:42,381
Hey, amigo.

789
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:47,803
So, who gave you the shiner?

790
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:51,182
Either Ronny or Donny.

791
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:53,058
Can't tell the difference anymore.

792
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:57,021
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

793
01:03:57,062 --> 01:03:58,522
Hmm.

794
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:01,984
Kids don't like it when
their parents get divorced.

795
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:05,738
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

796
01:04:20,252 --> 01:04:22,421
How is she?

797
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,548
I really wouldn't know.

798
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:28,093
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

799
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,137
What happened?

800
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,307
She left?

801
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:36,644
She's in love
with a dead guy anyway.

802
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,397
Edward Appleby.

803
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:45,277
You know, uh...

804
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,239
she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

805
01:04:52,243 --> 01:04:55,746
- Adios, muchacho.
- Hey, are you okay?

806
01:04:57,456 --> 01:05:00,376
Mmm, I'm a little bit
lonely these days.

807
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:35,202
Max?

808
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,621
What are you doing here?

809
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:41,750
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

810
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:44,378
- It was... It was so sudden.
- What?

811
01:05:44,753 --> 01:05:46,714
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?

812
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:50,759
- I just got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

813
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:52,595
Hmm? What did you say?

814
01:05:52,636 --> 01:05:54,763
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

815
01:05:57,475 --> 01:06:00,644
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

816
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:09,028
So, this is where it all happens.

817
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:12,198
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

818
01:06:12,323 --> 01:06:14,909
So, why did you dump Blume?

819
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:20,247
- That's none of your business.
- I know it's not.

820
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:23,250
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

821
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:25,294
I mean, I thought
you dumped me for Blume.

822
01:06:25,336 --> 01:06:28,297
- Then I hear...
- I never dumped you
because we were never going out.

823
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:31,383
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

824
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,344
Tell me what happened.

825
01:06:36,722 --> 01:06:38,057
Okay.

826
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:44,730
Um, A: He's married.

827
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:48,609
B: He hates himself.

828
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:52,738
And C: Well,
he smashed up your bicycle,

829
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:56,784
- didn't he?
- My previous bicycle, yes.

830
01:06:56,867 --> 01:07:01,038
- Well, what sort of person
does something like that?
- I don't know.

831
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:07,211
War does funny things to men.

832
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:11,465
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

833
01:07:13,717 --> 01:07:15,678
What does that mean?

834
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:22,560
Well, I mean, you live in his room,
with all his stuff. It's kind of...

835
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:26,981
I was married to him.

836
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:30,693
- I know you were.
- Although, I will say...

837
01:07:30,734 --> 01:07:35,698
that Edward has more
spark and character...

838
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:37,741
and imagination
in one fingernail...

839
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:40,744
than Herman Blume
has in his entire body.

840
01:07:43,164 --> 01:07:45,124
One dead fingernail.

841
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,464
Right.

842
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:54,508
One dead fingernail.

843
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:00,306
How did he die, by the way?

844
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:03,017
He drowned.

845
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:06,979
How did your mother die?

846
01:08:07,146 --> 01:08:09,356
She got cancer.

847
01:08:14,487 --> 01:08:17,448
Hold still for a moment, okay?

848
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:26,665
You're very pretty.

849
01:08:27,124 --> 01:08:29,043
Thank you.

850
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,900
Is this fake blood?

851
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,072
Yes, it is.

852
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:01,867
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

853
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,121
You're both little children.

854
01:09:07,373 --> 01:09:09,416
Let me show you the door.

855
01:09:11,127 --> 01:09:13,587
I'll just go back out the window.

856
01:09:27,518 --> 01:09:30,479
- Good-bye, Miss Cross.
- Good-bye, Max.

857
01:09:48,622 --> 01:09:50,040
Hey.

858
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:54,503
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about what I said...

859
01:09:54,545 --> 01:09:56,922
about your mom
giving me a hand job.

860
01:09:57,882 --> 01:10:00,050
I know, Max.

861
01:10:00,134 --> 01:10:03,762
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

862
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:06,849
Hey, uh, that's okay.

863
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:14,857
What's that?

864
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,445
I don't know.

865
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,586
Nice landing.

866
01:10:39,548 --> 01:10:43,177
What's, uh... What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

867
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,221
Hmm, pretty good.

868
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:47,765
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

869
01:10:47,848 --> 01:10:50,768
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

870
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:02,988
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

871
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:06,117
- They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's...
- No, not anymore.

872
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:09,578
- Why not?
- Because it was a fake.

873
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:12,873
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

874
01:11:12,957 --> 01:11:15,626
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

875
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:17,837
I thought it would,
but it didn't.

876
01:11:24,802 --> 01:11:27,680
You're a real jerk to me,
you know that?

877
01:11:29,473 --> 01:11:31,434
I'm sorry, Margaret.

878
01:11:32,977 --> 01:11:35,938
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

879
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:59,545
Do you want to take over for a while?

880
01:12:24,403 --> 01:12:26,530
Take dictation, please.

881
01:12:28,824 --> 01:12:32,703
Possible candidates
for Kite Flying Society.

882
01:12:33,704 --> 01:12:36,290
David Connors. Murray Marshall.

883
01:12:36,373 --> 01:12:39,293
Greg Holloway. Duncan Wright.

884
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,962
Margaret Yang. Woody Jackson.
Shoeshine Pickens.

885
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,753
- Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume.
- What can I do for you?

886
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:29,468
What's this?

887
01:13:33,848 --> 01:13:37,601
That's the Perfect Attendance Award
and the Punctuality Award.

888
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:40,020
I got those at Rushmore.

889
01:13:40,146 --> 01:13:42,022
I thought you could choose
which one you like more...

890
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:45,359
and you could wear that one,
and I could wear the other.

891
01:13:49,113 --> 01:13:50,990
I'll take Punctuality.

892
01:13:52,491 --> 01:13:53,909
Okay.

893
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:55,786
Come here.

894
01:14:04,795 --> 01:14:08,507
- Thank you.
- Come on inside.

895
01:14:12,511 --> 01:14:15,639
Well, well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

896
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:18,726
Sorry I'm late.

897
01:14:18,893 --> 01:14:20,561
That's okay.

898
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:22,521
I want you to meet someone.

899
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:26,025
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

900
01:14:29,403 --> 01:14:31,489
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Fischer.

901
01:14:31,614 --> 01:14:35,034
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

902
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:38,788
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

903
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:42,166
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have a look.

904
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:48,297
Mm-hmm.

905
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:53,511
I don't know, Bert.

906
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:57,723
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

907
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:00,392
Maybe we'll throw in
a shave as well.

908
01:15:01,185 --> 01:15:04,438
Okay, are you fond
of that mustache?

909
01:15:04,688 --> 01:15:08,651
Do you think you want to keep it
for a while? Mm-hmm.

910
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:12,571
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

911
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,865
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

912
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,742
- Good, good.
- Why?

913
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:18,911
'Cause we're gonna
need all of it.

914
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:30,524
She's not coming, is she?

915
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:34,278
Hmm, doesn't look good.

916
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:36,489
But don't worry. Come on, Herman.

917
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:39,575
- Shit, what am I doing here?
- Hey!

918
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,286
- Scatter. Scatter.
- Damn it!

919
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:46,582
How in the hell did you ever
get so rich? You're a quitter, man!

920
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:49,418
I paid $8 million for this.

921
01:16:51,712 --> 01:16:54,131
And that's all
you're prepared to spend?

922
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,353
I'm, uh, sorry you couldn't make it to
our little groundbreaking the other day.

923
01:17:07,978 --> 01:17:11,190
It's kind of a shame,
since he's building it for you.

924
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:15,736
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

925
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:19,198
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

926
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:21,450
Me neither.

927
01:17:22,034 --> 01:17:25,663
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

928
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:28,916
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

929
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,918
That's what I thought.

930
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:34,755
Blume's got a bit more spark and
vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

931
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,134
I thought the aquarium
was your idea.

932
01:17:39,009 --> 01:17:41,095
Well, I gave it to my friend.

933
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:43,806
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

934
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:47,643
And... could you make
the order out to...

935
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:50,020
Ready Demolition,
Tucson, Arizona?

936
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,816
Thank you very much.

937
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,239
Make sure these don't get wet.

938
01:18:03,075 --> 01:18:05,035
I'll see you at 3:15.

939
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:07,037
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

940
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:10,040
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

941
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:29,810
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

942
01:18:29,894 --> 01:18:31,145
I'd have shot you
in the other ear,

943
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:34,190
but it got blown off
a long time ago.

944
01:18:34,356 --> 01:18:39,153
- Besides, now we're even.
- Not for long, Kemo Sabe.

945
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,615
We'll see. I got
a proposition for you.

946
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:46,494
Well, you can stick it up
your mother's ass, you little prick.

947
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,579
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

948
01:18:48,704 --> 01:18:50,915
You've got a way with words.

949
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:52,875
You want to be in a play?

950
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:57,421
What's all that shite?

951
01:18:59,548 --> 01:19:01,425
Nothing.

952
01:19:02,092 --> 01:19:04,178
I just think
you're right for the part.

953
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:24,573
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

954
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:28,244
I know you did, mate.

955
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,008
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

956
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:45,886
Oh, boy, I gotta call the hospital.

957
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:49,098
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Whitney, the English teacher?

958
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,017
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

959
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:54,019
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

960
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:56,147
- Hello.
- That's kid's gonna burn this place down.

961
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,942
- You better believe it.
- Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

962
01:20:00,067 --> 01:20:02,319
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

963
01:20:02,445 --> 01:20:04,488
- Too late now.
<i>- Officers Brooks and Donovan...</i>

964
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:06,991
<i>requesting additional units</i>
<i>at Grover Cleveland High School.</i>

965
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:08,826
<i>- Units responding identify.</i>
- A program.

966
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:12,746
Let me look at that.
Turn it, turn it.

967
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,748
That's enough.

968
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:19,753
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

969
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:25,634
Hi, Herman.

970
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:31,932
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

971
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:41,901
Thank you very much.

972
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:46,572
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me,

973
01:20:46,655 --> 01:20:48,908
and I wanted
to make a dedication.

974
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,661
So, I'll just say that this play
is dedicated to the memory of my mother,

975
01:20:52,703 --> 01:20:55,080
Eloise Fischer,

976
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:58,959
and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

977
01:21:00,044 --> 01:21:02,671
Also, you'll find a pair
of safety glasses and some earplugs...

978
01:21:02,713 --> 01:21:04,673
underneath your seats.

979
01:21:04,715 --> 01:21:08,344
Please feel free to use them.
Thank you very much.

980
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:17,103
<i>Bravo Company, this is Tango 7.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

981
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:20,856
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action...

982
01:21:20,981 --> 01:21:23,484
This is a different kind of war.

983
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:26,904
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

984
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:40,626
How long you been
in country, soldier?

985
01:21:40,751 --> 01:21:42,962
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

986
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:45,047
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

987
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,716
Right on, brother.

988
01:21:49,885 --> 01:21:52,012
Hoo. Hoo-hoo.

989
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,643
Let's rock, Esposito!
I repeat, let's rock!

990
01:21:59,562 --> 01:22:01,397
Let's rock and roll!

991
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,141
Fischer!

992
01:22:40,186 --> 01:22:41,937
I'm okay. Go, go, go, go.

993
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:44,440
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

994
01:22:44,482 --> 01:22:46,609
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

995
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:49,195
- All right, bring me some more
ketchup very quickly, please.
- Effects!

996
01:22:49,278 --> 01:22:52,656
- This is gonna look stupid.
- No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

997
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:13,093
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

998
01:23:13,552 --> 01:23:15,596
Hold this one too, okay?

999
01:23:19,016 --> 01:23:23,270
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

1000
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:26,565
It's good.

1001
01:23:29,151 --> 01:23:32,154
But let's hope
it's got a happy ending.

1002
01:23:49,755 --> 01:23:54,385
- Adios, Esposito.
- Adios, Sarge.

1003
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:58,389
Say a prayer for Surf Boy,
wherever he is.

1004
01:23:58,472 --> 01:24:02,435
Semper fi, soldier.
Semper fi.

1005
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,979
Sic transit gloria.

1006
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:07,940
Maybe we'll meet again someday...

1007
01:24:08,107 --> 01:24:10,067
when the fighting stops.

1008
01:24:12,903 --> 01:24:15,906
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries!
We're movin' out!

1009
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,728
I don't know but I've been told

1010
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:22,204
I don't know but I've been told

1011
01:24:31,422 --> 01:24:33,340
Hello, Esposito.

1012
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:40,097
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?

1013
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,434
You bet I will.

1014
01:24:57,281 --> 01:25:01,035
That's my son.
That's my Maxie.

1015
01:25:09,627 --> 01:25:12,505
I just didn't expect to see you here.

1016
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:14,548
Did Max send you an invitation?

1017
01:25:14,632 --> 01:25:18,010
Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

1018
01:25:19,804 --> 01:25:24,058
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Yang.

1019
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:27,436
I, uh, actually wrote a different
version of the play two years ago,

1020
01:25:27,561 --> 01:25:29,355
but I couldn't
get it done over at Rushmore.

1021
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,649
- Oh, really? Why?
- Too political?

1022
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,652
No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

1023
01:25:34,735 --> 01:25:37,655
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

1024
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:40,199
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

1025
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:43,369
He's a barber.
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

1026
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:46,622
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

1027
01:25:46,747 --> 01:25:48,207
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

1028
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:52,586
I'd also like everyone to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Yang. This is Margaret.

1029
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:55,422
- Hello, Margaret.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

1030
01:25:55,506 --> 01:25:57,716
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

1031
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,718
It's clearly a safety hazard.

1032
01:25:59,802 --> 01:26:03,222
- Well, last year,
he tried to raise piranhas.
- Yeah, I know he did.

1033
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:06,475
- What did you think, Mr. Littlejeans?
- Best play ever, man.

1034
01:26:09,019 --> 01:26:10,980
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

1035
01:26:11,021 --> 01:26:14,024
Yeah? Fischer stepped
over half my bloody lines.

1036
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:16,068
That's funny.
I didn't notice.

1037
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:18,696
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

1038
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:21,365
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

1039
01:26:22,074 --> 01:26:26,120
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
- No, I'm a barber.

1040
01:26:26,203 --> 01:26:28,998
But a lot of people make that mistake.

1041
01:26:34,044 --> 01:26:36,338
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

1042
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,592
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

1043
01:26:39,675 --> 01:26:43,345
I loved it when you grabbed
onto the bottom of the chopper
as it was taking off.

1044
01:26:43,429 --> 01:26:45,389
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

1045
01:26:45,431 --> 01:26:47,391
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1046
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:49,935
Can you do
an Australian accent?

1047
01:26:50,019 --> 01:26:52,521
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

1048
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:55,566
I really feel like celebrating,
you know?

1049
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:59,487
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes, I would love to.

1050
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:01,155
- Great.
- Come on.

1051
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:03,282
You're looking good, Bert.

1052
01:27:03,365 --> 01:27:05,326
Hello, Mr. Blume.

1053
01:27:05,743 --> 01:27:08,370
Hello, Margaret.
May I cut in?

1054
01:27:08,412 --> 01:27:11,415
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

1055
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:15,002
- Ah, new girlfriend.
- Yes, I am.

1056
01:27:15,085 --> 01:27:19,006
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

1057
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:22,927
No, it's okay.
He's my friend.

1058
01:27:28,599 --> 01:27:31,811
Well... you pulled it off.

1059
01:27:31,936 --> 01:27:35,231
Yeah, it went okay.
At least nobody got hurt.

1060
01:27:37,483 --> 01:27:38,943
Except you.

1061
01:27:40,903 --> 01:27:43,906
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

1062
01:27:44,115 --> 01:27:47,159
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

1063
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:52,206
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, but...

1064
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:56,043
Here, let's see if the deejay can play
something with a little more... Reuben!
