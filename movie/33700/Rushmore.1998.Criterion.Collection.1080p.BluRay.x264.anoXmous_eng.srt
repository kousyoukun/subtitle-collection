1
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,193
If, and only if,
both sides of the numerator...

2
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:47,029
is divisible by the inverse
of the square root...

3
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,531
of the two unassigned variables.

4
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:52,826
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate...

5
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,754
is equal to or less than
the value of one.

6
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,174
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

7
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,461
Oh, that? Don't worry about that.
"M" is -

8
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,505
[ Isaac ]
Wait. Why?

9
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,256
I just put that up as a joke.

10
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,051
That's probably the hardest
geometry equation in the world.

11
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,686
How much extra credit is it worth?

12
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,765
Well, considering I've never seen
anyone get it right...

13
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,644
including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T...

14
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,413
I guess if anyone here
can solve that problem...

15
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,974
I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again...

16
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:26,067
for the rest of your lives.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,977
Max? Care to try it?

18
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,124
I'm sorry.
Did someone say my name?

19
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,456
You got it.

20
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:28,297
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

21
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:43,685
Thank you.

22
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:47,503
You guys have it real easy.

23
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:51,695
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

24
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:55,157
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is...

25
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:58,160
you go to one of the best schools
in the country:

26
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,703
- Rushmore.
- - Shh.

27
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,850
Now, for some of you...

28
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,240
it doesn't matter.

29
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:08,409
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

30
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,277
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

31
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,794
Take dead aim on the rich boys.

32
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:19,563
Get them in the crosshairs...

33
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,612
and take them down.

34
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:26,396
Just remember:
They can buy anything...

35
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,691
but they can't buy backbone.

36
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,936
Don't let them forget that.

37
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,696
Thank you.

38
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,464
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

39
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,625
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,377
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

41
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,830
The least these little pricks can do
is hear me out.

42
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,966
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

43
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,093
Hello. I'm Max Fischer.

44
00:03:56,094 --> 00:04:00,482
I just wanted to say that I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

45
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,058
Um... your speech was excellent.

46
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,062
- Thank you.
- Hello.

48
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:10,649
Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

49
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,068
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

50
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,971
Well, thanks.

51
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,577
You know...

52
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,967
I really think you're right
about Rushmore.

53
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,899
Come on, Dirk.

54
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:32,463
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

55
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,729
Sharp little guy.

56
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,853
He's one of the worst students we've got.

We're putting you on what we call
"sudden death academic probation."

74
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,233
And what does that entail?

75
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:07,015
It entails that if you fail another class...

76
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,929
you'll be asked to leave Rushmore.

77
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,186
In other words, I’ll be expelled.

78
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,813
That's correct.

79
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:15,740
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

80
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:20,195
Too many extracurricular activities, Max.
Not enough studying.

81
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,611
Mm-hmm.

82
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,870
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job...

83
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,998
but the fact is,
no matter how hard I try...

84
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,292
I still might flunk another class.

85
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,795
If that means I have to stay on for
a postgraduate year, then so be it, but -

86
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,040
We don't offer a postgraduate year.

87
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:42,217
Well... we don't offer it yet.

88
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,413
Just bring up the grades.

89
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,056
Do you remember
how I got into this school?

90
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:51,268
Yes. You wrote a play.

91
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,645
That's right. Second grade.

92
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,565
A little one-act about Watergate.

93
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,067
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

94
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,331
And you read it, and you gave me
a scholarship, didn't you?

95
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:04,614
Mm-hmm.

96
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:07,396
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

97
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:10,260
But I still might have to expel you.

98
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,080
Couldn't -

99
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,422
Couldn't we just let me float by?

100
00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:16,918
For old time's sake?

101
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,456
Can't do it, Max.

102
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,884
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no. Not again.

103
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,511
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

104
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,775
try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

105
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,396
Did you hear they're
teaching Japanese next year?

106
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:38,641
That's the rumor.

107
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,805
- And they're canceling Latin.
- What?

108
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,530
I tried to get Latin canceled
for five years.

109
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,783
"It's a dead language,"
I'd always say.

110
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,613
Well, I guess they finally heard you.

111
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,140
Excuse me.

112
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,182
Could I please see a list of all the people
who've checked out this book in the past year?

113
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,938
Why?

114
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,290
Look at that.

115
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,234
Hmm.

116
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:01,565
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both;"

117
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,346
and I believe
they both get paid in the end.

118
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,070
But the fools first.

119
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,925
"Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button."

120
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,580
- Meet me on the corner in 10 minutes.
- Where are you going?

121
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,124
I'll tell you in the squad car.

122
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,709
Oh, and, Willie...

123
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,128
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

124
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,470
He died in his sleep.

125
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,383
[ Max ]
Excellent. That was excellent.

126
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,218
That was great. That was great.

127
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,889
Um, Irving. Could you get some root beers
for anybody who wants one?

128
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,724
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

129
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,774
All right. Next scene.

130
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,855
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

131
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,316
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are...

132
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,401
to have someone like you
looking out for Dirk.

133
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,361
Oh, don't be silly.

134
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,614
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart...

135
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:54,469
some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

136
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,953
This has my number on it
if you need to call me...

137
00:09:56,954 --> 00:10:00,040
or need help with Dirk
or anything like that.

138
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,875
[ Mrs. Calloway ]
Well, thank you very much.

139
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,877
- Hello, Dirk.
- Hi, Mom.

140
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,712
- How are you, honey?
- Fine.

141
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,542
- Bye.
- Bye. It was so nice to see you again.

142
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,593
Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?

143
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,136
What math test?

144
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,138
I thought you had a math test today.

145
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,225
No. Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

146
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,981
Yeah, I got an extension.

147
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,063
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

148
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,689
We shook hands.

149
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,316
Big deal.

150
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:28,443
And I gave her my phone number.

151
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,904
Buchan said he'd have already
banged her by now.

152
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,280
What?

153
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,242
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

154
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,787
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

155
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:42,502
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,709
What are you, a lawyer?

157
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,586
Hey, Mr. Blume.

158
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:48,755
Hey. It's Max Fischer.

159
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,340
Oh, hi.

160
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,760
Hey, Max. My mom just showed up.
Is it okay if I leave early? Over.

161
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:55,517
Sure, Charlie.

162
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,061
What's the secret, Max?

163
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,896
"The secret"?

164
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,400
Yeah. Well, you seem to
have it pretty figured out.

165
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,449
The secret. I don't know. Uh -

166
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,488
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do...

167
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,611
and then do it
for the rest of your life.

168
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,716
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

169
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,499
- Shotgun.
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys -

170
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,012
- Get in the back. I said "Shotgun."
- Get in the back, Donny.

171
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,007
Let's go.

172
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,013
- Did you invite that kid to your party?
- Max Fischer?

173
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,223
Come on, Dad.
There's gonna be girls there. I'd rather die.

174
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,565
Pull your head out of your ass.

175
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,188
- Good night, Mr. Little jeans.
- Good night, Max.

176
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,994
I'll see you tomorrow.

177
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,422
May I see the back, please?

178
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:01,833
Certainly.

179
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,874
How's that?

180
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,679
Thank you.

181
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,340
I need a signature
on this geometry test, by the way.

182
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,096
Let's see.

183
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,345
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

184
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,561
A 37.

185
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,929
Oh, I don't know what to do anymore.

186
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,988
It could have been worse.

187
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,692
You almost got the "A."

188
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:35,816
"Almost got the 'A" '?
Dad, what are you writing?

189
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:45,372
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs...

190
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,874
and putting on plays.

191
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,001
That's possible.

192
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,545
I should probably be trying harder
to score chicks.

193
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:56,456
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

194
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,386
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

195
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,763
It'll happen, Max. It's just -

196
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,683
You're like one of
those clipper ship captains.

197
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,851
You're married to the sea.

198
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,853
Yes, that's true.

199
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,635
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

200
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,198
Hello.

201
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,955
Hi.

202
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,711
I like your hat.

203
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,296
Oh, thank you.

204
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,078
You're a teacher here, aren't you?

205
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,303
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

206
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,060
Uh-huh.

207
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:48,184
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

208
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:50,137
Well, let's see now.

209
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,440
- H-How old are you?
- Fifteen.

210
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,401
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

211
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,319
You should quit.

212
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
You're right.

213
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,208
And I should mind my own business.

214
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:12,584
Where did you go to school,
by the way?

215
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,585
- Harvard.
- Really?

216
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,463
That's a coincidence.

217
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:19,966
My top schools where I want to apply to
are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

218
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,674
My safety's Harvard.

219
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,888
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

220
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,889
What do you want to study?

221
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:30,977
Well... I haven't decided for sure...

222
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:35,607
but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

223
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,692
What was your major?

224
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:42,493
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

225
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:47,118
Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear they're
not going to teach Latin here anymore?

226
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,704
This was more like Central America.

227
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,916
Oh, Central America and whatnot.
Hmm.

228
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,376
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

229
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,353
They've got to make room for Japanese.

230
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:03,218
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages are based on Latin.

231
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,219
Yeah, they are, aren't they?

232
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,979
Nihilo sanctum estne?

233
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,183
What's that?

234
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:13,696
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?
What does that mean?

235
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,169
Is nothing sacred?

236
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,074
Sic transit gloria.

237
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,617
Glory fades.

238
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,245
I'm Max Fischer.

239
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,977
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:40,255
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

241
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,340
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

243
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:46,386

♪ Are soft as summer rain ♪

246
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,837
In summation,
I have only one question:

247
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,103
Is Latin dead?

248
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:57,272
♪ The sidewalks and the street ♪

249
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:00,608
♪ The concrete and the clay
beneath my feet ♪

250
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:03,987
Why don't you just
piss off, Fischer, you dotty wee skid mark?

251
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:05,548
Was that Latin?

252
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,123
Never in my wildest imagination...

253
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:18,344
did I ever dream
I would have sons like these.

254
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,481
What's your dad do, Max?

255
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,510
He's a neurosurgeon
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

256
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,806
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain...

257
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:33,953
but he seems to enjoy it.

258
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,520
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

259
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,358
So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken?

260
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,311
Yeah.

261
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,280
Were you in the shit?

262
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,782
Yeah, I was in the shit.

263
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,327
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

264
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,745
All right.

265
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,496
What's on Sunday?

266
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:57,832
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

267
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,669
Do you want to come?

268
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,632
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

269
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:09,852
Yeah. Thanks for the invitation though.

270
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,825
Come work for me.

271
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:18,297
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I-I-I could use someone like you.

272
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:22,231
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

273
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:25,151
My father may only be a doctor,
but we manage.

274
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,653
One-twelves!

275
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,995
Excuse me, Mr. Blume.
Nice talking to you.

276
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:35,215
- You're on the team?
- I'm an alternate.

277
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,248
How you doin'?
Good to see you again.

278
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,440

Miss Cross?

296
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,303
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation the other day -

297
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:18,139
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

298
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,975
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

299
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,560
Oh, you did?

300
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,683
I understand you made
a very convincing argument.

301
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,783
I just thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're gonna continue the Latin program.

302
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:33,821
I'm very impressed.

303
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:36,163
Well, thank you very much.

304
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,660
Hey, you need an assistant?

305
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,788
Do we get to have
an assistant around here?

306
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,331
No, I doubt it.

307
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,833
I'm on scholarship though -
academic scholarship -

308
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,628
so I get to do odd jobs and -

309
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,089
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

310
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,333
My husband went here.

311
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,970
I, uh -

312
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:00,014
I didn't know you were married.

313
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:02,100
Well, he's dead now.

314
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,102
So I'm not, actually.

315
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,395
When did he die?

316
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,152
Last year.

317
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,879
My mother's dead.

318
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,029
I'm sorry to hear that.

319
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,371
She died when I was seven.

320
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,960
I guess we both have dead people
in our families.

321
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,882
What's going on in here?

322
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,414
These were just born.

323
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't want alloys.
I want steel.

324
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:41,146
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

325
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,351
Steel, Harry.

326
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:49,313
So you've changed your mind,
and you want the job?

327
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,485
No. But I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

328
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,153
What Rushmore needs
is an aquarium -

329
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,572
a first-class aquarium -
where the scientists can lecture...

330
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,950
and the students can observe
the marine life in its natural habitat.

331
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:02,702
I don't know.
What do you think, Ernie?

332
00:21:02,703 --> 00:21:04,704
An aquarium? What kind of fish?

333
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:07,582
Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout...

334
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,501
hammerheads, piranha,
giant squid, octopi -

335
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,086
Piranhas? Really?

336
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,547
Yes, I'm talking to a guy
in South America.

337
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:18,426
- What'd Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.

338
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,469
Why?

339
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,390
Because at this moment, I feel
the best strategy is to keep it low profile.

340
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:26,350
The more preparation work I can do...

341
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,936
the stronger our case will be
when we take it to the administration.

342
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,855
How much money do you want?

343
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,270
$35,000, for the initial plans.

344
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,916
I'll give you 2,500.

345
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:47,986

- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

359
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,504
- Max?
- Mm-hmm?

360
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:22,359
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

361
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:26,787
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

362
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,271
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

363
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:38,065
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student -

364
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:41,235
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

365
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,529
I'm surprised
you brought it up so bluntly.

366
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,742
I just want to make sure -

367
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:50,703
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

368
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:52,705
Good.

369
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:54,461
And, um...

370
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,586
the - the truth is
neither one of us has the slightest idea...

371
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,421
where this relationship is going.

372
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,214
We can't predict the future.

373
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:04,342
We don't have a relationship, Max.

374
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:07,261
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

375
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,930
That's all I meant by "relationship."

376
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,016
You want me to grab a dictionary?

377
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,561
No. I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

378
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:17,772
I understand.

379
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,065
You're not attracted to me.

380
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,249
C'est la vie.

381
00:24:23,737 --> 00:24:26,029
Max, you're 15 years old.

382
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,137
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

383
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:31,619
If you say so.

384
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,205
Look, all I'm getting at is that -

385
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,342
that I've never met anyone like you.

386
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,139
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

387
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:50,155
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

388
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:56,573
You haven't, have you?

389
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,620
Want to shake hands?

390
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:04,658
I'm glad we had this conversation.

391
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,270
So am I.

392
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:10,783
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

393
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:13,536
Oh, come on, Frank.
You’ll have complete protection.

394
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,371
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

395
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,790
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

396
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:21,377
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

397
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:23,963
Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court -

398
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,923
- No!
- No, what?

399
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,800
No, I'm not gonna testify.

400
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,844
Go, go, go.

401
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:32,847
I'll expect your gun and your badge
on my desk -

402
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,517
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

403
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,853
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end...

404
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:41,605
of the line... where I got to be.

405
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,441
So help me God.

406
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,776
- Someone coming out of the building.
- I've got something!

407
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,696
- Wait. This could be it.
- There's action across the street.

408
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,573
- Yeah, it's him.
- It's Snowman.

409
00:25:53,326 --> 00:25:55,744
- He's getting on the el train!
- Take him!

410
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:00,124
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max -

411
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,419
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it,
Sanchez. The old man likes his cannolis."

412
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,213
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

413
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:08,799
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

414
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,469
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

415
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,846
Don't fuck with my play!

416
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,056
- You fucking cocksucker -
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

417
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,975
I'm gonna kill you.

418
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:27,407
Max. Max.

419
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,595
I thought the acting tonight
was excellent.

420
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:57,890
Thanks.
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

421
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,684
I’ll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

422
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,021
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

423
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,144
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

424
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,239
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

425
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,282
There he is.
Max, that was great.

426
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,867
I'm so glad you could come.

427
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,578
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

428
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,121
Hi.

429
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:23,415
Who's this guy?

430
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,459
Peter.

431
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,796
I really liked your play.
It was really cool.

432
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,172
Yeah.

433
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:33,050
What happened to your nose?

434
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,844
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

435
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:37,596
What's your excuse?

436
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:39,139
Hey, author.

437
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,891
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

438
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,352
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

439
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,604
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

440
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:47,481
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross -

441
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,848
And I didn't catch
this young gentleman's name.

442
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,371
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

443
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,802
These are O.R. scrubs.

444
00:27:57,325 --> 00:28:01,078
"O.R." they?

445
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,998
Well, they're totally inappropriate
for the occasion.

446
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,419
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

447
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,253
That's because you weren't invited.

448
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,421
Take it easy, Max.

449
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,347
You were the one that ordered him
a whiskey and soda.

450
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:15,509
So what's wrong with that?

451
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,852
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

452
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,310
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

453
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,437
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

454
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,522
I wrote a hit play and directed it.

455
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:30,983
So I'm not sweating it either.

456
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,693
Can we get a check, please?

457
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:34,862
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

458
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,947
No, you're not. Excuse me.

459
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,074
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

460
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:41,327
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three...

461
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:44,705
but, uh, someone invited himself along,
so I apologize.

462
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,415
- Quite all right, sir.
- Okay.

463
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,708
Very well.

464
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:49,835
You're being rude, Max.

465
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:51,587
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

466
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:55,049
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out why
you brought this gentleman to my play...

467
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,976
and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

468
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:00,679
Would you like me
to pass you the creamer, Doc?

469
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,556
Yes, please.

470
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:05,643
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

471
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,766
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

472
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:11,815
How did I hurt your feelings?

473
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,984
Oh, my God!

474
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,571
I wrote a hit play!

475
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,617
And I'm in love with you.

476
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:31,460
Put that a little bit there.

477
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:33,753
Put that a little bit there.

478
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:54,525
Hi.

479
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,735
Were you hiding over there?

480
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:59,517
Uh, I didn't want to disrupt class.

481
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,325
What's that you're painting?

482
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:06,643
That's a - a jellyfish.

483
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,623
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

484
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,042
Max wants to talk to you.

485
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,752
What for?

486
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:16,296
To apologize, I think.

487
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,638
Should we talk over here?

488
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,922
- He sent you?
- Yeah.

489
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:26,382
Are you his messenger?

490
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,977
No, I'm his friend.

491
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:34,075
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

492
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,188
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

493
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,199
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

494
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,824
No. No, I know, but...

495
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:48,009
I think I let him get too attached.

496
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,801
What do you think?

497
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,174
Well, I think you did your best.

498
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,956
Tell him I'm sorry.

499
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,436
Okay.

500
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,109
What is your first name?

501
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,105
Rosemary.

502
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,107
What's yours?

503
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,864
Herman.

504
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,990
He wrote you a letter.

505
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,700
Dear Miss Cross...

506
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,328
I would like to take this opportunity
to formally apologize...

507
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,872
for the events
of the night of the 23rd.

508
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:34,583
I'm not accustomed
to drinking alcohol.

509
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:38,879
Please do me the service of coming to the
unveiling of a new venture I've undertaken.

510
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,799
I hope you will attend, if possible.

511
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,302
I remain your friend, Max Fischer.

512
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,937
Cut the music,
and no more pictures.

513
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:57,064
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

514
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,983
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

515
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,860
Did you see her?

516
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,570
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

517
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,572
Shall I go ahead
and take care of this tree?

518
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:07,866
- Let's wait a few minutes.
- What's going on here, Maxie?

519
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,743
Oh, hey, Coach Beck.
Good to see you.

520
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:11,578
This is where
we're putting in the new aquarium.

521
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,622
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

522
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:16,250
This is my baseball diamond.

523
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:20,087
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

524
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,451
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

525
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:26,677
- Where did you hear that?
- My source indicated that it was a possibility.

526
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,263
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

527
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,889
Max?

528
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,599
Excuse me, George.

529
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,268
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

530
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,603
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

531
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,897
- I guess she got sick.
- You know she's not sick.

532
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:41,142
Give me the phone.

533
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,864
Janet. Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

534
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,547
Well, where is he?

535
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,369
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

536
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,830
I don't give a shit about the barracudas...

537
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,791
but fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

538
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,003
Max!

539
00:33:01,004 --> 00:33:03,005
Where are those damn
chain saws coming from?

540
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:05,090
- He's right over there!
- Max! Max!

541
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:06,758
Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

542
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,552
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

543
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,014
- We're having a fund-raiser for the -
- Turn that damn thing off!

544
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,891
Tell me this isn't happening.

545
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:17,402
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

546
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,165
...chapter seven.

547
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:48,008
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

548
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:50,260
His name's Max Fischer...

549
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,773
and he's actually asked
to say a few words to the class.

550
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,600
Max, do you want to take it away?

551
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:59,373
Sure. Thanks very much.

552
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,530
I just wanted to introduce myself.

553
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,031
I'm Max Fischer.

554
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:13,617
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy...

555
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,959
which I recently got expelled from.

556
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:21,041
This is my first time
in a public school.

557
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:24,586
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth...

558
00:34:24,587 --> 00:34:26,838
but I'm no elitist.

559
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,257
I think you've got some great facilities...

560
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:33,387
and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

561
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:35,222
One footnote.

562
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,766
I notice you don't have a fencing team.

563
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:41,086
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

564
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,235
- Max?
- Yes?

565
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:51,196
Hi. I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

566
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,740
I just wanted to tell you
that I liked your speech.

567
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:54,992
Thank you.

568
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,704
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

569
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:01,081
No? How unfortunate.

570
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:04,251
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way.

571
00:35:04,252 --> 00:35:06,169
- But I think I know -
- What do you mean?

572
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,921
- Well -
- You know what?

573
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:11,727
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

574
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:17,055
En garde!

575
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,442
Janet. Max Fischer. Is he in?

576
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,614
Yeah?

577
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:36,810
Okay.

578
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:39,536
- Hey, Max, how's it going?
- Terrible.

579
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,747
Tell me something. When you talked
to Miss Cross the other day -

580
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,958
Do you have a telephone pass?
Excuse me.

581
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,044
- Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

582
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,463
I gotta tell ya,
I don't know what you see in her.

583
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,256
I- I don't think she's right for you.

584
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,110
What's that supposed to mean?

585
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:57,298
I mean, she's not that beautiful.

586
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:01,141
She's not that intriguing.

587
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:04,644
I mean, she has something
that you can't put your finger on, but -

588
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:07,856
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments
are valuable, but let's get to the point.

589
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:10,979
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

590
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,445
- No.
- Hang on.

591
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:16,520
I'm talking on the telephone.

592
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,827
- Oh, come on.
- That's rude.

593
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,523
Hey, Fischer.

594
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,348
You better beat it, sonny.

595
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:44,763
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

596
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,063
Showboat. Always talkin'.

597
00:36:48,064 --> 00:36:50,482
Picking a kid like Dirk
because his mother's a great piece...

598
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:52,526
and then getting nowhere.

599
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,611
Like everything you do.

600
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,246
Big show. No results.

601
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:02,366
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

602
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:04,663
A fucking lie.

603
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,688
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium?

604
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:11,419
Nah. It was the hand job.

605
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,372
You want to know something else?
It was worth it.

606
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,428
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

607
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:23,356
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

608
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,883
I will.

609
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,311
You okay?

610
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,995
Yeah, I'm fine, but I miss Rushmore.

611
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,693
I miss the seasons.

612
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:37,070
Watching the leaves change.

613
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:39,705
By the way,
what time does the library close?

614
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,959
I've got an overdue book to turn in.

615
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:52,670
That is your handwriting, isn't it?

616
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:55,046
My husband gave me this book...

617
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:57,340
when he came to visit England
when I was 13.

618
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,426
And he went to Rushmore,
so when he died...

619
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,524
I gave it to the library here.

620
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,517
You remind me of him, you know?

621
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,311
I do?

622
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:11,271
How?

623
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:13,174
Well...

624
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,578
you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

625
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:21,031
Yeah. I was president of them.

626
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,275
He founded that club.

627
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,919
Do you think we can
be friends again, Miss Cross?

628
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,046
In-In a strictly platonic way?

629
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,048
Of course I do.

630
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:42,439
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

631
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:45,186
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

- That's too fake.

656
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,398
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

657
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,397
- What's your name again?
- Margaret Yang.

658
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,442
Margaret Yang. What are you doing
seventh period, Margaret Yang?

659
00:40:20,443 --> 00:40:22,110
I have guitar lessons.

660
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:24,362
- Classical guitar or - In what school?
- Rock.

661
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:27,240
Ro - That's good.
We can get you out of that.

662
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,021
Could I see you
without your glasses on, please?

663
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,913
Let's put Margaret down
for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody.

664
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,082
Thank you.

665
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,168
And-And bring a head shot, please.

666
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,848
Hello, Herman.

667
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,392
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

668
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:58,930
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

669
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,693
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

670
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,780
Nice house.

671
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,740
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.

672
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:11,521
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

673
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,514
Um... you were in the neighborhood?

674
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,960
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

675
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,089
A trip to the museum or something?

676
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,884
No, I don't think so.
I-I think he's rehearsing tonight.

677
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,637
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

678
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:33,473
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

679
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:36,108
Yeah, he's doing very well, isn't he?

680
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,306
Do you want a carrot?

681
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:44,449
Yeah, I’ll have one of those.

682
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:48,238
Thank you.

683
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,418
Well, I'll probably be seeing you soon.

684
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,351
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

685
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,973
Sure.

686
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,612
The weather's nice, isn't it?

687
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:25,307
A little brisk.

688
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,287
I’ll just get a sweater.
I’ll be back in a minute.

689
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,393
Dirk?

690
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,161
I know about you and the teacher.

691
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:17,410
Does Max know?

692
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:20,246
No, and I don't want him
to know, ever.

693
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:23,271
I just want it to stop right now.

694
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,451
You're a married man, Blume...

695
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,546
and you're supposed to be his friend.

696
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:31,174
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

697
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,213
Oh, yeah. And with friends like you,
who needs friends?

698
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:49,831
Unlock it!

699
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,927
Little Calloway.

700
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,625
You're standing up for the wrong guy.
Fischer ain't your mate.

701
00:44:05,626 --> 00:44:07,627
What are you talking about, Buchan?

702
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:09,712
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

703
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,757
That's the only reason
he picked you as his chapel partner.

704
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:16,135
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

705
00:44:16,136 --> 00:44:20,576
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

706
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,811
Max would never say that.

707
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:27,647
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

708
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:29,983
After all, the son of a brain doctor...

709
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:32,569
doesn't need to impress anybody
now, does he?

710
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,574
The killing's gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

711
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,034
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

712
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:41,661
People be trying to kill you.

713
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:45,174
Are you talkin' about
you're gonna get rid of your gun?

714
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,709
It's time, homey.

715
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,460
Kiss me, Little Juan.

716
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:51,921
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

717
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,965
Is that for me?

718
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:57,427
Dear Max, I am sorry to say
that I have secretly found out...

719
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,346
that Mr. Blume is having an affair
with Miss Cross.

720
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:03,349
My first suspicions came when I saw them
Frenching in front of her house...

721
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,686
and then I knew for sure when they went
skinny-dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool...

722
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,898
giving each other hand jobs while
you were taking a nap on the front porch.

723
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:13,359
Why am I telling you this now?

724
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,112
Because you're such a good friend.

725
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,989
Take care, pal.

726
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,551
Fondly, Dirk Calloway.

727
00:45:22,161 --> 00:45:24,404
God.

728
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,686
How was she, Herman?

729
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,586
Jesus Christ.

730
00:45:31,587 --> 00:45:34,005
Was she good? I bet she was.

731
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:37,008
Although, I wouldn't know
'cause I never screwed her.

732
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:41,054
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap.

733
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:42,764
"Are you comfortable, Max?

734
00:45:42,765 --> 00:45:47,101
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude, getting
hand jobs from the woman you love."

735
00:45:47,102 --> 00:45:49,200
We never went skinny-dipping.

736
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:51,481
Sure you didn't.

737
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:56,282
And next you're gonna tell me you didn't just
walk out of her house at 2:00 in the morning.

738
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:01,205
I'm in love with her.

739
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:05,918
Well, I was in love with her first.

740
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,708
And all that crap about...

741
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:14,170
"I don't think she's that great.
I don't think she's right for you, Max."

742
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,512
That was all bullshit, wasn't it?

743
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:21,435
Do you think she's in love with you?

744
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:25,404
I don't know.

745
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:29,905
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

746
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:33,194
Max.

747
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:38,416

00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,942

Hello, Mrs. Blume.
This is Max Fischer.

762
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,493
I have some information
regarding your husband.

763
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:31,831
Please return my call on my voice mail:
Grover Cleveland High School, extension 23.

764
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,701
Thank you very much.

765
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,804
Thank you for meeting me.

766
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:42,527
You're welcome.

767
00:47:43,844 --> 00:47:46,185
Would you like a sandwich?

768
00:47:47,973 --> 00:47:49,729
All right.

769
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:56,397
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

770
00:47:56,398 --> 00:47:58,483
Sorry it's not something more exotic.

771
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:01,167
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

772
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,114
Milk or apple juice?

773
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,533
Get to the point.

774
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:11,162
Okay.

And how long will you
be staying with us, Mr. Blume?

777
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:27,512
Indefinitely.
I'm being sued for divorce.

Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

780
00:48:33,227 --> 00:48:36,020
I might want to take a dip

Thanks for bailing me out, Dad.
Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

823
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:46,026
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

824
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,598
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

825
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,642
This is private property.
You're trespassing!

826
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:03,643
What, are you crazy?

827
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,467
Wait a minute!

828
00:52:08,316 --> 00:52:11,110
Stop!
Let's have a truce for a second.

829
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:14,477
Wait! Truce! Truce!

830
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:25,957
What's this all about?

831
00:52:27,335 --> 00:52:29,712
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

832
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,614
- What?
- Did you say it?

833
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,334
Who told you that goddamn lie?

834
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:38,554
Never mind. I know who said it.
And I'm gonna stick a knife in his heart.

835
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,848
Then I'm gonna send him
back to Ireland in a body bag.

836
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:42,641
He's from Scotland.

837
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:46,838
Well, tell that stupid mick he just made
my list of things to do today.

838
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,069
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

839
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:55,035
So you received the package?

840
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,823
Good.

841
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:00,785
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

842
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:07,333
I never took you for an informer, Max.

843
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:09,794
What's that supposed to mean?

844
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:12,526
"What's that supposed to mean?"

845
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,092
She resigned this morning
before I even got your little snapshots.

846
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:21,847
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

847
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,475
But she's one of the best teachers you've got.
How could you let her go?

848
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:26,977
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

849
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,687
I'm trying to win her back!

850
00:53:46,206 --> 00:53:47,961
Miss Cross?

851
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,464
Hi, Max.

852
00:53:55,423 --> 00:53:57,591
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

853
00:53:57,592 --> 00:54:00,970
- Oh, damn.
- Oh, here. Let me see.

854
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,190
No. Please, look.
I don't think you should come in here.

855
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:09,267
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

856
00:54:09,563 --> 00:54:12,489
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but -

857
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,942
Please, Max -

858
00:54:14,943 --> 00:54:17,236
You honestly believe you love Blume
instead of me?

859
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:19,113
Yes.

860
00:54:19,114 --> 00:54:21,699
Well, you’ll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

861
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,908
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross.

862
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:25,995
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'm gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't -

863
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,580
It's too late.

864
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:29,434
It's too late.

865
00:54:33,879 --> 00:54:35,976
Wait. Please.

866
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,513
- I got kicked out because of you.
- No, you got kicked out -

867
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,057
Rushmore was my life.

868
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:48,809
Now you are.

869
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,712
No, I'm not.

870
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:55,032
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

871
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,855
Do you think we're gonna have sex?

872
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,096
That's a kind of cheap way to put it.

873
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:07,085
Not if you've ever fucked before,
it isn't.

874
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:11,211
Oh, my God.

875
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,473
How would you describe it
to your friends?

876
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:17,546
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

877
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,710
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

878
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:26,430
Please get out of my classroom.

879
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,025
Fisher, you spotty wee fuckup.

880
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:39,610
Hey, Magnus.

881
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,952
Got any good hand jobs lately?

882
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:49,662
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

883
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:53,666
It's your stepfather, waiting for your mom
so that he can get a piece.

884
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:59,194
Your mind's as warped as your ear,
Buchan.

885
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:06,527
Don't get nasty, brother.

886
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,994
We got him, Dirk.

887
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,569
We got him.

888
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,174
Max?

889
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:50,110
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

890
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,727
You said you wanted to meet?

891
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:59,307
Wh-When?

892
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:03,787
Right now. You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

893
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:09,538
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and have
that tree over there fall on you.

894
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:12,411
That big one?

895
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:13,829
Yup.

896
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,248
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

897
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:18,199
What stopped you?

898
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:21,378
I don't know. What's the point?

899
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:24,290
She loves you.

900
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:41,043
She's my Rushmore, Max.

901
00:57:41,983 --> 00:57:44,861

01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:21,359
It's been nice having your company
here at the shop, Max.

943
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:25,938
You put any more thought
into giving school another shot?

944
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,499
No.

945
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,612
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

946
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:36,482
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

947
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:40,385
You talked about
being a senator or a diplomat.

948
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,372
Pipe dreams, Dad.

949
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,958
I'm a barber's son.

950
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,957
See you at dinner.

951
01:01:13,278 --> 01:01:16,154
- Hello, Dirk.
- Hi, Max.

952
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:19,992
- What can I do for you?
- I thought I might get a haircut.

953
01:01:19,993 --> 01:01:21,553
We're closed.

954
01:01:22,453 --> 01:01:26,053
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

955
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:29,036
But I guess I'll go now.

956
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,469
Merry Christmas.

957
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,714
What in the hell's that?

958
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,359
So, did you hear the news?

959
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:05,954
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

960
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,296
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

961
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,800
I’ll send him a box of candy.

962
01:02:13,046 --> 01:02:15,387
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

963
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:25,223
Mrs. Guggenheim?

964
01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:28,444
Hello, Max. Come in.

965
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:36,536
It's so good to see you.

966
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:41,531
Oh, these are glorious.
I’ll put them in some water.

967
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:43,484
Have a seat.

968
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:47,204
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

969
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,205
No, he can hear you.

970
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:58,048
Hey, old-timer.

971
01:02:58,049 --> 01:03:00,829
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

972
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,389
You probably can't hear me because...

973
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,516
I don't know if your brain
is damaged or -

974
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:10,102
What do you want?

975
01:03:11,896 --> 01:03:16,042
Nelson?

976
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:23,348
That's the first thing he's said
in 10 days.

977
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:27,243
Do you think he recognized me?

978
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,955
Oh, I don't think so.

979
01:03:29,956 --> 01:03:31,565
It's Fischer.

980
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,053
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

981
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,306
Hey, amigo.

982
01:03:57,442 --> 01:03:59,734
So, who gave you the shiner?

983
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,780
Either Ronny or Donny.

984
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:06,367
Can't tell the difference anymore.

985
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,494
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

986
01:04:09,495 --> 01:04:11,621
Hmm.

987
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:14,541
Kids don't like it
when their parents get divorced.

988
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:17,836
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

989
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,462
How is she?

990
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,855
I really wouldn't know.

991
01:04:36,856 --> 01:04:40,124
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

992
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,456
What happened?

993
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:46,401
- She left?
- Yeah.

994
01:04:46,866 --> 01:04:49,353
She's in love with a dead guy anyway.

995
01:04:50,703 --> 01:04:53,044
Edward Appleby.

996
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,547
You know, uh...

997
01:04:58,377 --> 01:05:00,914
she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

998
01:05:04,717 --> 01:05:06,384
Adios, muchacho.

999
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:08,385
Hey, are you okay?

1000
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:13,269
Mmm. I'm a little bit lonely
these days.

1001
01:05:45,591 --> 01:05:47,543
Max?

1002
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:50,796
What are you doing here?

1003
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,266
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

1004
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:56,461
- It was so sudden.
- What?

1005
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:00,689
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?
I just got hit by a car.

1006
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,233
Oh, my God. A-A-Are you okay?

1007
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:05,110
Hmm? What did you say?

1008
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:07,403
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

1009
01:06:09,782 --> 01:06:12,904
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

1010
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,668
So, this is where it all happens.

1011
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:24,754
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

1012
01:06:24,755 --> 01:06:27,966
So, why did you dump Blume?

1013
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,504
That's none of your business.

1014
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,013
I know it's not.

1015
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:35,807
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

1016
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:38,143
I mean, I thought you dumped me
for Blume. Then I hear -

1017
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:40,979
I never dumped you
because we were never going out.

1018
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,982
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

1019
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,734
Tell me what happened.

1020
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:50,827
Okay.

1021
01:06:53,326 --> 01:06:56,789
Um, A: He's married.

1022
01:06:57,997 --> 01:07:01,082
He hates himself.

1023
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,985
And C: Well...

1024
01:07:03,961 --> 01:07:07,005
he smashed up your bicycle,
didn't he?

1025
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:09,424
My previous bicycle, yes.

1026
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,801
Well, what sort of a person
does something like that?

1027
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:13,607
I don't know.

1028
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,684
War does funny things to men.

1029
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:23,881
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

1030
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:27,920
What does that mean?

1031
01:07:29,737 --> 01:07:32,822
Well, I mean, you live in his room...

1032
01:07:32,823 --> 01:07:35,312
with all his stuff. It's kind of -

1033
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:39,850
I was married to him.

1034
01:07:40,373 --> 01:07:42,457
I know you were.

1035
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:47,258
Although, I will say that Edward
has more spark and character...

1036
01:07:48,214 --> 01:07:50,256
and imagination
in one fingernail...

1037
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:53,526
than Herman Blume has
in his entire body.

1038
01:07:55,513 --> 01:07:57,854
One dead fingernail.

1039
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:04,020
Right.

1040
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:06,265
One dead fingernail.

1041
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:12,556
How did he die, by the way?

1042
01:08:13,197 --> 01:08:15,538
He drowned.

1043
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:19,125
How did your mother die?

1044
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,052
She got cancer.

1045
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:28,920
Hold still for a moment, okay?

1046
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,825
You're very pretty.

1047
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,465
Thank you.

1048
01:09:02,496 --> 01:09:04,983
Is this fake blood?

1049
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:10,911
Yes, it is.

1050
01:09:11,672 --> 01:09:14,501
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

1051
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:17,669
You're both little children.

1052
01:09:19,972 --> 01:09:22,313
Let me show you the door.

1053
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:26,381
I'll just go back out the window.

1054
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,868
Good-bye, Miss Cross.

1055
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:43,624
Good-bye, Max.

1056
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:02,514
Hey.

1057
01:10:02,515 --> 01:10:04,465
I'm, uh -

1058
01:10:05,184 --> 01:10:09,965
I'm sorry about what I said
about your mom giving me a hand job.

1059
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:12,524
I know, Max.

1060
01:10:12,525 --> 01:10:16,194
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

1061
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:19,756
Hey, uh, that's okay.

1062
01:10:25,204 --> 01:10:27,350
What's that?

1063
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:32,377
I don't know.

1064
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:48,196
Nice landing.

1065
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:55,525
What's, uh - What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

1066
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:58,069
Hmm. Pretty good.

1067
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,280
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

1068
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,647
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

1069
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:15,295
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

1070
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:17,380
They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's -

1071
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:20,592
- No, not anymore.
- Why not?

1072
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:22,385
Because it was a fake.

1073
01:11:22,386 --> 01:11:25,430
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

1074
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:28,183
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

1075
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:30,719
I thought it would, but it didn't.

1076
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:40,558
You were a real jerk to me,
you know that?

1077
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:44,064
I'm sorry, Margaret.

1078
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:48,629
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

1079
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:12,206
Do you want to take over for a while?

1080
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,162
Take dictation, please.

1081
01:12:41,006 --> 01:12:44,665

I want you to meet someone.

1110
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:38,514
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

1111
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,961
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fischer.

1112
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:47,673
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

1113
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:51,260
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

1114
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:55,310
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we’ll have a look.

1115
01:14:58,977 --> 01:15:00,733
Mm-hmm.

1116
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,067
I don't know, Bert.

1117
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:09,677
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

1118
01:15:10,197 --> 01:15:13,658
Maybe we'll throw in a shave as well.

1119
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:16,585
Okay. Are you fond of that mustache?

1120
01:15:17,162 --> 01:15:21,699
Do you think you want to
keep it for a while? Mm-hmm.

1121
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:25,169
- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

1122
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,630
- Over 10 million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1123
01:15:27,631 --> 01:15:29,507
- Good, good.
- Why?

1124

- Hey!

1136
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:54,634
- Scatter. Scatter.
- Damn it!

You're a quitter, man!

1139
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:02,588
I paid eight million dollars for this.

1140
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:07,065
And that's all you're prepared to spend?

1141
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:20,169
I'm, uh, sorry you couldn't make it
to our little groundbreaking the other day.

1142
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,746
It's kind of a shame
since he's building it for you.

1143
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:28,209
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

1144
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,430
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

1145
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:33,719
Me neither.

1146
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:37,615
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

1147
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:41,347
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

1148
01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:43,432
That's what I thought.

1149
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:47,228
Blume's got a bit more spark and vitality
than you expected, doesn't he?

1150
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:50,107
I thought the aquarium was your idea.

1151
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:53,901
Well, I gave it to my friend.

1152
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,320
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

1153
01:17:56,321 --> 01:17:58,573
And...

1154
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:01,325
could you make the order out
to Ready Demolition...

1155
01:18:01,326 --> 01:18:03,278
Tucson, Arizona?

1156
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:06,775
Thank you very much.

1157
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:13,415
Make sure these don't get wet.

1158
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,466
I’ll see you at 3:15.

1159
01:18:17,467 --> 01:18:19,343
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

1160
01:18:19,344 --> 01:18:23,150
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

1161
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:42,283
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

1162
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:46,787
I'd have shot you in the other ear,
but it got blown off a long time ago.

1163

Besides, now we're even.

1164

1165
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:53,419
We’ll see.

1166
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,254
I got a proposition for you.

1167
01:18:55,255 --> 01:18:58,132
Well, you can stick it up your mother's ass,
you little prick.

1168
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,218
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

1169
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:03,596
You've got a way with words.

1170
01:19:03,597 --> 01:19:06,280
You want to be in a play?

1171
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,093
What's all that shite?

1172
01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:13,819
Nothing.

1173
01:19:14,566 --> 01:19:16,956
I just think you're right for the part.

1174
01:19:33,585 --> 01:19:37,585
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

1175
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,389
I know you did, mate.

1176
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,855
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

1177
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,076
Oh, boy. I gotta call the hospital.

1178
01:19:58,944 --> 01:20:01,278
Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Whitney,
the English teacher?

1179
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,488
Yes.

1180
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:04,407
Hi. I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

1181
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:06,200
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

1182
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:08,744
- Hello.
- That kid's gonna burn this place down.

01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:10,413
You better believe it.

1184
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,581
Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

1185
01:20:12,582 --> 01:20:14,792
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

1186
01:20:14,793 --> 01:20:17,420
- Too late now.
- Officers Brooks and Donovan...

1187
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:19,672
requesting additional units
at Grover Cleveland High School.

1188
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:21,424
Units responding, identify.

1189
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:25,302
The program.
Let me look at that. Turn it. Turn it.

1190
01:20:25,303 --> 01:20:27,303
That's enough.

1191
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:32,498
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

1192
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:38,113
Hi, Herman.

1193
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,830
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

1194
01:20:52,539 --> 01:20:55,124
Thank you very much.

1195
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:58,637
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me...

1196
01:20:59,212 --> 01:21:01,547
and I wanted to make a dedication.

1197
01:21:01,548 --> 01:21:05,176
So, I’ll just say that this play is dedicated
to the memory of my mother...

1198
01:21:05,177 --> 01:21:07,030
Eloise Fischer...

1199
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,942
and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

1200
01:21:12,642 --> 01:21:15,186
Also, you'll find a pair of safety glasses
and some earplugs...

1201
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:17,188
underneath your seats.

1202

Bravo Company,

1204
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:33,329
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action -

1205
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:36,040
This is a different kind of war.

1206
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:39,376
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

1209
01:21:53,225 --> 01:21:55,518
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

1210
01:21:55,519 --> 01:21:57,394
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1211
01:21:57,395 --> 01:21:59,688
Right on, brother.

1212

1219
01:22:52,617 --> 01:22:54,763
I'm okay. Go, go, go, go.

1220
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,121
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

1221
01:22:57,122 --> 01:22:59,081
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

1222
01:22:59,082 --> 01:23:01,125
All right. Bring me some more ketchup
very quickly, please.

1223
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:03,043
- Effects!
- This is gonna look stupid.

1224
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,212
No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

1225
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,064
Thank you.

1226
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,983
You're welcome.

1227
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:28,325
Hold this one too, okay?

1228
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:36,206
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

1229
01:23:37,203 --> 01:23:38,959
It's good.

1230
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:44,732
But let's hope it's got a happy ending.

1231
01:24:02,062 --> 01:24:04,208
Adios, Esposito.

1232
01:24:04,898 --> 01:24:06,815
Adios, Sarge.

1233
01:24:06,816 --> 01:24:09,318

1234

wherever he is.

1235
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:14,778
Semper fi, soldier. Semper fi.

1236

Sic transit gloria.

1237
01:24:17,702 --> 01:24:19,946
Maybe we'll meet again someday...

Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

- Too political?

No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

1254
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:50,127
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

1255
01:25:50,128 --> 01:25:52,629
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

1256
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,173
He's a barber.

1257
01:25:54,174 --> 01:25:56,175
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

1258
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:59,261
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

1259
01:25:59,262 --> 01:26:00,971
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

1260
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:03,974
I'd also like everyone
to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang.

1261
01:26:03,975 --> 01:26:06,185
- This is Margaret.
- Hello, Margaret.

1262
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:07,936
It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

1263
01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:10,564
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

1264
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:12,316
It's clearly a safety hazard.

1265
01:26:12,317 --> 01:26:15,903
- Well, last year he tried to raise piranhas.
- Yeah, I know he did.

1266
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:19,336
- What did you think, Mr. Little jeans?
- Best play ever, man.

1267
01:26:21,493 --> 01:26:23,577
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

1268
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:26,747
Yeah? Fischer stepped over
half my bloody lines.

1269
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,749
That's funny. I didn't notice.

1270
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,418
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

1271
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,248
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

1272
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,341
I understand
you're a neurosurgeon.

1273
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:40,302
No, I'm a barber.
But a lot of people make that mistake.

1274
01:26:46,518 --> 01:26:48,936
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

1275
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:52,189
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

1276
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:56,026
I loved it when you grabbed onto the bottom
of the chopper as it was taking off.

1277
01:26:56,027 --> 01:26:58,112
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

1278
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:00,030
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1279
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:02,533
Can you do an Australian accent?

1280
01:27:02,534 --> 01:27:05,077
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

1281
01:27:05,078 --> 01:27:08,122
I really feel like celebrating, you know?

1282
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:10,165
Would you care to dance?

1283
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:12,084
Oh, yes, I-I would love to.

1284
01:27:12,085 --> 01:27:13,710
- Great.
- Come on.

1285
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:16,046
You're looking good, Bert.

1286
01:27:16,047 --> 01:27:18,340
Hello, Mr. Blume.

1287
01:27:18,341 --> 01:27:20,968
Hello, Margaret. May I cut in?

1288
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,971
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

1289
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,848
Ah, new girlfriend.

1290
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:27,724
Yes, I am.

1291
01:27:27,725 --> 01:27:31,237
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

1292
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:33,897
No, it's okay.

1293
01:27:33,898 --> 01:27:36,191
He's my friend.

1294
01:27:41,072 --> 01:27:44,032
Well... you pulled it off.

1295
01:27:44,033 --> 01:27:45,909
Yeah, it went okay.

1296
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,959
At least nobody got hurt.

1297
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:51,670
Except you.

1298
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,420
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

1299
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,104
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

1300
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,011
Would you like to dance?

1301
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:07,931
Yeah, but - Here, let's see if the deejay
can play something with a little more -
