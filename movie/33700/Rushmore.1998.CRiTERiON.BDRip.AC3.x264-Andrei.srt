1
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,431
<i>If, and only if,
both sides of the numerator...</i>

2
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:47,100
<i>is divisible by the inverse
of the square root...</i>

3
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,644
<i>of the two unassigned variables.</i>

4
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:52,982
Good. Except when the value
of the "X" coordinate...

5
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:56,109
is equal to or less than
the value of one.

6
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:59,445
- Yes, Isaac?
- What about that problem?

7
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,990
Oh, that?
Don't worry about that.

8
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:04,491
- "M" is...
- Wait. Why?

9
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:06,849
I just put that up as a joke.
That's probably...

10
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,124
...the hardest geometry equation
in the world.

11
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,793
How much extra credit is it worth?

12
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,795
Well, considering I've never
seen anyone get it right,

13
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,921
including my mentor,
Dr. Leaky at M.I.T.,

14
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,591
I guess if anyone here
can solve that problem,

15
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,761
I'd see to it that none of you ever
have to open another math book again...

16
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,598
for the rest of your lives.

17
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,689
Max? Care to try it?

18
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,276
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

19
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,439
You got it.

20
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:28,532
Fischer! Fischer!
Fischer! Fischer! Fischer!

21
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,631
Thank you.

22
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,424
You guys have it real easy.

23
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:51,595
I never had it like this
where I grew up.

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,140
But I send my kids here
because, the fact is,

25
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,937
you go to one of the best
schools in the country:

26
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,939
- Rushmore.
- Shh.

27
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:02,107
Now, for some of you,

28
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,358
it doesn't matter.

29
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,112
You were born rich,
and you're going to stay rich.

30
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,157
But here's my advice
to the rest of you:

31
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,997
Take dead aim
on the rich boys.

32
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,624
Get them
in the crosshairs...

33
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,127
and take them down.

34
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:26,420
Just remember:
They can buy anything,

35
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,591
but they can't buy backbone.

36
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,092
Don't let them forget that.

37
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,388
Thank you.

38
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:44,106
Free for graduation, Herman?
Perhaps you could give us an encore.

39
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,648
- Nicholas! Copernicus!
- I don't give a shit.

40
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,399
I paid for the whole damn natatorium.

41
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,280
The least these little pricks
can do is hear me out.

42
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,823
- Hi, Dr. Guggenheim.
- Hello, Max.

43
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,950
Hello, I'm Max Fischer.

44
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,370
I just wanted to say that I strongly agree
with your views concerning Rushmore.

45
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,248
Um... your speech
was excellent.

46
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:05,335
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,959
- Thank you.
- Hello.

48
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:10,632
Oh, Mr. Blume, this is my
chapel partner, Dirk Calloway.

49
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,799
Nice to meet you, Dirk.

50
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,843
Well, thanks.

51
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,516
You know...

52
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:24,977
I really think you're
right about Rushmore.

53
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,187
Come on, Dirk.

54
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:32,444
- What's his name again?
- Max Fischer.

55
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,614
Sharp little guy.

56
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,451
He's one of the worst
students we've got.

57

<i># Makin' time #</i>

<i># Actin' the fool ##</i>

73
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,697
We're putting you on what we call
"sudden death academic probation".

74
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,407
And what does that entail?

75
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,867
It entails that if you
fail another class,

76
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,285
you'll be asked
to leave Rushmore.

77
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,121
In other words,
I'll be expelled.

78
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,538
That's correct.

79
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,292
Could I see some documentation
on that, please?

80
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,087
Too many extracurricular
activities, Max.

81
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,341
Not enough studying.

82
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,846
Dr. Guggenheim, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job,

83
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,889
but, the fact is,
no matter how hard I try,

84
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,974
I still might
flunk another class.

85
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:36,897
If that means I have to stay on for a
postgraduate year, then so be it, but...

86
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,066
We don't offer
a postgraduate year.

87
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,193
Well... we don't offer it yet.

88
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,278
Just bring up the grades.

89
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:48,116
Do you remember how
I got into this school?

90
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,285
- Yes. You wrote a play.
- That's right.

91
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:56,500
Second grade.
A little one act about Watergate.

92
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,002
And my mother read it
and felt I should go to Rushmore.

93
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,171
And you read it, and
you gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

94
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,340
Mm-hmm.

95
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,384
- Do you regret it?
- No, I don't regret it.

96
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,095
But I still might
have to expel you.

97
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:12,056
Couldn't...

98
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,808
Couldn't we just
let me float by?

99
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,060
For old time's sake?

100
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,271
Can't do it, Max.

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,733
- They want to kick me out.
- Oh, no, not again.

102
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,403
- What are you gonna do?
- The only thing I can do:

103
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,991
try and pull some strings
with the administration, I guess.

104
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,413
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

105
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:38,497
That's the rumor.

106
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,625
And they're canceling Latin.

107
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,336
What?

108
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,422
I tried to get Latin
canceled for five years.

109
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,591
"It's a dead language,"
I'd always say.

110
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, I guess
they finally heard you.

111
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,192
Excuse me.

112
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,945
Could I please see a list
of all the people...

113
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,155
who've checked out this book
in the past year?

114
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,948
Why?

115
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,117
Look at that.

116
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,620
"I have seen wicked men and fools,
a great many of both;

117
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:04,415
"and I believe they both
get paid in the end.

118
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:07,000
"But the fools first.

119
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:11,170
Chapter 15.
The Lad with the Silver Button. "

120
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:16,549
- Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.
- Where are you going?

121
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll tell you
in the squad car.

122
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:20,723
Oh, and, Willie,

123
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,100
you were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez.

124
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,561
He died in his sleep.

125
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:28,144
Excellent. That was excellent.

126
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,146
That was great.
That was great.

127
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:33,734
Um, Irving... could you get some
root beers for anybody who wants one?

128
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,529
- I don't want one, okay?
- Okay.

129
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,573
All right, next scene.

130
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:41,826
Frank, you enter stage right
with a bag of cocaine.

131
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,620
I was just telling Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are...

132
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:46,225
- to have someone like
you looking out for Dirk.

133
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:47,747
Oh, don't be silly.

134
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,333
Dirk's a great kid,
and I'm just trying to impart...

135
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,589
some of the experiences
I've accrued to help him.

136
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,881
This has my number on it
if you need to call me...

137
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:00,010
or need help with Dirk
or anything like that.

138
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,637
Well, thank you very much.
Hello, Dirk.

139
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,807
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, honey?

140
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,599
- Fine.
- Bye.

141
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,183
It was so nice
to see you again.

142
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:12,773
- Hey, Dirk. How'd your math test go?
- What math test?

143
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,443
- I thought you had a math test today.
- No.

144
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:18,194
Did you turn in your paper
on the Berlin Airlift?

145
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,905
Yeah, I got an extension.

146
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:23,032
- Hey, George.
- So how'd it go with Mrs. Calloway?

147
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,119
- We shook hands.
- Big deal.

148
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:28,286
And I gave her
my phone number.

149
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,748
Buchan said he'd have
already banged her by now.

150
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:32,125
What?

151
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:35,461
Just tell that deformed Scottish gorilla
to shut his fat face.

152
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,755
That's my best friend's mother
he's talking about.

153
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,509
I always thought that's why
you picked Dirk as your chapel partner.

154
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,761
What are you, a lawyer?

155
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:48,806
Hey, Mr. Blume.
Hey, it's Max Fischer.

156
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,600
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Max, my mom just showed up.</i>

157
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,521
<i>Is it okay if I leave early? Over.</i>

158
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,397
Sure, Charlie.

159
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,236
What's the secret, Max?

160
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,987
- "The secret"?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:08,493
Well, you seem to have it
pretty figured out.

162
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,870
The secret.
I don't know. Uh...

163
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:13,372
I think you just gotta find
something you love to do,

164
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:17,042
and then do it
for the rest of your life.

165
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,544
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

166
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:22,464
Shotgun.

167
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,095
- Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny. How you guys...
- Get in the back. I said, "Shotgun".

168
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:28,179
Get in the back, Donny.

169
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:32,140
Let's go.

170
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:37,019
Did you invite that kid
to your party?

171
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,522
- Max Fischer? - Come on, Dad.
There's gonna be girls there.

172
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,360
- I'd rather die.
- Pull your head out of your ass.

173
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,947
- Good night, Mr. Littlejeans.
- Good night, Max.

174
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,906
I'll see you tomorrow.

175
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,874
May I see the back, please?

176
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,879
Certainly.

177
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,008
How's that?

178
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,341
Thank you.

179
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:13,221
I need a signature on this
geometry test, by the way.

180
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:14,975
Let's see.

181
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,227
- Hmm.
- I know, I know.

182
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:21,229
A 37.

183
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,110
Oh, I don't know
what to do anymore.

184
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,236
It could have been worse.

185
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:32,572
You almost got the "A".

186
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:35,491
"Almost got the 'A"'?
Dad, what are you writing?

187
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,086
Maybe I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs...

188
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,338
and putting on plays.

189
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,422
That's possible.

190
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:53,426
I should probably be trying
harder to score chicks.

191
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,473
That's the only thing
anybody really cares about.

192
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:59,433
It's not my forte, unfortunately.

193
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,643
It'll happen, Max. It's just...

194
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:04,313
You're like one
of those clipper ship captains.

195
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:06,649
You're married to the sea.

196
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:08,692
Yes, that's true.

197
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:12,195
But I've been out to sea
for a long time.

198
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:21,454
- Hello.
- Hi.

199
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:31,756
I like your hat.

200
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:34,633
Oh, thank you.

201
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:37,803
You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

202
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,975
And this is your first year
at Rushmore, I take it.

203
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:44,142
Uh-huh.

204
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:47,936
And how long have you been a smoker,
if you don't mind me asking?

205
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:51,734
Well, let's see now.
How old are you?

206
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,153
Fifteen.

207
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:56,446
- Since I was your age.
- You're kidding.

208
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,115
You should quit.

209
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,742
You're right.

210
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,663
And I should mind my own business.

211
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,462
Where did you go
to school, by the way?

212
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:14,757
- Harvard.
- Really?

213
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:16,258
That's a coincidence.

214
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:20,011
My top schools where I want
to apply to are Oxford and the Sorbonne.

215
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:22,430
My safety's Harvard.

216
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:24,890
- That's very ambitious.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,017
What do you want to study?

218
00:14:27,893 --> 00:14:30,771
Well... I haven't
decided for sure,

219
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:35,610
but probably a double major
in mathematics and premed.

220
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,610
What was your major?

221
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:42,530
I didn't have a major, but my thesis
was on Latin American economic policy.

222
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,954
Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear they're
not going to teach Latin here anymore?

223
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,789
This was more like Central America.

224
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:52,792
Oh, Central America
and whatnot. Hmm.

225
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:55,629
But moving on:
They're gonna cancel Latin.

226
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,797
They've got
to make room for Japanese.

227
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,970
That's a shame because all the Romance
languages were based on Latin.

228
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,055
Yeah, they are,
aren't they?

229
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:08,058
Nihilo sanctum estne?

230
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:11,810
What's that?
Oh, it's Latin, isn't it?

231
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,812
What does that mean?

232
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:16,940
"Is nothing sacred?"

233
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:27,368
Sic transit gloria.
Glory fades.

234
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,995
I'm Max Fischer.

235
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,705
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,297
- Come on, come on. File out.
- Sign here, please.

237
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,132
- Sic transit gloria.
- All right, all right.

238
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,309
In summation,
I have only one question:

239
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:55,019
Is Latin dead?

240
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:03,987
Why don't you just piss off,
Fischer, you dotty skid mark?

241
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,446
Was that Latin?

242
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:15,165
Never in my wildest
imagination...

243
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,583
did I ever dream
I would have sons like these.

244
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,963
What's your dad do, Max?

245
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:28,508
He's a neurosurgeon...
at, uh, St. Joseph's Hospital.

246
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:31,552
Personally, I could never see myself
cutting open somebody's brain,

247
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:34,474
but he seems to enjoy it.

248
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,602
Oh, no, no, no. I got this one.

249
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:42,939
- So you were in Vietnam,
if I'm not mistaken? - Yeah.

250
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,111
Were you in the shit?

251
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:49,571
Yeah, I was in the shit.

252
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,367
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

253
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,287
- All right.
- What's on Sunday?

254
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,955
Oh, that's right.
The twins' birthday party.

255
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,332
Do you want to come?

256
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:05,295
I'd love to, except I've already got
a previous obligation to attend to.

257
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:08,674
Yeah. Thanks for
the invitation, though.

258
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,054
Come work for me.

259
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:18,224
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I could use someone like you.

260
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:22,061
Look, I may not be rich, Mr. Blume.

261
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,022
My father may only be
a doctor, but we manage.

262
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:28,735
- One-twelves!
- Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking to you.

263
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,739
You're on the team?

264
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,740
I'm an alternate.

265
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:38,786
How you doin'?
Good to see you again.

266
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:50,714
Whoa. Neat.

267
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,395
<i># Met a girl, fell in love
Glad as I can be #</i>

268
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:12,527

269

273

274
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,105

<i>Miss Cross?</i>

279
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,294
I thought I'd just let you know
as per our conversation, the other day...

280
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:18,049
- Latin?
- Right. The Romance languages.

281
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,885
- Well, I gave a little speech.
- I heard about this.

282
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,385
Oh, you did?

283
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,224
I understand you made
a very convincing argument.

284
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,853
I just thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're gonna continue the Latin program.

285
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,898
I'm very impressed.

286
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:36,651
Well, thank you very much.

287
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,319
Hey, you need an assistant?

288
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,321
- Do we get to have an
assistant around here?

289
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,073
No, I doubt it.

290
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:45,575
I'm on scholarship, though...
academic scholarship...

291
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,244
so I get to do odd jobs and...

292
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,913
Say, how did you decide
to teach at Rushmore?

293
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:52,916
My husband went here.

294
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:59,840
I, uh... I didn't know
you were married.

295
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,925
Well, he's dead now.

296
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,926
So I'm not, actually.

297
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,261
When did he die?

298
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:08,096
Last year.

299
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,601
My mother's dead.

300
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,729
I'm sorry to hear that.

301
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,522
She died when I was seven.

302
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:20,776
I guess we both have
dead people in our families.

303
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,781
What's going on in here?

304
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,164
These were just born.

305
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:37,417
I don't want alloys. I want steel.

306
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,795
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

307
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,924
Steel, Harry.

308
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:49,802
- So you've changed your mind,
and you want the job? - No.

309
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:52,139
But I've got an idea,
and I need some money.

310
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:54,808
What Rushmore
needs is an aquarium...

311
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,477
a first-class aquarium...
where the scientists can lecture...

312
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,812
and the students can observe
the marine life in its natural habitat.

313
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:03,440
- I don't know. What do you think, Ernie?
- An aquarium?

314
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,506
What kind of fish?

315
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,489
- Barracudas, stingrays,
electric eel, trout,

316
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:10,491
hammerheads, piranhas,
giant squid, octopi...

317
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,576
Piranhas? Really?

318
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,577
- Yes, I'm talking to
a guy in South America.

319
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,373
- What'd Guggenheim say?
- Nothing. I felt I should go to you first.

320
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,374
Why?

321
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,130
Because at this moment, I feel the
best strategy is to keep it low profile.

322
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:27,133
The more preparation work I can do,
the stronger our case will be...

323
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:30,176
- when we take it to the administration.
- How much money do you want?

324
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:34,472
Thirty-five thousand dollars,
for the initial plans.

325
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:46,359
I'll give you 2,500.

326
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:47,902
Okay.

- You're welcome.

340
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:18,281
- Max.
- Mm-hmm?

341
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:21,824
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

342
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,663
Has it ever crossed your mind
that you're far too young for me?

343
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:35,380
It crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility. Yeah.

344
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,840
Quite apart from the fact
that you're a student...

345
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,885
I'm not trying to pressure you
into anything, Miss Cross.

346
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,907
- I'm surprised you
brought it up so bluntly.

347
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:44,847
I just want to make sure...

348
00:23:47,644 --> 00:23:50,438
- We've become friends, haven't we?
- Yes.

349
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,231
Good.

350
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,024
And, um...

351
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,653
the... the truth is, neither
one of us has the slightest idea...

352
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,570
where this relationship is going.

353
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:04,283
- We can't predict the future.
- We don't have a relationship, Max.

354
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,205
- But we're friends.
- Yes, and that's all we're going to be.

355
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,873
That's all I meant by "relationship".

356
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:11,750
You want me to grab a dictionary?

357
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,586
No, I just want to make sure
that we understand each other.

358
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,671
I understand.

359
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:20,841
You're not attracted to me.

360
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,926
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

361
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,139
Max, you're 15 years old.

362
00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:29,432
Attraction doesn't enter into it.

363
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:31,477
If you say so.

364
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:33,813
Look, all I'm getting at is that...

365
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:39,316
that I've never met anyone like you.

366
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,698
So you can take that
for whatever it's worth.

367
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,537
I think I can safely say
I've never met anyone like you either.

368
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:56,251
You haven't, have you?

369
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:01,256
Want to shake hands?

370
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,217
I'm glad we had this conversation.

371
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:06,720
So am I.

372
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,554
I can't wear a wire.
They're feeling me up every day.

373
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,515
Oh, come on, Frank.
You'll have complete protection.

374
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,477
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

375
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,644
- I gotta put a dime in the meter.
- Sit down, Frank.

376
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:21,064
Joe, go put a dime in the meter
for Officer Serpico.

377
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,527
- Look, Serpico, if you agree
to testify in open court... - No!

378
00:25:24,652 --> 00:25:27,864
- No, what?
- No, I'm not gonna testify.

379
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:29,406
Go, go, go.

380
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:33,327
I'll expect your gun
and your badge on my desk...

381
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:36,374
- Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
- Name it.

382
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,126
That you're gonna follow this thing
all the way to the end...

383
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:41,503
of the line... where I got to be.

384
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:43,295
So help me God.

385
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,422
<i>- Someone coming out of the building.
- I've got something!</i>

386
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:48,549

- There's action across the street.</i>

387
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,969

- It's Snowman.</i>

388
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,518
- He's getting on the "L" train!
- Take him!

389
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:00,020
- What happened to the cannoli line?
- Max...

390
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:03,315
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it,
Sanchez. The old man likes his cannolis".

391
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,026
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
It didn't make any difference anyway.

392
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,694
Hey, I'm letting it go,
but don't say it doesn't matter.

393
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:11,364
- Every line matters.
- Get off my back!

394
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:13,408
Don't fuck with my play!

395
00:26:14,076 --> 00:26:16,035
- You fucking cocksucker...
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.

396
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,913
I'm gonna kill you.

397
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,462
Max. Max.

398
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:53,761
- I thought the acting
tonight was excellent.

399
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,117
Thanks.

400
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:57,826
Well, it was better in rehearsals.

401
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,620
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I got a dinner to go to.

402
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:04,039
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Cast and crew only.

403
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,169
- Oh. You need some money?
- No, Dad.

404
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,090
- Well, how was the slap?
- It was good.

405
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,427
- There he is. Max, that was great.
- I'm so glad you could come.

406
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,512
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Peter Flynn, Max Fischer.

407
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,973
- Hi.
- Who's this guy?

408
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:26,165
- Peter.

409
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,607
- I really liked your
play. It was really cool.

410
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,150
- Yeah.
- What happened to your nose?

411
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,654
- I got punched in the face.
- Oh, boy.

412
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,074
- What's your excuse?
- Hey, author.

413
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
- How you doing?
- Nice job.

414
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,329
- Thank you.
- Gonna get to meet your dad tonight?

415
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,372
Oh, no. The old man's on call.

416
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,375
Mr. Blume, I'd like you
to meet Miss Cross...

417
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,377
and I didn't catch
this young gentleman's name.

418
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,589
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

419
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,174
These are O.R. scrubs.

420
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,467
"O.R." they?

421
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:04,139
Well, they're totally
inappropriate for the occasion.

422
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:06,519
Well, I didn't know
we were going to dinner.

423
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,937
That's because you weren't invited.

424
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:11,314
Take it easy, Max.

425
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,524
- You were the one that
ordered him a whiskey and soda.

426
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,399
So what's wrong with that?

427
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:19,782
I can write a hit play. Why can't I have
a little drink to unwind myself?

428
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,285
So, tell me, curly,
how do you know Miss Cross?

429
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,453
- We went to Harvard together.
- Oh, that's great.

430
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:28,496
I wrote a hit play
and directed it.

431
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,916
So I'm not sweating it either.

432
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,500
Can we get a check, please?

433
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,795
- What do you think you're doing?
- Getting the check.

434
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,838
No, you're not. Excuse me.

435
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:38,967
I just want to thank you
for accommodating us.

436
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,136
You see, we only thought
we were going to be three,

437
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,639
but, uh, someone invited
himself along, so I apologize.

438
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,140
- Quite all right, sir. Very well.
- Okay.

439
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:49,976
You're being rude, Max.

440
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:51,518
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

441
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:55,022
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out
why you brought this gentleman to my play...

442
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:58,067
and my dinner,
which was invitation only.

443
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,111
- Would you like me to
pass you the creamer, Doc?

444
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,571
Yes, please.

445
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:05,659
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

446
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:09,617
You hurt my feelings!
This night was important to me!

447
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:11,745
How did I hurt your feelings?

448
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:16,211
Oh, my God!
I wrote a hit play!

449
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,799
And I'm in love with you.

450
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:33,478
Put that a little bit there.

451
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:56,582
- Hi.
- Were you hiding over there?

452
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:59,835
Uh, I didn't want
to disrupt class.

453
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:03,338
What's that you're painting?

454
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:06,632
That's a... a jellyfish.

455
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,595
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

456
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,806
Max wants to talk to you.

457
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:15,642
- What for?
- To apologize, I think.

458
00:30:16,393 --> 00:30:18,143
Should we talk over here?

459
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,690
He sent you?

460
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:23,358
Yeah.

461
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,278
Are you his messenger?

462
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,615
No, I'm his friend.

463
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:34,327
You were right.
I should not have allowed him to drink.

464
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,664
I don't think
I should see Max anymore.

465
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,375
Well, he's not gonna like
the sound of that.

466
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,171
No. No, I know, but...

467
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:48,172
I think I let him
get too attached.

468
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,509
What do you think?

469
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,846
Well, I think
you did your best.

470
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,017
Tell him I'm sorry.

471
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:07,402
Okay.

472
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,155
What is your first name?

473
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:16,952
Rosemary. What's yours?

474
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:18,493
Herman.

475
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,793
He wrote you a letter.

476
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,670
<i>Dear Miss Cross,</i>

477
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:29,171
<i>I would like to take this opportunity
to formally apologize...</i>

478
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,797
<i>for the events
of the night of the 23rd.</i>

479
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:34,508
<i>I'm not accustomed
to drinking alcohol.</i>

480
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,805
<i>Please do me the service of coming to the
unveiling of a new venture I've undertaken.</i>

481
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:41,765
<i>I hope you will attend,
if possible.</i>

482
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:45,228
<i>I remain your friend, Max Fischer.</i>

483
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:54,695
Cut the music and no more pictures.

484
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:56,992
- What time is it, Alan?
- 1:15.

485
00:31:57,117 --> 00:32:00,119
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hey, lay off the chips, Buchan.

486
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:01,703
Did you see her?

487
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,838
- She's not here.
- Well, go check her classroom.

488
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,831
- Shall I go ahead and
take care of this tree?

489
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:07,140
Let's wait a few minutes.

490
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,501
- What's going on here, Maxie?
- Oh, hey, Coach Beck. Good to see you.

491
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:11,213
This is where we're
putting in the new aquarium.

492
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,214
I'm in charge of the committee,
if you can believe it.

493
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:15,968
This is my baseball diamond.

494
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:20,054
Yeah, I know, and I believe
it's being relocated a few feet over.

495
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:22,848
Is it true the aquarium
will have piranhas?

496
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,870
Where did you hear that?

497
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,727
- My source indicated
that it was a possibility.

498
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:29,312
Yes, it's true, but piranhas
are a very tricky species.

499
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:32,148
- Max?
- Excuse me, George.

500
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:34,151
- Bad news.
- What's the story?

501
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,486
- She had a substitute teacher today.
- Why?

502
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:38,279
I guess she got sick.

503
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,990
- You know she's not
sick. Give me the phone.

504
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:46,329
Janet, Max Fischer.
Is Mr. Blume there?

505
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:49,747
Well, where is he?

506
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,294
Goddamn it.
He's supposed to be here.

507
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:54,964
I don't give a shit
about the barracudas,

508
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:57,508
but, fuck it, I'm building it anyway.

509
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:00,509
Max!

510
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,512
Where are those damn
chain saws coming from?

511
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,515
- He's right over there!
- Max!

512
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,683
- Max!
- Oh, hello, Dr. Guggenheim.

513
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,352
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- We're having a fund-raiser for the...

514
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:11,437
Turn that damn thing off!

515
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,982
Tell me this isn't happening.

516
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:17,110
Dr. Guggenheim, I'd rather not have
this conversation in front of my crew.

517
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,341
...chapter seven.

518
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:47,891
One more thing.
We have a new student with us today.

519
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:51,392
His name's Max Fischer,
and he's actually asked...

520
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:53,769
to say a few words to the class.

521
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,689
Max, you want to take it away?

522
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:59,484
Sure. Thanks very much.

523
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,194
I just wanted to introduce myself.

524
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:10,703
I'm Max Fischer.

525
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:13,538
I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy,

526
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,291
which I recently
got expelled from.

527
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:21,003
This is my first time
in a public school.

528
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,466
I know you probably think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,

529
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:26,677
but I'm no elitist.

530
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:29,137
I think you've got
some great facilities,

531
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:32,723
and I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it here at Grover Cleveland.

532
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,142
One footnote.

533
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:37,686
I notice you don't have
a fencing team.

534
00:34:37,853 --> 00:34:41,024
Well, I'm gonna try my hardest
to start one up for you guys.

535
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:48,156
- Max?
- Yes?

536
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,242
Hi, I'm Margaret Yang.
I'm in Mrs. Whitney's class.

537
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:54,537
- I just wanted to tell you that
I liked your speech. - Thank you.

538
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:58,667
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone
asking to give a speech in class before.

539
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,835
No? How unfortunate.

540
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:04,172
The silver spoon remark
might rub some people the wrong way,

541
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:06,090
- but I think I know...
- What do you mean?

542
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:07,675
- Well...
- You know what?

543
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:11,176
I gotta go into class in here.
I'll see you later, Mrs. Chang.

544
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,600
En garde!

545
00:35:26,318 --> 00:35:28,401
Janet, Max Fischer. Is he in?

546
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,285
Yeah?

547
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:36,453
Okay.

548
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,662
Hey, Max, how's it going?

549
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:41,414
Terrible. Tell me something. When you
talked to Miss Cross the other day...

550
00:35:41,497 --> 00:35:43,875
Do you have a telephone pass?

551
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,044
- Excuse me. Do you have a telephone pass?
- One second.

552
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,151
I gotta tell ya, I don't know
what you see in her.

553
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:51,132
I don'tthink she's right for you.

554
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,801
What's that supposed to mean?

555
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:57,639
I mean, she's not
that beautiful.

556
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,058
She's not that intriguing.

557
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:04,979
I mean, she has something that
you can't put your finger on, but...

558
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:07,690
Look, Mr. Blume, your comments are
valuable, but let's get to the point.

559
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:10,651
- Son?
- Will she see me again, yes or no?

560
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,445
- No.
- Hang on.

561
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,449
I'm talking on the telephone.

562
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,034
Oh, come on.

563
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:20,787
That's rude.

564
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,220
Hey, Fischer.

565
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,555
You better beat it, sonny.

566
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:44,643
You know, Fischer,
I've been watching you.

567
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,981
Showboat. Always talkin'.

568
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:52,400
Picking a kid like Dirk because his mother's
a great piece, and then getting nowhere.

569
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,486
Like everything you do.

570
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:57,613
Big show. No results.

571
00:36:57,822 --> 00:37:02,283
What do you call getting a hand job from
Mrs. Calloway in the back of her Jaguar?

572
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,664
A fucking lie.

573
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:09,501
You think I got kicked out
for just the aquarium? Nah.

574
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:13,254
It was the hand job.
You want to know something else?

575
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,090
It was worth it.

576
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:20,301
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner.

577
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:23,724
And please apologize
to what's-his-name for me.

578
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:28,019
I will. You okay?

579
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:31,939
Yeah, I'm fine,
but I miss Rushmore.

580
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,065
I miss the seasons.

581
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:37,069
Watching the leaves change.

582
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:40,278
By the way, what time
does the library close?

583
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:43,074
I've got an overdue book
to turn in.

584
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,123
That is your handwriting,
isn't it?

585
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,917
My husband gave me this book...

586
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:58,463
when he came to visit England
when I was 13 and he went to Rushmore.

587
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:01,133
So when he died,
I gave it to the library here.

588
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:06,431
You remind me of him, you know?

589
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:08,932
I do?

590
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,100
How?

591
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,185
Well...

592
00:38:14,312 --> 00:38:18,152
you were a member of
the Rushmore Beekeepers, weren't you?

593
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,904
Yeah. I was president of them.

594
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,905
He founded that club.

595
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:33,206
Do you think we can be
friends again, Miss Cross?

596
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:38,003
- In-In a strictly platonic way?
- Of course I do.

597
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:42,090
Do you think you can make a go of it
and settle down at Grover Cleveland?

598
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,967
Yeah, but I need a tutor.

599
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:52,056
<i># In the midnight moonlight

617

- Alan's got the birds for your approval.
- I'll take the green one.

618
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,008
- And here's the knife.
- That's too fake.

619
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,260
- Hi, Max.
- Hello.

620
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:16,430
What's your name again?

621
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,432
- Margaret Yang.
- Margaret Yang.

622
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,435
What are you doing seventh period,
Margaret Yang?

623
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,603
- I have guitar lessons.
- Classical guitar or... In what school?

624
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:26,941
- Rock. - Ro... That's good.
We can get you out of that.

625
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:29,443
Could I see you without
your glasses on, please?

626
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:33,697
Let's put Margaret down for 3:30
in the auditorium, Woody.

627
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,783
Thank you.

628
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:37,950
And-And bring
a head shot, please.

629
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,882
Hello, Herman.

630
00:40:52,007 --> 00:40:54,467
- How are you, Rosemary?
- I'm fine, thanks.

631
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,886
I just got home,
and I'm having a little snack.

632
00:41:00,016 --> 00:41:03,269
- Having some carrots?
- Yeah.

633
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,813
Nice house.

634
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:11,984
Yeah. Um, it isn't mine.
I'm just sort of house-sitting.

635
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:17,031
Um... you were
in the neighborhood?

636
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:20,993
Uh... did Max have something
planned for us today?

637
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,955
A trip to the museum
or something?

638
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,792
No, I don't think so.
I think he's rehearsing tonight.

639
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:30,544
Oh, that's right.
He's doing his new play.

640
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,338
Yeah, he's really making a go of it
over there at Grover Cleveland.

641
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:36,049
Yeah, he's doing very well,
isn't he?

642
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,431
Do you want a carrot?

643
00:41:42,305 --> 00:41:44,016
Yeah, I'll have one of those.

644
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,810
Thank you.

645
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,322
Well, I'll probably
be seeing you soon.

646
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:07,787
Or we could go for a walk now,
if you like.

647
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:20,050
Sure.

648
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:23,385
The weather's nice, isn't it?

649
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,096
A little brisk.

650
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,432
I'll just get a sweater.
I'll be back in a minute.

651
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:02,550
Dirk?

652
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:05,719
I know about you
and the teacher.

653
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:20,232
- Does Max know?
- No, and I don't want him to know, ever.

654
00:43:20,315 --> 00:43:23,360
I just want it
to stop right now.

655
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:25,697
You're a married man, Blume,

656
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,117
and you're supposed
to be his friend.

657
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:30,993
Look, Dirk, I am his friend.

658
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:33,913
Oh, yeah. And with friends
like you, who needs friends?

659
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:49,429
Unlock it!

660
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,933
Little Calloway.

661
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,608
You're standing up
for the wrong guy.

662
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,611
Fischer ain't your mate.

663
00:44:05,736 --> 00:44:07,572
What are you talking about, Buchan?

664
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,697
He thinks your mom's good for a bonk.

665
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:12,699
That's the only reason he picked you
as his chapel partner.

666
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:16,162
- Who sold you that crock?
- He told me himself.

667
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:20,374
He says she gave him a hand job
in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar.

668
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,880
- Max would never say that.
- Yeah.

669
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,883
I suppose you're right.

670
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:32,510
After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't
need to impress anybody now, does he?

671
00:44:34,136 --> 00:44:37,477
The killing's gotta stop, esse.
It's getting too loco.

672
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:39,935
- No more gats.
- Nigger, you're the crazy one.

673
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,979
People be trying to kill you.
Are you talkin'...

674
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,898
...about you're gonna get rid of your gun?

675
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:47,650
It's time, homey.

676
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:49,402
Kiss me, Little Juan.

677
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,864
All right, then he kisses her
and we're out. Okay.

678
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,573
Is that for me?

679
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,245
<i>Dear Max, I am sorry to say
that I have secretly found out...</i>

680
00:44:57,329 --> 00:45:00,247
<i>that Mr. Blume is having
an affair with Miss Cross.</i>

681
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,209
<i>My first suspicions came when I saw them
Frenching in front of her house,</i>

682
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:06,543
<i>and then I knew for sure when they went
skinny-dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool,</i>

683
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:10,923
<i>giving each other hand jobs while you
were taking a nap on the front porch.</i>

684
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,300
<i>Why am I telling you this now?</i>

685
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:16,012
<i>Because you're such a good friend.</i>

686
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,679
<i>Take care, pal.</i>

687
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:20,934
<i>Fondly, Dirk Calloway.</i>

688
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:24,729
God.

689
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,689
How was she, Herman?

690
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,024
Jesus Christ.

691
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:33,696
Was she good?
I bet she was.

692
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,699
Although, I wouldn't know
because I never screwed her.

693
00:45:38,617 --> 00:45:41,286
Going skinny-dipping
while I took a nap.

694
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,497
"Are you comfortable, Max?
I'll just, uh, be out back, nude,

695
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,000
getting hand jobs
from the woman you love. "

696
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:49,709
We never went skinny-dipping.

697
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:52,297
Sure, you didn't.
And next you're gonna tell me...

698
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:55,384
you didn't just walk out of her house
at 2:00 in the morning.

699
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:00,886
I'm in love with her.

700
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,891
Well, I was in love
with her first.

701
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:12,231
And all that crap about,
"I don't think she's that great.

702
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,025
I don't think she's right
for you, Max. "

703
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,529
That was all bullshit,
wasn't it?

704
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:20,698
Do you think
she's in love with you?

705
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,909
I don't know.

706
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:29,208
Well, I guarantee you she's not,
and she never will be.

707
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,043
Max.

708
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:38,049
I saved Latin.

709
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,387
What did you ever do?

710
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:48,394
On the planet I come from...

711
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:50,979
the sun only comes out once a year.

712

<i># From a tiny piece of colored glass #</i>

715

722
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:27,472
<i>This is Max Fischer. I have some
information regarding your husband.</i>

725
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,652
Thank you for meeting me.

726
00:47:40,653 --> 00:47:41,945
You're welcome.

727
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,200
Would you like a sandwich?

728
00:47:47,867 --> 00:47:49,784
All right.

729
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:56,458
I have a tuna
and peanut butter and jelly.

730
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,461
Sorry it's not
something more exotic.

731
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:01,297
- I'll take the tuna fish.
- Okay.

732
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,717
Milk or apple juice?

733
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,885
Get to the point.

734
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,679
Okay.

Your husband's...

- How long will you be
staying with us, Mr. Blume?

737
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:25,987
Indefinitely.

738
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,657
- I'm being sued for divorce.
- Very good, sir.

Yo, shorty.

Say, can you tell me
where the pool is located?

741
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,705
I might want to take a dip
after I have dinner and hit the bar.

742
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,541
It's on the roof, sir.

Can you drop me off at Rushmore?

773
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:45,596
- I gotta go get a teacher fired.
- I don't think that's wise, Max.

774
00:51:57,609 --> 00:51:59,526
Whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

775
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:01,236
- This is private property!
You're trespassing!

776
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:02,862
What, are you crazy?

777
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:06,910
Wait a minute!

778
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:09,245
Stop!

779
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:14,126
- Let's have a truce for a second.
- Wait! Truce! Truce!

780
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:25,467
What's this all about?

781
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:29,513
Did you say my mom
gave you a hand job?

782
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:31,889
- What?
- Did you say it?

783
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:34,810
Who told you
that goddamn lie?

784
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:36,980
Never mind.
I know who said it.

785
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:38,523
I think I'm gonna stick
a knife in his heart,

786
00:52:38,606 --> 00:52:40,773
then I'm gonna send him back to Ireland
in a body bag.

787
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:42,483
He's from Scotland.

788
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:46,824
Well, tell that stupid Mick he just
made my list of things to do today.

789
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:50,493
I'm gonna pop a cap in his ass.

790
00:52:52,578 --> 00:52:55,831
So you received the package?

791
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:57,583
Good.

792
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,003
I just wanted to inform you
about what's going on.

793
00:53:04,088 --> 00:53:06,676
I never took you
for an informer, Max.

794
00:53:07,426 --> 00:53:09,345
What's that supposed to mean?

795
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:11,680
"What's that supposed to mean?"

796
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:19,186
She resigned this morning before
I even got your little snapshots.

797
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,395
So your latest attempt
at sabotage backfired.

798
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,317
But she's one of the best teachers
you've got. How could you let her go?

799
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:26,985
- Why are you trying to get her fired?
- You stupid old fool!

800
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm trying to win her back!

801
00:53:46,214 --> 00:53:48,006
Miss Cross?

802
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,008
Hi, Max.

803
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:57,682
- Need any help?
- No, I have it.

804
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:01,979
Oh, here, let me see.

805
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,189
- No. Please. Look, I don't
think you should come in here.

806
00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:08,819
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings.

807
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:12,862
I'm sorry I love your friend
instead of you, but...

808
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,989
Please, Max...

809
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:17,076
- You honestly believe you
love Blume instead of me?

810
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:19,037
Yes.

811
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:21,287
Well, you'll have to forgive me
if I don't take your word for that.

812
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:22,999
- Oh, stop.
- Miss Cross...

813
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:26,176
- Listen, if you don't stop, I'm
gonna lose it. I mean it! Don't...

814
00:54:26,277 --> 00:54:27,670
It's too late.

815
00:54:27,753 --> 00:54:29,670
It's too late.

816
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:35,887
Wait. Please.

817
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:43,267
I got kicked out
because of you.

818
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:46,771
- No, you got kicked out...
- Rushmore was my life.

819
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:50,150
- Now you are.
- No, I'm not.

820
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:55,448
What do you really think
is gonna happen between us?

821
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:58,575
Do you think
we're gonna have sex?

822
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:04,245
That's a kind
of cheap way to put it.

823
00:55:04,412 --> 00:55:06,789
Not if you've ever
fucked before, it isn't.

824
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,713
Oh, my God.

825
00:55:11,796 --> 00:55:15,256
How would you describe it
to your friends?

826
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:17,551
Would you say
that you'd fingered me?

827
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:21,179
Or maybe I could give you a hand job.
Would that put an end to all of this?

828
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:26,141
Please get out of my classroom.

829
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:37,905
Fresh are you, sporty, me fuckup.

830
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,447
Hey, Magnus.

831
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:42,449
Got any good hand jobs lately?

832
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:49,584
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here.

833
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:53,461
It's your stepfather, waiting
for your mom so that he can get a piece.

834
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:58,799
Your mind's as warped
as your ear, Buchan.

835
00:56:03,595 --> 00:56:06,183
Don't get nasty, brother.

836
00:56:23,822 --> 00:56:29,163
We got him, Dirk.
We got him.

837
00:56:45,177 --> 00:56:46,471
Max?

838
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,849
Oh, hey, Mr. Blume.

839
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:55,477
You said you wanted to meet?

840
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,064
W- When?

841
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,025
Right now.

842
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:04,236
You said you wanted
to put an end to all this.

843
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:10,242
Oh, yeah. I, uh, was gonna try and
have that tree over there fall on you.

844
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,579
- That big one?
- Yup.

845
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,914
It would have flattened me
like a pancake.

846
00:57:16,665 --> 00:57:17,915
What stopped you?

847
00:57:18,962 --> 00:57:21,630
I don't know.
What's the point?

848
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:23,798
She loves you.

849
00:57:38,773 --> 00:57:40,732
She's my Rushmore, Max.

850
00:57:41,815 --> 00:57:45,027
Yeah, I know.
She was mine too.

851

See you next time.

891
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:21,388
It's been nice having
your company here at the shop, Max.

892
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:24,015
You put any more thought...

893
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:27,268
- into giving school another shot?
- No.

894
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:33,522
Max, I like being a barber.
I'm good at it.

895
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:36,775
But I always thought
you'd try another line of work.

896
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:40,863
You talked about being
a senator or a diplomat.

897
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:43,283
Pipe dreams, Dad.

898
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,576
I'm a barber's son.

899
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:52,580
See you at dinner.

900
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,354
Hello, Dirk.

901
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:17,692
- Hi, Max.
- What can I do for you?

902
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:21,319
- I thought I might get a haircut.
- We're closed.

903
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:26,198
Well, I just want to say
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you that day.

904
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:28,659
But I guess I'll go now.

905
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,378
Merry Christmas.

906
01:01:39,504 --> 01:01:41,421
What in the hell's that?

907
01:01:58,939 --> 01:02:01,649
So, did you hear the news?

908
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:05,695
I doubt it. I don't really
follow the news anymore.

909
01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:08,072
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

910
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,495
I'll send him a box of candy.

911
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,498
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

912
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:27,842
- Mrs. Guggenheim?
- Hello, Max. Come in.

913
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:35,432
It's so good to see you.

914
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:41,353
Oh, these are glorious.
I'll put them in some water.

915
01:02:41,436 --> 01:02:43,563
Have a seat.

916
01:02:44,147 --> 01:02:46,945
Should I say hello to Dr. Guggenheim
or can he not hear me?

917
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,905
No, he can hear you.

918
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:00,706
Hey, old-timer.
It's, uh, Max Fischer.

919
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:05,336
You probably can't hear me because...

920
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,004
- I don't know if your
brain is damaged or...

921
01:03:07,005 --> 01:03:08,589
What do you want?

922
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,928
Nelson?

923
01:03:19,682 --> 01:03:23,019
That's the first thing
he's said in ten days.

924
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,940
Do you think he recognized me?

925
01:03:27,023 --> 01:03:31,319
- Oh, I don't think so.
- It's Fischer.

926
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:50,504
See ya later. Bye.
Hope you feel better.

927
01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:54,675
Hey, amigo.

928
01:03:57,387 --> 01:04:00,098
So, who gave you the shiner?

929
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:03,477
Either Ronny or Donny.

930
01:04:03,602 --> 01:04:05,352
Can't tell the difference anymore.

931
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:09,315
Well, whichever one it was
really clocked you.

932
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:10,814
Hmm.

933
01:04:11,398 --> 01:04:14,276
Kids don't like it when
their parents get divorced.

934
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:18,032
- I don't blame 'em.
- Neither do I.

935
01:04:32,543 --> 01:04:34,715
How is she?

936
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:36,843
I really wouldn't know.

937
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:40,386
- Why not?
- I haven't seen her in six weeks.

938
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:42,430
What happened?

939
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:45,599
She left?

940
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,937
She's in love
with a dead guy anyway.

941
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:52,691
Edward Appleby.

942
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:57,569
You know, uh...

943
01:04:58,113 --> 01:05:00,530
she's sweet, but she's fucked-up.

944
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:08,036
- Adios, muchacho.
- Hey, are you okay?

945
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:12,667
Mmm, I'm a little bit
lonely these days.

946
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:47,494
Max?

947
01:05:48,202 --> 01:05:49,913
What are you doing here?

948
01:05:51,496 --> 01:05:54,041
I don't know. Jesus.
They came at me out of nowhere.

949
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:56,667
- It was... It was so sudden.
- What?

950
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,003
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?

951
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:03,049
- I just got hit by a car.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

952
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:04,885
Hmm? What did you say?

953
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:07,054
- Come inside.
- Thank you.

954
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:12,933
- I'm gonna get something for your head.
- Okay.

955
01:06:19,314 --> 01:06:21,315
So, this is where it all happens.

956
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,488
- All what happens?
- I wouldn't know.

957
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:27,199
So, why did you dump Blume?

958
01:06:27,908 --> 01:06:32,535
- That's none of your business.
- I know it's not.

959
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,538
But I just got hit by a car,
and I'm a little confused right now.

960
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:37,183
I mean, I thought
you dumped me for Blume.

961
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,106
Then I hear...

962
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:40,586
- I never dumped you because
we were never going out.

963
01:06:40,753 --> 01:06:43,672
It would just help me
if you talked to me for a minute.

964
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:45,633
Tell me what happened.

965
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:50,346
Okay.

966
01:06:53,306 --> 01:06:57,017
Um, A: He's married.

967
01:06:57,769 --> 01:07:00,897
He hates himself.

968
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:05,025
And C: Well,
he smashed up your bicycle,

969
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:09,072
- didn't he?
- My previous bicycle, yes.

970
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,838
- Well, what sort of person
does something like that?

971
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,323
I don't know.

972
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:19,500
War does funny things to men.

973
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:23,751
He thinks you dumped him
because of Edward Appleby.

974
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:27,965
What does that mean?

975
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:34,847
Well, I mean, you live in his room,
with all his stuff. It's kind of...

976
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,269
I was married to him.

977
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,979
- I know you were.
- Although, I will say...

978
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,983
that Edward has more
spark and character...

979
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:50,028
and imagination
in one fingernail...

980
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:53,032
than Herman Blume
has in his entire body.

981
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,411
One dead fingernail.

982
01:08:01,872 --> 01:08:03,750
Right.

983
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:06,792
One dead fingernail.

984
01:08:10,296 --> 01:08:12,592
How did he die, by the way?

985
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,303
He drowned.

986
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:19,265
How did your mother die?

987
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:21,640
She got cancer.

988
01:08:26,772 --> 01:08:29,734
Hold still for a moment, okay?

989
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:38,950
You're very pretty.

990
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:41,327
Thank you.

991
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,186
Is this fake blood?

992
01:09:08,856 --> 01:09:10,356
Yes, it is.

993
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,150
You know, you and Herman
deserve each other.

994
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,403
You're both little children.

995
01:09:19,657 --> 01:09:21,699
Let me show you the door.

996
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,870
I'll just go back out the window.

997
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:42,761
- Good-bye, Miss Cross.
- Good-bye, Max.

998
01:10:00,904 --> 01:10:02,323
Hey.

999
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:06,784
I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about what I said...

1000
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:09,203
about your mom
giving me a hand job.

1001
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,330
I know, Max.

1002
01:10:12,414 --> 01:10:16,044
I'm sorry I didn't take your hand
when Buchan kicked your ass.

1003
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:19,132
Hey, uh, that's okay.

1004
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:27,138
What's that?

1005
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,724
I don't know.

1006
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:47,866
Nice landing.

1007
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:55,458
What's, uh... What's that you got there,
a little flight plan or something?

1008
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,503
Hmm, pretty good.

1009
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,046
- Do you know Dirk Calloway?
- I don't think so.

1010
01:11:00,129 --> 01:11:03,048
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.

1011
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:15,268
I, uh, heard about your science project
on Action 13.

1012
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:17,274
- They said the Navy wants
to buy it from you. That's...

1013
01:11:17,275 --> 01:11:18,397
No, not anymore.

1014
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:21,856
- Why not?
- Because it was a fake.

1015
01:11:21,981 --> 01:11:25,150
- What do you mean?
- I faked all the results.

1016
01:11:25,234 --> 01:11:27,903
- Why?
- Because it didn't work.

1017
01:11:27,986 --> 01:11:30,117
I thought it would,
but it didn't.

1018
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,958
You're a real jerk to me,
you know that?

1019
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,711
I'm sorry, Margaret.

1020
01:11:45,253 --> 01:11:48,214
Well, anyway, nice to see you.

1021
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:12,322
Do you want to take over for a while?

1022
01:12:37,179 --> 01:12:39,305
Take dictation, please.

1023

Come here.

I want you to meet someone.

01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,797
Mr. Blume,
this is my father, Bert Fischer.

1051
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:44,260
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Fischer.

1052
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:47,806
Now Mr. Fischer was my father's name.
Call me Bert, please.

1053
01:14:47,931 --> 01:14:51,561
- Okay, Bert.
- So, Max tells me you need a haircut.

1054
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:54,938
I can see that. Why don't you sit down,
and we'll have a look.

1055
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:01,068
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:06,281
I don't know, Bert.

1057
01:15:06,406 --> 01:15:10,495
Don't worry, Mr. Blume.
It's a relatively painless procedure.

1058
01:15:10,662 --> 01:15:13,164
Maybe we'll throw in
a shave as well.

1059
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:17,209
Okay, are you fond
of that mustache?

Do you think you want to keep it
for a while? Mm-hmm.

- How much are you worth, by the way?
- I don't know.

1062
01:15:25,465 --> 01:15:27,637
- Over ten million?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1063
01:15:27,804 --> 01:15:29,514
- Good, good.
- Why?

1064
01:15:29,598 --> 01:15:31,681
'Cause we're gonna
need all of it.

But don't worry. Come on, Herman.

1075
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:52,341

you're prepared to spend?

01:17:24,124 --> 01:17:28,504
Well, you know, I never asked anyone
to build me an aquarium.

1083
01:17:29,046 --> 01:17:31,964
I'm not quite sure
how that rumor got started.

1084
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,218
Me neither.

1085
01:17:34,802 --> 01:17:38,429
You think Edward Appleby
would have built one for you?

1086
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:41,681
Yeah, I think he would have,
if he'd had the money.

1087
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:43,682
That's what I thought.

1088
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:47,520
Blume's got a bit more spark and
vitality than you expected, doesn't he?

1089
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:50,899
I thought the aquarium
was your idea.

1090
01:17:51,774 --> 01:17:53,860
Well, I gave it to my friend.

1091
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:56,572
- Fifteen sticks?
- Yes, please.

1092
01:17:56,697 --> 01:18:00,408
And... could you make
the order out to...

1093
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:02,784
Ready Demolition,
Tucson, Arizona?

1094
01:18:04,494 --> 01:18:06,580
Thank you very much.

1095
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,005
Make sure these don't get wet.

1096
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,800
I'll see you at 3:15.

1097
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:19,801
- Where are you going?
- Rushmore.

1098
01:18:19,843 --> 01:18:22,803
I've got one last piece
of unfinished business to attend to.

1099
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:42,573
- Fischer, you fuck!
- Hello, Magnus.

1100
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:43,907
I'd have shot you
in the other ear,

1101
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:46,954
but it got blown off
a long time ago.

1102
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,916
- Besides, now we're even.
- Not for long, Kemo Sabe.

1103
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:55,378
We'll see. I got
a proposition for you.

1104
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:59,257
Well, you can stick it up
your mother's ass, you little prick.

1105
01:18:59,423 --> 01:19:01,342
I gotta hand it to you, Magnus.

1106
01:19:01,467 --> 01:19:03,680
You've got a way with words.

1107
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:05,639
You want to be in a play?

1108
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,185
What's all that shite?

1109
01:19:12,311 --> 01:19:14,187
Nothing.

1110
01:19:14,856 --> 01:19:16,940
I just think
you're right for the part.

1111
01:19:33,957 --> 01:19:37,335
I always wanted to be
in one of your fucking plays.

1112
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:41,007
I know you did, mate.

1113
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,768
This is gonna be exciting.
My son Max wrote it.

1114
01:19:55,894 --> 01:19:58,649
Oh, boy, I gotta call the hospital.

1115
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:01,860
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Whitney, the English teacher?

1116
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,777
- Yes. - Hi, I'm William Yang,
Margaret Yang's father.

1117
01:20:04,861 --> 01:20:06,780
- This is my wife, Lucille.
- Nice to meet you.

1118
01:20:06,864 --> 01:20:08,908
- Hello.
- That's kid's gonna burn this place down.

1119
01:20:08,991 --> 01:20:10,847
You better believe it.

1120
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,703
- Well, the plans were never
formally submitted to the city.

1121
01:20:12,828 --> 01:20:15,079
- Were they supposed to be?
- I assume so.

1122
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:17,250
<i>- Too late now.
- Officers Brooks and Donovan...</i>

1123
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:19,753
<i>requesting additional units
at Grover Cleveland High School.</i>

1124
01:20:19,836 --> 01:20:21,587
<i>- Units responding identify.
- A program.</i>

1125
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:25,507
Let me look at that.
Turn it, turn it.

1126
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,508
That's enough.

1127
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,512
- Excuse me. Right here.
- Thanks.

1128
01:20:36,351 --> 01:20:38,393
Hi, Herman.

1129
01:20:42,106 --> 01:20:44,692
Looks like Max
pulled a fast one on us.

1130
01:20:52,618 --> 01:20:54,661
Thank you very much.

1131
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:59,331
I don't usually do this,
but this play means a lot to me,

1132
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:01,668
and I wanted
to make a dedication.

1133
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:05,419
So, I'll just say that this play
is dedicated to the memory of my mother,

1134
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:07,840
Eloise Fischer,

1135
01:21:08,549 --> 01:21:11,720
and to Edward Appleby,
a friend of a friend.

1136
01:21:12,803 --> 01:21:15,431
Also, you'll find a pair
of safety glasses and some earplugs...

1137
01:21:15,472 --> 01:21:17,433
underneath your seats.

1138
01:21:17,475 --> 01:21:21,102
Please feel free to use them.
Thank you very much.

1139
01:21:27,775 --> 01:21:29,862
<i>Bravo Company, this is Tango 7.
Do you copy?</i>

1140
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:33,615
We order the military forces
of the United States to take action...

1141
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,243
This is a different kind of war.

1142
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:39,663
We are making progress,
progress, progress, progress.

1143
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,383
How long you been
in country, soldier?

1144
01:21:53,507 --> 01:21:55,719
I ain't even here, Sergeant.

1145
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,804
I'm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

1146
01:21:59,096 --> 01:22:00,474
Right on, brother.

1147
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,767
Hoo. Hoo-hoo.

1148
01:22:07,397 --> 01:22:10,400
Let's rock, Esposito!
I repeat, let's rock!

1149
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:14,153
Let's rock and roll!

1150
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:49,897
Fischer!

1151
01:22:52,941 --> 01:22:54,693
I'm okay. Go, go, go, go.

1152
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:57,195
- Damn it!
- Take it easy, Dirk.

1153
01:22:57,237 --> 01:22:59,365
- How much time do we got, Wood?
- Two minutes.

1154
01:22:59,406 --> 01:23:00,679
- All right, bring me some more
ketchup very quickly, please.

1155
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,950
Effects!

1156
01:23:02,033 --> 01:23:05,411
- This is gonna look stupid.
- No, it's not. It's gonna look real.

1157
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:25,849
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1158
01:23:26,306 --> 01:23:28,351
Hold this one too, okay?

1159
01:23:31,769 --> 01:23:36,026
So, what do you think
of Max's latest opus?

1160
01:23:37,402 --> 01:23:39,321
It's good.

1161
01:23:41,906 --> 01:23:44,908
But let's hope
it's got a happy ending.

1162
01:24:02,507 --> 01:24:07,136
- Adios, Esposito.
- Adios, Sarge.

1163
01:24:07,303 --> 01:24:11,141
Say a prayer for Surf Boy,
wherever he is.

1164
01:24:11,224 --> 01:24:15,186
Semper fi, soldier.
Semper fi.

1165
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,731
Sic transit gloria.

1166
01:24:18,023 --> 01:24:20,692
Maybe we'll meet again someday...

1167
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:22,819
when the fighting stops.

1168
01:24:25,654 --> 01:24:28,656
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries!
We're movin' out!

1169
01:24:30,746 --> 01:24:32,497
I don't know but I've been told

1170
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:34,956
I don't know but I've been told

1171
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:46,091
Hello, Esposito.

1172
01:24:51,014 --> 01:24:52,849
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn?

1173
01:24:54,392 --> 01:24:56,185
You bet I will.

1174
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:13,786
That's my son.
That's my Maxie.

1175
01:25:22,376 --> 01:25:25,257
I just didn't expect to see you here.

1176
01:25:25,506 --> 01:25:27,300
Did Max send you an invitation?

1177
01:25:27,384 --> 01:25:30,761
Yeah, and he told me to wear a tie.

1178
01:25:32,554 --> 01:25:36,807
- Congratulations, Max.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Yang.

1179
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:40,186
I, uh, actually wrote a different
version of the play two years ago,

1180
01:25:40,311 --> 01:25:42,103
but I couldn't
get it done over at Rushmore.

1181
01:25:42,228 --> 01:25:44,400
- Oh, really? Why?
- Too political?

1182
01:25:44,441 --> 01:25:47,402
No, a kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.

1183
01:25:47,485 --> 01:25:50,405
A very good evening
to you, Fischers. Hi.

1184
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:52,947
Miss Cross, I'd like for you
to meet my father, Bert Fischer.

1185
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:56,117
He's a barber.
This is my friend, Rosemary Cross.

1186
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,370
- Hello, Rosemary.
- Nice to meet you at last, Bert.

1187
01:25:59,496 --> 01:26:00,957
Of course you know Mr. Blume.

1188
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,335
I'd also like everyone to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Yang. This is Margaret.

1189
01:26:05,419 --> 01:26:08,172
- Hello, Margaret.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Cross.

1190
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:10,465
I'm surprised they let him build
a real campfire on the stage.

1191
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:12,465
It's clearly a safety hazard.

1192
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:14,258
- Well, last year, he
tried to raise piranhas.

1193
01:26:14,259 --> 01:26:15,969
Yeah, I know he did.

1194
01:26:16,052 --> 01:26:19,225
- What did you think, Mr. Littlejeans?
- Best play ever, man.

1195
01:26:21,769 --> 01:26:23,728
I thought it was
a very realistic performance.

1196
01:26:23,769 --> 01:26:26,772
Yeah? Fischer stepped
over half my bloody lines.

1197
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:28,815
That's funny.
I didn't notice.

1198
01:26:28,899 --> 01:26:31,443
Mr. Blume, how are Ronny and Donny
enjoying military school?

1199
01:26:31,526 --> 01:26:34,112
- They love it.
- Lucky bastards.

1200
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:38,869
- I understand you're a neurosurgeon.
- No, I'm a barber.

1201
01:26:38,951 --> 01:26:41,746
But a lot of people make that mistake.

1202
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:49,085
You were incredible tonight, Margaret.

1203
01:26:49,127 --> 01:26:52,338
- You were that poor girl.
- Thank you.

1204
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:56,092
I loved it when you grabbed onto the
bottom of the chopper as it was taking off.

1205
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:58,135
- That was totally improvised.
- I know.

1206
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:00,139
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1207
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:02,682
Can you do
an Australian accent?

1208
01:27:02,766 --> 01:27:05,268
I'm working on something
that's set in the outback.

1209
01:27:05,352 --> 01:27:08,312
I really feel like celebrating,
you know?

1210
01:27:08,521 --> 01:27:12,231
- Would you care to dance?
- Oh, yes, I would love to.

1211
01:27:12,397 --> 01:27:13,903
- Great.
- Come on.

1212
01:27:14,444 --> 01:27:16,030
You're looking good, Bert.

1213
01:27:16,113 --> 01:27:18,073
Hello, Mr. Blume.

1214
01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:21,117
Hello, Margaret.
May I cut in?

1215
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:24,161
I haven't had a chance to cut a rug
with your new girlfriend yet.

1216
01:27:24,203 --> 01:27:27,749
- Ah, new girlfriend.
- Yes, I am.

1217
01:27:27,832 --> 01:27:31,753
Find your own dance partner, Mr. Blume.
I'm spoken for.

1218
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:35,674
No, it's okay.
He's my friend.

1219
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:44,555
Well... you pulled it off.

1220
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,975
Yeah, it went okay.
At least nobody got hurt.

1221
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:51,689
Except you.

1222
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:56,652
No, I didn't get hurt that bad.

1223
01:27:56,861 --> 01:27:59,905
Come on, you two. Shake a leg.

1224
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,950
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, but...

1225
01:28:05,033 --> 01:28:08,788
Here, let's see if the deejay can play
something with a little more... Reuben!

1226
01:28:53,956 --> 01:28:56,917
<i># Poor old Granddad #</i>

1227
01:28:57,042 --> 01:29:00,170
<i># I laughed at all his words #</i>

1228
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,382
<i># I thought he was a bitter man #</i>

1229
01:29:03,424 --> 01:29:06,511
<i># He spoke of women's ways #</i>

1230
01:29:06,594 --> 01:29:09,638
<i># They'll trapped you
Then they use you #</i>

1231
