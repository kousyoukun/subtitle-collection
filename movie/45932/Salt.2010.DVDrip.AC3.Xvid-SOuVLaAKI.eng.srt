1
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,350


2
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,120
Please, let me go home, please, please I am not the one you think I am.

3
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,100
I am not really who you think I am.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,270
Please, I am not a spy...

5
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,570
Please let me go home.

6
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,080
I am not a spy, I am a businesswoman,

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,360
I work for petroleum and gas.

8
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,680
Please tell them, I work for Rink Petroleum.

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,070
You're here to sabotage our nuclear ambition.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,430
I am not a spy.

11
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,120
I am not a spy!

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm not a spy...

13
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,270
Keep your head down, don't say anything until the swap,

14
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,330
in case Kim Jong-il changes his mind.

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,060
Exchange.

16
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,350
I do not understand.

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
You don't understand what?

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,930
All the rule says that a little one life

19
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,300
is not worth doing operational cover.

20
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,110
You're damn right.

21
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,300
If we have to lose someone for greater good.

22
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,520
We will.

23
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,510
So why did you do it?

24
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,900
Well...

25
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,410
I didn't do it.

26
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,650
He did.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,370
Once he found out where you're, there's no stop him.

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,030
He petitioned the Senate,

29
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,590
the State Department, we didn't need publicity,

30
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,180
so I figured we thought up some reason,

31
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,850
and do the goddam right thing and spare the public from themselves.

32
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,920
Are you okay?

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,570
Yeah.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,770


35
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,970


36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000


37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000


38
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,630
Hi.

39
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,270
- Good morning.  - Happy Anniversary.

40
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,570
You want me to make breakfast?

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,690
How about... pancakes?

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,200
You're cooking?

43
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,350
You're joking, you like my cooking.

44
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,550
Germans don't joke.

45
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,780
Burt likes my cooking.

46
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,250
Get your bugs off the table.

47
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,510
- They're spiders.  - They're bugs.

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,850
- Spiders.  - Bugs.

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,200
Fold the square back as we did the two before it,

50
00:04:48,440 --> 00:05:00,200
turn the napkin over, fold both sides back over one another about third away...

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,410
Are you doing these on company time?

52
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,400
It's my anniversary, and I want it to be perfect.

53
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,350
But...

54
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,900
that is not sexy.

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,290
No, but it is utilitarian and utilitarian is the new sexy.

56
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,860
Find a trace, first name Busse, last name Bussac.

57
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,190
- Terrify behaviors?  - One.

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,510
Hey friend, just do me a favor,

59
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,940
and stick that in a safe until tomorrow.

60
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,420
Mata Hari here is to got a big night tonight.

61
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,200
Yes, sir, right away, sir.

62
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,430
Sir...

63
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,330
Do I look like a Sir to you?

64
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,990
For me hard to tell, I'm superising they call you "Your Majesty".

65
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,770
I like read that. I think I prefer "Your Majesty".

66
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,300
Was I ever that young?

67
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,500
Younger.

68
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,510
Walk me out.

69
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,660
How did the over-office briefing go?

70
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,580
You know, as-usual.

71
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,360
The President wants to know what happens in Russia the day before it happens.

72
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,750
But you, is that everything went well?

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,240
I'm just going to quit.

74
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,890
You're sure about this?

75
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,910
You know, once you start to push a paper, you cannot turn it back.

76
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,640
I had a strangest feeling when I was there last time.

77
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,620
I was homesick.

78
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,020
Homesick? Is there something else...

79
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,550
Sir! Sir!

80
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,670
We get a "walk-in"

81
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,390
and it affected ten minutes ago.

82
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,630
- Here?  - Guess he's not by our governor.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,750
- He is bona fide?  - He's Russian.

84
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,010
Says he has affects and don't want to get in this any more.

85
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,240
- He's a strange guy.  - How's his English?

86
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,030
Passable, not great.

87
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,650
But I forget to tell it's certainly not the English you want.

88
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,020
Ted, Mike is waiting for me at home.

89
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,470
Yes, and I have a plane to catch.

90
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,600
Come on, Salt, no one can solve that kind of job here faster than you.

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,700
- I have 25 minutes.  - I got 26, let's go.

92
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,480
- Who got and tell them this?  - Not me.

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,450
Hi Ted, we crash the party.

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,570
- Peabody.  - Salt.

95
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,320
Take the bag off his head.

96
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,020
Microphones are on.

97
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,450
Checking levels.

98
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,160
Baseline recording.

99
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,370
Neuroscan is on. You're ready to go.

100
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,610
Commencing audio and visual recording.

101
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,810
Testing earpiece.

102
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,520
Interview commence at 14:42.

103
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,130
You're married.

104
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,770
A husband must be a distraction for a female intelligence officer.

105
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,080
We are here to talk about you.

106
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,070
So what is your name?

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,160
My name is Oleg Vassily Orlov.

108
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,350
I have cancer.

109
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,170
I'm moved, a defector with cancer.

110
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,860
Are you selling secrets for chemo, or are you afraid to die?

111
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:41,510
If I have gained, anything by damage myself, it is that I no longer afraid anything think of you...

112
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,840
Oleg Vassily Orlov.

113
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,660
Shows up in 1993 in Novosibirsk, Siberia.

114
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,660
His database doesn't have many stuff here.

115
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,160
Scan says it's true for the cancer.

116
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,890
Prior to 93?

117
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,780
Nothing.

118
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,030
Don't exist.

119
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,220
I have somewhere I need to be, Mr. Orlov.

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,490
So if you wouldn't mind getting to the point.

121
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,840


122
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,310


123
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,070


124
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,880
Do not speak Russian. I have to ask you to talk in English.

125
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
Others are listening.

126
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,210
1975. The Cold War.

127
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,640
Imagine as in Grozny,

128
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,750
a Soviet Olympic wrestler, named Sasha Jodovic Chenkov.

129
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,370
Meets for the first time,

130
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,570
the only female Chess Grandmaster of her era,

131
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,740
Anya Najok.

132
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,260
Within a month they were married.

133
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,480
And within a year, a child.

134
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,390
One month's more,

135
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,690
the child was back to the same hospital.

136
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,950
Sick with fever.

137
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:21,102
And within days after that the child suddenly was dead.

138
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,126
Yes.

139
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,351
A child was dead.

140
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,267
And, yes.

141
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:31,206
A child was buried.

142
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,962
But the Chenkov baby was alive

143
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:45,820
and became the property of another man.

144
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:51,121
A master spy who had devised the greatest plan

145
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:54,892
that Russia patriot could ever invent.

146
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,885
The plan to destroy America.

147
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:05,828
It had all started with an American named Lee Harvey Oswald.

148
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,922
In 1959,

149
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,994
he emigrated to Russia.

150
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:13,097
Three years later he returned home,

151
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:19,075
but the man who came back to America was in fact a Russian spy,

152
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,229
named Alek.

153
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:25,322
On November 22, 1963,

154
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:29,389
Alek became the first success of the new program

155
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,629
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

156
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:38,999
The spy master was given to go ahead, to create many more like Alek.

157
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,203
Scores of agents...

158
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:42,971
males and females

159
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:45,758
to be substitute for Americans.

160
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,390
In an abandoned monastery, Chenkov and other boys and girls

161
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,731
learnt English long before they learnt Russian.

162
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:04,443
Drilled in idioms, idiosyncrasies and ideology.

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,631
And by methods of through rigorous physical and psychological programs,

164
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:13,001
the spy master made warriors of

165
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:17,348
higher unquestioned and unbreakable.

166
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,660
You're killing me, man.

167
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,588
When is the good fairy coming?

168
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:23,699
Never.

169
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,124
It's just a story without hope.

170
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:31,377
Chenkov was matched with the child to wait become an American family.

171
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:37,740
There was an accident, the family died, and Chenkov was sent to America

172
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:41,212
to live a complete lie.

173
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:46,788
And to patient clear wait the day to attack from within day X.

174
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,380
The longer-waited mission is here.

175
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:59,765
Chenkov will travel to New York City, to kill the president of Russia

176
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:04,660
at the funeral of the American vice president.

177
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:10,629
Chenkov is KA12.

178
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,165
- KA.  - Called legend.

179
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:16,884
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents insert into American society

180
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,326
to sabotage and assassinate.

181
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,430
Supposedly they waited years to strike. Decades.

182
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,646
Eh, supposedly.

183
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,395
Something you wanna tell me, don't you believe in moles?

184
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:29,247
I believe in moles alright. Just not the bogey-man.

185
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,911
Especially the plan is to kill their own president.

186
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,141
This guy is sound smoke.

187
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,686
Wrap it up, Ev.

188
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:41,006
So a Russian agent is going to kill the Russian president, is that it?

189
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,531
Ok.

190
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,646
Thank you very much.

191
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:49,766
And what would you like to return for that information?

192
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:54,791
I simply wish to help you do what you need to do.

193
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,943
You're good.

194
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,512
KA program is brilliant bullshit.

195
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,487
But I am officially off-duty, so...

196
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,080
you can tell the rest of your little story to one of my colleagues.

197
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,384
- Salt.  - Yes.

198
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,879
The name of the Russian agent is Salt.

199
00:14:18,085 --> 00:14:19,714
Evelyn Salt.

200
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,847
My name is Evelyn Salt.

201
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,544
Then you are a Russian spy.

202
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,525
Truthful.

203
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:36,209
So far the FMRI scan registered truth on everything he said.

204
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,337
Ted...

205
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,780
Call Protective Services and make sure they find my husband.

206
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:50,737
- Where are you going?  - I need to get to the phone.

207
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:52,272
No... not after the neuroscan.

208
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:53,143
- Because he didn't flatter?  - Yes.

209
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:56,778
I could pass that thing 5 times in 6. I'm trying to. And so is he.

210
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,221
I need my phone. I need to call my husband.

211
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,349
- Let me call my husband.  - Let me see it.

212
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,345
There is a reason he mentioned my wedding ring, Ted.

213
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:12,918
When they blow spies, they didn't just blow the cover, they blowed their whole covered life, you know that.

214
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,899
Do you remember what happened to Henry's wife?

215
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,194
- Yes, I do.  - The speaker.

216
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:21,291
Please leave a message after the beep. Thank you. Bye.

217
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,465
Honey, it's me. Please call me as soon as you get this.

218
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,030
Okay, sweetheart? As soon as you get this.

219
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,522
Godspeed, comrade Chenkov.

220
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,954
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.

221
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,957
Someone join me to get answers.

222
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,307
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

223
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,044
I am not a goddamn Russian spy.

224
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:39,301
I did not say you were.

225
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:41,947
Let's go to my office and we can sort this out.

226
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:43,803
No, no. We got to go to a secure location.

227
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:45,155
Now.

228
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:45,982
All right.

229
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,446
Nothing get more secure than this?

230
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,350
Ev, 5 minutes.

231
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,006
Call Protective Services and tell them to find Mike.

232
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,544
Give us a second. I'll be back.

233
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:10,150
Look, I know we hadn't jurisdiction here, but I ask you for 5 minutes.

234
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:10,761
No.

235
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,949
If I have to ask, she can not have 5 minutes alone, I have to talk to her.

236
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,493
- She's scared. Don't you see?  - I don't care.

237
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,624
I don't care. There is a mole in Russia house.

238
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,907
There is a mole in Russia house, I'm sure of it.

239
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,372
Please step into the elevator.

240
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,925
What the hell is that?

241
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,245
Sir.

242
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,045
Jesus Christ.

243
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,632
Here is again, the son is so far on the street.

244
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,713
That was two minutes before we locked down.

245
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,910
We've got a match, sir.

246
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:07,614
It's made in 1981. Here is Brezhnev, and there...

247
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:11,289
- Orlov.  - That's him.  - He used to be a heavy weight once upon a time.

248
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,605
Get that photo up now to every ticket counter, airport,

249
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:16,815
train station, taxi dispatch the whole nine yard.

250
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:18,782
Get me to the Director on a secure line, now.

251
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:19,580
Yes, sir.

252
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,928
The topright screen... Is that live?

253
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:23,809
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,195
Where is she going? Track her.

255
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,319
No one can leave the building.

256
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,832
Rink Petroleum Security.

257
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,833
Yes, you have a woman to your left, behind you,

258
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,342
Evelyn Salt.

259
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,236
- We lost visual of her.  - Damn it.

260
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,469
Where did she go?

261
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,125
Hey Edward, is Mike there?

262
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:47,141
No, I'm sorry, he left after lunch.

263
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:49,102
Hey, Ev. Happy anniversary.

264
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:50,347
The stairwell.

265
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:52,707
Second floor.

266
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:54,609
- What's on that floor?  - It's empty.

267
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,147
- It's security buffer.  - Isolate and seal it.

268
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,727
Get her records to my handheld.

269
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:08,447
It's corridor.

270
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:26,803
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

271
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:32,950
We got her.

272
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:41,300
All right.

273
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:44,033
Get the tactical team to meet with me in the south stairwell.

274
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:44,820
Yes, sir.

275
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,000
Do you have recommend, sir?

276
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:50,983
I'll call her back.

277
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,062
- Shit.  - Lost visual.

278
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:01,325
Where is she now, talk to me.

279
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,894
Come on.

280
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:11,894
North hallway.

281
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:29,470
There, interrogation room. Bring that up.

282
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,639


283
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,539


284
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,539


285
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:05,331


286
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,549
- Have you found him?  - What the hell are you doing there?

287
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:18,190
This don't look good.

288
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,652
The tactical team coming at you in about 30 seconds.

289
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:26,211
Get your goddamn pants off the camera, so we can see. You won't get hurt.

290
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:27,491
Have you found my husband?

291
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:29,380
These boys are full around, Ev.

292
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:36,538
Please, I cann't help you unless you talk to me.

293
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,838
Call me when you find Mike.

294
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,345
Okay, open the door about two feet. We're going to gas her.

295
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,441
Send up gas will be necessary?

296
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:04,822
What, you want to shoot her?

297
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,414
Get a medical team in place now.

298
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,414
Get ready!

299
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,520
Well, on my count.

300
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:38,874
Three, two, one.

301
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:40,078
Go!

302
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,823
Jesus Christ.

303
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,768
Where is she?

304
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,304
Come on, guys, find her. Now.

305
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,080
There. Bring that up.

306
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,261
Stick with her, she's crossing the street.

307
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:15,629
Pan the goddamned camera.

308
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:27,990
Back it up and zoom in.

309
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:30,898
Freeze.

310
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:35,370
What the hell are you doing there?

311
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,350
Michael Krause left his office at Missouri an hour ago.

312
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:45,376
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

313
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,405
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

314
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:49,179
She will, she is serious about Mike.

315
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,943
- He may stay in the house.  - Okay.

316
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:52,959
Taxi!

317
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,391
Hughes Street, I'll tell you where you stop.

318
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,520
Hi, this is Mike, please leave a message after the beep.

319
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,248
He is one of the world's top arachnologists, sir.

320
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:42,856
And as such enjoys, pretty much unrestricted access to the border of North Korea.

321
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,030
So...

322
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:47,116
Brush up on your bugs and get to know him.

323
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,892
It is a perfect cover to get us inside.

324
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,889
Mike?

325
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,383
Mike?

326
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:35,936
Honey?

327
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:44,016
Hi, baby.

328
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:47,936
It's okay, where is Daddy?

329
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:49,697
Where is Daddy?

330
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,976
The bathroom is clear.

331
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:56,935
The kitchen is clear.

332
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,375
The office is clear.

333
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,330
The living room is clear.

334
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,934
Everybody go out in 50 seconds.

335
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:02,782
What are you doing?

336
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,921
She is not here, no sign of her husband neither.

337
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:07,548
Did it ever occur to you, maybe that Russian was lying?

338
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,582
- Why she run?  - I don't know, because you locked her up?

339
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:13,524
See it from her perspective, maybe her husband is in some real danger.

340
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,254
Maybe, God forbid. Salt is who she says she is.

341
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,506
Maybe is your department. Mine is catching her so we can find out.

342
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:23,790
Protocol is clear we bring her here, or we bring her down.

343
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,660
Do you have any idea whom this woman is?

344
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,180
What she's done for this country didn't that mean anything to you?

345
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,580
Should it?

346
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:34,496
Your mom home?

347
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,496
No.

348
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,097
You do me a favor?

349
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:39,873
- Yeah.  - Fine. Babysitter her for me?

350
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:40,873
Oh, yeah.

351
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,396
Here is some money for food.

352
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,636
What did you do? You're doing your homework?

353
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,778
Yeah, math.

354
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:50,778
Algebra.

355
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,154
I hate math.

356
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:06,029
Hi, nice to see you again.

357
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:10,593
- You're talking to me?  - Yeah, I've seen you here before.

358
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,057
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

359
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,457
You?

360
00:29:16,742 --> 00:29:20,064
Oh, I am working here. At the Museum.

361
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,073
I am an arachnologist.

362
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,129
A what?

363
00:29:25,487 --> 00:29:26,945
I hunt spiders.

364
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:44,177
I got her, she's heading north towards a metro station.

365
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:46,177
Ev.

366
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,076
She is east-bound, it's time to call them off.

367
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:42,889
There she is.

368
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,471
All teams south-bound, toward the bridge, block her in.

369
00:30:58,934 --> 00:30:59,471
Stop.

370
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,271
Take it back! Hold your fire!

371
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:14,471
Stop.

372
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:26,170
- Stop!  - Don't shoot, I am innocent.

373
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,505
On the ground, now!

374
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,175
I stopped.

375
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:30,307
Go, Give up now.

376
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:32,492
- On the ground.  - I have to find my husband.

377
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:34,211
- Why did you run?  - I have to find my husband.

378
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:35,099
That's not a reason.

379
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,718
Please don't shoot.

380
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:36,901
Stay back.

381
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:40,091
I am innocent, someone set me up.

382
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:42,280
- Don 't make me put you down, Salt.  - Put the damn gun down.

383
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:44,167
- On the floor now!  - No!

384
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:44,500
What did she say?

385
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:45,568
On the ground.

386
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:46,568
We will solve this out, I promise.

387
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:48,825
I got to bring you in, Salt.

388
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:50,606
Salt, put your face down.

389
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,158
Somebody's going to try to kill Russian president, you know that.

390
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,265
Do something about that.

391
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,102
That's you should worry about.

392
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,246
You have no where to run, quit now.

393
00:31:58,477 --> 00:31:59,688
I didn't do anything.

394
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:11,129
She is on a blue semi, blue one, heading north.

395
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:12,920
Get a roadblock in place now.

396
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:06,730
Here she is, on the tank.

397
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:07,734
Stop. Stop.

398
00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:18,734
Ev!

399
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,233
- You, my friend, you got a mole in your group.  - You don't know that yet.

400
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,030
Actually, she's a trained goddamned liar.

401
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:43,668
Everything she set up to pronounce is to protect her cover.

402
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:45,470
Why don't you tell me how you really feel about it?

403
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,807
Get up on the shoulder! Get up on the shoulder!

404
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,168
Ok, take it down.

405
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:08,112
Shit!

406
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:12,056
Shit!

407
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:19,593
Ok.

408
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:21,569
Ted, I know you are her friend,

409
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:24,802
but we got to drop a net in New York.

410
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,417
We got to do it now.

411
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:32,993
I don't find a secret service on my base detail.

412
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,209
Tell them Salt might be coming on their way.

413
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,893
If she is, Orlov may not be fall behind either.

414
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:45,103


415
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:46,205
You seen this?

416
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:48,090
Salt had spent her time in Russia as a kid.

417
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:52,600
She was in a car accident with her parents in 1988, they both died.

418
00:35:54,192 --> 00:35:58,041
They were teachers at the US Embassy for American children of staff there.

419
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,298
So why we put her on Russia in the first place.

420
00:36:03,104 --> 00:36:05,706
We need to get on a plane to New York tonight.

421
00:36:54,755 --> 00:37:00,000
And here in New York City, security has been beeped up and the preparations are continuing well into the night

422
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,167
for the funeral of Vice President Maxwell Haulls.

423
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:07,767
Among the dignitaries will be attending the service tomorrow at the St. Bartholomew Church

424
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:10,246
is Russian President Boris Matveyev,

425
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,981
who will arrive here in Manhattan earlier this evening.

426
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,712
Evelyn, look at me.

427
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,198
If that was a way I would kill them.

428
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:35,662
- You shouldn't have come here.  - What do you mean? I don't... I don't understand.

429
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,861
Now they know who you are.

430
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:42,021
Who?

431
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,638
Evelyn, who?

432
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:53,510
I would accept anything about you, but I need to know.

433
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,190
So... look at me. Look at me.

434
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:00,671
Just tell me, okay?

435
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:03,097
Just tell me.

436
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:07,230
I work...

437
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,343
I work for CIA.

438
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:13,815
See, there is...

439
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,142
there is no future for us.

440
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,567
You are not safe with me.

441
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,702
I don't want to be safe.

442
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:29,862
I know you.

443
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:32,302
And I wanna be with you.

444
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,214
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

445
00:38:39,262 --> 00:38:40,910
Okay?

446
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:44,454
Okay, okay.

447
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:06,170
Welcome to New York, Mrs. Fernandez.

448
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:07,495
One night at the luxury room?

449
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,467
Yes.

450
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,943
Mrs. Fernandez, do you need any help with your luggage?

451
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:12,378
No, I had, thanks.

452
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:41,378


453
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,378


454
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:55,997
A solemn day here in New York City.

455
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:59,165
The funeral of Vice President Maxwell Haulls.

456
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:02,653
A former 5 time US Senator and a Cold War warrior.

457
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:08,157
His greatest legacy maybe as architect of a new era of America and Russia relations.

458
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:12,186
Russian President Boris Matveyev has journey from Moscow

459
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:17,214
to be an honorary tomb burier to the man he's called "his greatest friend in the west".

460
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:15,051
What's security perimeter?

461
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:18,186
We are too deep inside, we are on this entire block.

462
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:20,618
And those are secret service agents.

463
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,826
Not CIA, so relax.

464
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:24,715
That's real funny.

465
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,538
I don't know you guys told jokes.

466
00:42:53,584 --> 00:42:56,538
Due to the funeral, the 5th Street station is closed.

467
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:03,538
Good evening, due to the funeral, the 5th Street station is closed.

468
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:18,686
Step back. Step Back. Everybody moves out of way.

469
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:00,638
- Boris.  - Mr. President.

470
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,779
Please be seated.

471
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:46,855
Mrs. Haulls, Elenore, Joe, we are sit down...

472
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:51,088
After the president finishes chorus sing, they may amoung them to the eulogy.

473
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:54,353
If they gonna try anything here, I have to be pretty amazing.

474
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:02,353
I knew he would bring more to the job than just his years of experience.

475
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:05,138
As vice president,

476
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:09,592
he showed the world the best of what it is to be in American.

477
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:15,993
And today, the world says goodbye to a great man.

478
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:28,818
- I will take the back.  - Lima Zulu 4. Clear.

479
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:59,776
My friend Maxwell Haulls began of the unlikeliest places...

480
00:45:59,777 --> 00:46:05,164
Lima Zulu 4, come in? Could you stand up, Lima Zulu 4?

481
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:10,164
We got two MIAs. Lima Zulu 4 at the corner of utility tunnel outside equiped and Lima Zulu 5.

482
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,926
I'm heading out to the crypt, some kind of trouble in there.

483
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:16,798
What is going on there, talk to me.

484
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:20,079
So knew the team Zulu 1, 2. Converge on crypt. Repeat. Converge on crypt.

485
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:25,827
He may call it difference and for that he will always have my respect.

486
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:36,242
Drop it.

487
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:48,360
Shooter's at the 12 o'clock.

488
00:48:50,256 --> 00:48:51,290
Do not move!

489
00:48:54,256 --> 00:48:55,290
Take her down, take her down.

490
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:57,059
Check all her weapons.

491
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:00,602
We need a medical group down the crypt immediately.

492
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,091
I cant feel the pulse.

493
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:05,657
Get out.

494
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:08,589
Come on, guys. Keep moving, keep moving.

495
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:14,589
Hey, hey, watch out, watch out.

496
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,589
What, what?

497
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:22,147
Do you have any idea how much blood is on your hands?

498
00:49:22,718 --> 00:49:27,178
You gonna write my whole, Salt. I'm seeing you a personal dark goddam demon.

499
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:33,071
Back off, man. Back.

500
00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:34,383
Let's go.

501
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,409
Matveyev was declared dead on the route to the hospital.

502
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,104
Jesus Christ.

503
00:49:57,302 --> 00:49:58,433
Yeah.

504
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,089
You were right about it.

505
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,296
She had a drop on me, Ted.

506
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:06,936
Why didn't she shoot?

507
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,894
Cop down! Cop down! Hear me?

508
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:50,183
Get out of the car with your hands on your head.

509
00:53:03,532 --> 00:53:07,715
- What is your name?  - My name is Evelyn Salt.

510
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:11,075
- What college will you attend?  - Princeton University.

511
00:53:11,265 --> 00:53:14,452
- Where will you work?  - The Central Intelligence Agency.

512
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:15,981
Who will you trust?

513
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:17,523
No one.

514
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,691
Be very patient.

515
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,483
Remember your training.

516
00:53:23,106 --> 00:53:26,124
Remember you are not the only one.

517
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:27,566
There are many others.

518
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:31,117
- All of you waiting to strike.  - Yes.

519
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:36,236
- And we will strike together.  - Yes.

520
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:40,965
Wait.

521
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:46,774
One day I'll come for all of you.

522
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:54,905
Hello, Evelyn.

523
00:53:55,296 --> 00:53:57,674
I am Mark Crenshaw from the US Embassy.

524
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,481
We're very sorry about your family's accident.

525
00:54:09,332 --> 00:54:14,895
Rioters outside of the US Embassy cheer their new leaders worried and called on

526
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:15,930
taking a strong action against what they called a 

527
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:19,862
state sponsored act terrorism on the part of the US.

528
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:25,130
These riots are supporting similar outbreak to entire American protestors across Russia.

529
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,875
We will strike back, says the new Russian President angrily,

530
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:33,893
condemn today's assassination by the American Intelligence officer, Evelyn Salt.

531
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:38,719
Even if the body of president Matveyev was on its way back to Moscow,

532
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,362
anti-America riots have rocket across Russia

533
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:44,026
with bombing, so the US diplomatic car in Moscow.

534
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,003
The Russian arm forces have been put on high alert.

535
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,062
Responding to a rapidly isolating crisis.

536
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:53,988
President Lewis has called for a emergency White House meeting...

537
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,772


538
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,772
Greetings, Comrade Orlov!

539
00:55:06,747 --> 00:55:09,556
When I saw you in Washington, I almost ran to you.

540
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:23,564
You were not supposed to get married, not unless you cut great tactical advantage.

541
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:25,349
I did it to seem normal.

542
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:31,731
When you escaped today, I thought even I could not come hoped for so much.

543
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:36,026
You're my greatest creation.

544
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,306
You trained me well.

545
00:56:14,316 --> 00:56:16,636
My husband, you have him?

546
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:19,076
I have to be certain.

547
00:56:19,874 --> 00:56:21,340
But now you trust me?

548
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:23,557
Completely.

549
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,978
So, tell me what's next.

550
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,841
Next, part two.

551
00:56:37,496 --> 00:56:41,160
We seize control of this country's atomic weapons.

552
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,287
How?

553
00:56:44,286 --> 00:56:45,711


554
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:47,815


555
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:00,213


556
00:58:02,283 --> 00:58:04,092


557
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,013


558
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:10,742


559
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:14,359


560
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:18,167


561
00:58:18,852 --> 00:58:21,438


562
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,903


563
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:27,430


564
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,416


565
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:44,485


566
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:50,669


567
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:56,685


568
00:58:57,237 --> 00:59:01,885


569
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,077


570
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:05,275


571
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:08,197


572
00:59:08,356 --> 00:59:10,670


573
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:13,264
You're not hear from me again.

574
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:15,041
My daughter.

575
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:33,322


576
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,329


577
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:45,650
Chenkov. Do you remember me?

578
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:51,683
Chenkov.

579
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,362
Did you miss me?

580
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,427
Sneijder?

581
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,779
How long have you been here?

582
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:06,115
I left Russia one year after you.

583
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:11,115
I've been the NATO liaison of the White House for three years.

584
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,875
Colonel Edwards Thomas.

585
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:15,875
And you...

586
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:17,692
are my attache.

587
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:19,017
Your ID card.

588
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:22,188
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.

589
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:25,125
More important is our mission.

590
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:29,517
The bunker is eight stories below the White House.

591
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:33,671
That's where the president is going to be.

592
01:02:38,262 --> 01:02:39,768
How do we do it?

593
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:42,022
Do not worry, he will be there, that's my job,

594
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:43,551
to make sure he's there.

595
01:02:44,756 --> 01:02:45,847
What's my job?

596
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:49,269
Do you remember, Chenkov, when you were young

597
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:51,797
and you had to finish first in everything

598
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:53,866
and to be the best in everything.

599
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:56,893
Even though you knew you would be beaten with a cane, you had to finish first.

600
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:58,807
I remember.

601
01:02:59,428 --> 01:03:02,020
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.

602
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:08,829
Tonight you will kill America's president.

603
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:22,740
IDs, please.

604
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:25,514
Up the hood. Open the trunk.

605
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:35,356
Control, this is H. Evans. We have a Colonel named Thomas and a Major Kucik.

606
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:41,134
Colonel.

607
01:03:41,203 --> 01:03:42,540
Major. All clear

608
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:56,318
You know the drill, colonel.

609
01:03:58,156 --> 01:04:00,622
A shrapnel, from a Serbian landmine.

610
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:02,987
I spend more time looking at it, than the doctor did.

611
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:08,598
Step through, please, sir.

612
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:14,006
Turn around.

613
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,351
Thank you.

614
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:29,450
Patience is key, I've been coming here for two years, others have been here even longer.

615
01:04:29,464 --> 01:04:31,083
- What others?  - I don't know.

616
01:04:31,608 --> 01:04:33,146
But you are the best of us

617
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:34,487
and I was the least.

618
01:04:34,749 --> 01:04:37,764
There must be others who have to finish what we begin.

619
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,929
- Thomas, good to see you again.  - Major Kucic.

620
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:44,516
Pleasure. You have exactly 2 minutes to prepare your views before the main meeting.

621
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:48,156
Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt,

622
01:04:48,827 --> 01:04:50,117
who can tell us about her?

623
01:04:50,245 --> 01:04:52,117
We think she maybe a Soviet plant,

624
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:55,798
started years ago on preparation for some of KGB

625
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:57,390
called "Day X."

626
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:01,121
The day that would mark the started large scale strike against US and her alias.

627
01:05:08,748 --> 01:05:10,144
You should be the president now.

628
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:17,102
You got a big job, Chenkov. But you can do it.

629
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:20,702
- You still haven't told me what your job is.  - Home.

630
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:23,039
I'm going home.

631
01:05:31,822 --> 01:05:33,033
Get back.

632
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,033
- Are you okay, sir?  - Yes.

633
01:05:48,122 --> 01:05:50,133
- God damn it.  - This is OP. Down with MOBO.

634
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,822
I think I saw her.

635
01:06:10,773 --> 01:06:11,975
You saw who?

636
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:15,063
Salt.

637
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,078
I think I saw her in the corner.

638
01:06:20,525 --> 01:06:22,015
Get the NATO officer.

639
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,335
She's here.

640
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:30,022
- Check.  - Clear. Go!

641
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:32,377
Go!

642
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:35,001
We have an visual on the second assassin, Evelyn Salt.

643
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:38,076
Repeat, Evelyn Salt's presence, maybe dressed as a NATO officer.

644
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:50,919
I need this hallway. Clear it to the left. Now!

645
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:54,826
Main post, this is Jake, I need the PR let the bunker operate running.

646
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:58,514
If this is authorised by the Russian government, it is an act of war.

647
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,052
And we will respond.

648
01:07:07,498 --> 01:07:08,669
Let's go, sir.

649
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:20,934
Close! Close!

650
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,090
Go, go.

651
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:08,538
Direct move approaching the bunker door in 5 seconds.

652
01:08:12,732 --> 01:08:14,017
Clear.

653
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:23,690
Any chance she could follow?

654
01:08:23,704 --> 01:08:25,951
My own men couldn't get to that door once it is closed.

655
01:08:25,952 --> 01:08:28,128
Very well, but unfortunately she isn't one of yours.

656
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:33,952
Okay. Go!

657
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:36,526
Stay until the trunk seal...

658
01:08:40,225 --> 01:08:41,526
Direct move, secure.

659
01:09:09,765 --> 01:09:11,272
- Get me to Director Manfred.  - Yes, sir.

660
01:09:12,726 --> 01:09:15,557
Sir, I think we need seriously consider the possiblity that today,

661
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:18,560
right now, could be the start of Day X.

662
01:09:19,157 --> 01:09:21,489
Mr. President, Director Manfred is up.

663
01:09:22,545 --> 01:09:24,098
Marianne, what is the situation?

664
01:09:24,152 --> 01:09:26,274
It should be coming up on one of your screens.

665
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:32,277
What you see there represents temperature drops and mobile missile units in Siberia.

666
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:35,773
It means so Russians are deploying their missiles to the field.

667
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:38,861
And that's been confirmed on the ground, Mr. president.

668
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:43,945
Mr. President, I strongly recommend we go from the DEFCON 4 to DEFCON2.

669
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:45,730
At least that all in bases.

670
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:48,151
Do it.

671
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:55,001
I insist the Russians have deployed, we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

672
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,026
It's not on the table, it's not determined.

673
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:01,742
All right, Marianne, we'll come back to you.

674
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:28,946
Sir, the outer front door is jamed, no response.

675
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:31,986
And we just lost feed from most our security cameras.

676
01:10:32,248 --> 01:10:34,862
We are blind down here and no one can enter this facility.

677
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:39,215
Command, our eyes are down both ways and we have a POC out of security plus front door not function.

678
01:10:39,216 --> 01:10:40,394
Get out there now.

679
01:10:40,902 --> 01:10:42,215
Seal this room.

680
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:46,441
Down that corridor, security.

681
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:41,139
This is the President Howard Lewis. Proceed with authentication.

682
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,476
Yes, Mr. President.

683
01:11:47,155 --> 01:11:48,925
Ready to commence on authentication, sir.

684
01:11:49,395 --> 01:11:54,462
Zulu, Tango, Echo, Seven, Niner, Juliet, XRay, Sierra,

685
01:11:54,463 --> 01:11:59,249
Seven, Alpha, Mike, Charlie, Whiskey, Five, Six, Tango.

686
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:01,920
Authentication codes confirmed.

687
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,112
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

688
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:05,881
God be with you.

689
01:12:07,854 --> 01:12:10,558
Attack options and the target are your control, Mr. President.

690
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,542
Anise, Nabble, where is your location?

691
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,526
Anise, Nabble, where is your location?

692
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,354
- Is the camera outside this door working?  - Yes.

693
01:12:19,355 --> 01:12:19,895
Put it up.

694
01:12:20,685 --> 01:12:22,447
Officer Draw what is your status?

695
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:25,799
Officer Draw, come in.

696
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:31,111
Who the hell is that?

697
01:12:32,692 --> 01:12:33,687
That's her.

698
01:12:34,276 --> 01:12:35,758
That's Evelyn Salt.

699
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:40,594
- Give me your side-arm, I am qualified.  - No, sir, only Secret Service

700
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:42,540
preserved fire arm presents facility.

701
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,395
Screw protocols, Jack. We got an enemy agent out there.

702
01:12:44,396 --> 01:12:45,472
Protocol is protocol, sir.

703
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,809
And dead... is dead.

704
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:54,533
I'm the National Security Advisor.

705
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:56,478
Not anymore.

706
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:04,925
Sit down.

707
01:13:07,947 --> 01:13:09,062
Who are you?

708
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:12,326
My name, Mr. President, is Nikola Tarchovski.

709
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:18,429
And unless you do exactly as I say, I would be the last person you would ever see.

710
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:27,926
- Should we look at some selected attack options?  - Go to hell.

711
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:59,536
- Select attack options.  - Ted.

712
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,638


713
01:14:08,836 --> 01:14:10,158
Why didn't you tell me?

714
01:14:13,155 --> 01:14:16,036


715
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,061


716
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:21,490
But if you were with us in Russia, I would've remembered you.

717
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,176


718
01:14:23,765 --> 01:14:26,239


719
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:29,119


720
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:30,664


721
01:14:31,769 --> 01:14:34,754
Select attack targets acquired.

722
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:37,379
Tehran.

723
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,042
Mecca.

724
01:14:39,961 --> 01:14:42,819
Mecca? Tehran?

725
01:14:42,898 --> 01:14:44,585


726
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,584


727
01:14:46,902 --> 01:14:49,033


728
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:52,304


729
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:12,149


730
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,237
You knew you first came to light me.

731
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:25,213
I don't think I would be able to do it,

732
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:31,550
that I'd be able to resist the temptation to say some...

733
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:39,286
Em... you and Mike... things changed.

734
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:44,035


735
01:15:44,864 --> 01:15:49,346


736
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:56,890


737
01:15:57,681 --> 01:15:59,466


738
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:24,350
What you were seen are live pictures of Russian President Matveyev arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.

739
01:16:24,381 --> 01:16:27,287
This is astonishing. According to his doctor's,

740
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:31,631
president Matveyev's mistaken death is attributting to a temporary paralysis

741
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:34,359
from a toxin derived from spider venom.

742
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,728
Please don't shy.

743
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:48,778
I felt that I lost you there in North Korea.

744
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:52,444
I could see how moved you were by Mike when you walk through that white line. Do you?

745
01:16:53,522 --> 01:16:57,229
You are supposed to a crude knife, and fall in love with him.

746
01:16:58,339 --> 01:17:00,429
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

747
01:17:02,787 --> 01:17:04,253
By the way, how is Mike?

748
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,125
Orlov is dead.

749
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,526
That's good news.

750
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:16,830
You saved me the trouble.

751
01:17:18,611 --> 01:17:22,472
I detected him to desist on blowing your cover CIA.

752
01:17:24,575 --> 01:17:25,913
You see,

753
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:28,170
you want to come out these things in a life.

754
01:17:31,303 --> 01:17:33,137
You need someone to take the blame.

755
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,953
I'm the patsy.

756
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:40,865
And I'm the hero.

757
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:45,410
Congratulations, Ev.

758
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:49,633
You're about to become famous.

759
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:26,177
Identity confirmation requested.

760
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:41,137
Identity confirmation requested.

761
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:48,020
Identity confirmed.

762
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:04,507
Permission to launch.

763
01:20:28,284 --> 01:20:29,535
Get down on the floor, now!

764
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:31,245
I said now.

765
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:39,790
Launch sequence aborted. System restoring.

766
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,517
Show me your hands.

767
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:43,210
What is your name, sir?

768
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:45,743
I'm Ted Winter of the CIA. Help the president!

769
01:20:47,652 --> 01:20:52,414
Mr. President, can you hear me?

770
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,595
- Aid is on the way.  - Make sure you got body bags

771
01:20:57,596 --> 01:20:58,404
There are at least seven here.

772
01:20:58,405 --> 01:20:59,430
She wears bullet proof vests.

773
01:21:03,062 --> 01:21:06,871
I want her alone in the room. There are other cases out here I want to talk about.

774
01:21:07,366 --> 01:21:10,736
She won't talk, she's trained not to talk no matter what we do.

775
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,284
If we gonna find these people, we gonna find myself.

776
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,325
Somebody already did.

777
01:21:14,326 --> 01:21:18,641
At least some of them. Barge east river, 12 dead, including Orlov.

778
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,896
Who did that?

779
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,312
I don't know, forensics are on it.

780
01:21:33,214 --> 01:21:34,284
Please step back.

781
01:21:34,285 --> 01:21:36,608
Step back, sir, please, step back.

782
01:22:14,482 --> 01:22:17,381
It's Winter, it's Ted Winter, sir, you better get up here.

783
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:56,271
Sit down.

784
01:22:58,133 --> 01:23:00,744
She's yours for 15 minutes during the flight.

785
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:02,865
Then she's the FBI's.

786
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:49,104
Why did you kill him?

787
01:23:49,969 --> 01:23:51,471
Because somebody had to.

788
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:05,674
What?

789
01:24:15,998 --> 01:24:19,008
Why it takes you think that everybody is who they say they are?

790
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:22,831
You knew something was wrong when Orlov walked in.

791
01:24:22,832 --> 01:24:23,882
So did I.

792
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:25,665
We just don't know what it was.

793
01:24:26,535 --> 01:24:27,873
Winter did.

794
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,249
Winter?

795
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:34,305
You expect me to believe that Winter is gonna launch some missiles

796
01:24:34,455 --> 01:24:35,857
and you saved the world?

797
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:40,050
I would like you to believe it. Yeah.

798
01:24:42,312 --> 01:24:44,002
It's a big accusation.

799
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,150
Well...

800
01:24:47,179 --> 01:24:49,559
He is dead now, so he can't defend himself.

801
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:52,706
I guess you have to detect for yourself.

802
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:01,954
How many more like you are there?

803
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:03,708
Like me?

804
01:25:05,273 --> 01:25:06,778
None.

805
01:25:07,576 --> 01:25:08,826
Like him?

806
01:25:09,008 --> 01:25:11,152
More than you and I can handle alone.

807
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:16,490
You really think that a trained Soviet agent

808
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:20,684
couldn't kill the Russian president at point blank if she wanted to?

809
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:27,228
Or you, for that matter.

810
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:30,148
I could kill you at the funeral, and I didn't.

811
01:25:30,435 --> 01:25:32,737
You surrendered to me, because I think you know...

812
01:25:32,738 --> 01:25:34,268
You know better.

813
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:37,492
I had a choice.

814
01:25:38,659 --> 01:25:40,077
You know better.

815
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:51,616


816
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:00,999
If I did believe you...

817
01:26:01,535 --> 01:26:04,393
and I'm unsane for a second that I do, but if I did.

818
01:26:06,982 --> 01:26:08,296
Nobody else would.

819
01:26:10,175 --> 01:26:12,760
Or maybe you can think a way around that.

820
01:26:24,436 --> 01:26:26,152
They took everything from me.

821
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:29,332
I'll kill them.

822
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:53,831
Bullshit!

823
01:27:14,156 --> 01:27:15,369
Go get them.

824
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000


825
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:20,000
