1
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,920
Please, let me go home. Please,
I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,720
I am really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,440
- Please, please, I'm not a spy.
- You are a spy.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Please let me go home.

5
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,880
Try again.

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,440
I am not a spy, I am a businesswoman.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,480
I work in the sale
of petroleum and gas.

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,920
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambition.

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm not a spy. I'm not a spy.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm not a spy.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
I am not a spy. I am not a spy.

12
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,800
Keep your head down and don't
say anything until we make the the swap.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,840
In case Kim Jong here changes his mind.

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
Exchange.

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,240
I don't understand.

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,200
You don't understand what?

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,080
All the rules say to leave me, that one
life is not worth blowing operational cover.

18
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,360
You got that right.

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,520
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
We will.

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
So why did you do it?

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,240
Well...

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
I didn't do it.

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
He did.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,880
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
He petitioned the Senate...

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
State department...

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,880
We didn't need the publicity, so I
figured we better do something or

29
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,980
he's gonna invade this
God damn Republic himself.

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,560
Hey.

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,600
- Good Morning.
- Happy Anniversary.

33
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
You want me to make you breakfast?

34
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,120
How about pancakes?

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,280
You're cooking?

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,440
You're joking, you like my cooking.

37
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
Germans don't joke.

38
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,680
Bert likes my cooking.

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
Get your bugs off the table.

40
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,120
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,000
- Spiders.
- They're bugs.

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you doing this on company time?

43
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,560
It's my anniversary and
I want it to be perfect.

44
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
But...

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,480
that is not sexy.

46
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,000
No, but it is utilitarian and
utilitarian is the new sexy.

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,760
Ran the trace, first name
Usem, last name Utsa.

48
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,480
- Any verifiable hits?
- Only one.

49
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Francis, do me a favor...

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
stick it in the safe till tomorrow.

51
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
- Matahari here's got a big night tonight.
- Yes sir, Right away Sir.

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Sir?

53
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,640
Do I look like a, "Sir" to you?

54
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,440
From head to toe.

55
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm surprised he didn't
call you "Your Majesty".

56
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,920
I like the ring of that.

57
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,400
I think I prefer "Your Majesty".

58
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,440
Was I ever that young?

59
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Younger.
Walk me out.

60
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,640
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
You know, the usual.

62
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,320
The President wants to know what's
happening in Russia the day before it happens.

63
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,720
What about you?
I heard that interview went well.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,400
Hm... Fingers crossed

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Are you sure about this?

66
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,880
Once you start pushing papers,
there's no turning back.

67
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,320
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

68
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
I was homesick.

69
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
Homesick?

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Sir... Sir...

71
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
We got a walk-in...

72
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,560
- Here?
- Guess he's not buying our cover.

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
- You get his bona-fides?
- He's Russian.

75
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
He says he's FSB, but
won't give us any more.

76
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,080
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

77
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
Passable, not great.

78
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,040
- But if we got down to the subtleties of English...
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

80
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Come on Salt, no one can sort
out a nut job from the real thing faster than you.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,760
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Yeah, okay. We'll
decide when we know more.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,360
- Who called Counter-Intelligence?
- Not me.

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
- Peabody.
- Salt.

86
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,920
Please remove the hood.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
Microphones are on.

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Checking levels.

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,800
Baseline recording.

90
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Neuro-scan is up. Ready to go.

91
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Commencing audio and visual recording.

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,640
Testing ear piece.

93
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Interview has commenced at 14:42.

94
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
You're married.

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,880
A husband must be a distraction
for a female intelligence officer.

96
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,520
Well, we're here to talk about you.

97
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,960
So what is your name?

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,440
My name is Alec Vassilly Orlov.

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,200
I have cancer.

100
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm moved.

101
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,880
A defector with cancer. Are you selling secrets for
chemo or are you afraid of dying?

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:41,120
If I have gained anything by damming myself,
it is that I no longer have anything to fear.

103
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,560
- Russia is also dying.
- Alec Vassilly Orlov.

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,520
Shows up in 1993 in
Novosibirsk blast, Siberia.

105
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,360
He's on Victor Rasovsky's staff there.
He checks out as FSB.

106
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,000
The scan says he's
truthful on the cancer.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,680
Prior to '93...

108
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,040
Nothing...

109
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
He doesn't exist.

110
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,880
I have somewhere I
need to be, Mr. Orlov

111
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,360
So if you wouldn't
mind getting to the point.

112
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,880
In English please.
Others are listening.

113
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,680
1975, The Cold War.

114
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:48,000
In a gymnasium, a Soviet Olympic
wrestler named Sacha Jordorovich,

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,960
meets for the first time,

116
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,320
the only female
Chess Grandmaster of her era.

117
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,080
Within a month they were married.

118
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,080
And within a year, a child.

119
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
One month more,

120
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,360
the child was back
in the same hospital,

121
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,400
sick with fever.

122
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,920
And within days after that,
the child, suddenly was dead.

123
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
Yes,

124
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
a child was dead...

125
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
and yes,

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,800
a child was buried.

127
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,480
But the Chenkov baby was still alive.

128
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,880
And became the property of another man.

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,640
A master spy who had devised the greatest
plan a Russian patriot could ever invent...

130
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,400
A plan to destroy America.

131
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,840
It had all started with an
American named Lee Harvey Oswald.

132
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
In 1959,

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,560
he emigrated to Russia.

134
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,320
Three years later,

135
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,720
he returned home. But, the man who
came back to America, was in fact a Russian spy...

136
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
named Alec.

137
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,920
On November 22, 1963,

138
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Alec became the first
success of the new program

139
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

140
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,640
The spy master was now given
the go ahead, to create many more like Alec.

141
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,080
Scores of agents.

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
Males and females

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,400
to be substituted for Americans.

144
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,360
At an abandoned monastery,
Chenkov and other boys

145
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,360
and girls learned English long
before they learned Russian.

146
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Drilled in idiom, idiosyncrasy.

147
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400
And ideology.

148
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,360
And by methods of rigorous
physical and psychological programming.

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,240
The spy master made warriors of iron.

150
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Unquestioned and unbreakable.

151
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
You're killing me, man.

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
When does the good fairy come in?

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
Never...

154
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,160
It's a story without hope.

155
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,920
Chenkov was matched with a child
of a visiting American family.

156
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:38,040
There was an accident, the family died.
Chenkov was sent to America,

157
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,680
to live a complete lie...

158
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,360
and to patiently await the
day to attack from within, day X.

159
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,000
The long awaited mission is here.

160
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,360
Chenkov will travel to your
city to kill the President of Russia,

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:10,320
at the funeral of the
American Vice President. Chenkov is KA12.

162
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
KA12?

163
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,080
It's an urban legend.

164
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents,
inserted into American society to sabotage and assassinate.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,720
supposedly, they’d wait years to strike.
Decades even.

166
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
Hmm... Supposedly.

167
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,120
What's the matter, Ted?
You don't believe in moles?

168
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,000
I believe in moles, alright.
Just not the boogey man.

169
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
Specially if the plan is to
kill their own president.

170
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,560
This guy's selling smoke.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
Wrap it up, Eve.

172
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,640
So a Russian agent is gonna kill
the Russian president. Is that it?

173
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,680
- Hmm...
- Okay.

174
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Thank you very much

175
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,200
and what would you like in
return for that information?

176
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,280
I simply wish to help you
do what you need to do.

177
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,560
You're good.

178
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,080
KA-program is brilliant bull-shit,

179
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,160
but I'm officially off-duty,

180
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,680
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

181
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,080
- Salt.
- Yes.

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,440
The name of the
Russian agent is, Salt. Evelyn Salt.

183
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,280
My name is Evelyn Salt.

184
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
Then you are a Russian spy.

185
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
<i>Truthful.</i>

186
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,800
So far, the FMRI has registered
truthful on everything he said.

187
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,320
Ted.

188
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,000
Call Protective Services and
make sure they find my husband.

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
- Where are you going?
- I need to get to the phone.

190
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,120
No, no. Not after the neuro-scan.

191
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,200
'Cause he didn't flutter?
I can beat that thing five

192
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,200
times out of six. I am
trained to and so is he.

193
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,840
I need my phone, I need to call my husband.

194
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,520
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

195
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
There is a reason he
mentioned my wedding ring Ted.

196
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
When they blow up a spy,
they don't just blow

197
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,360
up their cover, they blow up their
whole covered life, you know that.

198
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,440
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what happened to Henry's wife?

199
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,400
- Yes, I do.
- Speak.

200
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,800
"Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks, Bye".

201
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,920
Honey, it's me.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

202
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Okay sweetheart? As soon as you get this.

203
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Godspeed, comrade Chenkov.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Someone interrogate
that piece of shit.

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

206
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,640
Look Eve, try to stay calm...

207
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm not a goddamn Russia spy.

208
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,720
I didn't say you were.

209
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Let's go up to my office
so we can sort this out.

210
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,160
No, no. We gotta go to a secure location.

211
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,780
- Now.
- Alright.

212
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,320
Doesn't get anymore secure than this.

213
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,200
Eve?

214
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,320
Five minutes.

215
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Call Protective Services and
tell them to find Mike.

216
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
This is bullshit.

217
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Give us a sec.

218
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,600
I know that we're heading into your jurisdiction here,
but I'm asking you for just 5 minutes.

219
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,320
No.

220
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,320
If I have to yes, you can't have
five minutes alone with her. I have to talk with her

221
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,080
- She's scared?
- I don't care.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,320
There's a mole in
Russia house Ted.

223
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
There's a mole in
Russia house and I am sure...

224
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,840
Please step in the elevator.

225
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,760
What the hell is that?

226
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,560
Sir.

227
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,361


228
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
Jesus Chirst.

229
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,560
- There he is again.
- No sign of him so far on the street.

230
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,920
Two minutes to go before we lock down.

231
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
We just got a match, Sir.

232
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,560
- In 1981, there's Bresnov and there...
- Orlov.

233
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,760
- That's him.
- Used to be a heavyweight once upon a time.

234
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,320
Get that photo out now. Every ticket counter

235
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,320
airport, train station and taxi
station, the whole nine yards.

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
- Get me director Medford on a secure line, now.
- Yes, Sir.

237
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,920
- Top-right screen, is that live?
- Yes sir.

238
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,640
- Where is she going?
- Track her.

239
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Rink Petroleum Security.

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,200
You have a woman to your left behind you.

241
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Evelyn Salt.

242
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,520
- We lost visual of her.
- Damn.

243
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,880
Where'd she go?

244
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Hey, Edward. Is Mike there?

245
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

246
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,600
Stairwell, second floor.

247
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,840
What's on that floor?

248
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
It's empty. Security buffer.

249
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,480
Isolate and seal it.

250
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,480
Get her records to my hand-held.

251
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

252
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,200
We got her.

253
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Alright.

254
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Get a tactical team to meet
me on the south stairwell.

255
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes, Sir.

256
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,900
- Director Medford, Sir.
- Get me a side-arm.

257
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,120
I'll call her back.

258
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,320
- Shit.
- I lost visual.

259
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,680
Where is she Albert. Talk to me.

260
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
Come on.

261
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,280
North hallway.

262
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,640
There, interrogation room. Bring it up.

263
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,640


264
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,640
- Have you found him?
- What the hell are you doing Eve?

265
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,640
This don't look good.

266
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
There's a tac team coming
at you in 30 seconds. Get your goddamn

267
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,360
panties off the camera. Get where we
can see you. So you don't get hurt.

268
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,720
Have you found my husband?

269
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,400
These boys don't fool around, Eve.

270
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,000
- Please, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
- Call me when you find Mike.

271
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
Okay, open the doors, about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.

272
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Is that absolutely necessary?

273
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,040
Want, do you want me to shoot her?

274
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
Get a medical team in place now.

275
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,120
Okay, on my count.

276
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,120
3, 2, 1...

277
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,900
Go.

278
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
Jesus Christ.

279
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
Where is she?

280
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,480
Come on, guys. Find her, now.

281
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
There. Bring that up.

282
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
Stay with her. She's crossing the street.

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
Pan the god-damned camera.

284
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
Back that up and zoom in.

285
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,760
Freeze.

286
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,320
What the hell are you doing, Eve?

287
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,560
Michael Krauss left his office an hour ago.

288
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,320
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

289
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

290
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,240
She will if she's serious about Mike.

291
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
This stays in the house, okay?

292
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Taxi.

293
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,400
Hugh's street. I'll tell you where to stop.

294
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,480
"Hi, this is Mike. Please
leave a message after the tone".

295
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,960
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Eve.

296
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,760
And as such, enjoys pretty much unrestricted
access to the borders of North Korea.

297
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,960
So,

298
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,920
brush up on your
bugs and get to know him.

299
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,800
He's the perfect cover to get us inside.

300
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,600
Mike?

301
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Mike?

302
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
Honey?

303
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,880
Hey baby. Come here.

304
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
It's alright.

305
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
It's okay. Where's daddy?

306
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,520
Where's daddy?

307
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
Go! Go!

308
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Bathroom, clear.

309
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,680
Kitchen, clear.

310
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,160
Office, clear.

311
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Living room, clear.

312
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,640
Everybody out in 60 seconds.

313
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,600
What are you doing?

314
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,000
She's not here and no sign
of the husband either.

315
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,360
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe that Russian was lying?

316
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,440
I don't know, cause you
were gonna lock her up.

317
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,361
Why'd she run?

318
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,280
See it from her perspective.
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.

319
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,120
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

320
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,440
"Maybe", is your department.
Mine is catching her, so we can find out.

321
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,880
We bring her in, or we bring her down.

322
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,934
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

323
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:28,711
What she's done for this country.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

324
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,266
Should it?

325
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,266
- Is your mom home?
- No.

326
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,060
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

327
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,129
- Can you baby-sit Bert for me?
- Yeah.

328
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,116
Here's some money for the food.

329
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:46,718
Did you do your homework?

330
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,892
Yeah, Math.

331
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:51,939
I hate math.

332
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:04,608
Hi.

333
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:05,836
It's nice to see you again.

334
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,800
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

335
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,400
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

336
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
And you?

337
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,560
No, I'm working here at the museum.

338
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm an arachnologist.

339
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,600
A what?

340
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,440
I hunt spiders.

341
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
I got her.

342
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
She's heading north
toward the metro-station.

343
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,940
Eve..?

344
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,240
She's east-bound in the mall.

345
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
There she is.

346
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,840
All teams south-bound toward the bridge.

347
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Box her in.

348
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Stop!

349
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,880
Stop!

350
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,880
Fuck!

351
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,120
Take it back. Hold your fire.

352
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Stop!

353
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,080
Salt!

354
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,560
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, I'm innocent.

355
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
On the ground, now.

356
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,760
Just don't shoot.

357
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,360
Salt, on the ground.

358
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,480
- I have to find my husband
- why'd you run?

359
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,400
- To find my husband
- For what reason?

360
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Don't shoot.

361
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,080
- Stay back.
- Last chance.

362
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm innocent,
somebody is setting me up.

363
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,580
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the god-damn gun down.

364
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,200
- Give yourself up, now!
- No.

365
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,040
On the ground.

366
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,960
We'll sort this out, I promise.

367
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,920
We gotta bring you in Salt.

368
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,440
Someone is gonna try to kill
the Russian president, you know that.

369
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,680
Do something about that.

370
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,520
- Give yourself up.
- That's what you should be worried about.

371
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
There's nowhere to run.

372
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,720
I didn't do anything.

373
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,240
She's on a blue semi,
route one, heading north.

374
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,240
Get a roadblock in place now.

375
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,720
There she is. On the tanker.

376
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
Stop! Stop!

377
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,840
Ev..!

378
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,560
- You, my friend, have got a mole in your group.
- We don't know that yet.

379
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,040
Actually, she's a
trained god damned liar.

380
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,040
Everything she's done up
until now, is to protect her cover.

381
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,840
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it.

382
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,560
Get off on the shoulder!
Get off on the shoulder!

383
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,980
Okay, take it down.

384
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,280
Shit.

385
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,480
Shit.

386
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,040
Okay.

387
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,760
Ted, I know you're her friend,

388
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,160
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

389
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,960
We gotta do it now.

390
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,680
I'll notify the
Secret Service on the details.

391
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,940
Tell 'em Salt might be coming their way.

392
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,360
Here she is.

393
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,560
Orlov may not be far behind either.

394
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,940
You see this?

395
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,280
Salt spent time in Russia
when she was a kid.

396
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,720
She was in the car accident with
her parents in '88, they both died.

397
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,360
They were teachers at the U.S Embassy
for the American children of the staff there.

398
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,400
That's why we put her on
Russia in the first place.

399
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,580
We need to get on a plan
to New York. Tonight.

400
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,520


401
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:21,720


402
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,880
Evelyn.

403
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
Look at me.

404
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,120
If there was a way, I would kill them.

405
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,000
- You shouldn't have come here
- What do you mean? I don't understand.

406
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
Now they know who you are.

407
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,080
Who?

408
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,640
Evelyn.

409
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,280
Who?

410
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,840
I would accept anything about you,
but I need to know.

411
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,600
Look at me. Look at me.

412
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,200
Just tell me, okay?

413
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,440
Just tell me.

414
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,720
I work...

415
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,320
I work for the CIA.

416
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,960
You see, this...?

417
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,200
There is no future for us.

418
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,160
You're not safe with me.

419
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,880
I don't want to be safe.

420
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,120
I know you...

421
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
and I want to be with you.

422
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,480
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

423
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,600
Okay?

424
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Okay.

425
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,760
Welcome to New York
Ms. Hernandez. One night?

426
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,240
- A deluxe room.
- Yeah.

427
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,680
- Ms. Hernandez, do you need any help with your luggage?
- No, I got it. Thanks.

428
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,800
<i>A full day here in New York City.</i>

429
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,160
<i>The funeral of Vice-President Maxwell Oates.</i>

430
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,000
<i>A former five term
U.S Senator and Cold War warrior.</i>

431
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>He's based legacy may be as architect of
the new era of Russian, American relations.</i>

432
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,080
<i>Russian President Boris Matveyev has
joined from Moscow to be an</i>

433
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,880
<i>honorary forbearer of the man who's
called, "his greatest friend in the West".</i>

434
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,120
What's the security perimeter?

435
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,280
We're too deep inside and we
own this entire block.

436
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,880
And those are secret service agents.

437
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,960
Not CIA. So, relax.

438
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,000
That's real funny.

439
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,440
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

440
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,920
Step back! Step back!
Everybody, move away.

441
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,360
Mr. President.

442
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,360
Please be seated.

443
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,360
After the President finishes
the chorus and the eulogy...

444
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,280
If she's gonna try anything here,
it'll have to be pretty amazing.

445
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,800
<i>I knew he would bring more to
the job than just his years of experience.</i>

446
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,400
<i>As Vice-President...</i>

447
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,240
<i>he showed the world best, of what
it is to be an American.</i>

448
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,560
<i>And today, the world says,
"Goodbye" to a great man</i>

449
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,560
- I'll take the back.
- Lower floor, clear.

450
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,560
We got two, M.I.A's.

451
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm heading down to the crypt, some
kind of trouble down there.

452
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,320
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

453
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,520
All teams converge in the crypt.
I repeat, converge in the crypt.

454
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,360
<i>He made all the difference and for that,
he will always have my respect and admiration.</i>

455
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,880
Matveyev!
Get god-damn Matveyev!

456
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,880
Drop it.

457
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,600
Drop it.

458
00:48:47,497 --> 00:48:48,336
Shooters at twelve o'clock.

459
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,406
Don't move.

460
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:56,694
Take her down! Take her down!

461
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,378
Check for other weapons

462
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,677
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

463
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:01,606
I can't feel a pulse.

464
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,920
Why?

465
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,280
Do you have any idea how
much blood is on your hands?

466
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,980
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.
I'm gonna see to it personally. A god-damn hole.

467
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,920
Back off! Back off!
Let's go!

468
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,600
Matveyev was declared
dead en route to the hospital.

469
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,040
Jesus Christ.

470
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
Yeah.

471
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,080
You were right about her.

472
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
She had the drop on me, Ted.

473
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,040
Why didn't she shoot?

474
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,200
Cops down, cops down.

475
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,400
<i>Get out of the car with
your hands on your head.</i>

476
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,760
Hands in the air.

477
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,440
- What is your name?
- My name is Evelyn Salt.

478
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,120
- What college will you attend?
- Princeton University.

479
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,360
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.

480
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,080
Who will you trust?

481
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,400
No one.

482
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,880
Be very patient.

483
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
Remember your training.

484
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,880
Remember, you're not the only one.

485
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,480
There are many others...

486
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,160
- all of you waiting to strike.
- Yes.

487
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:35,360
- And we will strike... together.
- Yes.

488
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Wait.

489
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,080
One day I will come for all of you.

490
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,520
Hello Evelyn...

491
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,960
I'm Martin Crenshaw, from the U.S. Embassy.

492
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,400
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

493
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,400
Rioters outside the U.S embassy,
sheared their new leaders word in taking...

494
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,400
strong action against what they are calling,
"A state sponsored act of terrorism."

495
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,800
on this part of the U.S.

496
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,800
These rioters are starting similar outbreaks of
anti-American protests across Russia.

497
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,800
"We will strike back", say's
the new Russian president.

498
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,760
Angrily condemning today’s assassination,
by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.

499
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,360
Even as the body of slain
President Matveyev is on it's way back to Moscow,

500
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,360
anti-American riots have
erupted across Russia.

501
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,160
With bombings of U.S diplomats in Moscow.

502
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,080
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

503
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,040
Responding to a rapid escalating crisis.

504
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,800
President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting.

505
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,920
Greetings, comrade Orlov.

506
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,640
When I saw you in Washington
I almost was in tears.

507
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,920
You were not supposed to get married.

508
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,520
Not unless it cut a
great tactical advantage.

509
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,080
I did it to seem normal.

510
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,360
When you escaped today, I felt
not even I could have hoped for so much.

511
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,200
You are my greatest creation.

512
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,720
You trained me well.

513
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,280
My husband? You have him?

514
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,460
I had to be certain.

515
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,560
But now you trust me.

516
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,240
Completely.

517
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,000
So, tell me what's next.

518
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,640
Next, part 2.

519
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,920
We seize control of this
country's atomic weapons.

520
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,760
How?

521
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,320
You won't hear from me again.

522
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,600
My daughter.

523
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,020
Chenkov?

524
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,880
You remember me?

525
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,880
Chenkov.

526
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,400
Did you miss me?

527
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,560
Shnaider?

528
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,800
How long have you been here?

529
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,400
I left Russia one year
after you, to Prague.

530
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:13,760
I have been a NATO-liaison to the
White House for three years. Colonel Edward Tomasz.

531
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,680
And you...

532
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,160
are my attache. Your ID.

533
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,160
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

534
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,880
More importantly, our mission.

535
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,760
The bunker, eight stories
below the White House

536
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,160
That's where the President needs to be.

537
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,120
How do we do it?

538
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,320
Don't worry, he will be there.
That's my job,

539
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,560
to make sure he's there.

540
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,200
And what's my job?

541
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,760
Do you remember Chenkov, when we were young?

542
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,320
and you had to finish first in everything.

543
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,200
You had to be the best at everything.

544
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Even though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane you had to finish first.

545
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,200
I remember...

546
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,480
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.

547
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,880
Tonight you will kill America's President.

548
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,320
ID's please.

549
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,440
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

550
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,760
Confirm this, A
Colonel Tomasz and a Major Egypt.

551
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,000
Colonel, Major... All clear.

552
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,000
You know the drill Colonel.

553
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,800
A shrapnel. A Serbian land-mine. They spend
more time looking at it than the doctor did.

554
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,680
Step though please, Sir.

555
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,320
Turn around.

556
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,120
Thank you.

557
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,520
Patience is key, I've been coming here
for two years. Others have been here longer.

558
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,880
- What others?
- I don't know.

559
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,320
But you were the best of us.
And I was the least.

560
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,240
There must be others here
to finish what we begin.

561
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:44,240
Tomasz, nice to see you again. Pleasure.
You have exactly two minutes before the main meal.

562
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,600
Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt...

563
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,360
what can you tell us about her?

564
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,480
We think she may be a Soviet plant.

565
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,080
Inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB

566
01:04:55,082 --> 01:04:56,880
called "Day X".

567
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,280
A day that would mark the start of a
large-scale strike against the U.S and her allies.

568
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,040
That should be the President now.

569
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,440
You have a big job Chenkov, but you can do it.

570
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,280
- You still haven't told me what your job is.
- Home.

571
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,520
I'm going home.

572
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,720
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

573
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,720
- It's a god-damn attack.
- Geronimo, it's SOP. Downward mobile.

574
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,960
I think I saw her.

575
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,160
Saw who?

576
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,480
Salt.

577
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,960
I think I saw her in the corridor.

578
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,080
The other new officer.

579
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
She's here.

580
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,800
- Check.
- Clear. Move.

581
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,520
Go.

582
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,240
We may have a visual on the
second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

583
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,240
Evelyn Salt on the premises.
Maybe dressed as a NATO officer.

584
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,760
<i>This is not a drill.
We are under attack.</i>

585
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,780
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

586
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,720
I need this hallway
cleared to the left, now!

587
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,920
This is Jenkins. I need the
P.R bunker up and running.

588
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:59,240
If this was authorized by the
Russian Government, it is an act of war

589
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,920
and we will respond.

590
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,920
Let's go, Sir.

591
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,680
Move, move.

592
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,680
Close it!
Close it!

593
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Go!
Go!

594
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,720
Geronimo approaching. Close
the door in five seconds.

595
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,200
Clear.

596
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,800
- Any chance she could follow?
- My own men couldn't get through that door once it's closed.

597
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,640
Yeah, well.

598
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,400
Unfortunately, she isn't one of your's.

599
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,880
Okay, go.

600
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,680
Stay close. Shut the seal.

601
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,680
Geronimo is secured.

602
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,600
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, Sir.

603
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,400
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility,

604
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,400
that today, right now, could
be the start of "Day X".

605
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,760
Mr. President, director Medford is up.

606
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,080
Mary-Anne, what is the situation?

607
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,640
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

608
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,560
What you see there, represents temperature
drops in mobile missile units in Siberia.

609
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,040
It means that the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

610
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,720
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr President.

611
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,040
Mr President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

612
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,720
At least on a forward basis.

613
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,820
Do it.

614
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,320
And since the Russians are deploying,
we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

615
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,320
It's not on a table,
it's not a deterrent.

616
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,120
Sir?

617
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,120
The outer door is jammed
and non-responsive.

618
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,200
We just lost the feed from
most of our security camera's.

619
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,880
We are blind down here and
no one can enter this facility.

620
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,320
Command, our eyes are down both ways and
we have a POC security door malfunction.

621
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,000
Get out there, now.

622
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,960
Seal this room.

623
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,360
Down that corridor, secure it.

624
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,200
This is President Howard Lewis,
proceed with authentication.

625
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,440
Yes, Mr President.

626
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,000
Ready to commence authentication, sir.

627
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,000
Zulu, Tango, Echo.
Seven, nine, Juliet.

628
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,000
X-ray, Sierra, seven,
Alpha, Mike, Charlie.

629
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,000
Whiskey, Five, Six, Tango.

630
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,680
Authentication is confirmed.

631
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,160
It's all yours now, Mr President.

632
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,920
God be with you.

633
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,160
Attack options and targeting are
under your control, Mr President.

634
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,840
- Is the camera outside this door working?
- Yes.

635
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,440
Put it up.

636
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,440
Officer, what is your status?

637
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,440
Officer, come in.

638
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,840
Who the hell is that?

639
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,160
That's her.
That's Evelyn Salt.

640
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,800
Give me your side-arm,
I'm qualified on it.

641
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:43,000
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
fire-arms in the Presidents facility.

642
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,000
Screw Protocol James.
we got an enemy agent out there.

643
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Protocol is protocol, Sir.

644
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,960
And dead, is dead.

645
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,840
I'm the National Security Advisor.

646
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,960
Not anymore.

647
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,080
Sit down.

648
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,360
Who are you?

649
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,840
My name, Mr President,
is Nicolai Tchaikovsky.

650
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,920
Unless you do exactly as I say,
I will be the last person you will ever see.

651
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
Let's have a look
at some attack options.

652
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,200
Go to hell.

653
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,480
Ted?

654
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,240
Why didn't you tell me?

655
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,720
But you weren't with us in Russia,
I would've remembered.

656
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,360
<i>Selected attack targets acquired.</i>

657
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,020
Tehran. Mecca.

658
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,200
Mecca... Tehran...

659
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,360
Missiles arming.

660
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,600
Nuclear command.

661
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,750
You know, when we first came to Langley...

662
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,760
I didn't think
I'll be able to do it,

663
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,760
to resist the
temptation to say something.

664
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:36,960
And you met Mike and well...

665
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:39,960
things changed.

666
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,160
<i>"The Russian president is alive"</i>

667
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,400
What you are seeing are live pictures
of Russian President Matveyev,

668
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,400
arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.

669
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,320
This is astonishing.
According to his doctors...

670
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,280
President Matveyev's mistaken
death was attributed

671
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,280
to a temporary paralysis from
a toxin derived from spider venom.

672
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,280
At least I was right.

673
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,560
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

674
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,550
I could see how moved you were with
Mike's little white knight routine.

675
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,280
You were supposed to recruit
the man, not fall in love with him.

676
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,080
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

677
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,640
By the way how is Mike?

678
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,600
Orlov is dead.

679
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,040
Oh, that's good news.

680
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,280
Saves me the trouble.

681
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,980
I detect if you twist his arm, you get
to blow your cover to the CIA.

682
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,960
You see? He wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

683
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,760
You needed somebody
to take the blame.

684
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,320
I'm the bad guy.

685
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,000
And I'm the hero.

686
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Congratulations, Ev'.

687
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,640
You're about to become famous.

688

Get on the floor now.

694
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,160
I said now!

695
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,120
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

696
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,960
What is your name sir?

697
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,360
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the President

698
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:52,800
Mr President, Mr President,
can you hear me?

699
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,600
I want her alone in a room. If there are
other KA's out there, I want her to talk.

700
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,280
She's trained not to talk,
no matter what we do to her.

701
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,960
If we're gonna find these people
must find them ourselves.

702
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,040
Somebody already did.

703
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,640
At least some of them, in the
East River. 12 dead, including Orlov.

704
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,480
Who did that?

705
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,120
I don't know. Forensics are on it.

706
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,840
Step back sir, please.

707
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,560
Please step back.

708
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,840
She attacked Winter sir.
You'd better get up here.

709
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,200
Sit down.

710
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,400
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

711
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,400
Then she's the FBI's.

712
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
Hey?

713
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,720
Why'd you kill him?

714
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,240
Because somebody had to.

715
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,160
What?

716
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,960
By this I take it, you think
everybody’s who they say they are.

717
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,160
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

718
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,280
So did I.

719
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,960
We just didn't know what it was.

720
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,560
Winter did.

721
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,500
Winter?

722
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,600
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles and you saved the world?

723
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,440
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

724
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,440
It's a big accusation.

725
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,480
Wow.

726
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,480
He's dead now so he
can't defend himself.

727
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,560
I guess you'll just have
to decide for yourself.

728
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,020
How many more like you are there?

729
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,360
Like me?

730
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,400
None.

731
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,200
Like him?

732
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,600
More than you or I can handle alone.

733
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,480
Do you really think, a trained
Soviet agent couldn’t kill

734
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,480
the Russian President at point
blank range if she wanted to?

735
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,840
Or you, for that matter.

736
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,520
I could've killed you at
the funeral and I didn't.

737
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,760
You surrendered to me because
I gave you no choice.

738
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,080
You know better.

739
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,960
I had a choice.

740
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,520
You know better.

741
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,180
If I did believe you and I'm not
saying for a second that I do,

742
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,280
but if I did...

743
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,920
nobody else would.

744
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,360
Well, maybe you can think
of a way around that.

745
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,920
They took everything from me.

746
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,000
I'll kill them.

747
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,160
Bullshit!

748
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,160
We're approaching. Heading due south.

749
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,400
Go get 'em.

750
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,400
Salt!

751
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,400
Circle back!
Circle back!
