SALT: Please let me go home. Please, I'm not who you think I am.

对我社会主义国家采取的敌对行为

24
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,790
压低头,交换前别说一句话
Keep your head down. Don't say anything till we make the swap.

25
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,920
以防金正日改变心意

交换

我不懂

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,030
你不懂什么?
You don't understand what?.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,410
所有指示都说要丢下我
All the rules say to leave me, that one life

32
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,540
不值得为一个人暴露组织行动
is not worth blowing operational cover.

33
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,000
你没搞错
You got that right.

34
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,370
必要时,我们会为大我牺牲小我
If we have to lose someone for the greater good, we will.

35
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,710

36
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,500
我没救你

是他

38
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,180
他一发现你下落,就拼命设法救你
Once he found out where you were, there was no stopping him.

39
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,180
他向国会议员、国务院请愿
He petitioned the Senate, the State Department.

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,060
我们不要媒体注目,所以我们想
We didn't need the publicity so I figured we better do something

41
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,900
再不设法,他会自己进攻这个烂国家
or he's gonna invade this goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040

开玩笑,你很爱吃我做的
You're joking. You like my cooking.

德国人不开玩笑的

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,410
把你的虫收起来
Get your bugs off the table.

55
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,500
- 这是蜘蛛 - 蜘蛛就是虫
They're spiders. They're bugs.

56

这是蜘蛛
MlKE: They're spiders.

蜘蛛就是虫
SALT: They're bugs.

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,630
把下层向前两个一样折回来
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]: Fold the next layer back as you did the two before it.

59
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,840

将两端向后折

在三分之一的地方重复

62
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,190
检查是否对称,再仔细折妥
Check for symmetry and press the fold down well.

63
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,820
你上班时间搞这个?

今天是我结婚纪念日

我要一切完美
And I want it to be perfect.

66
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,780
不过
But

67
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
这并不性感
that is not sexy.

68
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,620
对,不过这很实用
No, but it is utilitarin.

69
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,210
这年头实用就代表性感
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

Any verifiable hits? One.

72
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,050
法兰西斯,帮个忙
Hey, Francis, do me a favor

73
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,510
把报告锁好,明天再说
and stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

74
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,050
这位女神今晚有大事要办
Mata Hari here's got a big night tonight.

75
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,720
是,长官,马上办

76
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,050
长官?
WlNTER: "Sir""?.

77
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,510
我的样子有那么专横吗?
Do I look like a '"sir"' to you?

78
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,390
官架子十足
From head to toe.

79
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,890
我很惊讶他没叫你"陛下"
I'm surprised he didn't call you ""Your Majesty."'

80

我想我喜欢人家叫我"陛下"
I think I'd prefer "'Your Majesty.""

82
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
我以前也这么嫩吗?
Was I ever that young?

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
比他更嫩
Younger.

84
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,990
陪我出去
Walk me out.

85
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,410
总统办公室的简报如何?
SALT: How did the Oval Office briefing go?

86
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,370
你知道的,跟往常一样
Oh, you know. The usual.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,170
总统想知道俄罗斯事件的详情
President wants to know what's happening in Russia

88
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,180
你呢?听说面谈很顺利

89
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,550
老天保佑
Fingers crossed.

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
你确定要换位子?
You sure about this?

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,180
一旦去做行政人员就不能回头了
You know, once you start pushing paper, there's no turning back.

92
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,180
我上次出任务时有个超怪的感觉
I had the strangest feeling when I was out last time.

93
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,350
我得了思乡病
I was homesick.

94
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,060
思乡病?不能吃药解决吗?
WlNTER: Homesick?

95
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,680
长官!长官!
Can't you take something for that?. Sir!. Sir!.

96
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,900
有卧底来自首,十分钟前

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,690
我猜他不相信我们的伪装
I guess he's not buying our cover.

99
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
查过背景了?
Did you get his bona fides?. He's Russian.

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,990
俄罗斯人,只宣称是前国安局探员
He says he's FSB but won't give us any more.

101
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,450
他很怪
He's a strange guy.

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,620
他英文如何?
How's his English?

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,450
还可以
Passable. Not great.

104
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,200
但是没办法很清楚的表达
But if it got down to the subtleties of English nuance...

105
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,620
泰德,麦克在家等我

对,我也要赶飞机

PEABODY: Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide when we know more.

是谁找反情报组的?
Who called Counterintelligence? Not me.

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,650
不是我

128
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
对于一个女特务来说
A husband must be a distraction

129
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,880
丈夫是个绊脚石

130
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,220
我们要谈的是你

138
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,200
还是你只是怕死?
or are you afraid of dying?

139
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,580
要说我的行动会得到什么报应
If I have gained anything by damning myself,

140
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,830
就是我不再恐惧

Go!. Go!.

421
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,140
卧房,没问题
MAN 2: Bedroom, clear!.

422
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,310
厨房没问题
WOMAN: Kitchen is clear.

办公间,没问题
MAN 3: Office, clear!.

424
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,070
起居室,没问题

425
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,470
全体撤离,六十秒
MAN 5: Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

426
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,160
[MOUTHING] 过来.
[MOUTHING] Come here.

427
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,630
你干嘛?
What are you doing?

428
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,630
她不在这里,她丈夫也不在
She's not here. No sign of the husband either.

429
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,880
你想过也许是那个俄国佬瞎掰吗?
WlNTER: Did it ever occur to you that that Russian was lying?

430
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
她为什么要跑?
PEABODY: Why'd she run? WlNTER: I don"t know.

431
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,180
不知,因为你要关她?
Because you were gonna lock her up?

432
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
从她的观点来
See it from her perspective.

433
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,220
也许她丈夫真的有危险
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.

434
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,510
也许,莎特并没有问题
Maybe, God forbid, Salt is who she says she is.

435
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,180
你的部门就负责猜
""Maybe"" is your department.

436
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,560
我得负责抓她找出真相
Mine is catching her so we can find out.

437
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,900
任务明确,不能活逮就处决
Protocol is clear. We bring her in or we bring her down.

438
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,900
你知道这女的是谁吗?
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

439
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,990
她为国奉献,对你毫无意义?
What she"s done for this country? Does that mean anything to you?.

440
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,860
应该要有吗?
Should it?

441
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,830
- 你妈在家吗? - 不在
Is your mom home? No.

442
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,580
- 不在?帮我一个忙吧? - 好
No?. Can you do me a favor? Yeah.

443
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,910
你能帮我照顾波特吗?
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?.

444
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,250
- 可以 - 可以?
Oh, yeah. Yeah?.

445
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,250
这里有钱可以买狗食
Here's some money for food.

446
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,050
波特
Hi, Burt.

447
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,920
你在写作业?
What you doing?. You doing homework?

448
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,220
对,数学
Yeah, math.

449
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,090
代数
Algebra.

450
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
我讨厌数学
I hate math.

451
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,940
高兴再见到你
MlKE: Hi. Nice to see you again.

452
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,150
你跟我说话?
You talking to me?

453
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,740
对,我之前在这里看过你
Yeah, I've seen you here before.

454
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,160
是啊,我常来这里
Yeah, l-- Yeah, I come here a lot.

455
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,780
你呢?
You?

456
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,580
我在这里工作在博物馆
Oh, l"m working here.At the museum.

457
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,000
我是节足动物学家
I'm an arachnologist.

458
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,370
什么?
A what?

459
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,790
我追踪蜘蛛
A spider hunter.

460
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,210
你就像一只蜘蛛
You look like one.

461
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,300
世界上有四万种蜘蛛
MlKE: There are 40,000 species of spiders in the world.

462
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,020
那只是我的
And that one is mine.

463
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,230
你发现的
You discovered it.

464
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,640
在北朝鲜境内
Inside North Korea.

465
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,320
我取名为彼得贝斯提
I named it Terrijoolsima peterbesti.

466
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,570
你懂吗?
Do you get that?

467
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,610
不懂,我该懂吗?
No. Should I?

468
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,450
彼得贝斯提是我以彼得贝斯特命的名
Peterbesti? I named it after Pete Best.

469
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,160
他是林哥之前的第一鼓手
The first drummer before Ringo.

470
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,500
贝斯特过去在甲壳虫乐队中从来就没有名气
Best never was a famous Beatle,

471
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,340
不过现在他是有名的蜘蛛了
but now he's a famous spider.

472
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,030
找到她了
I got her.

473
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,900
她往北跑向地铁车站
She's heading north towards the Metro station.

474
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,570
伊芙!
Ev!.

475
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,020
伊芙!
WlNTER: Ev!.

476
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,360
她往东走了,在购物广场里
She's eastbound, in the Penn Quarter Mall.

477
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,030
抱歉
Excuse me.

478
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,880
正赶往现场
MAN [OVER RADlO]: Will do. Headed there noW.

她往南方桥头走去,包围她

莎特!别动!

483
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
紧盯着她
Coming up behind you!

484
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,650
在你后面
MAN 2: Keep her in your sights!.

485
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
该死!
Fuck!

486
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,240
退开!不要开枪!
Keep back!. Hold your fire!.

487
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
莎特!
Salt!

488
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,290

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
- 趴在地上 - 不要
On the ground. Now! Please don't. No!

493
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,640
趴下!莎特!趴在地上!
PEABODY: Down! Salt! Do it now! On the ground!

494
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,930
- 我要找我丈夫 - 你为什么要跑?
I have to find my husband.

495
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,760
我要找我丈夫
PEABODY: Why'd you run? To find my husband!

496
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,810
- 那不是理由 - 拜托,别开枪
PEABODY: That"s not a reason. SALT: Don't shoot.

497
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,190
- 退开! - 最后机会
Stay back!. PEABODY: Last chance.

498
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,820
我是无辜的,有人陷害我
I'm innocent. Somebody is setting me up!

499
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,150
- 别逼我对你开枪,莎特 - 把枪放下
Don't make me put you down. Put the gun down!

500
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,650
- 投降吧! - 拜托
PEABODY: Give yourself up! WlNTER: Come on, Ev.

501
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,990
照他说的做,我保证会查明事实
Do what he says. We'll sort this out, I promise.

502
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,700
我要逮捕你
I gotta bring you in,

503
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,620
结束了,脸朝下
Salt. It's over. Face down.

504
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,450
有人要暗杀俄国总统,你很清楚
Somebody's going to try to kill the Russian president.

505
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,330
快设法阻止!那才是你该担心的
Do something about that! That's what you should worry about.

506
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,670
你无处可跑了,投降吧
PEABODY: There's nowhere to run! Quit now!.

507
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,090
不,我什么都没做
No, I didn't do anything.

508
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,340
- 伊芙! - 不!
WlNTER: Get back! No!

509
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,220
她上了蓝色拖车,一号公路往北
She's on a blue semi. Route 1, heading north.

510
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,890
立刻设下路障
Get a roadblock in place now.

511
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,820
首府警方戒备中
WOMAN [OVER RADlO]: Metro Police on alert.

512
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,910
她在那里,在油罐车上
There she is. On the tanker.

513
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
停!停!
Stop. Stop!.

514
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,590
伊芙!
Ev!.

515
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,400
朋友,你的部门有内奸
You, my friend, have got a mole in your group.

516
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,070
这还不一定
We don't know that yet.

517
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,110
我认为她是训练有素的说谎高手
I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

518
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,610
她说过的一切都是为了掩饰身份
and everything she's said has been to protect her cover.

519
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,490
你干脆说清楚你的感觉吧
Well, why don"t you tell me how you really feel about it?

520
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,710
走路肩、走路肩
Get up on the shoulder!. Get up on the shoulder!.

521
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
好,开下去
Okay, take it down.

522
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
该死!
Shit!

523
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,000
该死!
Shit!

524
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
好吧
Okay.

525
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,670
泰德,我知道你是她朋友
Ted, I know you're her friend,

526
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,930
不过我们要在纽约布下天罗地网
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

527
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,590
就得立刻开始动手
We gotta do it now. MAN: Let's go!

528
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,430
通知负责俄国总统安全的特勤队
Notify the Secret Service on Matveyev's detail.

529
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,440
告诉他们,莎特可能会出现
Tell them Salt might be coming their way.

530
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
如果她要动手
And if she is,

531
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,610
奥洛夫也会在附近
Orlov may not be far behind either.

532
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,240
(伊芙在父母死亡车祸时受伤)

533
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,410
看过这个了?
PEABODY: You seen this?

534
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,240
莎特小时候在俄国待过一阵子
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

535
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,540
她和父母在88年发生车祸
She was in a car accident with her parents in '88.

536
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
父母都死了
They both died.

537
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,580
他们是美国大使馆聘用的老师
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy for the American children of the staff.

538
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
所以我们一开始就让她去俄罗斯
That's why we put her on Russia in the first place.

539
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,470
我们今晚要搭上去纽约的飞机
We need to get on a plane to New York, tonight.

540
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,020
把奥洛夫的资料传给纽约警方
Send everything we've got on Orlov to N.Y.P.D.

541
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,450
在纽约市
MAN [ON RADlO]: And here in New York City,

542
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,200
安全警戒全面升高

543
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,780

544
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,790
以迎接副总统麦威欧兹的告别式

545
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,460
预定明天抵达圣巴托罗缪教堂

546
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,790
参加此庄严仪式的高官显要中
BartholomeW's Church

547
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,290
有俄罗斯总统马特维耶夫

548
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,960
已于今晚稍早抵达市中心
who arrived here in Manhattan earlier this evening.

549
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,340
由于地铁关闭,大众运输系统
Public transportation will experience delays,

550
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,840
将会有所延迟
with subway closures and...

551
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,970
伊芙
Evelyn.

552
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,770
看着我
Look at me.

553
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,600
如果有办法,我会杀了他们
If there was a way, I would kill them.

554
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,610
你不该来这里的
You shouldn't have come here.

555
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,820
这话什么意思?我不
What do you mean? I don't understand.

556
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,950
现在他们知道你了
Now they know who you are.

557
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
谁?
Who?.

558
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,790
伊芙

泰德,你的探员莎特
Now, Ted, your Russian Cl agent, Salt.

对于她,你有什么情报?
What can you tell us about her?.

870
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,320
我们认为她可能是俄罗斯密探
We think she may be a Soviet plant,

871
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,120
数年前被安插进来

872
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,580
为KGB的某个"毁灭日"做准备

873
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,200
那一天,要开启大规模攻击

对付美国与其盟邦

这应该是总统了

876

你有个艰巨的任务,宣科夫

885
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,090
- 你没事吧 - 没事
Are you okay, sir? Yes.

886
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,760
- 该死 - 依照程序,酋长前往地下碉堡

救命!这里!

888
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,230
快叫医护人员

889
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:50,530
我想我看到她了

890
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,070
你看到谁?

我想我在走廊上看到她了

我们看见第二位攻击者伊芙
We may have a visual on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

900
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,100
一身北约军官打扮

901
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,520
这不是演习
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: This is not a drill.

902

白宫正遭受攻击

我要确保这条走廊安全无虞

中心,请求启动地下碉堡
Command, this is Jenks. I need the PEOC bunker up and running.

908
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,240
这若是俄罗斯政府授权的行动
If this was authorized by the Russian government,

909
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,960
这就是战争行为,我们会复仇

910
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,750

01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,530
酋长五秒内抵达碉堡门口

01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,330
她会跟来吗?
WlNTER: Any chance she could follow?.

924
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,540
门一关上,连我的人都进不来
My own men couldn't get through that door.

925
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,840
是啊,可惜她不是你的人

926
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,050

927
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:23,890
等门关好再走
Stay until it"s shut and sealed.

928
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:29,230
酋长安全
Geronimo secured.

929
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,050
帮我接梅孚局长
LEWlS: Get me Director Medford.

930
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,260
是,长官
WOMAN: Yes, sir.

931
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,430
我想我们该严重考虑
WlNTER: Sir, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility

932
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,520
今天,现在,就是毁灭日的开始
that today, right now, could be the start of Day X.

933
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,770
总统先生,局长上线了
Mr. President, Director Medford is up.

934
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,270
局长,情况如何?
Marion, what's the situation?

935
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:15,770
资料应该正显示在您的屏幕上
It should be coming up on one of your screens.

936
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:19,570
这里显示西伯利亚的移动飞弹
What you see there represents temperature drops

937
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,070
温度下降
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

938
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:25,620
这表示俄罗斯正在部署飞弹
It means the Russians are deploying their missiles to the field.

939
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,580
地面人员己确认此事,总统先生
And that's been confirmed on the ground, Mr. President.

940
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:34,130
我强烈建议提升战备到二级状态
M r. President, I strongly recommend we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

941
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,880
至少在前线是如此
At least at our forward bases.

942
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,590
就这么办
Do it.

943
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,130
由于俄罗斯已部署飞弹
And since the Russians have deployed,

944
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:45,390
我们要考虑核武器攻击的可能
we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

945
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,640
不认真考虑,就无法遏阻他们
It's not on the table, it's not a deterrent.

946
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,980
谢了,局长,我们会再联络你
Thanks, Marion. We'll come back to you.

947
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,790
长官

948
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,010
外门卡住了,没有反应

949
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,130
大部分的监视器也失灵了

We're blind down here and no one can enter this facility.

951
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,180
中心,视讯无法传输
Command, our eyes are down.

952
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,730
地下碉堡安全外门也故障
We have a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

953
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,940
快点离开
Get out there now.

954
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,650
封住这个房间
Seal this room.

飞行的15分钟内,她是你的
She's yours for 1 5 minutes during the flight.

1119
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,020
- 把手给我 - 之后就是联邦调查局的
PEABODY: Give me your hands. MAN: Then she's the FBl's.

1120
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,080
嘿.
Hey.

1121
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,820
为什么要杀他?
Why'd you kill him?.

1122
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:16,620
因为一定要有人动手
Because somebody had to.

1123
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,210
什么?
What?.!.

1124
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,140
我猜你认为人人都表里如一
By this, I take it you think everybody is who they say they are.

1125
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,980
你在奥洛夫投诚时就觉得有问题
You knew something was wrong the moment Orlov walked in.

1126
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:50,570
我也是
So did l.

1127
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:53,030
我们只是不知道是什么
We just didn't know what it was.

1128
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:54,570
温特知道
Winter did.

1129
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,990
温特
Winter?

1130
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,540
你要我相信是温特要发射飞弹?
You expect me to believe that Winter was gonna launch the missiles

1131
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,620
而你拯救了全世界?
and you saved the world?

1132
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,920
我要你相信,对
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

1133
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,340
这是很大的指控
That's a big accusation.

1134
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,840
反正
Well,

1135
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,680
他死了,死无对证
he"s dead now so he can"t defend himself.

1136
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:21,180
我想你必须自己决定
I guess you'll just have to decide for yourself.

1137
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,270
有多少像你一样的人?
How many more like you are there?

1138
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,520
像我?
Like me?

1139
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,360
没有
None.

1140
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:37,450
像他的?
Like him?.

1141
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:39,990
多到你我都无法对付
More than you or I can handle alone.

1142
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,370
你真以为训练精良的俄国密探
You really think a trained Soviet agent

1143
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:50,130
无法近距离枪杀俄罗斯总统?
couldn't kill the Russian president at point-blank range if she wanted to?

1144
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,550
或是无法杀你?
Or you, for that matter.

1145
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,510
告别式那天我可以杀你却没动手
I could've killed you at the funeral and I didn't.

1146
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:02,550
你投降是因为我让你别无选择
You surrendered to me because I gave you no choice.

1147
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,640
你很清楚
You know better.

1148
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,890
我有选择
I had a choice.

1149
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,690
你很清楚
You know better.

1150
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:21,570
(奥洛夫死亡现场发现绍特指纹)

1151
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,170
要是我相信你
If I did believe you,

1152
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,130
我不是说我信你,只是就算我信
and I'm not saying for a second that I do, but if I did,

1153
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,760
别人也不会信
nobody else would.

1154
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:44,600
也许你可以换个角度想
Well, maybe you can think of a way around that.

1155
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,490
他们夺走了我的一切
They took everything from me.

1156
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,030
我要宰了他们
I'll kill them.

1157
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:18,350
预计到达时间，四分钟后.
ETA, four minutes.

1158
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,560
瞎扯!
Bullshit!

1159
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:42,320
我们正飞往波托马克河西南方
PlLOT: We are approaching the Potomac, heading due south and west.

1160
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:49,660
宰了他们!

while on a tour of Russia.

1171
01:36:44,360 --> 01:44:02,980
片尾之后请看第二结局版

1172

俄罗斯已然改变

不过我们的生命将不会白费

机身编码是N182SL
Tail number N182SL.

1176
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,700
他会给你最终的指示

1177

-就这样 -就这样

1178

在这之后，我们停止联系

1179
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:38,000
中止一切联络

我将不会再与你联络

奥洛夫跟你谈过了

1267

玛莉安，情况如何？

1300
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:21,350
资料应该正显示在您的荧幕上
It should be coming up on one of your screens.

1301

1303
01:53:28,030 --> 01:53:31,200
这表示俄罗斯正在部署飞弹

01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,710
由于俄罗斯已部署飞弹

我们要考虑核子攻击的选项

It's not on the table, it's not a deterrent.

01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:25,010
洲际弹道飞弹设定
ICBMs set to...

1396
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:27,720
最大破坏能量
...maximum yield.

1397
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,220
你刚来到中情局时
You know, when you first came to Langley...

1398
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,060
我没想到我能守住秘密
...I didn't think I'd be able to do it.

1399
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:38,770
我没想到能够…
I didn't think I'd be able to...

1400
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:42,320
抗拒吐露身分的诱惑
...resist the temptation to say something.

1401
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,240
后来你认识了迈可
Then you met Mike and...

1402
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:48,330
...然而...
...well...

1403
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:49,820
结果情况改变了
...things changed.

1404
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:54,870
让我加入你
Let me join you.

1405
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,460
这些年来就在我眼前
All these years right in front of me

1406
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:00,330
而我却完全不知道
and I never knew.

1407
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,720
让我加入你
Let me join you.

1408
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:11,600
我想跟你一起
I want to be with you.

1409
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:23,810
(俄罗斯总统没死！)

1410
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,400
众人都认为已死的人
The man we thought was dead has

1411
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:27,280
奇迹似地复活了
made a resurrection that is miraculous.

1412
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:29,530
马特维耶夫总统还活着
President Matveyev is alive.

1413
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,910
您所看到的是俄罗斯现场传回
We're going to Russia. What you are seeing...

1414
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:34,580
俄罗斯总统飞抵莫斯科
...are live pictures of Russian president Matveyev...

1415

近郊机场的现场画面
...arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.

1416
02:00:37,290 --> 02:00:38,790
这太惊人了
This is astonishing.

1417
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,080
据医生说，总统死亡的乌龙
According to his doctors, President Matveyev's mistak en death...

1418
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:44,750
是由蜘蛛毒液萃取出的毒素
...is attributed to a temporary paralysis...

1419
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:47,380
所引发的暂时性麻痹
...from a toxin derived from spider venom.

1420
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:48,720
对那些...
A recap for those...

1421
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:51,810
...谁可能不会关注当天的事件...
...who may not have been following the events of the day...

1422
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:56,810
至少我没弄错
At least I was right.

1423
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:03,190
我当时就觉得在北朝鲜已经失去你了
I had a feeling we'd lost you back there in North Korea.

1424
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:04,980
我看得出迈可英勇的王子行动
I could see how moved you were

1425
02:01:05,150 --> 02:01:06,860
让你有多感动
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

1426
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,570
你应该要招募他
You were supposed to recruit him, Ev...

1427
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:11,360
不是爱上他
...not fall in love with him.

1428
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:14,740
所以我叫奥洛夫去逮他
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

1429
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,210
对了，迈可好吗？
By the way, how is Mike?

1430
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,320

1437

02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:46,580
请求许可发射

1442
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:17,660
趴下，快！
Get down on the floor, now!

1443
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:19,780
我叫你趴下！

1444
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:27,750
发射程序解除，系统回复

1445
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,840
-快，快，快 -把手举起来
- Move, move, move!- Show me your hands!

1446
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,750
-要他们趴着 -手举起来
- Get down!- What is your name, sir?

1447
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,260
-你是谁？ -我是中情局的温特，快救总统
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.Help the president.

1448
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,640
总统先生
Mr. President.

1449
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:42,390
总统先生，你听得见吗？
Mr. President, can you hear me?

1450
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:45,640
-别动 -急救小组马上到
- Hold still.- EMT's on the way.

1451
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,940
送尸袋来，至少有七人死亡
Make sure they got body bags.At least seven.

1452
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:49,650
她穿着防弹背心
She's wearing a vest.

1453
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:52,820
五分钟后会议室见，我要清理一下
I'll meet you in five minutes.I wanna get cleaned up.

1454
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:54,570
我要她单独关一间房
And I want her alone in a room.

1455
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:57,240
我要她供出其他的俄国密探
If there are other KAs out there,I want her talking.

1456
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:58,450
她不会说的
She won't talk.

1457
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:00,660
她受过训练，无论如何都不会说
She's trained not to,no matter what we do to her.

1458
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:03,870
我们要找这些人，就得自己找
If we're gonna find these people,we gotta do it.

1459
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:13,250
我去整理一下，我马上回来
I'm gonna get cleaned up.I'll be right back.

1460
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:20,470
总统安全前不得进出，请退后
No one comes through until the president is secure. Step back.

1461
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,930
-我是温特  -退后，先生，请退后
- I'm Theodore Winter... - Step back, sir. Please.

1462
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:29,020
你受伤了，坐下来吧？
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you have a seat?

1463
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:30,940
我们会照顾你
We'll take a look at you.

1464
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:33,360
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1465
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:36,570
伤口很深
Pretty good gash there.

1466
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:39,320
看来里面有玻璃
Looks like you got a piece of glass in there.

1467
02:06:02,890 --> 02:06:04,010
她又杀人了
She killed someone else.

1468
02:06:04,180 --> 02:06:07,310
是泰德温特，你最好快上来
It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir. You better get up here.

1469
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,570
看看他，快看看他
Check him. Check him!

1470
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,400
检查生命迹象
Checking vitals.

1471
02:06:20,570 --> 02:06:23,370
我摸不到脉搏
I'm not getting a pulse. I'm not getting much.

1472
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:32,210
对于伊芙莎特，我们发现的越多   似乎知道的却越少
The more we find out about Evelyn Salt,the less we seem to know.The more we find out about Evelyn Salt,the less we seem to know.

1473
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:33,670
可以确定的是她是个谜
She has proven a mystery.

1474
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:38,340
我向美国国旗
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

1475
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:43,180
以及共和国所代表的
...of the United States of America...

1476
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:50,350
一个国家…
...and to the republic for which it stands...

1477
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:54,190
宣誓效忠，在上帝…
...one nation, under God...

1478
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,690
不可分割的自由…
...indivisible, with liberty...

1479
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:02,490
与正义之下
...and justice for all.

1480
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:07,540
百合折
The lily fold.

1481
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:12,540
在我的新生命中   我试着减少功利想法
In my new life,I'm trying to be less utilitarian.

1482
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:22,590
有人终止了导弹发射
Someone stopped the missile launch.

1483
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:26,140
总统没有意识
所以不是你就是温特干的
President was unconscious,so it was either you or Winter.

1484
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:30,060
总统说是温特开始的   所以…
President says Winter started it, so...

1485
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:32,690
是你救了这个世界？
...you saved the world?

1486
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:37,320
听好，莎特
Listen, Salt.

1487
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,490
温特，我们可以找出源头
Winter we can figure out.

1488
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:44,450
他过着生活，他留有痕迹
He led a life. He left a trail.

1489
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:48,910
我们会回溯过去     必要的话我会解剖他
We'll trace it back.I will dissect him if I have to.

1490
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:54,580
但是奥洛夫还在外面
But Orlov is still out there.

1491
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,380
迈可常说最甜美的事…
Mike used to say the sweetest thing.

1492
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:02,720
他常说他的心…
He used to say that his heart...

1493
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,930
是张蜘蛛网
...was a spider web...

1494
02:08:05,090 --> 02:08:08,640
而我是在上面生活的蜘蛛
...and I was the spider who lived on top.

1495
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:14,940
不论我在哪里    我都可以连着一条丝线…
And no matter where I was,I could attach a single thread...

1496
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:19,860
这样我就永远都连系着
...so I would always be connected.

1497
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:24,400
所以我永远可以找到回家的路
So I could always find my way home.

1498
02:08:28,490 --> 02:08:30,620
他告诉我无论何时     我看到一张蜘蛛网
He told me whenever I saw a spider web...

1499
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:33,500
我就会记得他有多爱我
...I should remember how much he loved me.

1500
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,770
我什么也没做
I did nothing.

1501
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:01,730
他们杀了我丈夫而我只是看着     我什么事也没做
They killed my husband and I watched and I did nothing.

1502
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:07,950
是为了大局着想
For the greater good.

1503
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:15,290
我对迈可感到遗憾    不过奥洛夫…
I'm sorry about Mike, but Orlov...

1504
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:19,670
-给我一点消息    -为什么？
- Give me something.- Why?

1505
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:22,750
所以你就可以逮捕他？
So you can arrest him?

1506
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:27,050
所以你的纳税人     可以把他放进一个美丽的小盒子里？
So your taxpayers can put him in a pretty little box?

1507
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:33,100
他的真名不是奥洛夫
His real name is not Orlov.

1508
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:36,680
那是什么？
What is it?

1509
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:49,780
他们给我们这些牙齿
在后面…
They gave us these teeth in the back...

1510
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:56,580
这就是我杀温特的原因
所以他不能自杀
It's why I killed Winter.So he couldn't do it himself.

1511
02:09:58,710 --> 02:09:59,790
该死！
Shit!

1512
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,210
该死的氰化物
Goddamn cyanide.

1513
02:10:05,210 --> 02:10:07,550
对，是皮巴帝       直接把我接过去
Yeah, it's Peabody.Put me through straight away.

1514
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:11,720
莎特刚刚想自杀，对
Salt just tried to kill herself. Yeah.

1515
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:13,010
可能是氰化物
Could be cyanide.

1516
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,600
要让她活着，各位
Keep her alive, folks.

1517
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,970
不，他们现在正在想办法
No, they're trying to figure that out right now.

1518
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:22,310
她的气管通畅吗？
Are her airways clear?

1519
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,730
可恶
Shit.

1520
02:10:31,950 --> 02:10:33,530
别开枪…
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1521
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:38,040
站住！
Freeze!

1522
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:48,960
我们的父亲决定…
Our father has decided that...

1523
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:51,300
你们展开…
...the time has come...

1524
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:54,970
全新生命的时间到了
...for you all to start your new lives.

1525
02:10:58,270 --> 02:11:02,940
准备我们的下一场攻击
To prepare for our next attack.

1526
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:29,300
有什么是我可以效劳的吗？
Can I help you?

1527
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:40,390
我的女儿
My daughter.

1528
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:44,770
你是来亲吻戒指的吗？
Have you come to kiss the ring?

1529
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:52,030
我是来告诉你我自由了
I've come to tell you that I'm free.
