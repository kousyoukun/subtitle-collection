请跟他们联络 润克石油公司

你是来破坏我们的核子设施的

赦免美国帝国主义者

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,577
对我社会主义国家采取的敌对行为
for her hostile acts against our socialist nation.

21
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:01,289
压低头 交换前一句话也别说
Keep your head down. Don't say anything till we make the swap.

22
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,084
以防金正日改变心意

所有指示都说要丢下我
All the rules say to leave me, that one life

29
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:41,287
不值得为一个人暴露组织行动
is not worth blowing operational cover.

30
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,664
你没搞错
You got that right.

31
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,835
必要时 我们会为大我牺牲小我

37
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,980
我们不要媒体注目 所以我们想
We didn't need the publicity so I figured we better do something

38
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,692
再不设法 他会自己进攻这个烂国家
or he's gonna invade this goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,252
你还好吧？

46
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,522
你亲手做？
Your cooking?

47
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,691
开玩笑 你很爱吃我做的
You're joking. You like my cooking.

48
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,860
德国人不开玩笑的
Germans don't joke.

49
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,988
波特喜欢我的料理
Burt likes my cooking.

50
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,081
把你的虫收起来
Get your bugs off the table.

51
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,333
- 这是蜘蛛  - 蜘蛛就是虫

52
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,378
- 这是蜘蛛  - 蜘蛛就是虫
- They're spiders. - They're bugs.

53
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,812
把下层折回来
Fold the next layer back

54
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:01,853
像前两个一样
as you did the two before it.

55
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,920
把餐巾转过来
Turn the napkin over.

56
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:06,090
将两端向后折
Fold both sides back,

57
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,102
在三分之一的地方重复

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,347
检查是否对称
Check for symmetry

59
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:14,600
再仔细折妥
and press the fold down well.

00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,901
你上班时间搞这个？

并且插入你最喜欢的银器…

今天是我结婚纪念日
It's my anniversary.

63
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:24,242
我要一切完美
And I want it to be perfect.

64
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,620
不过这并不性感
But that is not sexy.

65
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,498
对 不过这很实用
No, but it is utilitarian.

66
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,834
这年头实用就代表性感

"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

74
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,727
官架子十足
From head to toe.

75
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,022
我很惊讶他没叫你“陛下”

82

你知道的 跟往常一样

83
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,091
总统想知道俄罗斯事件发生前一天的详情

84
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,673

一旦去做行政人员就不能回头了
You know, once you start pushing paper, there's no turning back.

88
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,891
我上次出任务时有个超怪的感觉

我得了思乡病
I was homesick.

90
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:32,510
思乡病？
Homesick?

91
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,021
- 不能吃药解决吗？ - 长官！长官！

00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,270
我猜他不相信我们的伪装

96
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,746
查过背景了？
Did you get his bona fides?

97
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:44,667
俄罗斯人
He's Russian.

98
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,932
只宣称是前国安局探员
He says he's FSB but won't give us any more.

99
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,118
- 他很怪  - 他英文如何？
- He's a strange guy. - How's his English?

100
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,412
还可以
Passable. Not great.

101
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,457
但是没办法很清楚的表达

00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:59,123
要说我的行动会得到什么报应
If I have gained anything by damning myself,

427
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:24,160

从她的观点来

愿天保佑 绍特并没有问题

434
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,321
你知道这女的是谁吗？
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

435
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,533
她为国奉献 对你毫无意义？
What she's done for this country? Does that mean anything to you?

436

绍特小时候在俄国待过一阵子

536
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,540
因为地铁关闭…

537
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,588

850
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:14,248
我想我们该严重考虑
Sir, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility

851
01:12:14,415 --> 01:12:17,292
今天 现在 就是毁灭日的开始
that today, right now, could be the start of Day X.

852
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:20,504
总统先生 梅德福局长上线了
Mr. President, Director Medford is up.

853
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,257
局长 情况如何？
Marion, what's the situation?

854
01:12:23,424 --> 01:12:26,427
资料应该正显示在您的屏幕上
It should be coming up on one of your screens.

855
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:29,263
这里显示西伯利亚的移动飞弹
What you see there represents temperature drops

856
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,598
温度下降
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

857
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:35,602
这表示俄罗斯正在部署飞弹
It means the Russians are deploying their missiles to the field.

858
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:39,356
地面人员己确认此事 总统先生
And that's been confirmed on the ground, Mr. President.

859
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:44,028
我强烈建议提升战备到二级状态
Mr. President, I strongly recommend we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

860
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,613
至少在前线是如此
At least at our forward bases.

861
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:49,408
就这么办
Do it.

862
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,952
由于俄罗斯已部署飞弹
And since the Russians have deployed,

863
01:12:52,745 --> 01:12:55,873
我们要考虑核武器攻击的可能
we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

864
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,126
不认真考虑 就无法遏阻他们
It's not on the table, it's not a deterrent.

865
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:03,172
谢了 局长 我们会再联络你
Thanks, Marion. We'll come back to you.

866
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:24,985

外门卡住了 没有反应

868
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:34,036
大部分的监视器也失灵了
And we just lost the feed from most of our security cameras.

869
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:36,830
我们看不见 不过没人能进来
We're blind down here and no one can enter this facility.

870
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,422
指挥部 信号无法传输
Command, our eyes are down.

871
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,539
地下调堡的安全外门也有故障
We have a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

872
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,253
快点离开
Get out there now.

873
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,297
封住这个房间
Seal this room.

不 长官
No, sir.

906
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,130
总统身边只有特勤人员能持枪

907
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,049
去它的规定 外面有敌人的间谍

否则我就是你最后看到的人

我们一起挑选攻击目标吧？

919
01:16:36,343 --> 01:16:37,678

你怎么不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

925
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,043
我试过很多次 不过

926
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:30,588

927
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:33,483
你没跟我们一起 我不会忘记你的
You weren't with us in Russia. I would have remembered you.

928
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,596
我比你早一期

929
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:38,050
奥洛夫摩下最闪亮的星星

930
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,136
现在我很荣幸能发动攻击

931
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,059

我没想到我能守住秘密

我没想到能够

抗拒吐露身份的诱惑

马特维耶夫总统还活着

964
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,420
前往俄罗斯现场

967

968
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:44,601
据他的医生说

969
01:19:44,684 --> 01:19:46,240
马特维耶夫总统的乌龙死亡

970
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,026
归因于一种暂时性麻痹
is attributed to a temporary paralysis

971
01:19:49,142 --> 01:19:51,490
是由蜘蛛毒液萃取出的毒素引发的
from a toxin derived from spider venom.

972
01:19:51,705 --> 01:19:55,876
回顾一下，为了那些可能没有关注当天事件的人…
A recap for those who may not have been following the events of the day...

973
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,131
至少我没弄错
At least I was right.

974
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:07,512
我当时就觉得在北韩已经失去你了
I had a feeling we'd lost you back there in North Korea.

975
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:11,558
我看得出麦克英勇的王子行动让你有多感动
I could see how moved you were by Mike's little white-knight routine.

976
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:13,894
你应该要招募他
You were supposed to recruit him, Ev,

977
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,687
不是爱上他
not fall in love with him.

978
01:20:16,897 --> 01:20:19,065
所以我叫奥洛夫去逮他
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

979
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:23,778
对了 麦克好吗？

980

奥洛夫死了

982
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,291
省了我的麻烦
Saved me the trouble.

983
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,718
我得真的扭断他的手
I had to practically twist his arm

984
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:41,925
才能逼他去中情局揭穿你的身份
to get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

985
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,351
你明白
You see,

986
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:47,710
他希望事情结束后 你能活命
he wanted you to come out of this thing alive.

987
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:53,183
不过你需要有人垫背
But you needed somebody to take the blame.

988
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:56,436
我是替死鬼
I'm the patsy.

989
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:02,108
而我是英雄
And I'm the hero.

990
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,780
恭喜了 伊芙
Congratulations, Ev.

991
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:10,992

1019
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,620

- Give me your hands. - Then she's the FBI's.

1039
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:25,742
为什么要杀他？
Why'd you kill him?

1040
01:27:26,034 --> 01:27:27,493
因为一定要有人动手
Because somebody had to.

1041
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:42,133
什么？
What?!

1042
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:56,064
我猜你认为人人都表里如一
By this, I take it you think everybody is who they say they are.

1043
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,859
你在奥洛夫投诚时就觉得有问题
You knew something was wrong the moment Orlov walked in.

1044
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:01,486

1045
01:28:01,653 --> 01:28:03,947
我们只是不知道是什么

1046
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:05,528
温特知道
Winter did.

1047
01:28:06,002 --> 01:28:06,982
温特？
Winter?

1048
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:12,455
你要我相信是温特要发射飞弹？
You expect me to believe that Winter was gonna launch the missiles

1049
01:28:12,622 --> 01:28:14,540
而你拯救了全世界？
and you saved the world?

1050
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:18,836
我要你相信 对
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

1051
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:22,215
这是很大的指控
That's a big accusation.

1052
01:28:23,383 --> 01:28:24,717
反正
Well,

1053
01:28:25,802 --> 01:28:28,596
他死了 死无对证
he's dead now so he can't defend himself.

1054
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:32,058
我想你必须自己决定
I guess you'll just have to decide for yourself.

1055
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:41,192
有多少像你一样的人？
How many more like you are there?

1056
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:43,444
像我？
Like me?

1057
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:46,280
没有
None.

1058
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:48,366
像他的？
Like him?

1059
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:50,910
多到你我都无法对付
More than you or I can handle alone.

1060
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,874
你真以为
You really think...

1061
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:58,742
训练精良的苏联密探杀不了这位俄罗斯总统吗？
a trained Soviet agent couldn't kill the Russian president 

1062
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:01,040
在近距离如果她想的话
 at point-blank range if she wanted to?

1063
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,427
或是无法杀你
Or you, for that matter.

1064
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:10,430
葬礼那天我可以杀你却没动手
I could've killed you at the funeral and I didn't.

1065
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,474
你投降是因为我让你别无选择
You surrendered to me because I gave you no choice.

1066
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,560
你很清楚
You know better.

1067
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:18,813
我有选择
I had a choice.

1068
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:20,606
你很清楚
You know better.

1069
01:29:27,388 --> 01:29:32,601
（奥洛夫死亡现场发现绍特指纹）

1070
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:43,087
要是我相信你
If I did believe you,

1071
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:47,050
我不是说我信你 只是就算我信
and I'm not saying for a second that I do, but if I did,

1072
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:50,678
别人也不会信
nobody else would.

1073
01:29:52,305 --> 01:29:55,516
也许你可以换个角度想
Well, maybe you can think of a way around that.

1074
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,405
他们夺走了我的一切
They took everything from me.

1075
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:12,950
我要宰了他们
I'll kill them.

1076
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,342
预计到达时间为四分钟
ETA, four minutes.

1077
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,475
瞎扯！
Bullshit!

1078
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:53,199
我们正飞往波托马克河西南方
We are approaching the Potomac, heading due south and west.

1079
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:00,540
宰了他们！
Go get them.

1080
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,019
绍特！
Salt!

1081
01:31:30,695 --> 01:31:34,157
绕回去！绕回去！
Circle back! Circle back!

1082
01:32:30,505 --> 01:32:33,121
新上任的美国总统乔瑟夫·史戴本今天宣布

1083
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,291
由于娜塔莎·契诃夫的死亡，也就是在美国名为伊芙·绍特

1084
01:32:35,468 --> 01:32:41,679
所有的恐怖分子集团成员都已经被歼灭

1085
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,715
这是在他维和访问莫斯科时宣布的

1086
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:46,305
这期间史戴本总统曾献花致意

1087
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,098
就在1974年造成他父母和姐妹遇难的飞机失事地点上

1088
01:32:51,276 --> 01:32:53,892
此时他正出访俄罗斯
