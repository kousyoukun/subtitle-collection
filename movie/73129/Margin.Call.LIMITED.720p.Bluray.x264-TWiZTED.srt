1
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,338
Is that them?

2
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,100
Jesus Christ.

3
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,645
Are they going to do it right here?

4
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,478
You guys ever been through this before?

5
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,229
No.

6
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,733
It's best to ignore it, keep your
head down, and go back to work.

7
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,826
Go on.

8
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,127
Don't watch.

9
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,265
Timothy Singh?

10
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,522
- Yes.
- I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

11
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,693
Come.

12
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,244
Eric Dale?

13
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,120
Excuse me?

14
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,338
Eric Dale?

15
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,087
- No.
- Sorry?

16
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,961
I'm not Eric Dale.

17
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,175
I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,380
He's my boss.

19
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,723
He's down the hall.

20
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,971
Thanks.

21
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,318
Excuse me, Mr. Dale?

22
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,615
This way.

23
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,667
Okay.

24
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,464
I am obviously sorry
that we are here today.

25
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,965
But these are extraordinary times,
as you very well must know.

26
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,087
Look, I run Risk Management.

27
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,424
I don't really see how that's a
natural place to start cutting jobs.

28
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,894
We hope you understand
this is in no way personal.

29
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,060
The majority of this floor
is being let go today.

30
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,275
Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through
the details of what the firm is offering.

31
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,319
Okay.

32
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,904
Mr. Dale, the firm is offering you
a six-month severance at half your salary.

33
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,906
You will keep all unvested options
that you currently hold.

34
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,909
Health will be extended
through that period.

35
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:31,874
You have until tomorrow at 4:47 to either
take the offer or it will be revoked.

36
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,632
Do you understand?

37
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,302
Yes.

38
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,587
Unfortunately, Mr. Dale,

39
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,182
due to the highly sensitive nature
of your work here,

40
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,760
the firm has to take certain precautions
for security purposes

41
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,472
that may seem punitive in nature.

42
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,475
I hope, considering your

43
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,979
over 19 years of service to the firm,

44
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,315
you will understand that these measures
are in no way a reflection

45
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,865
of the firm's feelings
towards your performance

46
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,071
or your character.

47
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,616
I don't understand.

48
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,878
She's apologizing
for what's about to happen.

49
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:14,542
Your company e-mail, access to the server,
access to the building,

50
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,505
and your mobile data and phone service
will all be severed as of this meeting.

51
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,475
And this gentleman
will take you to your office

52
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,019
so you can clear out
your personal belongings.

53
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,027
What about what I'm currently working on?
I'm in the middle of something that...

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,858
The firm has worked out its transition plan
and is prepared to move forward.

55
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,489
But we do appreciate your concern.

56
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,789
We understand that this is difficult.
And here is my card.

57
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,825
Please contact me in the next few weeks

58
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:50,327
if you need any assistance
with this transition in your life.

59
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,838
Sir.

60
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,009
Okay.

61
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,682
Okay.

62
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,681
Okay.

63
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,341
Hey.

64
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,508
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,596
- You still alive?
- For now.

66
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,981
Congratulations.

67
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,100
It was a bloodbath.

68
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,353
I heard.

69
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,398
Listen, Eric,

70
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,444
if there was something I could have done,
I would have done it.

71
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,568
- I know.
- All right?

72
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,071
Yeah, I know. I know.

73
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,035
Okay.

74
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,832
Just tell me,

75
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,743
who was it?

76
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,630
- Come on, Eric.
- Come on, Will.

77
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,423
- Rogers?
- I'm not going to say, you know.

78
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,875
- You know me.
- Robertson?

79
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,088
That cunt. I knew it.

80
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,591
I knew I shouldn't have
fucking gone to her last year.

81
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,595
It wasn't anyone.
Eric, you know what it was?

82
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,969
It was bad luck, and that's all it was.

83
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,061
Yup.

84
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,722
Yup.

85
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,517
All right, well, good luck.

86
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,726
Will?

87
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,904
Come here.

88
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,317
I was just in the middle
of a lot of shit right here

89
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,277
that I think somebody needs
to take a look at.

90
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,613
Eric, listen,

91
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,832
they're telling us
everybody needs to get out of here.

92
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,992
Just leave their stuff.

93
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,621
And while we appreciate your concern,

94
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,879
this is not your problem anymore.

95
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,885
Good luck.

96
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,312
Thank you.

97
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,981
Right this way, Mr. Murphy.

98
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,720
- Eric, I'm very sorry.
- Yeah.

99
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,014
Did they say what was going
to happen with us?

100
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,218
- Jesus, Seth.
- What?

101
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,843
It's going to get pretty ugly
around here for a while.

102
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,688
But, you know, you guys will be all right.

103
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,809
- Good luck, Eric.
- All right.

104
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,070
I'll see you around, okay?
All right. Thank you.

105
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,878
Eric.

106
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,383
I wanted to say thanks.

107
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,136
- It's not necessary.
- Well, it is.

108
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,263
You were the person around here that I...

109
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,607
I know.

110
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,894
Hey, look,

111
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,444
I was working on something,
but they wouldn't let me finish it.

112
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,117
So, take a look at it.

113
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,949
Be careful.

114
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,433
<i>We're sorry.</i>

115
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:20,522
<i>The telephone you are calling from
is not in service at this time.</i>

116
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,650
Robertson!

117
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,357
Sarah Robertson.

118
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,865
Sarah.

119
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,241
You shut off my phone?

120
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,906
Eric, I didn't do anything.

121
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,290
Fuck you.

122
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,602
Well, that was fucking hideous.

123
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,862
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

124
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,489
You think?

125
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,074
Much.

126
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,320
You got any Nicorettes?

127
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,411
I'm out of Nicorettes.

128
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,625
Which means in about 10 minutes
I'm going to kill someone.

129
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,005
You all right, Sam?

130
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,838
My dog is dying.

131
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,435
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,182
Just got off the phone with the vet.
Fucking tumor on her liver.

133
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:50,445
I was spending, like, $1,000 a day
already just trying to keep her alive.

134
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,646
Yeah,

135
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,446
I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

136
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,659
Well, they're all gone.

137
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,874
So...

138
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,413
How many do we have left?

139
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,711
About 33.

140
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,761
Well, make sure they're all out there.
I've gotta say something.

141
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,254
Yeah, no, they're ready.

142
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,132
They're ready for you.

143
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,311
All right, let's hear it.

144
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,779
You're all still here for a reason.

145
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,159
80% of this floor
was just sent home, forever.

146
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,745
We spent the last hour
saying our goodbyes.

147
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,789
They were good people
and they were good at their jobs,

148
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,087
but you were better.

149
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,253
Now they're gone,
they're not to be thought of again.

150
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,803
This is your opportunity.

151
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,633
On every floor of this building

152
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,636
and in every office,
from Hong Kong to London,

153
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,267
the same thing is happening.

154
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,940
By the time we're done,

155
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,646
three of every seven guys who were
standing between you and your boss' job

156
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,689
are gone.

157
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,450
That is your opportunity.

158
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,369
I've been with this place for 34 years,

159
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,950
and I can tell you this is not the last
time that you're gonna go through this.

160
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,999
But you are all survivors.

161
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:37,459
And that is how this firm, over 107 years,
has continued to grow stronger.

162
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,090
So keep your heads high. Get back to work.
Let's hear it.

163
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,727
Everyone's going out, man.
You should... Come on.

164
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,820
No, man. I'm cool. Thanks.

165
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,190
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
just give me a call.

166
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,444
I will.

167
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,653
Come.

168
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,200
- Where you guys going?
- The Grand.

169
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,368
I will call you when I am done.

170
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,746
All right.

171
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,707
Hey, be glad you're still alive.

172
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,294
I am.

173
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,060
- Have a good night, man.
- You, too.

174
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,243
Come on. Come on. Come on.

175
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,418
<i>We're sorry.
You've reached a number...</i>

176
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,917
<i>- Fuck me. Fuck!
- ...that has been disconnected.</i>

177
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,971
- Hello?
- Hey.

178
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,601
<i>- I can't hear you.
- What?</i>

179
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,770
Can you go outside? It's too loud.

180
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,273
Hold on a second. It's loud.
Just give me a second.

181
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,441
<i>- All right, what's up?
- Hey, where are you?</i>

182
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,368
<i>- Lugo.
- Okay. Are you with Will?</i>

183
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,286
<i>- Yeah. Will Emerson?
- Yeah.</i>

184
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,285
Yeah. I think he's still here. Why?

185
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,290
All right. I need you to get Will,
and I need you guys to come back up here.

186
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,121
<i>- Where?
- To the office.</i>

187
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,831
<i>- What?
- I'm serious.</i>

188
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,292
Wait a sec... You want me
to get our boss' boss out of a club

189
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,716
and bring him back to the office
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

190
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,549
Well, our boss got axed,
so technically he is our boss,

191
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,681
<i>- and yes, that is what I want you to do.
- Why?</i>

192
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,730
Look, man. Just trust me, okay?
I need you guys back here now.

193
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,103
<i>All right. We'll be there in 10.</i>

194
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,310
Fuck.

195
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,876
Have I ever told you
how much I love your bag?

196
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,047
No, really.

197
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,172
- Do you have a little dress that matches it?
- Yeah, I do.

198
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,837
Because you could bounce around in it
like a fucking girl.

199
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,930
Hey!

200
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,180
Look who's burning the candle
at both ends.

201
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,552
Why didn't you come out with us?

202
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,014
There's no more cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my arse.

203
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,186
I frankly don't even know
what it is you guys do.

204
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,357
Well, I'm really sorry
I had to bring you guys back here,

205
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,275
- but...
- That's all right.

206
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,777
- What's going on?
- Look at this.

207
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,901
- Eric gave me this file before he left.
- Eric...

208
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,371
Dale. And he told me
that he couldn't quite figure it out.

209
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:22,285
And the last thing he said to me

210
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,913
before the elevator doors closed was,
"Be careful."

211
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,369
- He said, "Be careful"?
- Yeah. So, obviously, I'm a little curious.

212
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,587
I start to get into it a little bit,

213
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,961
and I realize that the only thing
that he's missing...

214
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,261
- This is not good, Will.
- All right. Okay. So what is he doing here?

215
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,556
No, no. Go to model four.
It makes more sense.

216
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,381
Okay. All right.

217
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,884
What is this?

218
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,771
This is basically everything that
we have in our books at any given time.

219
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,440
But, what Eric was trying to do
was to work these numbers

220
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,895
for levels of volatility that fall
outside of the standard VAR model.

221
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,562
- What are those levels?
- It's fairly complicated.

222
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,689
Simplify.

223
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,782
The volatility levels are set
using historic patterns, basically,

224
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,281
and then stretching those patterns
out another 10, 15% roughly.

225
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:03,280
All right, so?

226
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:07,085
So, we are starting
to test those historic patterns.

227
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,377
When?

228
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,412
- Today.
- Tuesday.

229
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,508
Monday. Last Friday and Wednesday.

230
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,426
Two Fridays ago.

231
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,462
All right. I get it.

232
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,923
Fuck me.

233
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,093
Once this thing gets going
in the wrong direction,

234
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,636
this is fucking huge.

235
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,014
How huge?

236
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,817
Well, the losses are greater than
the current value of the company.

237
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,566
Projected losses.
The projected losses, Will.

238
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,614
- And this is just our floor?
- Yes.

239
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,451
Where the fuck is Eric Dale?

240
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,154
I don't know. I tried to call him.
His phone is off.

241
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,282
What do you mean?

242
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:46,658
They turned everybody's phone off
that they axed today.

243
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,034
Fucking ruthless.

244
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,167
- Did you try his personal cell?
- Yeah, I called his cell phone. it's not on.

245
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,669
- Call his home.
- At this hour?

246
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,046
Yeah. Do we even know if he's right?

247
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,096
- Looks pretty fucking right to me.
- It does.

248
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,174
Mrs. Dale, it's Will Emerson.

249
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,099
I'm fine, thank you. May I speak with Eric?

250
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,809
No, we've tried that.
His phone appears to be off.

251
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,733
Listen, could you have him call me
the moment he comes in?

252
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,315
The moment he walks through the door.

253
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,190
Thank you so much.

254
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,568
Goodbye.

255
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,698
Where the fuck is he?

256
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,495
- Doesn't he have, like, three kids?
- So?

257
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:28,161
Fuck, I don't know, would you go home?

258
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,619
I know where he is.

259
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,333
I need you two to go and get him.

260
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,336
There will be a car
waiting for you downstairs.

261
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,167
- You need to go.
- Right now?

262
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,923
Yeah, right now.

263
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,345
What are you going to do?

264
00:23:41,346 --> 00:23:43,214
I'm going to call Sam.

265
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,761
Fuck me.

266
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,908
<i>- Yes?
- It's Will.</i>

267
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,697
It's 11:00 at night.

268
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,700
I know. I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called.

269
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,253
What's the problem?

270
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,880
I think you need to get back here.

271
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,791
What?

272
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,884
<i>Sam, listen...</i>

273
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,710
it's 11:00 at night.

274
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:27,057
I'm well aware of the fucking time, Sam.
I'm telling you, you need to see this.

275
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,258
<i>See what?</i>

276
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,681
It's...

277
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,770
E- mail it to me.

278
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,316
I don't think that, that
would be a good idea.

279
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,937
I'm on my way.

280
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,366
Look at these people.

281
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:53,706
Wandering around with absolutely no idea
what's about to happen.

282
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,293
Right?

283
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,259
Well, I try to not let
work get to me like that.

284
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,130
I've noticed that about you.

285
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:09,137
Come on. We're 23 years old.

286
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,968
- I'm 28.
- All right, 28.

287
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,266
Whatever, it's the same thing,

288
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:18,351
but I made nearly a quarter
of a million dollars last year.

289
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,777
Fuck. For what?

290
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,781
I push numbers around
on a computer screen.

291
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,867
A bunch of glorified crack addicts
are willing to take that information,

292
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,943
and they pretend to understand it,

293
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,153
and they bet it against some other jock
halfway around the world

294
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,531
who, you know, if he wasn't doing this,

295
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,958
he'd be in an OTB somewhere,
putting it all on number seven, you know?

296
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,247
At the end of the day,
one guy wins, one guy loses.

297
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,877
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that, right?

298
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,419
Yeah.

299
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,011
It's Will. He wants to know if we found him.
What do I say?

300
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,606
Let's say that we haven't found him yet.

301
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,440
Okay.

302
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,207
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,334
So?

304
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,715
Eric Dale.

305
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,138
Oh, Jesus.

306
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,599
Before he leaves the building,
escorted by fucking security, by the way...

307
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,176
- I had nothing to do with that.
- I know.

308
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,385
I'm sorry. Go on.

309
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,188
Before he leaves the building,
he hands this disk to Peter Sullivan.

310
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,729
- Who's Peter Sullivan again?
- Doesn't matter.

311
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,396
- He's one of Eric's guys.
- All right.

312
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:47,194
But before the elevator doors are closing, the
last thing that he says is, "Be careful."

313
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,071
"Be careful"?

314
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,197
Yeah.

315
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,368
- "Be careful"?
- Yeah.

316
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,196
- Why?
- Take a look.

317
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,369
Oh, Jesus. You Know
I can't fucking read these things.

318
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,870
Just speak to me in English.

319
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:05,045
All right. Basically, this Kid, Peter Sullivan,
he gets all inspired by your pep talk.

320
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,916
Nice job, by the way.

321
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,710
And he delves straight in after work.

322
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,963
And I think he nailed it.

323
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,593
Nailed it?

324
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,925
Yeah, I think he figured out
what Eric was missing.

325
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,394
And?

326
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,312
It's not good, Sam.

327
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,734
These here are
the historical volatility index limits

328
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,395
which, of course, our entire trading model
relies on pretty fucking heavily.

329
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:31,697
Well, we're now so levered up
that once it gets outside of these limits,

330
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,154
it gets ugly in a hurry.

331
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,123
And how close to those limits
have we gotten?

332
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,417
Sam, we're beyond close.

333
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,413
We broke through these limits
five or six days in the last two weeks.

334
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,424
Now, somehow we've managed to
stay on the right side of it for now.

335
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,751
For now.

336
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,718
Well, look what happens
when we get on the wrong side of it.

337
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,522
- Wait a minute. What am I looking at?
- You're looking at this figure here.

338
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,519
- Whoa. Is that...
- Yeah.

339
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,981
And that would not be a bad day for us,
historically speaking.

340
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,483
- Is that figure right?
- I don't know. I can't be sure.

341
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,992
Where's Eric Dale?

342
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,660
- We shut his phone off.
- Of course we did.

343
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,280
Yeah. So I called his wife,
who says he's not home.

344
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,036
Yeah, he's probably crying
in some fucking beer somewhere.

345
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,617
Yeah, or worse.

346
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,872
Where's the kid that did this?

347
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,537
I sent him out looking for Eric.

348
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,293
You think he knows what he's doing?

349
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,623
I don't know. What do I know?

350
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,630
Get him back here. Get him back here.

351
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,892
What do you think these girls
make in a night?

352
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,477
$1,500?

353
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,193
Two grand?

354
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,287
Two grand.

355
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,160
Fuck. That's... That's pretty great.

356
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,833
I mean, all considered.

357
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,000
Shit.

358
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,173
Will.

359
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,343
Yep.

360
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,847
No. No, we asked, and nobody's seen him.

361
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,518
Okay, yep.

362
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,539
All right, so what do you think
Rogers makes in a year?

363
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,043
- I don't know, I have no idea.
- Come on. Play along.

364
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,667
- What year? I don't know.
- Last year.

365
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,290
Three quarters of a million.

366
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,547
Come on.

367
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,378
- What?
- Oh, it's not even close.

368
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,222
- More?
- Much more.

369
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,717
A million?

370
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,303
Will Emerson made
two and a half million last year.

371
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,262
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me.

372
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,561
Fuck you. How do you know that?

373
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,393
- He told me.
- He just told you?

374
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,480
I asked him, and yeah, he told me.

375
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,486
You think that's true?

376
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,655
Yeah, probably.

377
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,577
That's fucked up.

378
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,623
- Why is that fucked up?
- I don't know, does it seem right to you?

379
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,618
Right? I mean, right is... Right is...

380
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,045
Jesus.

381
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,965
So what do you think
that means Rogers puts away?

382
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:37,587
I have no idea, Seth.
This traffic is a fucking nightmare.

383
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,610
Sorry.

384
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,448
Gentlemen.

385
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,488
Will. Mr. Rogers.

386
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,332
Come with us, please.

387
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,956
Sam, this is Seth Bregman
and Peter Sullivan.

388
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,129
Sir.

389
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,345
Will?

390
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,131
Where are we going?

391
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,682
We're going to get a second opinion
on your work, Peter.

392
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,259
So, Sam, what do you have for us?

393
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,388
It'll be here in a minute.

394
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,389
Finding somebody in the copy room at this
hour was a little bit of a challenge.

395
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,014
Okay, let's go right
into the introductions.

396
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,519
This is Sarah Robertson, who you know.

397
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,059
Chief Risk Management Officer
Ramesh Shah from upstairs.

398
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,483
And David Horn,
one of the firm's in-house counsel.

399
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,399
Nice to meet you all. This is my Head
of Trading, Will Emerson, and this is...

400
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,950
Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman.
They work in our Risk Department.

401
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,530
Where's Eric Dale?

402
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,703
He was let go today.

403
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,911
Who do you have left
in your Risk Department?

404
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,883
As of today that would be
Peter and our Junior Analyst, Seth.

405
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,552
Really?

406
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,923
Will Emerson?

407
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,350
Yes, please. Just hand them out.

408
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,889
Thank you.

409
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,738
Apparently, Eric had been working on this
for some time,

410
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,075
but he wasn't able to finish it.

411
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,777
This morning, as he left the building,

412
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,620
he handed the program to Peter here
and asked him to take a look at it.

413
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,496
Peter did. He put a few things in
that Eric seemed to be missing,

414
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,577
and this is what came out.

415
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,751
Peter, is this your work?

416
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,259
Mostly Mr. Dale's.

417
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,752
But is this your draft?

418
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,879
Yes.

419
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,433
Again, expanded on the original work
by Mr. Dale. But, yes.

420
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,931
What's your background?

421
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,478
- My background?
- Your CV?

422
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,928
I've been with the firm
for two and a half years,

423
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,022
working with Eric that whole time.

424
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,020
But I hold a doctorate in engineering,

425
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,143
specialty in propulsion, from MIT
with a bachelor's from Penn.

426
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,613
What is a specialty in propulsion, exactly?

427
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,654
My thesis was a study
in the ways that friction ratios

428
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,612
affect steering outcomes in aeronautical
use under reduced gravity loads.

429
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,248
So, you're a rocket scientist?

430
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,117
I was. Yeah.

431
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,373
Interesting.

432
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,962
How did you end up here?

433
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,881
It's all just numbers, really.
Just changing what you're adding up.

434
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,587
And to speak freely, the money here is
considerably more attractive.

435
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,178
What time is it?

436
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,271
2215.

437
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,771
Fuck me. Fuck me.

438
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,737
And I'm guessing by the fact
that you two haven't said anything

439
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,521
that the math checks out.

440
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,822
Look, we'd need some time to go over this.

441
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,325
But Mr. Sullivan here seems like
he knows what he's doing.

442
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,156
So, it would appear we have a problem.

443
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,823
Thank you for that.

444
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,157
What time is it?

445
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,831
- 2:16.
- Fuck me.

446
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,747
Fuck me.

447
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,215
Sam, how long under normal operations

448
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,594
would it take your people
to clear that from our books?

449
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,557
What?

450
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,060
- All of it?
- Yes.

451
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,228
I don't know. Weeks.

452
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,072
- Weeks?
- Yeah. Weeks.

453
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,745
But you certainly know
that our business is selling and buying?

454
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,910
It doesn't work for very long
without both components.

455
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,616
We suddenly stop buying for a day or two,

456
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,868
that's not something you can hide
under the rug. That gets out.

457
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:25,249
And when it does, this whole thing
comes to an end, and right quick.

458
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,418
- I understand.
- Do you?

459
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,677
Yes.

460
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,436
How many traders do we have left
between your floor and Peterson's?

461
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,479
- I don't know, what...
- 60.

462
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,100
Jared, as I look at this more closely,

463
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,476
it is these VAR numbers
that are setting this thing off.

464
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,902
Excuse me.

465
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,948
I warned you about this last year.

466
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,122
We would not be in this position
if we had done what I...

467
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:03,119
Please.

468
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,788
As I was saying,
and I speak completely off the record,

469
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,666
it's only a matter of time
before someone else

470
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,798
starts putting these in and
they come up with exactly the same results

471
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,629
and look at exactly
what we're looking at right now,

472
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,804
if they haven't already.

473
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,255
Understood.

474
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,760
And, Sarah, what value would you allow
to be placed on those assets

475
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,261
that might remain on the books,
if they had to?

476
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,978
Why would they still be on the books?

477
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,690
Because suddenly nobody wants
to fucking buy them.

478
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,107
Fuck you, Sam. Will you give me

479
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,353
- a fucking break here?
- Excuse me, Jared...

480
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,437
Without an active market,
it would take weeks or months

481
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,523
for me to come up with
an accurate value on them.

482
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,028
You would have to go block by block.

483
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,611
Look, Jared, it's a very simple business,
right? We talked about this.

484
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,911
Sam.

485
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,119
Will, Peter, and...

486
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,495
- What the fuck is his name?
- Seth.

487
00:36:41,496 --> 00:36:45,041
Thank you. Seth. Could you please
give us a few moments?

488
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,415
And, Peter?

489
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,170
Has anyone else seen this?

490
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,127
No, no one aside from us.

491
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,883
- And Eric Dale.
- Yes.

492
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:58,132
And can it really be possible that
we don't know where Eric Dale is?

493
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,352
I called his wife, he hasn't come home yet,

494
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,011
and we turned off his phone today.

495
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,104
Perfect.

496
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,396
Well, I'd like to know where he is.

497
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,862
Jesus fucking Christ. Who is that guy?

498
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,240
Sam's boss.

499
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,535
He looks like he's 15 years old.

500
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,085
He's 40.

501
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,255
Yeah, how does that happen?

502
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,916
Oh, it happens all the time.

503
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,465
Except to me.

504
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,598
Kid's a fucking killer.

505
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,767
What are they talking about in there?

506
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,857
It ain't pretty.

507
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,738
What ain't pretty?

508
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,867
If people stop buying what we're selling.

509
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,247
Jared.

510
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,418
You cannot be doing
what you're thinking of doing.

511
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,041
Well, I don't see any other choice.

512
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,588
What does that mean,
we don't have a choice?

513
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,789
Fuck you, you don't have a choice.

514
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,209
Fuck me?
Did you even look at the numbers, Sam?

515
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,752
Yeah, but what do I know?

516
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,221
Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Shah,

517
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,714
but these numbers, they don't add up.

518
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,217
One and one no longer makes two.

519
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,050
Look, if I may,
I would like a little bit more time.

520
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,427
Jared, we can't tell you yet.

521
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,770
Are you fucking kidding me?
We have talked about this.

522
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:30,233
We need a little more time
to give you our conclusion.

523
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:32,899
Okay. We meet again in 45 minutes.

524
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,863
- Sam, do you have the file?
- Yeah.

525
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,170
What are you going to do?

526
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,842
Are you gonna call him?

527
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,098
I already have.

528
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,114
Jesus.

529
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,412
Wow, that's gorgeous.

530
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,507
It's a long way down.

531
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,755
Yes, it is.

532
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,693
Will, don't do that. Come on.

533
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,656
You know the feeling that people experience

534
00:40:00,657 --> 00:40:04,698
when they stand on the edge like this
isn't a fear of falling.

535
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,280
It's the fear that they might jump.

536
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,993
That's very deep and depressing.
Thank you.

537
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,327
Yeah, well, I'm a little dark sometimes.

538
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,751
All right. Come down, please, Will.
Please, come on.

539
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,127
Will.

540
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,917
Yeah, fuck it.

541
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,338
Not today!

542
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,768
It looks like they're going to
make us dump this shit.

543
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,064
What?

544
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,350
You watch.

545
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,523
How?

546
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,394
You'll see.

547
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,896
How could they do that?

548
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,741
They can't. It's impossible.
But they'll figure a way.

549
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,743
I've been at this company for 10 years,

550
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:49,080
and I've seen things you wouldn't believe.

551
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,541
When all is said and done,
they do not lose money.

552
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,370
They don't mind if everybody else does,

553
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,296
but they don't lose.

554
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,714
Will?

555
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,218
Did you really make
two and a half million last year?

556
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,596
Yeah, sure.

557
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,892
How did you spend it all?

558
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,773
It goes quite quickly.

559
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,773
You know,
you learn to spend what's in your pocket.

560
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:23,398
Two and a half million goes quickly?

561
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,404
All right, let's see.

562
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,609
So the taxman takes half up front,

563
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,032
so you're left with one and a quarter.

564
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,280
My mortgage takes another 300 grand.

565
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,626
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know, keep them going.

566
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:36,952
- So what's that?
- 800.

567
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:38,250
All right, 800.

568
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,920
Spent 150 on a car.

569
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,762
About 75 on restaurants.
Probably 50 on clothes.

570
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,965
- I put 400 away for a rainy day.
- That's smart.

571
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,596
Yeah, as it turns out,
'cause it looks like the storm's coming.

572
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,896
You still got 125.

573
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,521
Yeah, well, I did spend $76,520
on hookers, booze, and dancers.

574
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,321
But mainly hookers.

575
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,775
76,5007

576
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,827
I was a little shocked initially,
but then I realized

577
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,281
that I could claim most of it back
as entertainment. it's true.

578
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,962
- Holy shit!
- Goddamn!

579
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,882
The cavalry is here!
Come on, we should go.

580
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,383
How old are you?

581
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,682
- 43.
- Jesus.

582
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,189
This is bizarre.

583
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,739
It's like a dream.

584
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,956
I don't know, seems like we actually
may have just woken up.

585
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,784
Come in.

586
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,708
How do we look?

587
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,007
- I should go.
- No. You should stay.

588
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,255
So?

589
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,710
It's legit.

590
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,384
The kid killed it.

591
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,342
The formula's worthless.

592
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,347
- What does that mean?
- It's broken.

593
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,393
There are eight trillion dollars of paper
around the world

594
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,065
relying on that equation.

595
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,437
Well, we were wrong.

596
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,815
No, you mean you were wrong.

597
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,022
Now, don't get me started.
We discussed this.

598
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,197
I'm heading for the conference room.

599
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,774
No, I want you to hear this.

600
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,735
I don't want to hear this.

601
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,206
How do you think I've stuck around
this place so long?

602
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,207
I called Tuld.

603
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,761
Do we have a contingency plan here?

604
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:53,051
- A contingency plan?
- Yes.

605
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,766
No, we went all in on this one.

606
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,479
So we've gotten ourselves
quite exposed here, haven't we?

607
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,651
To Tuld or the market?

608
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,904
To both.

609
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,257
He's here?

610
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,119
- Tuld's helicopter just landed.
- I know. Come with us.

611
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,293
- Where's Sam?
- I don't know. You sure you want all of us?

612
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,589
Yes.

613
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,342
One piece of advice for everyone
before we go in there.

614
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,477
This could get a little ugly.

615
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,055
But whatever you do, just tell the truth.
No sugarcoating

616
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,639
Do not change a word of it.

617
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,395
No one here is smart enough,
including the rocket scientist.

618
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,490
- Mr. Cohen.
- Morning.

619
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,990
This way, please.

620
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,167
He's already in there waiting for you.

621
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,499
Excellent.

622
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,147
John.

623
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,197
Please, sit down.

624
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,746
Welcome, everyone.

625
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,541
I must apologize for dragging you all here
at such an uncommon hour.

626
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,962
But from what I've been told, this
matter needs to be dealt with urgently.

627
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,086
So urgently, in fact, it probably
should have been addressed weeks ago.

628
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,418
But that is spilt milk under the bridge.

629
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,677
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

630
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,392
Mr. Tuld, as I mentioned earlier,

631
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,266
if you compare the figure
at the top of page 13...

632
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,895
Jared, it's a little early for all that.
Just speak to me in plain English.

633
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,267
Okay.

634
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,396
In fact, I'd like to speak to
the guy who put this together.

635
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,901
Mr. Sullivan, is it? Does he speak English?

636
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,278
Sir?

637
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,984
I'd like to speak with the analyst

638
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,660
who seems to have
stumbled across this mess.

639
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,785
Certainly. That would be Peter Sullivan.
Right here.

640
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,117
Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you're here.
Good morning.

641
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,951
Maybe you could tell me
what you think is going on here.

642
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:14,002
And please,
speak as you might to a young child

643
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,583
or a golden retriever.

644
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:20,339
It wasn't brains that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

645
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,637
Well, sir, as you may or may not know,
I work

646
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,270
here for Mr. Rogers as an associate
in the Risk Assessment

647
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,266
and Management Office at MBS.

648
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:37,022
Please. Just relax. Stand up.
Tell us in a clear voice.

649
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,482
What is the nature of the problem?

650
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,701
Okay.

651
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,947
As you probably know,
over the last 36 to 40 months

652
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,168
the firm has begun packaging

653
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:56,374
new MBS products that
combine several different tranches

654
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,711
of rating classifications
in one tradable security.

655
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,796
This has been enormously profitable,

656
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,016
as I imagine you noticed.

657
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,308
I have.

658
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,728
The firm is currently doing
a considerable amount

659
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,850
of this business every day.

660
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,848
Now the problem, which is, I guess,
why we are here tonight,

661
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,978
is that is takes us, the
firm, about a month

662
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,856
to layer these products correctly,
thereby posing a challenge

663
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,155
from a Risk Management standpoint.

664
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,245
And, Mr. Sullivan, that challenge is?

665
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:30,865
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

666
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,083
Yes.

667
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,003
But the key factor here is
these are essentially just mortgages.

668
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,998
So that has allowed us to push
the leverage considerably beyond

669
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,674
what you might be willing or allowed to do
in any other circumstance,

670
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,724
thereby pushing the risk profile
without raising any red flags.

671
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,265
Now... Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. Sit down.

672
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,767
What I'm guessing your report here says,

673
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,270
and give me some rope here.

674
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:59,354
What I'm guessing it says is that
considering the, shall we say,

675
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,611
bumpy road we've been on
the last week or so,

676
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,527
that the figures your brilliant co-workers
up the line ahead of you have come up with

677
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,904
don't make much sense any more

678
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,408
considering what's taking place today.

679
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,243
Actually, not what's taking place today,

680
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:17,087
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

681
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,542
So, you're saying
this has already happened?

682
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,001
Sort of.

683
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,713
Sort of.

684
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:30,643
And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model
say that, that means for us here.

685
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,438
Well, that's where it becomes a projection.

686
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,897
But...

687
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,899
You're speaking with me, Mr. Sullivan.

688
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,734
Well, sir,

689
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,275
if those assets decrease by just 25%

690
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,244
and remain on our books,

691
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:54,083
that loss would be greater than
the current market capitalization

692
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,081
of this entire company.

693
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,550
So, what you're telling me

694
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,380
is that the music is about to stop

695
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,846
and we're going to be left
holding the biggest bag

696
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,269
of odorous excrement

697
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,271
ever assembled in the history of

698
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,562
capitalism.

699
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:27,859
Sir, I'm not sure that I would put
it that way. But let me clarify.

700
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,610
Using your analogy,

701
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,488
what this model shows

702
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,416
is the music, so to speak, just slowing.

703
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,161
If the music were to stop, as you put it,

704
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,462
then this model wouldn't be even close
to that scenario.

705
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:46,260
It would be considerably worse.

706
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,016
Let me tell you something, Mr. Sullivan.

707
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,648
Do you care to know why
I'm in this chair with you all?

708
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,145
I mean, why I earn the big bucks?

709
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,477
Yes.

710
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,815
I'm here for one reason
and one reason alone.

711
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:13,412
I'm here to guess what the music might do
a week, a month, a year from now.

712
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,081
That's it.

713
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,121
Nothing more.

714
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,667
And standing here tonight,

715
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:29,095
I'm afraid that I don't hear a thing.

716
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,014
Just

717
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,014
silence.

718
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:56,994
So, now that we Know the music has
stopped, what can we do about it?

719
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,034
Mr. Cohen? Ms. Robertson?

720
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:05,082
I'm afraid I think this is where
you're supposed to step back in.

721
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:09,043
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

722
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,805
What do you have for us?

723
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,939
What have I told you since
the first day you stepped into my office?

724
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,775
There are three ways to make a living
in this business,

725
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,233
be first, be smarter, or cheat.

726
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,902
Now, I don't cheat.

727
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,828
And although I like to think we have
some pretty smart people in this building,

728
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,999
it sure is a hell of a lot
easier to just be first.

729
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,585
Sell it all. Today.

730
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,510
Is that even possible, Sam?

731
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,925
Yes, but at what cost?

732
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,341
I'll have to pay.

733
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,593
Really?

734
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,016
I think so.

735
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,566
Where is this going to come back to us?

736
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,442
Everywhere.

737
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:12,865
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
what your boy here has just said.

738
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,283
If I made you,

739
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,789
how would you do this?

740
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,882
You call the traders in for their normal
6:30 meeting and you be honest with them.

741
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,460
Because they're going to know
it's the end either way.

742
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,672
You're going to have to throw them a bone,
and a pretty big one.

743
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,177
And then you've got to
come out of the gates storming.

744
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,510
No swaps. No nothing.

745
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,890
40% done by 10:15. By 11:00,

746
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,470
all your trades have to be gone

747
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,894
because by lunchtime,
word's going to be out.

748
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:52,019
And by 2:00 you're going to be selling
at 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky.

749
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,024
And then the feds are going to be in here,
up your ass, trying to slow you down.

750
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,324
Ramesh?

751
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,026
They can slow you down.
They can't stop you.

752
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,361
It's yours to sell.

753
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,535
But, John, even if

754
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,744
we manage to pull that off,
and that's saying something,

755
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,332
the real question is,
who are we selling this to?

756
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,426
Same people we've been selling it to
the last two years,

757
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,169
and whoever else will buy it.

758
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,514
But, John, if you do this,

759
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,893
you will kill the market for years.
It's over.

760
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,061
And you're selling something
that you know has no value.

761
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:32,986
We are selling to willing buyers
of the current fair market price.

762
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,190
So that we may survive.

763
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:41,037
You will never sell anything
to any of those people ever again.

764
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,408
I understand.

765
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,327
- Do you?
- Do you?

766
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,200
This is it!

767
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,499
I'm telling you. This is it.

768
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,258
Now, it's 4:00.

769
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:06,052
Jared, you've got till 5:00 to
break this down and draw me up a plan.

770
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:10,354
Is there anybody else who knows what's
in here at the moment, block by block?

771
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,401
Eric Dale.

772
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,148
And where is he?

773
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,314
As of today, he's no longer with the firm.

774
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,117
We have been trying to locate him.

775
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,076
- Carmelo.
- Yes.

776
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,249
Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.

777
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,993
It's done.

778
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,286
We meet back here in an hour.

779
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,499
Sam, let's talk.

780
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,810
This is a hell of a town.

781
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,645
I've always loved this place,
since the day I arrived.

782
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,104
Everything about it.

783
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,787
Sam, are you going to go with me on this?

784
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,457
I don't know, John.

785
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,123
This one is very ugly.

786
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,839
You and I, we're salesmen.

787
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,296
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

788
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,594
Exactly.

789
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,018
And you know damn well
you don't sell anything to anybody

790
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,016
unless you think they're gonna
come back for more.

791
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,349
That's the lesson we learned.
And tomorrow, we're done.

792
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,017
But this is it, Sam.

793
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,319
You keep saying that.
What's that supposed to mean?

794
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,396
This is the big one.

795
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,862
Most of us aren't going to
make it out of this one.

796
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,989
- Us?
- The Street.

797
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,454
What are you talking about?

798
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,495
This isn't the last situation
I'm gonna have to deal with this week.

799
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,791
This is just the start.

800
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,169
It's the start 'cause you're starting it.

801
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,543
Maybe. But I don't believe that.
Not this time.

802
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:00,551
The numbers,
they just don't add up any more.

803
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:04,211
I agree with you there.
I've been saying that for years.

804
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,512
If this kid out there can
come up with this, then...

805
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,261
Look, I just don't think I can
walk in there knowing what I know

806
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,018
and put the hammer down on these guys.

807
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,187
When did you start getting so soft, Sam?

808
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,569
Fuck you, soft. You're panicking

809
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:26,782
If you're the first out of the door,
that's not called panicking.

810
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,545
You're obviously operating
with more information than I have.

811
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,091
But I think this will destroy this firm.

812
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,209
No one will ever trust you again.

813
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,054
You're knowingly putting people
out of business, full stop.

814
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,013
You let me deal with that, Sam.

815
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,158
How'd it go?

816
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,321
This is a fucking shit show.

817
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,703
- They're gonna go with it?
- Probably.

818
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,746
Jesus.

819
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,417
Remember this day, boys.

820
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,254
Remember this day.

821
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,105
So, what's the strategy here?

822
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,436
That's where I'm headed right now.

823
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,362
Downstairs to work on it with my guys.

824
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,941
No, no. You and I with John.

825
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,158
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

826
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,411
Please.

827
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,499
Listen, he knows where we've stood on this

828
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,959
all along.

829
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,593
That's exactly my point.

830
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,849
And knowing what was discussed
by both you and I,

831
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,468
I don't see how this could
provide you with anything

832
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:18,222
other than a false sense of comfort.

833
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,559
I'm not looking for
a sense of comfort here, Sarah.

834
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,316
I don't think there's one to be found.

835
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,870
So, again, what's the strategy here?

836
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,871
I'm just not sure
there's much more to do on this.

837
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,587
It's very simple.

838
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,003
Don't even think about fucking me on this.

839
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,173
'Cause if we're going down,

840
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,471
then you damn well know it'll be together.

841
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,186
No.

842
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,935
I'm not sure that I do know that.

843
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,204
Hey.

844
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,373
Oh, I'm sorry.

845
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,890
What do you guys think
Tuld made last year?

846
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,648
Would you shut the fuck up?

847
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,194
86 million.

848
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,439
In bonuses and salary.

849
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,276
- Really?
- Sure, it's public record.

850
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,657
That is a lot of fucking money.

851
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,581
He was worth a billion.

852
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,657
Was?

853
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,251
Till today.

854
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,329
Really?

855
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,290
You'll see.

856
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,095
I'm going to get some coffee.
You guys want anything else?

857
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,015
- I'm all right.
- I could use some real air.

858
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,092
- Probably a good idea.
- Is it all right, Will?

859
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,144
- Is what all right?
- If I get out of here for a minute?

860
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:22,928
Of course, it's not a prison.

861
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,182
You want me to hold your hand?

862
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,485
Why did they put all this fruit on it?

863
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,949
Hello, Will Emerson.

864
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,122
Hello.

865
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,999
Right.

866
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,711
No, thank you. I understand.

867
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:58,264
No, we'll be discreet.

868
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,142
Thank you.

869
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,519
- What?
- Eric's wife.

870
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,180
He's alive, he's home,
he doesn't want to speak to us,

871
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,649
and he doesn't know that she rang me.

872
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,397
- Where's he live?
- Heights.

873
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,482
- Shall I call Tuld's guy?
- No.

874
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,322
It's Eric. The last thing we need
is those guys going over there.

875
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,863
No, you two go get him
and try to bring him here.

876
01:02:15,864 --> 01:02:18,326
- But you got to be back by 6:00 a.m.
- All right.

877
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,286
I hate Brooklyn.

878
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,417
May I come in?

879
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,669
Of course. Please, sit down.

880
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,592
So...

881
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,978
We're going to do this thing.

882
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,270
Okay.

883
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,560
It's going to be tight.

884
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,901
Is Sam on board?

885
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,570
Not yet.

886
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,704
Sarah,

887
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:07,326
I need a head to feed to the traders
on the floor and the board.

888
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,039
Is it me or Cohen?

889
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,383
It's you.

890
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,976
Of course, you're well aware
that I filtered several warnings

891
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,729
to you and Cohen about this a year ago.

892
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:36,609
I really don't think that's the best path
for you to take at this point.

893
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,574
You're going to be well taken care of here.

894
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,079
Obviously, it is

895
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,118
quite complicated.

896
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,329
John, I was told under
no uncertain terms...

897
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,621
It was always a very gray area.

898
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:59,719
Actually, it was made very clear
at the time by you, me, and Cohen.

899
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:05,224
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't fight me on this.

900
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,023
We all fucked this one up pretty good.

901
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,029
Yes.

902
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,487
We need you to stay here
until this is finished

903
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,822
and the market's closed.

904
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,291
I understand.

905
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:36,169
They'll go over the numbers
with you downstairs.

906
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,590
Good luck.

907
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,268
Oh, fuck. Jared's coming.

908
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,648
What's the boy wonder want?

909
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,909
- You got a minute?
- Just off to pick up Eric.

910
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,740
Yeah. I know. It will only take a second.

911
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,167
All right, what is it?

912
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,870
Tuld and I have concerns that Sam

913
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:17,923
may not be willing to step up
and do the right thing here.

914
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,753
This has never been a problem.

915
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,880
No, it hasn't.

916
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:24,384
But sometimes,
in acute situations such as this,

917
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:29,844
often what is right can take on
multiple interpretations.

918
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,349
Sam will step up.

919
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,185
Oh, I know he will. But if he doesn't...

920
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,901
But if he doesn't,
we need to know that you will.

921
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,067
Thank you.

922
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,574
You need to know that I will what?

923
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,405
That you'll step up.

924
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,952
I have no doubt that
Sam will make the right decision.

925
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,743
But just to make it clear,

926
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,463
he and I have always had
the same interpretation of what's right,

927
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:04,044
no matter how acute the situation.

928
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,918
Jesus, that's a nice place.

929
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,217
Yeah, it is. He just bought it.

930
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,592
I hope it was with cash.

931
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,392
Fuck me,
you're a heartless little shit sometimes.

932
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,724
And it wasn't.

933
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,903
Don't touch any of the buttons.

934
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,571
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

935
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,584
So, Peter finished the model
you were working on.

936
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,419
Really?

937
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,376
It caused a shit storm.

938
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,344
I bet it did.

939
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,763
You think he's right?

940
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,220
I know he's right.

941
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,560
Fuck.

942
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:44,939
All right.

943
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,447
So Jared Cohen called
an emergency meeting

944
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,149
with the senior partners last night.

945
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,818
And based on your findings,

946
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:00,121
they've decided to liquidate
our entire position.

947
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,698
Today.

948
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,248
I'm very sorry about that.

949
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,883
They're worried about you being out here
and they want me to bring you back.

950
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,804
Please.

951
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,173
I'm just saying.

952
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,800
- Fuck them. Fuck them.
- Eric...

953
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,475
- Don't be rash.
- Forget it. I signed my paper. I'm out.

954
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,057
- They'll pay you.
- They got nothing on me.

955
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,232
They'll pay you.

956
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,319
I've been paid enough already.

957
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,524
Fuck.

958
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,288
Do you know I built a bridge once?

959
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,790
- Sorry?
- A bridge.

960
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,744
No, I didn't know that.

961
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,046
I was an engineer by trade.

962
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:56,340
It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio,
to Moundsville, West Virginia.

963
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,212
It spanned 912 feet above the Ohio River.

964
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,807
12,100 people use this thing a day.

965
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,937
And it cut out 35 miles
of extra driving each way

966
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,435
between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

967
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:13,441
That's a combined 847,000 miles
of driving a day.

968
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:18,737
Or 25,410,000 miles a month.

969
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:26,583
And 304,920,000 miles a year saved.

970
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:32,043
Now, I completed that project in 1986.
That's 22 years ago.

971
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,295
So over the life of that one bridge,

972
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:41,472
that's 6,708,240,000 miles

973
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,382
that haven't had to be driven at...

974
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,806
What? Let's say 50 miles an hour.

975
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,980
So that's what?

976
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:52,730
That's 134,164,800 hours.

977
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,858
Or 559,020 days.

978
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,272
So that one little bridge
has saved the people

979
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,616
of those two communities a combined

980
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:04,161
1,531 years of their lives

981
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:07,415
not wasted in a fucking car.

982
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,498
1,531 years.

983
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,253
Jesus.

984
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,479
I guess you better get back over there.

985
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,643
Yeah.

986
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,357
Thanks for coming by.

987
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,987
You're welcome.

988
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,664
Who the fuck is this?

989
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,283
I would imagine it's the firm's people.

990
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,501
What?

991
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,296
They don't want any loose ends.

992
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,300
They fired me. Fuck them. Fuck them.

993
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:03,054
I totally agree. Fuck them.
So come back, take the money,

994
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,838
you'll be home by 5:00.

995
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,512
Otherwise, they're going to
fight you on everything.

996
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:09,852
They're going to fight you
on your package, your options, everything.

997
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,808
Be smart.

998
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,613
Well, you're a better man than me.

999
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,988
- That's always been true.
- Yes, it has.

1000
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,035
House looks good.

1001
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,917
Thanks.

1002
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,754
Hey, Eric.

1003
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,800
Don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, all right?

1004
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,346
Some people like driving
the long way home.

1005
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,469
Who the fuck knows, right?

1006
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,215
There he is.

1007
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,672
John.

1008
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,967
How's it looking?

1009
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,391
Cohen's doing a nice job. It could work.

1010
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,593
What does that mean?

1011
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,354
It means,

1012
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,731
as you very well know,

1013
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,944
that you're a very important piece
of this puzzle.

1014
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,641
That's very generous.

1015
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,597
It's not a gift.

1016
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,562
I need to know you're with me on this.

1017
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,480
I'm with the firm, John.

1018
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,652
I won't get what I need from your boys
on the floor

1019
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:31,987
unless they believe you.

1020
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,908
Unless they believe in you completely.

1021
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,960
Are you in on this?

1022
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,296
I've told you my reservations.

1023
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,548
You can't have reservations.

1024
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,805
And I need to know now.

1025
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,979
Well, John, I am completely with the firm,
as I always have been.

1026
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,397
Excuse me.

1027
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,927
All right, Will, am I getting fired?

1028
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,221
I don't know.

1029
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,675
Yeah.

1030
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,766
Almost definitely. Yes.

1031
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,975
- Are you?
- No.

1032
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,024
Seth, it's nothing you did.

1033
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:50,273
You're just in the wrong firm
at the wrong time.

1034
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,859
Young guys are always
the first to get culled.

1035
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,744
Listen, nothing I'm gonna say
is going to make you feel any better.

1036
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:59,491
It's just going to suck for a while,
and then you'll be fine.

1037
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,038
You all right?

1038
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,549
Yeah. I'm fine.

1039
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:12,796
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

1040
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,756
Don't be. You didn't do it to me.

1041
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,761
Still, at least you're going to have
some nice cash to walk away with.

1042
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,721
I guess.

1043
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,397
Shit, this is really
going to affect people.

1044
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,065
Yeah, it's going to affect people like me.

1045
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,985
No. No. Real people.

1046
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,237
Jesus, Seth.

1047
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,233
Listen, if you really want to
do this with your life,

1048
01:17:32,234 --> 01:17:34,404
you have to believe you're necessary.
And you are.

1049
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,613
People want to live like
this, in their cars

1050
01:17:36,614 --> 01:17:39,079
and the big fucking houses
they can't even pay for,

1051
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,657
then you're necessary.

1052
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,575
The only reason that they all get to
continue living like kings

1053
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,580
is because we've got our fingers
on the scales in their favor.

1054
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,746
I take my hand off,

1055
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:52,625
then the whole world gets really
fucking fair really fucking quickly,

1056
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,470
and nobody actually wants that.
They say they do, but they don't

1057
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,594
They want what we have to give them,

1058
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,142
but they also want to play innocent

1059
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,015
and pretend they have no idea
where it came from.

1060
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,971
That's more hypocrisy
than I'm willing to swallow.

1061
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,728
So fuck... Fuck normal people.

1062
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:11,191
The funny thing is, tomorrow,
if all of this goes tits up

1063
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,820
they're going to crucify us
for being too reckless.

1064
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,776
But if we're wrong

1065
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,487
and everything gets back on track,

1066
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,113
then the same people are going to
laugh till they piss their pants,

1067
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,661
'cause we're gonna look like
the biggest pussies

1068
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,960
God ever let through the door.

1069
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,590
You think we're going to be wrong?

1070
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,003
No, they're all fucked.

1071
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,982
Good morning.

1072
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,901
Peter.

1073
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,983
You want one?

1074
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:58,863
I don't smoke.

1075
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:01,196
Oh, that's good. I don't much either.

1076
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,259
You tired?

1077
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,176
Of what? Remember,
I don't work as hard as you.

1078
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,347
That's not true.

1079
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,174
No, it is, actually.

1080
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,729
We all getting fired tonight?

1081
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:29,057
Probably.

1082
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,558
Are they going to fire you?

1083
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,903
They won't exactly call it that.

1084
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,190
It'll be a mercy killing, really.

1085
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,198
You don't have to stand out here for me.

1086
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,699
No, I don't

1087
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:46,206
really want to go back in there just yet.

1088
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,372
I understand that.

1089
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,455
I think I know your son.

1090
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,127
Really?

1091
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,426
Not well, but he always seemed
like a nice person.

1092
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,761
He is a nice person.

1093
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,349
I guess you could say worse things
about a guy.

1094
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,723
Does he know what's about to happen?

1095
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,721
What do you mean?

1096
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,599
Did you talk to him?

1097
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,853
No, I hadn't even thought...

1098
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,911
They are all coming in now.

1099
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,701
Yes, they are.

1100
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:34,497
Have you ever done anything like this?

1101
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,420
No, never. Not even close.

1102
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,129
Yeah.

1103
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,601
Are you sure it's the only,

1104
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,138
or the right thing to do?

1105
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,772
For who?

1106
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,822
I'm not sure.

1107
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:02,149
Neither am I.

1108
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,855
Oh, God.

1109
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:47,755
You all right?

1110
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,891
You're about to fire me.

1111
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:11,571
This is all I ever wanted to do.

1112
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,082
Really?

1113
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,118
They're almost ready for you,
Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.

1114
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:57,370
You as well?

1115
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,288
Yes.

1116
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,370
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

1117
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,000
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1118
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:24,352
I didn't think they were going to
be able to get you back here.

1119
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,024
Well, they told me they were going to

1120
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:30,365
drag me through hell on everything
over the next two years,

1121
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,534
my options, my health care.

1122
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,662
Or I could come back here and make

1123
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:40,535
$176,471 an hour

1124
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,082
to sit quietly in this room.

1125
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,878
Didn't seem like much of a choice.

1126
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,335
It never is.

1127
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:57,719
Obviously, looking back,
it was expressed with

1128
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,637
insufficient urgency,

1129
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:05,017
but your point was passed on.
I need you to know that.

1130
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:06,648
Eric.

1131
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,734
It's okay. I understand.

1132
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,566
Believe me. There was nothing else
you could have done.

1133
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,701
I guess.

1134
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,083
At the time, it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

1135
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:23,455
It never does.

1136
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,885
You have kids, yeah?

1137
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,735
So, what's your package going to be like?

1138
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,070
I don't know.
That's what I'm waiting for now.

1139
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,069
It's probably going to be pretty good.

1140
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,905
It better be.

1141
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:19,256
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning.

1142
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,509
I know yesterday was pretty bad,

1143
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,594
and I wish I could say that
today's gonna be less so,

1144
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:24,938
but that isn't going to be the case.

1145
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:27,015
Now, I'm supposed to read
this statement to you all here.

1146
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:28,601
But why don't you just
read it on your own time,

1147
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,312
and I'll just tell you
what the fuck is going on here.

1148
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:36,609
I've been here all night
meeting with the executive committee,

1149
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,820
and the decision has been made
to unwind a considerable portion

1150
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:44,200
of the firm's holdings
and several key asset classes.

1151
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:49,963
The crux of it is, in the firm's thinking,

1152
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,250
the party is over as of this morning.

1153
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,506
There's gonna be considerable turmoil
in the markets for the foreseeable future,

1154
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:03,810
and they believe it is better
that this turmoil begin with us.

1155
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,222
As a result,

1156
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,854
the firm has decided to liquidate

1157
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:14,234
its majority position
of fixed income MBS today.

1158
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,861
These are your packets.

1159
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:21,491
You will see what accounts
you're responsible for today.

1160
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:25,123
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long

1161
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:29,201
to understand the implications of this sale

1162
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:31,203
on your relationships
with your counterparties

1163
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,877
and, as a result,

1164
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:35,466
on your careers.

1165
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:40,344
I have expressed this reality
to the executive committee,

1166
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:41,924
and they understand.

1167
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,716
As a result,

1168
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:47,386
if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets,

1169
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:52,518
you will receive
a $1.4 million one-off bonus.

1170
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:56,859
If the floor as a whole
achieves a 93% sale,

1171
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:02,662
you will get an additional
$1.3 million apiece.

1172
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:07,078
For those of you who have
never been through this before,

1173
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,876
this is what the beginning
of a fire sale looks like.

1174
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,748
I cannot begin to tell you how important
the first hour and a half is gonna be.

1175
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,379
I want you to hit every bite you can find.

1176
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:20,544
Dealers, brokers, clients.
Your mother, if she's buying.

1177
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,718
And, no swaps.

1178
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,718
It's outgoing only. Today.

1179
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:33,566
Obviously, this is not going down
the way that any of us would have hoped.

1180
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,228
But the ground is shifting below our feet,

1181
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,073
and apparently there's no other way out.

1182
01:28:58,875 --> 01:28:59,967
Guys,

1183
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:05,928
this is obviously
a very, very unique situation.

1184
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,426
If we are successful today,

1185
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:13,022
we will have been successful
in destroying our own jobs.

1186
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,648
I cannot promise that
any of you, all of you,

1187
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,694
some of you will be
repositioned within the firm.

1188
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:28,076
But I can tell you that I am very proud of
the work that we have done here together.

1189
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,120
I've been at this place 34 years,

1190
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:37,714
and I can tell you from experience
that people are going to say

1191
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,958
some very nasty things
about what we do here today

1192
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:44,680
and about what you've dedicated
a portion of your lives to.

1193
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,510
But,

1194
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:52,517
have faith that in the bigger picture,
our skills have not been wasted.

1195
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,347
We have accomplished much,

1196
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,272
and our talents have been used

1197
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,568
for the greater good.

1198
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,818
Here's your packets. Get to work.

1199
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,355
<i>- City this is Eric.
- Give me Elliot.</i>

1200
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,405
<i>- City.
- Hey, it's Will Emerson.</i>

1201
01:30:46,406 --> 01:30:47,523
<i>William, how are you?</i>

1202
01:30:47,524 --> 01:30:49,366
I'm all right.
How's the trouble and strife?

1203
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:50,578
<i>Busting my ass, as always.</i>

1204
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:53,282
You see, that's what I tried to tell you,
John. Why do you think I'm single?

1205
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,240
<i>I know you did.
What can I do for you?</i>

1206
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,959
Listen. I just got the tap on my shoulder,

1207
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,037
and we've got some risk over here
that we need to move.

1208
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:01,413
So today it looks like
my loss is your gain.

1209
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,757
<i>What kind of size are we talking?</i>

1210
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,042
It should be on your screen.
I just sent it.

1211
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:06,761
<i>Jesus! Where does this land?</i>

1212
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,712
<i>- 96 on the dollar.
- 91.</i>

1213
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,260
All three and we're done at 94.

1214
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,388
<i>- Ninety-three and a half
- Done.</i>

1215
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:15,808
<i>- Trading.
- Hello, gorgeous.</i>

1216
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,560
<i>Will, what's happening over there?</i>

1217
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,141
Well, today's moving day.

1218
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,067
<i>Fuck are you guys so
worked up about?</i>

1219
01:31:21,068 --> 01:31:24,984
You think they tell me anything? All I know
is that today, my loss is your gain.

1220
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,236
Now you're a friendly,
so I've come to you first.

1221
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:31,276
I got 270 mil at 15 year
paying out a point and a half above par.

1222
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:34,121
<i>- Where's it from?
- Where's it from? Do you care?</i>

1223
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:35,748
<i>No, not really.</i>

1224
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,620
<i>Now, where's the trade?
I'm hearing things...</i>

1225
01:31:37,621 --> 01:31:39,415
<i>- Alexis...
- You guys are scaring me a little.</i>

1226
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,589
I'm only sharing this
with you right now. 85.

1227
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:45,046
<i>Done.</i>

1228
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:49,637
<i>- Deutsche.
- It's Will Emerson.</i>

1229
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:51,590
<i>Fuck you, you limey bastard.</i>

1230
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,266
Come on, are you still angry about that?

1231
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:55,602
<i>Word is out. I'm hanging up now.</i>

1232
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,438
<i>- Merrill.
- Lawrence!</i>

1233
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,481
<i>What the fuck are
you guys doing over there?</i>

1234
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,810
<i>- Just a little spring cleaning.
- That is not what I'm hearing.</i>

1235
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,519
All right, Lawrence, are you a buyer?

1236
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,479
<i>I'm not sure any more. Where at?</i>

1237
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,236
Well, it sounds like
I should be asking you where at.

1238
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:09,490
<i>What are we talking about here?</i>

1239
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,942
Three hundred seventy-five mil
at 30 year mixed.

1240
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,412
<i>- Fuck me.
- Are you with me on this?</i>

1241
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,369
<i>- Sixty-three cents.
- Oh, fuck you. I'm hanging up.</i>

1242
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:18,951
<i>Sixty-three.</i>

1243
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,962
Let me call my man here.
I'll come back to you in five.

1244
01:32:21,963 --> 01:32:24,163
<i>It may be 55 in 5.</i>

1245
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:27,043
Well, all right, then. Stay on the line.

1246
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,334
Sam, pick up the phone.

1247
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,804
<i>- Sam, get on the line!
- Yeah.</i>

1248
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,473
<i>- I got Lawrence at Merrill.
- Where are we?</i>

1249
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:35,300
<i>- Sixty-three cents.
- Jesus.</i>

1250
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,843
<i>- On what?
- 375 mix 30.</i>

1251
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:39,470
<i>Get him to 65 and hit it.</i>

1252
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,473
Are you fucking kidding me? That's...

1253
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,981
What is that? That's a $131
million loss on a single trade.

1254
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,233
<i>I understand. Hit it.</i>

1255
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,320
Hey, Lawrence. We're fill or kill at 65.

1256
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:52,821
<i>It's filled.</i>

1257
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:17,763
Well done.

1258
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:26,355
I just want to give you a heads up.

1259
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,688
They're going to start sending
a few people home now.

1260
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:33,237
Now?

1261
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,284
Yes, Sam. No loose ends.

1262
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,042
Of course.

1263
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:46,337
And for what it's worth,

1264
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:49,045
you're still good.

1265
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,214
Yeah, I guess someone upstairs
really likes you.

1266
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:50,810
Sam.

1267
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,817
Please, sit.

1268
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:56,491
Congratulations are clearly in order.

1269
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,452
They did the best they could.

1270
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:04,203
You did a hell of a job.
And I thank you for it. Come on, sit.

1271
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,246
Excuse me for eating,

1272
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,871
but it's been a long day.

1273
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:13,003
- Can I get you something?
- No, nothing. Thanks.

1274
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,175
So, what can I do for you?

1275
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,756
I want out.

1276
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:23,222
I'm done. I want out.

1277
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:28,477
- It's been a very difficult day for everyone.
- I need you to release my options,

1278
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:31,141
if they're worth anything after today.
I want my bonus. I'm out.

1279
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:34,021
You'll get your bonus, your options,
and keep your current base.

1280
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,528
But I need you to stay with me
for the next 24 months, okay?

1281
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:43,487
Oh, come on, Sam.

1282
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,660
Put a smile on your face.

1283
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,658
You did some good today.
You said that yourself.

1284
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,004
Do you know, I'm starting to feel
a little better about this whole thing.

1285
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:56,043
You're one of the luckiest guys
in the world, Sam.

1286
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,968
Could have been digging
ditches all these years.

1287
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,513
That's true.

1288
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,468
And if I had, at least there'd be
some holes in the ground to show for it.

1289
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,219
Jesus.

1290
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,690
I just don't know
how we fucked this up quite so much.

1291
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:16,734
When did you start feeling
so sorry for yourself?

1292
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:18,606
It's unbearable. What?

1293
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,569
So you think we might have put
a few people out of business today.

1294
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,529
That's all for naught.

1295
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:29,496
But you've been doing that every day
for almost 40 years, Sam.

1296
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:34,710
And if this is all for naught,
then so is everything out there.

1297
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,176
It's just money.

1298
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,387
It's made up,

1299
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,802
pieces of paper with pictures on it

1300
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,806
so that we don't have to kill each other
just to get something to eat.

1301
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:49,888
It's not wrong.

1302
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:53,562
And it's certainly no different today
than it's ever been.

1303
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:57,813
1637, 1797,

1304
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:02,275
1819,1837, 1857,1884,

1305
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:06,241
1901, 1907,

1306
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:09,745
1929, 1937, 1974,

1307
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:13,582
1987, Jesus.
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1308
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:16,790
1992, 1997, 2000,
and whatever we want to call this.

1309
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:20,798
It's all just the same thing, over and over.
We can't help ourselves.

1310
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:25,255
And you and I can't control it

1311
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,135
or stop it or even slow it.

1312
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:30,470
Or even ever so slightly alter it.

1313
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:32,976
We just react.

1314
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:36,146
And we make a lot of money
if we get it right.

1315
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:39,195
And we get left by the side of the road
if we get it wrong.

1316
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,113
And there have always been
and there always will be

1317
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:42,862
the same percentage of winners and losers,

1318
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,283
happy fucks and sad sacks,

1319
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,158
fat cats and starving dogs in this world.

1320
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:50,289
Yeah.

1321
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:54,826
There may be more of us today
than there's ever been.

1322
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:58,252
But the percentages,
they stay exactly the same.

1323
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,645
I'll do it, John,
but not because of your little speech.

1324
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,865
But because I need the money.

1325
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:29,864
Hard to believe after all these years,
but I need the money.

1326
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,541
This is the executive dining room.

1327
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:37,245
- Do you want coffee or tea?
- No.

1328
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:43,425
You gonna keep the kid?

1329
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:47,342
Keep him? He's getting promoted.

1330
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,015
It's all hands on deck now, Sam.

1331
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,514
There's going to be a lot of money
to be made coming out of this mess,

1332
01:38:52,515 --> 01:38:56,231
and we're gonna need
all the brains we can get around here.

1333
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,774
Hello.

1334
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:24,944
I've called the police.

1335
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,191
Mary.

1336
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,356
- Sam.
- Yep.

1337
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:32,944
What are you doing?

1338
01:40:48,918 --> 01:40:50,886
Sam, what are you doing?

1339
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,552
Ella died.

1340
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:24,628
I was driving home from the vet
and I couldn't think of where else to go.

1341
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:28,921
- She belongs here.
- I know.

1342
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,298
But, Sam, you don't live here anymore.

1343
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:39,184
Are you all right?

1344
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:42,267
You don't look so good.

1345
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:46,229
Yeah, it's been a rough day
all the way around.

1346
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:48,107
I know, Sammy called.

1347
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,566
Is he all right?

1348
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:52,694
They got hammered, but they got out alive.

1349
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:53,865
Good.

1350
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:04,122
Well, I'm gonna go back inside

1351
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,755
and go back to bed.

1352
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,835
The alarm is on, so don't try and break in.

1353
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,095
Take care of yourself.
