00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,425
是他们吗？
Is that them?

2
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,133
天啊，他们来这做什么？
Jesus Christ.
Are they going to do it right here?

3
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:51,675
你们之前有过这样的经历吗？
Have you guys
ever been through this before?

4
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,883
没有。
- No.

5
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,383
你们最好别理这事，低头做你的事。
it's best to ignore it.
Keep your head down...go back to work.

6
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,550
去吧。
Go on.

7
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,092
别看。
Don't watch!

8
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:27,883
提摩太・欣？
Timothy Singh?

9
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:29,967
我是。
Yes.

10
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:34,175
我们想要和你谈谈。
I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

11
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:49,550
埃里克・戴尔？
Eric Dale?

12
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:54,550
-什么？
-埃里克・戴尔？
- Excuse me?
- Eric Dale?

13
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,925
呃，我不是。
I'm not Eric Dale.

14
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,883
哦，对不起。
Oh. I'm so sorry.

15
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:02,967
他是我老板，在走廊那边。
He's my boss,
he's down the hall.

16
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,592
- 谢了。
- Thanks.

17
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,383
不好意思，戴尔先生？
- Excuse me? Mr. Dale?

18
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,175

00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,050
好吧。
Okay.

20
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,633
我很抱歉……
I'm obviously sorry ...

21
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,842
我们今天来这里
that we are here today;

22
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,925
可现在是特殊时间，你应该很清楚。
but these are extra ordinary times
as you very well must know.

23
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:22,967
听着，我负责风险管理部
Look, I run risk management...

24
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,425
我不觉得这个部门应该是裁员开始的地方。
I don't really see,
how that's a natural place to start cutting jobs.

25
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,092
请你明白这里没有私人恩怨。
- We hope you understand
that this is in no way personal.

26
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,133
这层楼的大部分人都被炒了。
The majority of this floor is being let go today.

27
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,633
这文件里有
Ms. Bratberg is now going to

28
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,800
公司提供的详细赔偿方案。
run through the details;
of what the firm is offering.

29
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:47,663
戴尔先生，公司赔偿你半年工资收入的一半。
Mr. Dale the firm is offering you
six months severance,at half your salary.

31
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:50,508

34
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,467
接受公司的提议，或者重新选举。

35
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,425
明白吗？
Do you understand?

36
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:03,800
明白。
- Yes.

37
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,467
不幸的是，由于你工作的有非常高的机密性
Unfortunately Mr. Dale, due to the
highly sensitive nature of your work here;

38
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:17,175
公司必须要做出相对谨慎的一些行动，也许有些会让你觉得冒犯。
the firm has to take certain precautions
for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature.

39
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:22,008
我希望，你已经为公司工作了19年
I hope considering your.....
over 19 years of service to the firm,

40
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,592
你应该知道，公司的这些行为
you will understand that these measures
are in no way..

41
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:29,342
丝毫没有对你的工作或者性格有不满的意思。
a reflection of the firm's feelings
towards your performance or your character.

43
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,508
-我不明白。
-她在向你道歉，
- I don't understand.
- She's apologizing...

44
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,425

46
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,925
还有大楼的通行证，你的手机信息和服务
access to the building,
and your mobil data and phone service

47
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,508
在这会议结束后将都会终止。
will all be severed as of this meeting.

48
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,758
这位先生会带你去你的办公室把你的私人物品带走。
And, This gentleman, will take you to your office.
So, you can clear out your personal belongings.

49
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:58,967
那我现在在做的事情怎么办？
What about the..
what I'm currently working on?

50
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:04,842
有的事我正做到一半……
-公司已经有了移交计划，也准备好了怎么继续下去
I'm in the middle of something...
- The firm has worked out its transition plan.
and is prepared to move forward,

51
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:07,258
但是我们还是很感谢你能考虑到这些。
But, we do we appreciate your concern.

52
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,758
我们知道这很难让人接受，这是我的名片
We understand that this is very difficult;
and here is my card.

53
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:17,800
如果在接下来的几周内，
你对这影响一生的转变有什么困难请联系我。
Please contact me over the next few weeks,

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,050
你没事？
嗯，暂时的。
Are you still alive?
- Uh huh..For now.

56
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,967
不错。
Congratulations.

57
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:24,550
真是一场血战啊。
-我听说了。
It's a bloodbath.
- I heard.

58
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,217
听着，埃里克
Listen Eric?

59
00:07:28,217 --> 00:07:31,550
如果有什么事我能做我就做了。
If there was something I could have done,
I'd have done it.

60
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,092
好吧，告诉我是谁？
Just tell me...Who was it?

62
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,675
罗杰斯？
-我不会说，你知道的。
Was it Rogers?
- I'm not gonna side, you know me.

63
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,717
罗伯特森？
Robertson?

64
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,967
这个骚逼。我就知道，我去年就该去找她的。
That cunt. I knew it. I never should have
gone to her last year.

65
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,092
埃里克你知道，这只是运气不好。
Look it wasn't anyone. It was bad luck.
And that's all it was.

66
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,675
好吧，好运。
Alright, Well...Good luck.

67
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:14,133
威尔，我知道这里很多破逼事儿，你最好来看看。
I was just in the middle of alot of shit here
that I think somebody need to take a look at.

68
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,217
埃里克……
Eric Listen...

69
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,175
他们说所有人都要离开这，别碰这里的东西。
They are telling us that everybody needs
to get out of here and just leave this.

70
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:28,383
我跟感激你能这么想，
但是这不再是你个人的问题了。
And while we appreciate your concern,
but it's not your problem anymore.

71
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:34,592
祝你好运。
Good luck.

72
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,592
埃里克，我们很抱歉。
Eric, I am very sorry.

73
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,675
他们要炒了我们吗？
id they say what was going to happen with us?

74
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:18,467
行了，塞斯。
Jesus Seth.
- What?

75
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,383
这里最近会一直这样
It's gonna get pretty ugly around here for a while..

76
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,092
但你们应该没事。
but you guys will be alright.

77
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:31,967
我们回头见，好吗？
好。

我想对你说声谢谢。
I just wanted to say thanks.

80
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,467
没这个必要。
-有必要有必要。
That's not neccessary.
- Well, it is.

81
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:06,550
你是这里的负责人……
-我知道。
You were the person around here, that I..
- I know.

82
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,592
这个事情我做了一半，他们不让我继续了。
I was working on something
But they wouldn't let me finish it.

83
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:17,633
你看看吧。
So, take a look at it.

84
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:20,675
小心点。
Be careful.

85
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,508
罗伯特森？
Robertson?

86
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,550
塞拉？
Sarah?

87
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:00,842
你把我手机屏蔽了？
You shut off my phone?

88
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,550
埃里克，我什么都没做。
Eric, I didn't do anything.

89
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,050
操你妈！
Fuck you!

90
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,342
真他妈不容易啊。
It's fucking hedious.

91
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,383
总是要先变糟了才能变好。
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.

92
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,467
来根儿烟？
You got any Nicorettes?

93
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,050
戒了。
I'm out of Nicorettes.

94
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:49,758
也就是说……
Which means, in about..

95
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,467
过10分钟我要杀人了。（不抽烟）
Ten minutes. I'm gonna kill someone.

96
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,550
你没事吧，山姆？
You alright Sam?

97
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,925
我的狗快死了。
My dog is dying.

98
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,092
对不起。
I'm sorry?

99
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,008
打电话给兽医了，
Just got a phone to the vet,

100
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:11,508
他妈的在她的肝上长了个瘤。
it's some fucking tumor on her liver.

101
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,383
我每天都要花一千美元让她活着。
I must've paid almost a thousand bucks
a day already, just to keep her alive.

102
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:20,425
我都不知道还能他妈的做些什么了，威尔。
and I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

103
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,883
他们都……他们都走了。
Well they're all gone.

104
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:30,050
那……
So?

105
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,258
我们还剩下多少人？
How many do we have left?

106
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,758
大概33个。
About, Thirty-three.

107
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,842
把他们都叫起来，我要跟他们说个事儿。
Make sure everyone is out there,
I gotta say something.

108
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:43,800
他们都在，都准备好了。
Yeah, I know.
They are ready.

109
00:12:55,717 --> 00:13:00,050
好了，大家听着！
Alright, Let's hear it!

110
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,092
你们留下来是有原因的
You are all still here for a reason...

111
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:12,300
这层楼80%的人都离开这里了，也不会再回来。
eighty percent of this floor was just sent home...
forever.

112
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,217
我们花了一个小时和他们说再见。
We have spent the last hour saying our good-byes...

113
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,092
他们都是好人，他们都干得不错
they were good people and
they were good at their jobs...

114
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,175
但你们做得更好。
but you all were better.

115
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,258
现在他们走了，这里再也不会有人去考虑他们。
Now they are gone.
They are not to be thought of again.

116
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,550
这是你们的机遇。
This is your opportunity.

117
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,633
这栋楼的所有楼层，从香港到伦敦的所有办公室，
都在发生同样的事
On every floor of this building and in every office
from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening.

118
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:34,967
等这些都结束了
By the time we are done..

119
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:36,883
你和你上级中间
3 of every seven guys;

120
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,842
七分之三的人都会离开。
who were standing
between you and your boss's job...are gone.

121
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,008
这就是你们的机遇。
That is your opportunity.

122
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:51,758
我在这里工作了34年。
I've been at this place for thirty-four years.

123
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,508
告诉你们，这不会是你们最后一次经历这样的事。
And I can tell you that this will not be
the last time you're gonna go through this.

124
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:57,008
但你们都是幸存者。
But you all are survivors...

125
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:01,383
这也就是为什么这家公司在107年之后
And that is how this firm over 107 years,

126
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,092
还越来越壮大。
has continued to grow stronger.

127
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,508
所以，开心点，回去工作，鼓掌吧。
So, keep your heads high... and get back to work.
Let's hear it.

128
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,467
大家都走了，你也走吧。
Everyone is going out man...
you should come on.

129
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,508
我没事。
- Oh, I'm cool. Thanks.

130
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:07,967
好吧，如果你改主意了，给我打电话。
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
jut give me a call.

131
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,050
我会的。
I Will.

132
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,550
走吧！
Come!

133
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,550
你们去哪儿？
-大地酒吧。
Where are you guys going?
- The Grand.

134
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:18,758
我干完了给你打电话。
I'll call you when I'm done.

135
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,008
嘿，为了我们还能留下来，高兴点。
Hey, Be glad, you're still alive.

136
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,425
嗯，没错。
I am.

137
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:02,592
喂？
Yeah, Hello.

138
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:06,008
我听不见。
I can't hear you.

139
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:12,758
你能出去说吗？你那太吵了。
Can you go outside, It's too loud.

140
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,925
你们在哪儿？
-大地酒吧。
Where are you?
- Lugo.

141
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:24,383
威尔在吗？
威尔・艾默生？
Are you with Will?
- Yeah, Will Emerson?

142
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:25,425
他应该还在，怎么了？
Yeah, I think he's still here.

143
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:29,717
好吧我要你和威尔一起回来。
I need you to get Will
and I need you guys to come back up here.

144
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:30,758
呃，回哪儿？
-办公室。
Uh, Where?
- To the office.

145
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,592
- 什么？
- 说正经的呢。
- What?
- I'm serious.

146
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,800
你要我把咱们老板的老板
You want me to get our boss's boss out of

147
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,550
在周四晚上10点钟从酒吧弄回公司？
a club and bring him back to the office...
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

148
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:44,050
咱们老板被解雇了，理论上现在他是咱的老板，
我的确要你这么做。
Our boss just got axed,so technically
he is our boss, and yes that's what I want you to do.

149
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,092
为啥？
Why?

150
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,092
听着哥们儿，相信我，好吗？
我要你们现在回来。
Look man, Just trust me okay.
I need you guys back here, now.

151
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:50,133
好吧，10分钟。
Alright, we'll be there in ten.

152
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,717
嘿，看看谁在点蜡烛庆祝啊！
Hey, look who it is,
burning the candleat both ends.

153
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,508
为什么你不和我们一起去啊？
Why didn't you come out with us?

154
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:30,925
又没有其他的裁员计划，又不会让你舔我屁眼儿的。
There aren't anymore cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my arse.

155
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:33,925
说真的我都不知道你们要干吗？
I frankly, don't even know,
what it is you guys do.

156
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,717
威尔我很抱歉让你们回办公室。
- 没关系。
Will, I am so sorry I had to bring you guys back..
- That's alright.

157
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:42,342
埃里克走之前给我这个文件。
Eric gave me this file before he left.

158
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:46,092
他说他看不出里面是什么
And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out,

159
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:51,342
在电梯门快关上的时候
他对我说的最后一句话是“小心点”。
And the last thing he says as
the doors on the elevator close is 'be careful'.

160
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,300
他说小心点？
- 对，所以我有点好奇，就打开看了。
He said, Be careful?
- Yeah, So..obviously..I'm little curious.

161
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:56,592
然后我就意识到，这里的事情……
I get into it a bit and I realize that
the only thing missing..

162
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:00,133
不是什么好事，威尔。
This is not good, Will.

163
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,508
都打开，这样看着更清楚。
Go to model four, it makes more sense.

164
00:21:05,592 --> 00:21:07,008
这是什么？
What is this?

165
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:12,800
这基本上是我们帐目里的所有东西。
埃里克在试着算出
This is basically everything that we have in our books.
At any given time. But what Eric was trying to do

166
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:18,800
这些数据波动的杠杆，不在标准估计亏损风险模型中的可能性。
is to work this numbers for levers of volatility;
that fall outside of our standard VAR model.

167
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,842
什么杠杆？
What are those levers?

168
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:20,717
这……有点复杂……
简单说。
Well it's a fairly complicated...
- Simplify.

169
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,092
这些杠杆是由历史数据设置
The volatility levers are set using..

170
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,967
然后再按照10%或者15%的分级设置。
historic patterns basically, an then
stretching those patterns out on a 10-15%... roughly.

171
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:33,800
好吧，然后呢？
- 然后我们开始测试那些证券的走势。
Alright, So?
- So, We are starting to test those historic patterns.

172
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,842
什么时候？
- When?

173
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:35,883
今天
Today?

174
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:38,383
周一
Monday...

175
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,717
还有上周五和周三。
- 还有两周之前的周五。
Last friday and wednesday..
- Two Fridays ago.

176
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:43,717
好吧，我明白了。
Alright, I get it.

177
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,633
我操，这个曲线方向完全反了，这是……
Fuck me. Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...

178
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,467
他妈的差这么多。
有多大？
It's huge.
- How huge?

179
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,967
损失好像比公司目前的市值还高……
The losses are greater than the current
value of the company...?

180
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,008
还有项目呢，加上项目上的损失，威尔。
Projected...Projected losses...Will.

181
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,425
这还只是我们这层的？
- 没错。
This is just our floor?
- Yes.

182
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,967
埃里克・戴尔在他妈哪儿呢？
- 我不知道，我一直在联系他但是他关机了。
Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
- I don't know. Tried to call him, his phone's off.

183
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:13,133
什么意思？
- 他们把被裁的人的手机都屏蔽了。
What do you mean?
- They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.

184
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,258
真他妈傻逼。
Fucking ruthless.

185
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:21,467
给他家里打电话。
- 在这个点儿？
Call his home.
- At this hour?

186
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:25,967
对，你确定他是正确的吗？
- 在我看是没什么错了。
Yes... Do we even know if he's right?
- Looks pretty fucking  right to me.

187
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,050
戴尔夫人，我是威尔・艾默生。
Mrs. Dale. This is Will Emerson

188
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,842
我很好，谢谢。能叫下埃里克吗？
I'm fine, thank you.
May I speak with Eric?

189
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,925
找不到，我们试过了，他手机关机了。
你能让他给我打电话吗？
No, we've tried that. His phone appears to be off.
Listen, could you have him call me?

190
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,050
他一回来就让他给我打，他一进门就让他给我打。
The moment he comes in...
the moment he walks through the door.

191
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:47,967
谢谢你，再见。
Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

192
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:51,050
- 他他妈的去哪儿了？
- 他好像有三个孩子。 - 所以呢？
- Where the fuck is he?
- Doesn't he have like three kids?  - So?

193
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:53,383
我不知道，你有三个孩子的话你会不回家吗？
I don't know, would you go home?

194
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:56,842
我知道他去哪儿了。
I know where he is.

195
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:01,383
你们俩去接他。
I need you two, to go and get him.

196
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:04,008
楼下会有车等你们，去吧。
There will be a car waiting for you downstairs.
You need to go.

197
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,592
- 现在？
- 没错，现在。
- Right now?
- Yeah, Right now.

198
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:12,758
- 你要去干什么？
- 我给山姆打电话。
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna call, Sam.

199
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,717
真操蛋。
Fuck me.

200
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,717
- 喂？
- 我威尔。
- Yes?
- It's Will.

201
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:35,300
现在是夜里11点。
It's 11 O'clock at night?

202
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,925
我知道，我不改这会儿给你打电话……
I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...

203
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:42,300
你想你该回趟公司。
I think you need to get back here.

204
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,008
现在可是夜里11点！
It's 11 O'clock at night!

205
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:51,925
我他妈的知道几点！
山姆，你得来看看这个。
I'm well aware of the fucking time!
Sam, I'm telling you..You need to see this.

206
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:54,967
看什么啊？
See what?

207
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,050
发邮件给我。
Email it to me.

208
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,842
我觉得你还是回来一趟吧。
I don't think that would be a good idea.

209
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:04,842
好吧我来了。
I'm on my way.

210
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:12,633
看看这些人。
Look at these people.

211
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:20,217
在这瞎逛荡，根本不知道要发生什么了。
Wandering around, with absolutely no idea..
what's about to happen.

212
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:27,092
对么？
- 我试着不去那么想。
Right?
- Well, I try not to let work get to me like that.

213
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,967
你怎么想？
I've noticed that about you.

214
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:36,883
行了别逗了，我们才23岁。
- 我28了。
Look, we are twenty three years old...
- I'm 28.

215
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:44,550
我去年赚了差不多25万美元。
I made nearly,
a quarter of a million dollars last year...

216
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:50,175
卧勒个去，为了什么？
我自己的数据在电脑屏幕上
Fuck! for what...? Pushing some numbers
around on a computer screen,

217
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:54,175
一帮高傲的傻逼看着这些数据假装什么都懂
so a bunch of glorified crack addicts
could take that  information and pretend to understand it,

218
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:57,133
然后再拿这些数据去忽悠全世界的穷逼。
and then make a bet against some other
jock half way around the world who if he..

219
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:01,217
知道吗？我如果不做这个我可能会在赛马场赌7号什么的。
wasn't doing this, he'd be putting number seven
or you know??

220
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,925
最后总是有人赢也有人输。
And at the end of the day one guy win
and the other guy loses.

221
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,217
你知道实际上比这个要复杂得多，对吧？
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that? Right?

222
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:10,675
没错。
Yeah.

223
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,592
是威尔，问我们有没有找到他呢，怎么说？
It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him?
What do say?

224
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,633
就说……还没找到他呢。
I would say...that
we haven't found him, Yet.

225
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,633
埃里克・戴尔的数据……
Eric Dale...

226
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,300
哦上帝啊……
- 在他由那个傻逼保安看着离开大楼的时候……
Oh Jesus...
- Before he leaves the building, escorted by fucking security...

227
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:59,175
这跟我没关系。
I had nothing to do with that.

228
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,633
他离开之前把他的一个U盘给了皮特・苏利文
Before he leaves the building
he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

229
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,550
谁是皮特・苏利文？
- 别管那么多了，是我们的人。
Who's Peter Sullivan, again?
- Don't matter, One of Eric's guys.

230
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,092
在电梯门关上之前
Before, the elevator doors are closing..

231
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:10,925
他说的最后一句话是
The last thing he says is...

232
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:12,800
“小心点”
'Be Careful'

233
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,508
“小心点”？
- 没错。     - 什么意思？
'Be Careful'?
- Yeah.               - Why?

234
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:19,550
看看这个。
Take a look.

235
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:26,133
哦天啊，你知道我看不了这个。
直接告诉我吧。
Oh Jesus, You know i can't read this fucking thing!
Speak to me in English.

236
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:32,133
这个叫皮特・苏利文的小子因为你所说的话的激励，
顺便说一句，你讲的确实不错
Basically, this kid, Peter Sullivan..
He gets all inspired by you pep talk, Nice job! By the way..

237
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,008
开完会之后他埋头苦干，
He dealt straight in, after work.

238
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:37,758
现在我觉得他找到问题所在了。
- 找到了？
And I think he nailed it.
- Nailed it?

239
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:40,175
是的，我觉得他找到了埃里克没找出的问题。
Yeah, I think he figured out what Eric was missing.

240
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:44,133
看上去不怎么样，山姆。
...it isn't good, Sam.

241
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:46,717
这些是……
These here are the...

242
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:53,550
股市上历史数据的指标变化，是我们系统分析的主要依据……
historical volatility index limits, which of course,
our entire trading model relies on pretty fuckingheavily...

243
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:57,175
我们现在做的事很大程度上都依赖这个东西。
但是当这些数据都超过预警限制之后，
And well, we are now so levered up.
But once it gets outside those limits

244
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,217
事情立马就变得很操蛋了。
it gets ugly in a hurry.

245
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:02,717
我们离预警限制有多近？
And how close to those limits have we gotten?

246
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:05,008
哦山姆，我们超过了预警……
Oh Sam, we're beyond close...

247
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:11,092
之前的两周里，我们已经冲破这些预警限制5、6次了
We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks,
Now somehow, we've managed

248
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,258
现在我们又回到了限制区域内，就现在来说……
- 现在？
to stay on the upside  of it... for now...
- For now?

249
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,967
你看，这是接下来如果我们跑到限制之外会发生的事。
Well look.. what happens here
when we get on the wrong side of it.

250
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:25,925
等一下，我们在看什么？
What am I looking at?

251
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:26,758
来看这儿的数字。
You're looking at this figure here.

252
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:32,508
喔……这个是？
- 没错。
Wow...is that?
- Yeah.

253
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,008
尽管这不是历史上我们经历过的最糟糕的情况。
And that wouldn't even be that bad a day
for us... historically speaking.

254
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:37,050
这个数据对吗？
Is that figure right?

255
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:40,425
埃里克・戴尔呢？
- 我们把他的手机屏蔽了。
Where is Eric Dale?
- We shut his phone off.

256
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,550
然后我给他老婆打了电话，她说他不在家。
So, I called his wife.
Who says,  he's not home.

257
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:46,425
他他妈的蹲在哪儿哭呢吧……
He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere.

258
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:49,925
发现这个事儿的小子呢？
- 我让他们出去找埃里克了。
Where's the kid who did this?
- Out looking for Eric.

259
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:54,967
你觉得他知道自己在干什么吗？
- 让他们回来，赶快！
Do you think he knows what he's doing?
- Get him back.

260
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:13,133
这些女的一晚上挣多少钱？
1500美元？

261
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,508
2000美元？
2 grand?

262
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:50,758
好吧，没问题。
Okay,
Yeah.

263
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:07,217
好吧，那你说罗杰斯一年挣多少钱？
Alright, so come on,
What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?

264
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:09,800
我不知道……
I have no idea?

265
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,342
猜一个。
Come on, play along.

266
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,175
30多万？
Three quarters of a million?

267
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,633
别逗了。
Come on.

268
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:21,967
这也太不沾边儿了。
Not even close.

269
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:24,883
要多得多。
Much more.

270
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,550
100万？
A million?

271
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,175
威尔・艾默生去年挣了250万.
Will Emerson made two and half million last year.

272
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,508
你怎么知道的？
How do you know that?

273
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:38,300
他告诉我的，我问他了。
He told me.  Well I asked him.

274
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,717
靠谱儿吗？
- 差不多吧。
Do you think that's true?
- Yeah probably.

275
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,675
真操蛋……
- 为毛啊？
That's fucked up.
- Why, why's that fucked up?

276
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:54,467
你觉得这正常吗？
- 对吧，正常……是吗？
Does that seem right to you?
Right?

277
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:56,508
上帝啊。
Jesus.

278
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:03,258
所以你想想罗杰斯挣了多少？
- 我真没这个概念，塞斯。我就知道堵车真他妈烦。
So, what do you think that means Rogers puts away?
- I have no idea, Seth. This traffic's a fucking nightmare.

280
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:27,842
伙计们？
Gentlemen?

281
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:31,800
和我们一起来吧。
Come with us, please.

282
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:40,925
山姆，这是我说的塞斯・布雷格曼和皮特・苏利文。
Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.

283
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:48,800
我们这是去哪儿？
Where are we going?

284
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:51,425
我们去看看对你刚才的工作别人有什么意见。
Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.

285
00:31:29,217 --> 00:31:30,800
山姆你有什么要给我们看的？
So Sam what do you have for us?

286
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,050
他们等会儿就来，这个时候找个人做点什么还真是不容易。
Well... they'll be here in a minute. Finding someone
in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.

287
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:40,133
好吧我们先介绍一下吧。这是塞拉・罗伯特森，
首席风险评估分析师。
Okay, let's go right into introduction. This is Sarah Robertson
who you know, chief risk assessment officer..

288
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:45,592
拉米什・沙，楼上办公室的，大卫・宏公司内部的咨询师。
Ramesh Shah from upstairs and David Horn
one of the firm's in house council.

289
00:31:46,425 --> 00:31:47,633
很高兴见到你们，这位是我们的交易负责人，威尔・艾默生。
Nice to meet you all.
This is my head of trading, Will Emerson.

290
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:53,383
皮特・苏利文和塞斯・布雷格曼，都是风险部的。
Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman.
They work in our risk department.

291
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:54,425
埃里克・戴尔呢？
Where is Eric Dale?

292
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,258
他在今天被解雇了。
He was let go today.

293
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,758
那你们风险部还剩下谁？
Who's left in your risk department?

294
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:02,800
今天在我们这的是皮特
As of today that would be Peter

295
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:04,842
和我们的初级分析师塞斯。
and our junior analyst Seth...?

296
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:12,050
威尔・艾默生？
- 发给大家吧。
Will Emerson?
- Please just hand it out.

297
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,800
显然埃里克已经分析了一段时间了，但是没能完成。
Apparently Eric had been working on
this for some time but was unable to finish it,

298
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,967
今天早上他离开公司的时候
This morning, when he left the building;

299
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:34,175
他把这件事交给皮特让他看看。
He handed the program to Peter here,
and asked him to take a look at it.

300
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,717
皮特看了。
Peter did.

301
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,592
他把埃里克没做的几件事做了。
He put in a few things out that
Eric seemed to be missing..

302
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:39,592
你看到的这就是结果。
and this is what came out.

303
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:43,967
皮特这是你做的？
Peter, Is this your work?

304
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,300
大部分是戴尔先生的工作……
Mostly Mr. Dale's...

305
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,967
但是这是你的手稿？
- But is this your draft?

306
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,050
对。
- Yes.

307
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:56,300
我只是在戴尔先生的基础上进行了展开。
嗯，是我做的。
Again, expanded on original
work of Eric's. But yes.

308
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,133
- 你是什么背景？
- 我的背景？
- What is your background?
- My background?

309
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:01,800
- 你的简历。
- 我在公司一直和埃里克一起工作，已经两年半了……
Your CV.
-  I've been with the firm for 2 and half years
working with Eric that whole time...

310
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:06,508
但是我还有MIT的工程师和专业推动力学的博士学位。
But I hold a doctorate in engineering, speciality in propulsion,
from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.

311
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,092
专业推动力学是什么？
What's a specialty in propulsion, exactly?

312
00:33:08,717 --> 00:33:15,342
我的论文是关于固定配比现有数据对重力流失方面的研究。
My thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect
steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.

313
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:17,217
- 所以你是个火箭科学家？
- 曾经是。
So, you are a rocket scientist?
- I was.

314
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:24,217
有意思，那你怎么又来了这？
Interesting.
How did you end up here?

315
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:28,883
反正都是数字么，只是改变一下计算的方式……而且坦白地说，
Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing
what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely;

316
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:29,925
这里的收入更吸引人。
the money here is,
considerably more attractive.

317
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:40,717
现在几点了？
What time is it?

318
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:43,217
2：15。
It's 2:15.

319
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,383
我想你们两位还没让麦斯知道这事儿？
And I'm guessing, by the fact that
you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?

320
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,342
我们需要时间分析下这个，
Look, we'd need some time to go over this,

321
00:33:55,217 --> 00:33:56,800
苏利文好像很清楚他在做什么。
but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
know what he's doing.

322
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,925
所以看来我们好像有点问题了。
So, it would appear we have a problem.

323
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,217
- 几点了？
- 2：16。
- What time is it?
- 2:16.

324
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:04,258
操他妈的。
Fuck me.

325
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:07,592
操。
Fuck me.

326
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,050
山姆……
Sam..

327
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,258
把这事儿从我们的帐目上摆平，你的人一般需要多长时间？
How long under normal operations,
would it take your people to clear that from our books?

328
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:25,883
什么？
What?

329
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,675
- 所有的？
- 没错。
- All of it?
- Yes.

330
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:30,800
我不知道，几周吧。
I don't know, weeks.

331
00:34:31,758 --> 00:34:32,967
- 几周？
- 没错，几周。
- Weeks?
- Yeah, weeks.

332
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:38,300
但你很清楚我们的生意是要买和卖。
But as you certainly know
our business is selling AND buying.

333
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,050
没有任何一方都做不成。
Doesn't work for very long without both components.

334
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,800
如果我们现在停止买入一两天，
We suddenly stops buying for a day or two;

335
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,717
这可不是什么能藏得住的事，
that's not something you can
ust doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out

336
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:51,008
一旦传出去……很快我们就玩儿完。
and when it does...
this whole this thing comes to a end... and  right quick.

337
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,133
- 我明白了。
- 真的？
- I understand.
- Do you?

338
00:34:57,717 --> 00:34:58,633
真的。
Yes.

339
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,175
你和皮特森的楼层上还剩下多少交易员？
How many traders do we have left between
your floor and Petersen's?

340
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:05,217
- 我不知道，应该是……60个？
- 对，60个。
I don't know, what? Sixty?
- sixty.

341
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:10,467
我们再仔细看看这个，毕竟这是用估计亏损风险数值算出来的。
Jared as I looke at this more closely,
it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.

342
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,467
就像我刚才说的，直说的话，
As I was saying..just speaking completely off the record.

343
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,175
用不了多久就会有人发现我们的这些问题。
It's only a matter of time
before someone else startsputting these in.

344
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,217
他们也会算出同样的结果。
and they come up with exactly the same results.

345
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,383
就是我们现在看的这份。
And look at exactly
what we're looking at right now;

346
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:39,258
如果他们现在还没有看到的话。
If they haven't already.

347
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:40,300
明白了。
Understood.

348
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:43,008
萨拉，你允许放在账面上的资产价值是多少？
And Sarah, what value would you allow to be
placed on those assets

349
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:45,508
如果必须放的话？
that might be left on the books,
if they had to?

350
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:47,467
为什么还在账面上？
Why would they still be on the books?

351
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:52,050
- 因为显然没有人愿意去买这些傻逼玩意儿了。
- 你妈逼山姆！你丫让我安静会儿行吗？
- Because suddenly nobody wants to fucking buy them.
- Fuck you Sam! Will you give me a fucking break here?

352
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:56,258
没有市场的话，这要花上几周甚至几个月的时间
我才能算出精确的数字。
Without an active market, it'd take weeks or months
for me to come up with accurate value on them.

353
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,217
我要一排一排的算。
You'll have to go block by block.

354
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:09,633
塞斯，你们给我们点时间好吗？
Seth, Could you please,
give us for a few moments.

355
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:12,925
皮特？
And Peter?

356
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:17,217
- 还有人知道这个吗？
- 除了我们没别人了。
- Has anyone else has seen this?
- No one aside from us.

357
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,092
- 还有埃里克・戴尔？
- 对。
- And Eric Dale?
- Yes.

358
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:22,467
而且我们还不知道埃里克・戴尔在哪儿？
And can it really be possible that we don't know,
where Eric Dale is?

359
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:26,592
我给他老婆打电话了，他还没回家……
而且我们还把他的手机屏蔽了。
I called his wife. He hasn't come home yet
...and we turned off his phone today.

360
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:31,758
真牛逼。我想知道他去哪儿了。
Perfect. Well, I'd like to know where he is.

361
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,383
我了个擦擦，那家伙是谁啊？
Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?

362
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,467
- 山姆的老板。
- 我以为他应该得有50岁了。
- He's Sam's boss.
- He looks like he's fifteen years old.

363
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:50,758
- 他才40。
- 怎么会有这种事儿？
- He's Forty.
- Yeah, How does that happen?

364
00:36:54,383 --> 00:36:55,300
这种事儿一直就有。
Oh it happens all the time.

365
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:04,467
除了我以外。他就是他妈的杀人犯。
Except to me.
He's a fucking killer.

366
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,758
他们在里面会谈些什么呢？
What are they talking about, in there?

367
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,217
不会是什么好事。
It aint pretty.

368
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:18,050
会是什么不好的？
What aint pretty?

369
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,592
如果大家都不买我们的货了……
If people suddenly stop buying what we're selling....

370
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:32,508
杰瑞，你不能想做什么就做什么。
Jared, you cannot be doing
what you are thinking about doing?

371
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,342
我没什么别的选择。
Well, I don't see any other choice.

372
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:37,092
什么意思？你他妈没的选择？
What does that mean?
Fuck you... you don't have a choice.

373
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:39,633
我有吗？山姆你到底有没有看过这些数字？
Fuck me? Did you even looked at the numbers Sam??

374
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,425
当然，我看过。
Yes, but what do I know.

375
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:43,467
沙，如果我说错了纠正我一下。
Correct me, if i'm wrong, Mr.Shah.

376
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,508
但是这些数据不再是
These number, they don't add up.

377
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:47,467
1+1=2这么简单的做加法了。
One and one, no longer makes Two.

378
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,175
如果可以的话，我还需要一些时间……
If I may, I'd like a little more time.

379
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,717
- 我们之前就谈过这个。
- 我们需要点时间才能给你结果。
- We have talked about this.
- We need a little time before to give you our conclusion.

380
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,508
好吧，我们45分钟之后见。
We meet again in 45 minutes.

381
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,467
山姆，你有那份文件吗？
Sam, do you have the file?

382
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:18,925
你想怎么办？
What are you going to do?

383
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,592
给他打电话？
Are you going to call him?

384
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,133
我已经打了。
I already have.

385
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:46,508
上帝啊。
Jesus.

386
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:53,800
哇，太漂亮了。
Wow. It's gorgeous.

387
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,633
这掉下去也要花不少时间。
It's a long way down.

388
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,300
是啊。
Yes, it is.

389
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:19,758
我靠，别这样。
Don't do that, C'mon.

390
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,925
知道么有人站在这个边缘要掉下去的时候害怕的不是他们会掉下去。
Did you know the fear most people feel
when they stand on the edge like this isn't the fear of falling.

391
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:30,925
而是怕他们可能会自己就跳下去。
It's the fear that they might jump?

392
00:39:33,717 --> 00:39:35,258
这玩意儿可深了……
Well, that's very deep and depressing, thank you.

393
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,467
我有时候心里有点阴暗。
Yeah, well...I'm a little dark..
Sometimes.

394
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,092
下来吧，威尔，下来吧。
Come down, please.
C'mon...Will?

395
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:45,008
好吧，去他妈的。
Yeah, Fuck it!

396
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,967
反正不该是今天。
Not today.

397
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,883
看来他们要让我们把这些破玩意儿全卖了。
So it looks like,
they are gonna make us dump this shit.

398
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:57,925
什么？
What?

399
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,550
等着瞧吧。
You watch.

400
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,592
怎么了？
How?

401
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,300
- 你会知道的。
- 他们怎么能这么干？
- You'll see!
- How could they do that?

402
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,925
是不能，不可能这么干。但是他们会有办法的。
You can't...it's impossible.
But they'll figure out a way.

403
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:11,758
我在这地方10年了，我见过的事情你们都……
I've been at this place
for ten years and I've seen some things you wouldn't..

404
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:14,217
你们根本都不会相信。
you wouldn't believe...

405
00:40:14,717 --> 00:40:18,883
这些都搞定的时候，他们根本不会有什么损失。
即使其他所有人都在赔钱，
when all is said and done... they do not lose money.
They don't mind if everyone else does,

406
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,258
但他们不会。
but they don't loose.

407
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,008
威尔？
Will?

408
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:35,967
你去年真的挣了250万？
Did you really make two and half million last year?

409
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:37,050
嗯，对。
Yeah..sure.

410
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,383
你怎么花的这钱？
How did you spend it all?

411
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,217
很快就空了。
They expire quickly.

412
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,175
你知道的，口袋里的钱总是很快就没了。
You know, You'll learn and spend
what's in your pocket.

413
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:48,217
250万美元很快就花完了？
Two and half millions goes quickly?

414
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,300
对，我们算算看。
Alright, let's see.

415
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:53,675
税收拿走了一半，只给我剩了150万。
The tax man takes half up front.
So, you're left with one and a quarter.

416
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,550
房贷又花了30万。
My morgage takes another 300 grand.

417
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,592
我又给我爸妈50万让他们花。
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know..to keep them going.

418
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,467
- 这多少了？
- 80万。
- So, what's left?
- Eight hundred.

419
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,425
15万买车，
I spend 150 on a car.

420
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,300
7万5花在饭店里，
About 75 in restaurants,

421
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,175
大概，5万买衣服，
Probably, 50 on clothes.

422
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:13,258
我存了40万以防万一。
And I put 400 away for a rainy day...

423
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:14,300
聪明。
That's smar.

424
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:17,092
嗯，看起来金融风暴就要来了。
Yeah, as it turns out.
It looks like the storm's coming.

425
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,050
还有12万5呢？
You still got 125.

426
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:29,717
我花了76，520美元在找小姐和看脱衣舞上。
但主要是找鸡。
Yeah, I did spent 76,520 dollars on
Hookers, booze and dancers. But mainly, hookers.

427
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,717
7万6500？
76,5..?

428
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,883
一开始我也很震惊，但后来我意识到
我可以以娱乐开销的名义报销一大部分。
Yeah, It was a little shock initially, but then i realise that
I could claim most of it off, as entertainment.

429
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:55,383
你多大了？
How old are you?

430
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:58,592
43。
43.

431
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:06,175
真是怪了。
This is bizzare.

432
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:12,008
这就像个梦。
It's like a...dream.

433
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:18,425
我也不知道，好像我们刚睡醒。
Well, I don't know,
seems like we actually may have just woken up.

434
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:23,008
请进。
Come in.

435
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,508
怎么样？
How do we look?

436
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:28,508
我该走了。
I should go.

437
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:29,758
不，你要留下来。
No, you should stay.

438
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,842
怎么？
So?

439
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,508
没有错……
It's legit...

440
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,383
那孩子是对的。
the kid killed it.

441
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:36,633
这个公式没用了。
The formula is worthless.

442
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:39,550
什么意思？
What does that mean?

443
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:40,550
公式失效了。
It's broken.

444
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:42,425
全世界有8兆美元的钱
There are eight trillion dollars of paper

445
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:46,050
都指着这个公式呢。
around the world relying on that equation??

446
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,883
但是我们错了。
We were wrong.

447
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,883
不，你的意思是……你错了。
No, You mean..
you were wrong.

448
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:51,175
别惹我生气……
Don't get me started....

449
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:52,217
我们谈过这个的！
We discussed this!

450
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,258
我去会议室了。
I'm heading to the conference room.

451
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:54,300
不，你该听听这个。
No, I want you to hear this.

452
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,217
我不想听。
I don't want to hear this.

453
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,717
你觉得我在这呆那么久干吗？
How do you think
I've stuck around this place so long?

454
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,467
我给图尔德打电话了。
I've called Tuld.

455
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,842
我们有备用方案吗？
Is there a contingency plan here?

456
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,300
备用方案？
A contingency plan?

457
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:19,383
- 是的。
- 没有，我们把所有的都押在这上面了。
- Yes.
- No, We went all in on this one.

458
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:23,758
那我们现在彻底没辙了，是么？
So, we've got ourselves quite exposed
here... haven't we?

459
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:29,258
拿图尔德没辙了还是拿市场没辙？
To Tuld or the market?

460
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:32,967
都是。
To both.

461
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,092
他来了？
He's here?

462
00:44:26,717 --> 00:44:28,550
图尔德的直升机到了。
Tuld's helicopter just landed.

463
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,592
我知道，一起来吧。
I know, come with us.

464
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,050
- 山姆呢？
- 我不知道，我们几个都要去吗？        - 是的。
- Where's Sam?
- I don't know, You sure..you want all of us?       -Yes.

465
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:43,675
进去之前给大家一点建议。
Just one piece of advice
for everyone before we go in there.

466
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,467
一会场面可能会不太好看，
This could get a little ugly.

467
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:50,383
但不管怎么样……实话实说就好了。
不要拍马屁，刚才怎么说的一会儿就还怎么说。
but whatever you do... just... tell the truth.
No sugar coating. Do not change a word of it.

468
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:51,425
谁都别在这自作聪明。
no one here is smart enough...

469
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:54,092
那个火箭科学家也是。
Including the rocket scientist.

470
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,467
这边。
This way please.

471
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:12,300
他已经在里面等你了。
He's already in there waiting for you.

472
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:15,675
很好。
Excellent!

473
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,092
大家坐吧。
Please sit down.

474
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:46,300
欢迎大家。
Welcome everyone.

475
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:50,633
很抱歉在这么晚了叫大家过来，
I must apologize for dragging you all
here at such an uncommon hour;

476
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:53,008
但据我所知，有些事情要马上处理！
but from what I've been told,
this matter needs to be handled urgently!

477
00:45:54,508 --> 00:45:56,508
事实上，我们几周前就应该处理了。
so urgently, in fact.. it probably should
have been addressed weeks ago...

478
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,300
可我们现在居然还在分析！
but that is spilled milk...
Under the bridge!

479
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:04,383
那么，谁和我说说到底发生了什么？
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

480
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:07,008
图尔德先生，就像我之前说的，
Well, Mr. Tuld..
as I mentioned earlier..

481
00:46:08,508 --> 00:46:11,592
如果你把第13页最上面的数字和……
if you compare the figure at the top page 13...

482
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:13,300
杰瑞，你就直说吧。
Jared, it's a ?..just speak to me in plain english.

483
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:20,883
我要听那个把这个算出来的人说……苏利文，对吗？
But I'd  like to speak to the guy who put this
together... Mr. Sullivan is it?

484
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:21,925
他能直接说明白吧？
Does he speak English?

485
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:22,967
什么？
Sir?

486
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:25,842
我要和那个算出这些麻烦的分析师说话。
I'd like to speak to the analyst who
seems to have stumbled across this mess.

487
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,342
没问题，是皮特・苏利文，就在那。
Certainly, that would be Peter Sullivan.
Right here.

488
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:31,175
哦你就是苏利文啊，早上好。
Oh Mr.Sullivan. You are here!
Good morning.

489
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:33,717
也许你能告诉我这里发生了什么。
And maybe, you could tell me..
what you think is going on here.

490
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:38,050
而且请你像对孩子说话一样那么解释清楚，
And please speak as you might
to a young child ..

491
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:39,758
甚至像对一只金毛猎犬说话一样。
or a golden retriever.

492
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:43,342
这么说吧，不是我的智慧把我带到这个位置上的。
It wasn't brains, that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

493
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:53,550
好吧，也许您知道我在这和罗杰斯先生一起工作。
Well, sir. As you may or may not
know I work for Mr.Rogers.

494
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,050
是一位风险评估管理分析师。
As an associate in the risk assessment
and management office at GSMBS

495
00:46:58,592 --> 00:47:00,342
放松点，站起来说，大点声
Just relax, stand up.
Tell us in clear voice.

496
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:02,633
告诉大家问题在哪。
What is the nature of the problem.

497
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:13,383
好的……您应该知道，在过去的36到40个月里，
Yes... Well as you probably know over the
last 36-40 months the firm has begun

498
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:16,633
公司在包装新的按揭证券理财产品，
packaging new MBS products;

499
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:24,050
它是包含交易国债等好几块的产品组合。
that combine several different traunches of rating
classification in one tradable security.

500
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:29,800
这个产品带来了很大利润，我想这个您知道的。
This has been enourmously profitable...
as I imagine you noticed.

501
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:31,633
我知道。
I have.

502
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,092
现在公司的这个产品每天都能卖出很多。
Well the firm is currently doing
a considerable amount of this business every day.

503
00:47:35,092 --> 00:47:38,967
我们今天在这的主要问题是……
The problem..which is I guess
why we are here tonight.

504
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:41,550
我们花了……公司花了大概一个月的时间……
is that it takes us...
the firm, about a month...

505
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,425
才做好产品的风险分析。
to layer these products correctly.

506
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:48,342
这从风险控制管理的角度上来说是个难题。
thereby posing a challenge
from a risk assessment standpoint.

507
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,300
不好意思，什么难题？
And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

508
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:55,342
我们要花上比想象多得多的时间来做这件事。
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

509
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:56,383
好吧。
Yes.

510
00:47:56,467 --> 00:48:02,717
但问题是，这些只是抵押债款，所以由于杠杆效应，
But the key factor is here is, these are essentially just mortgages,
that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably..

511
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,175
让我们做了原本我们做不到或者不愿意做的一些事情，
beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do;

512
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:11,633
在任何情况下，我们可能把风险一再调高但是却没有预警。
in any other circumstance, thereby
pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.

513
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,133
好，谢谢，请坐。我猜你这报告说的是，
Now, Thank you...sit down.
What I am guessing, your report here says;

514
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:18,675
给我点时间，
give me some rope,

515
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:21,050
我想你的意思是……
what I am guessing, it says is that..

516
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:23,175
是不是说
considering the, shall we say?

517
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:26,633
尽管过去一两周我们一路颠簸。
bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so.

518
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,592
但你和你同事辛苦工作的结果……
But the figures your brilliant co- workers up
the line ahead of you had come up with..

519
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,175
没什么用。
don't make much sense anymore;

520
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:35,550
根据我们今天看到的局面。
Considering what's taking place today?

521
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,967
实际上不是今天才发生的，
Actually not taking place today...

522
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:41,550
这个情况两周前就开始了。
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

523
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:43,842
那么你是说，这早就发生了？
So, you are saying , this had already happened?

524
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,425
是吧。
Sort of.

525
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,967
苏利文，你的计算模型说明了什么问题？
And Mr. Sullivan,
what does your model say that that means...for us here?

527
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:57,342
我们得出了一个推测。
Well, that's where it becomes a projection.

528
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:01,300
但是……呃……
But... ummm..

529
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:03,967
你在和我说，苏利文先生。
You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.

530
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:06,467
好吧……
Well... sir...

531
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:12,258
如果我们账面上的这些资产下跌下跌25%的话，
If those assets decrease..by just 25 percent,
and remain on our books...

533
00:49:13,842 --> 00:49:14,800
那损失……
that loss...

534
00:49:16,175 --> 00:49:18,925
可能比我们整个公司现在的市值还要多。
would be greater than the current market
capitalization of this entire company.

535
00:49:25,383 --> 00:49:26,883
你的意思……
So what you're telling me...

536
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:29,342
就是说……
is that...

537
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,300
音乐要停了。
music is about to stop.

538
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:37,800
而我们手里堆积了整个资产阶级的
and we are going to be left holding...
'the biggest bag of odorous excrement'

539
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:43,758
所有的破烂玩意儿？
ever assembled in the history of capitalism?

540
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:49,008
呃先生，我可能……
Well sir, I'm not sure I'd..

541
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:53,967
不太会这么去形容这件事，但是让我用你的话来说的话，
put it that way, but let me clarify...using your analogy,

543
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,175
这个模型显示出……
what this model shows...

544
00:49:57,675 --> 00:50:01,133
你说的音乐，只是越来越慢了，
is the music, so to speak,
just slowing,

545
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,425
如果像你说的音乐要停了，
If the music were to stop,
as you put it,

546
00:50:04,717 --> 00:50:05,800
这个模型还不是，
then this model would not be even close;

547
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:10,800
其实这比音乐停了要更糟糕。
to that scenario.
It would be considerably worse.

548
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:15,592
我跟你说，苏利文。
Let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan.

549
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,342
你想没想过为什么我会坐在这个位子上？
Do you care to know,
why I'm in this chair with you all?

550
00:50:23,342 --> 00:50:24,383
为什么我是你们的老板？
Why I earn the big bucks?

551
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:28,175
想过。
Yes.

552
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:29,175
我坐上这个位置只有一个原因，
I'm here for one reason

553
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:30,967
也就一个原因。
and one reason alone.

554
00:50:31,467 --> 00:50:35,508
我在这里去猜，那音乐一周、一个月、
I'm here to guess,
what the music might do, a week, a month,

555
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,425
甚至一年之后会是什么样。
a year from now.

556
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:40,300
这就是原因！
That's it!

557
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:41,883
没别的了。
nothing more...

558
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,092
我今天晚上站在这……
I'm standing here tonight...

559
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,633
我觉得我什么音・乐・都・没・听・到……
I'm afraid that,
I don't hear... a... thing...

560
00:50:56,425 --> 00:51:01,717
万籁俱寂。
just... silence!

561
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,508
现在我们知道音乐停了，我们该怎么办？
So, now that we know that the music has
stopped, what can we do about it?

562
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:23,967
科恩，罗伯特森
Mr. Cohen,
Ms. Robertson,

563
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:29,425
我想这是你们该表现的时候了。
I'm afraid, I think..this is where
you are supposed to step back in.

564
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:33,133
我们今晚一直都在依靠苏利文先生。
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

565
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,675
你有什么要给我们看的？
What have you got for us?

566
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:45,967
你们第一天走进我办公室的时候
What have I told you since...

567
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,717
我对你们说了什么？
the first day you walked into my office?

568
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:53,217
这个行业里有三种生存模式：
There are three ways
to make a living in this business...

569
00:51:54,008 --> 00:51:57,133
更快，更聪明，或者更能忽悠。
Be first, be smarter,
or cheat.

570
00:51:57,842 --> 00:51:59,592
我不骗人。
Now, I don't cheat...

571
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:04,008
尽管我认为我们这里有很多聪明人，
And although I like to think,
we've some pretty smart people in this building.

572
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,883
但我想去做到更快会简单的多。
it sure is a hell of a lot easier
to just be first.

573
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:10,842
今天把这些全都卖了。
Sell it all...today!

574
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,342
能做到么，山姆？
Is that even possible Sam?

575
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,633
可以，但是成本呢？
Yes, but at what cost?

576
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,425
那是必须付出的。
I'll have to pay.

577
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:23,717
真的么？
Really?

578
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:26,550
我这么觉得。
I think so.

579
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:28,633
这些东西会以什么方式再回到我们手中？
Where does this gonna come back to us?

580
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:32,175
各种方式。
Everywhere.

581
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:36,758
山姆，我觉得你好像没听懂你的人刚才说的话……
Sam, I don't think you seem to understand
what your boy here had just said...

582
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:41,758
如果我让你处理，
if I made you...

583
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:44,092
你会怎么做？
how would you do it?

584
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,175
让交易员在早上6点半开例会，
Well, you call the traders in
for their normal 6:30 meeting...

585
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,217
老实告诉他们情况。
and you be honest with them.

586
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,383
反正他们很快都会知道。
B'cos they're gonna know it's the end either way.

587
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,300
所以你要给他们一份奖励，很多的奖金。
so you'd have to throw them a bone,
and a pretty big one.

588
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:01,092
然后你要赶紧出来，风暴来临了……
And then, you've gotta come
out of the gate storming...

589
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:03,675
不要掉期交易，什么都不要。
No swaps..no nothing.

590
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:09,967
10：15之前干掉40%，11点要卖完所有的东西。
因为中午的时候，
40 percent done by 10:15; by 11 O'clock
all your trades have to be gone. 'cos by lunch-time

591
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:11,008
消息就会传出去了。
words are gonna be out.

592
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:16,133
拖到2点的话还能以65%的成本价卖出就已经算是你走运了。
and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents
on the dollar, if you're lucky,

593
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:19,592
而且联邦调查局的人马上就会过来找你麻烦。
and the feds will be in here up your ass;
trying to slow us down.

594
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:21,550
- 拉米什？
- 他们会让你慢下来……
- Ramesh?
- They can slow you down...

595
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,550
但不会阻止你，这是你自己的买卖。
but they can't stop you.
it's yours to sell.

596
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,258
约翰……就算……
John...even if..

597
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:31,175
我们能把问题摆平……
we manage pull that off,
and that's saying something...

598
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:33,217
但真正的问题是……
The real question is...

599
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:34,675
我们卖给谁？
Who are we selling this to?

600
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:39,383
过去两年里的那些买家，以及其他任何愿意买的人。
The same people we've been selling to
for the last two years, and whoever else will buy it.

601
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,842
但是，如果你这么做了。
But John, If you do this.

602
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:47,300
你会让市场瘫痪好几年，那就完蛋了。
You would've killed that market
for years. It's over.

603
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,550
而且你知道你卖的东西毫无价值。
And you are selling something
that you know has no value.

604
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,467
我们以市场的价格
We are selling to willing buyers

605
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,467
卖给愿意购买的买家
at a current fair market price,

606
00:53:57,508 --> 00:54:00,800
然后我们就能活下来！
so that WE may survive!

607
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,217
但以后你再也不能向那些人卖出任何东西了。
You'll never sell anything to any of
those people ever again.

608
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:07,258
- 我知道。
- 你知道？
- I understand.
- Do you?

609
00:54:07,258 --> 00:54:08,425
- 你知道什么？！
- Do You???

610
00:54:09,258 --> 00:54:10,508
就这么定了！
This is it!

611
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:12,883
我告诉你，这就是命令！
I'm telling you.
This is it.

612
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:25,717
现在是……凌晨4点钟。
It's 4:00...O'clock.

613
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:30,008
杰瑞你在5点之前给我个方案。
Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down
and draw me up a plan.

614
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:34,675
除了这的人还有谁知道这件事的？哪怕一点也算？
Is there anyone else who knows
what's in there right now, block by block?

615
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:35,717
埃里克・戴尔。
Eric Dale.

616
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:37,800
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

617
00:54:38,383 --> 00:54:40,800
他今天已经被公司解雇了。
As of today he is no longer with the firm.

618
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:44,467
我们一直在找他。
We have been trying to locate him.

619
00:54:48,258 --> 00:54:49,883
- 卡梅隆？      - 说。
- 六点之前给我把埃里克・戴尔带过来。
- Carmelo?      - Yes?
- Get me Eric Dale here by Six.

620
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,175
知道了。
Done.

621
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,925
我们一小时之后再回来开会。
We meet back here in an hour.

622
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,800
山姆，我们谈谈。
Sam, let's talk.

623
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,258
这就是这座城市里最黑暗的地方。
This is a hell of a town.

624
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,508
我一直都很喜欢这地方。
I've always loved this place.

625
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,425
从我来这儿的第一天开始，喜欢这里的一切。
Since the day i arived.
Everything about it.

626
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:31,383
山姆，这件事上你会和我站在一起么？
Sam, are you gonna go with me on this?

627
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:36,258
我不知道，约翰。
I don't know John.

628
00:55:38,592 --> 00:55:40,175
这事儿太糟糕了。
This one is very ugly.

629
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,800
咱们都曾经是销售人员。
You and I were salesmen.

630
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,758
我们卖东西，这就是我们做的，一点都不复杂。
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

631
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:48,800
没错。
Exactly.

632
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,842
而且你很他妈的清楚
And you know damn well..

633
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:53,967
你不会卖任何没价值没回报的东西。
you don't make a sale unless
you think the guy is gonna come back for more,

634
00:55:54,008 --> 00:56:00,092
这是我们的教训，而且明天我们就完蛋了。
That's the lesson we learned.
and tomorrow we are done.

635
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:02,383
这次搞大了。
This is the big one.

636
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,425
我们中的大部分人都逃不出这次灾难。
Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.

637
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:08,842
- 我们？
- 整个华尔街。
- Us?
- The street.

638
00:56:08,842 --> 00:56:11,258
你什么意思？
What are you talking about?

639
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:12,425
这周发生的事不是我要面对的最终局面。
This isn't  the last 'situation' I will
have to deal with this week.

640
00:56:13,842 --> 00:56:15,842
这还只是个开始。
This is just the start.

641
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:19,050
这个开始是因为你开始了这一切。
It's the start because you are starting it.

642
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,092
也许吧，但我不相信。
Maybe. But I don't believe that.

643
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,842
反正不是这次。
Not this time.

644
00:56:22,258 --> 00:56:23,467
那些数字都没法加了。
The numbers just don't add up anymore.

645
00:56:24,258 --> 00:56:26,383
我同意你这个观点。这话我很多年前就说过了。
Well I agree with you there.
I've been saying that for years.

646
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,133
如果外面的孩子算出来的这结果……
I mean if this kid out there can
come up with this thing...?

647
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:37,217
我没办法明知道结果还要去害其他人。
I don't think I can go in knowing what I
know and put the hammer down on these guys like this.

648
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:38,258
山姆你什么时候变成这么个软蛋了？
When did you start becoming so soft, Sam?

649
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,300
你他妈才软蛋，是你自己害怕了。
Fuck you soft, you're panicking.

650
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,925
如果你第一个走出这个门，
If you're the first one out the door;

651
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,050
那就不叫害怕。
That's not called panicking.

652
00:56:56,633 --> 00:57:00,133
显然你比我掌握了更多信息。
Well, you are obviously operating
with more information than i have.

653
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,508
但我想这些足够毁了这公司了。
But I think this could destroy this firm.

654
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,383
没人会在相信你了。
No one will ever trust you again.

655
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:08,883
你在知情的情况下把人家的生意毁掉。彻底的。
Knowingly putting people out of business.
Full stop.

656
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:13,550
然我来处理吧，山姆。
Let me deal with that, Sam.

657
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:30,717
怎么样？
How'd that go?

658
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:33,383
都他妈的傻逼。
This is a fucking shit show.

659
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:36,425
- 他们真打算这么干了？
- 大概吧。
- They are gonna go with it?
- Probably.

660
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,300
不勒个是吧！
Jesus!

661
00:57:41,383 --> 00:57:42,467
记住今天吧，孩子们
Remember this day boys,

662
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,508
记着今天。
Remember this day.

663
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:04,008
我们现在什么策略？
What's the strategy here?

664
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:07,425
这正是我要下楼和他们一起研究的事情。
Well, that's why i'm headed downstairs,
to work it with my guys.

665
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:10,217
不，是你、我还有约翰。
No, no, you and I...
With John.

666
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:19,217
我觉得我们不需要这样，萨拉，我不是这么做事的。
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

667
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:22,300
别装逼了。
Please.

668
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:25,842
听着，他知道我们在做什么，
Listen, He knows where we are still on this.

669
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:28,842
一直都知道。
All along.

670
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:30,967
那正是我的意思。
That's exactly my point.

671
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:32,842
就算知道我们在干什么……
And knowing what was discussed..

672
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:39,217
我也觉得不会有人来帮你。
by both you and I. I don't think
this could provide you with anything.

673
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:40,717
也不会有人假装安慰你。
other than, false sense of comfort.

674
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:43,842
我不是在求安慰。
I'm not looking for sense of comfort.

675
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,758
估计也求不到。
I don't think there's one to be found.

676
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,550
那么再问一遍，现在有什么对策？
So again, what's the strategy?

677
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:05,967
我想我们也做不了什么。
I'm just not sure there's much more to do in this.

678
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:08,800
这事已经很清楚了，
It's very simple.

679
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:11,717
别想瞒着我。
Don't even think of fucking me on this.

680
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:15,758
因为如果我歇菜了，
because if we are going down...

681
00:59:16,717 --> 00:59:17,842
你也好不了。
you damn well know we'll  be together.

682
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,842
不，我不这么觉得。
No, I'm not sure I do know that.

683
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:04,633
你觉得图尔德去年挣了多少钱？
What do you think Tuld made last year?

684
01:00:08,383 --> 01:00:09,258
你他妈的能闭嘴么？
Would you shut the fuck up.

685
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,383
8千6百万。
86 mil.

686
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:14,592
包括工资和分红。
In bonuses and salary .

687
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:17,383
真的？
Really?

688
01:00:17,425 --> 01:00:18,050
当然，有公开记录的。
Sure, it's public record.

689
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:22,675
他曾经有十多亿美元呢。
He was worth a billion.

690
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:25,300
曾经？
Was?

691
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,175
直到今天，以后就不是了。
Until today.

692
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:39,967
我需要点新鲜空气。
I could use some real air.

693
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:42,133
好主意。
Probably a good idea.

694
01:01:03,842 --> 01:01:06,425
您好，我是威尔・艾默生。
Hello, Will Emerson.

695
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,175
喂？
Hello?

696
01:01:14,592 --> 01:01:16,842
不用了谢谢，我知道了。
No, thank you. I understand.

697
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,467
不，我们会小心的。
No, we'll be discreet.

698
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,175
怎么了？
What?

699
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:27,217
埃里克老婆。
Eric's wife.

700
01:01:27,675 --> 01:01:30,425
他没事，在家呢，就是不想和我们说话。
也不知道他老婆给我打电话。
He's alive, he's home. He doesn't wanna
speak to us. He doesn't know she rang me.

701
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:31,967
他住哪儿？
Where's he live?

702
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:33,008
住海兹。
The heights.

703
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,758
我们要叫图尔德手下那个人吗？
Should we call Tuld's guy?

704
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,008
不，这是埃里克。叫那些人去是我们最不得已的办法。
你们俩去把他找回来。
No.it's Eric...the last thing we need is those guys
going over there, you two go try to get him.

705
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:40,967
但是记得要赶在6点之前。
But you've got to be back here by 6:00 AM.

706
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,050
我讨厌布鲁克林。
I hate Brooklyn.

707
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,592
我能进来么？
May I come in?

708
01:01:53,717 --> 01:01:55,175
坐吧。
Please, sit down.

709
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:07,300
嗯，我们准备……
So... we are going to do this thing.

710
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:13,092
嗯。
Okay.

711
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:14,967
可能会很紧张。
It's going to be tight.

712
01:02:17,758 --> 01:02:19,050
山姆会和我们一起吗？
Is Sam on board?

713
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:20,467
现在还没有。
Not yet.

714
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:25,800
萨拉，
Sarah,

715
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:27,800
我需要一个负责人……
I need a head.

716
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,425
对交易员们负责任。
to feed to the traders...
on the floor and the board.

717
01:02:35,133 --> 01:02:36,383
是我还是科恩？
Is it me or Cohen?

718
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:38,217
就是你。
It's you.

719
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,342
你应该知道……
Of course you are...

720
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:53,258
我之前就提醒过你和科恩这件事。
well aware I filtered several warnings
to you and Cohen about this .

721
01:02:53,842 --> 01:02:54,758
一年前就说过。
A year ago.

722
01:02:55,758 --> 01:03:00,508
我真不觉得现在该说这个。
I really don't think that's the best path for you
to be taking at this point.

723
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:05,133
你会得到很好的补偿的。
you're going to be well taken care of.

724
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:13,925
显然这有点复杂。
Obviously it's quite complicated.

725
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:15,175
约翰，我了解相关的条款……
John I was told that in no uncertain terms...

726
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:17,300
这一直是个灰色区域。
It was always a very grey area.

727
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:20,508
其实那个时候我和你们
Actually it was made very clear at the time,

728
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:22,675
就把这事说的很清楚了。
by you and I and Cohen.

729
01:03:25,258 --> 01:03:29,258
我希望你不要再跟我扯这个事儿了。
I'd really appreciate it that you didn't fight me on this...

730
01:03:40,508 --> 01:03:43,383
这事我们全都搞砸了。
We all fucked this one up pretty good...

731
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,300
我要你在这呆到股市收盘。
We need you to stay here till
this is finished and the markets close.

732
01:03:52,717 --> 01:03:53,717
我明白。
I understand.

733
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:57,758
他们一会在楼下和你分析那些数据，
They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs...

734
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:01,550
祝你好运。
Good luck.

735
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,050
不知道那家伙想干吗？
What's the boy wonder want?

736
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:31,258
有时间吗？
You got a minute?

737
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,050
- 我们要去接埃里克。
- 我知道，就一会儿。
- We're just off to pick up Eric.
- Yeah I know. Will only take a second.

738
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:35,092
好吧，怎么了？
Alright, what is it?

739
01:04:35,883 --> 01:04:40,050
我和图尔德担心在这件事上山姆可能会站错位置。
Tuld and I have  concerns that Sam,
may not be step up and do the right thing.

740
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:42,925
这事儿原来没有过？
It's never been a problem?

741
01:04:42,925 --> 01:04:43,967
没有。
No, it hasn't.

742
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:46,800
但像现在这样的敏感时期……
But, sometimes in an acute situation,
Such as this...

743
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,967
对于究竟什么是对的
often what is right.

744
01:04:50,842 --> 01:04:56,092
可能招来很多猜忌。
Can take on,
mutiple interpretations.

745
01:04:57,258 --> 01:04:58,758
山姆知道该怎么做。
Sam will step up.

746
01:04:58,758 --> 01:04:59,800
我知道他会的。
Oh, I know..he will.

747
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:04,092
但是如果他不肯，我是说如果……
But if he doesn't.
IF he does not...

748
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:06,092
我们要知道你会的。
We need to know that,
You will.

749
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:10,550
你们要知道我会怎么样？
You need to know that,
I will... What?

750
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:13,217
你会和我们站在一起。
That you will step up.

751
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:17,883
我相信，山姆会做出正确的选择。
I have not doubt.
That Sam will make the right decision.

752
01:05:17,883 --> 01:05:20,467
但我想先说清楚，
But, just to make it clear.

753
01:05:20,467 --> 01:05:23,717
他和我对什么是正确的事情，意见很一致。
He and I always have the same interpretation,
Of what's right.

754
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,050
不管是不是什么敏感时期。
No matter, How acute...
the situation.

755
01:08:13,008 --> 01:08:16,592
天啊，这房子真不错。
Jesus, that's a nice place.

756
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,633
没错，他刚买的。
Yeah,  it is.. he just bought it.

757
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:20,467
希望他用的是现金。
I hope it was with cash.

758
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:25,217
滚蛋，你个没良心的就不会说点好的，
Fuck me. You are a heartless
little shit sometimes.

759
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,550
不是用的现金。
and it wasn't.

760
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:31,092
什么都别动！
Don't touch any of the buttons!

761
01:08:38,175 --> 01:08:39,383
你来这干吗？
What are you doing here?

762
01:08:39,925 --> 01:08:40,800
嘿？
Hey?

763
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:49,425
皮特把你在算模型做完了。
So..Peter finished that model
you were working on.

764
01:08:51,758 --> 01:08:52,633
真的？
Really?

765
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:54,175
惹了大麻烦了。
Caused a shit storm.

766
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,842
我就知道。
I bet...it did.

767
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,300
你认为他算得对吗？
Do you think he's right?

768
01:08:59,467 --> 01:09:00,383
我知道他是对的。
I know...he's right.

769
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:17,383
昨天晚上杰瑞・科恩和高级合作伙伴开了一个紧急会议。
Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting
of the senior partners last night.

770
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,842
基于你的那些发现……
Based on your findings..

771
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:23,008
他们决定把我们手里有的全卖了。
They've decided to liquidate our entire position.

772
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:25,592
就今天！
Today!

773
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:29,050
我很抱歉。
I am very sorry about that.

774
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,092
他们担心你一个人在外面，要我把你带回去。
They are worried about you being out here.
And  they want me to get you back.

775
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:44,633
- 别逗了！
- 他们说的。             - 让他们去死吧。
- Jesus!
- I'm just saying..             - Fuck that.

776
01:09:44,675 --> 01:09:48,467
- 好好考虑一下。
- 得了吧，我签了字，我已经不管这事儿了。
- Don't be rash.
- Forget it, I've signed my papers. I'm out!

777
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:51,050
他们会给你钱的。
They will pay you.

778
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,217
我已经拿了很多钱了。
I've been paid enough, already.

779
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:04,050
你知道我原来是造桥的么？
Did you know I built a bridge once?

780
01:10:06,508 --> 01:10:07,342
什么？
Sorry?

781
01:10:07,342 --> 01:10:08,383
造大桥。
A bridge.

782
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:09,925
我没听说过这事儿。
No, I didn't know that.

783
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,008
我当时是个工程师。
I was an engineer by trade.

784
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,258
那桥从俄亥俄州的多士巴到西维吉尼亚州的玛瑟夫。
It went from Dilles Bottom,
Ohio to Moundsville West Virgina.

785
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,050
距俄亥俄河上方218英尺。
It spans 912 feet above the Ohio river.

786
01:10:22,258 --> 01:10:25,092
每天有1万2千1百人通过这座桥。
12,100 people a day use this thing a day.

787
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:26,800
算上在惠灵和新马顿赛两头
And It cut out 35 miles...

788
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:30,550
通过这座桥的总路程有35英里。
of extra driving each way,
between Wheeling and New Martinsville.

789
01:10:31,508 --> 01:10:32,717
加起来的话……
That's a combined...

790
01:10:33,258 --> 01:10:37,300
汽车每天在这座桥上行驶84万7千英里
847,000 miles of driving,a day...

792
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:41,467
或者每个月2千5百4十1万英里
Worth 25,410,000 miles...a month;

794
01:10:43,133 --> 01:10:48,258
每年3亿4千9百2十万英里
and 304 millions 920,000 miles a year.

797
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:50,300
这座桥节省了这么多路程。
Saved.

798
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:54,675
我能在1986年做这样的工程，那是22年前了。
Now, I completed that project in 1986...
that's 22 years ago.

799
01:10:56,217 --> 01:11:03,633
那座桥的寿命大概还可以在上面行驶
60亿7千零8十万2千4百英里的路。
So, Over the life of that one bridge..that's 6 billion...
708 million...240 thousand miles...that haven't had to be driven!

802
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,467
我们算每小时50英里好了。
At what? let's say... 50 miles an hour

803
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,592
那就是1亿3千4百1十6万4千8百个小时。
So, that's a 134 million, 164 thousand
800 hours...

804
01:11:15,425 --> 01:11:16,425
或者说
or

805
01:11:16,883 --> 01:11:18,425
5十5万9千零2十天。
559 thousand 20 days...

806
01:11:20,092 --> 01:11:26,842
所以就那一座桥就省下了当地两个社区里的居民
总共1531年的生命
so that one little bridge has saved the people
of those two communities a combined, 1531 years of their lives

807
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,508
而不至于把那些时间浪费在车里。
not wasted in a fucking car...

808
01:11:33,925 --> 01:11:38,175
1千5百3十1年！
One thousand five hundred and 31 years!

809
01:11:38,175 --> 01:11:39,217
天啊。
Jesus.

810
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,883
我觉得……你该回去了。
I guess... you better get back over there.

811
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,550
好吧。
Yeah.

812
01:12:02,383 --> 01:12:04,008
谢谢你能来。
Thanks for coming by.

813
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,050
没事。
You're welcome.

814
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,258
那他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck is this?

815
01:12:11,883 --> 01:12:13,883
大概，公司的人吧。
I'd imagine, it's the firm's people.

816
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,133
啊？
What?

817
01:12:16,133 --> 01:12:17,258
图尔德不像在你这里失去控制。
Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.

818
01:12:19,383 --> 01:12:20,508
是他炒的我。
He fired me.

819
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:22,758
真他妈的有病。
Fuck em... Fuck em.

820
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:24,550
我同意，都是一帮傻逼。所以，回来吧。
I totally agree...Fuck them.
So, come back...

821
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,508
拿着你的钱，5点前你就回家了。
take the money,
You'll be home by five.

822
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:31,300
否则的话，他们会把你的什么都吞了，红包、期货……
Otherwise, they are going to fight you on everything,
they are going to fight you on the package, the options...

823
01:12:33,092 --> 01:12:34,050
识时务点吧。
Be smart.

824
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,258
好吧，你比我牛逼。
Well..You're a better man than I.

825
01:12:44,175 --> 01:12:45,758
我一直比你牛逼。
That's always been true.

826
01:12:45,758 --> 01:12:46,800
对，对对。
Yes, it has.

827
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:53,425
这房子不错。
The house looks good.

828
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:56,717
谢谢。
Thanks.

829
01:12:57,092 --> 01:12:58,675
埃里克……
Hey Eric...

830
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:03,217
别老这么怪罪自己好吗？
don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, alright?

831
01:13:05,092 --> 01:13:06,592
有的人就喜欢开半天车才能回到家。
Some people like driving the long way home.

832
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,175
谁他妈知道呢，对吧？
Who the fuck knows. Right?

833
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:43,217
啊，你在这。
There he is.

834
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,050
约翰。
John.

835
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:48,842
怎么样了？
How's it looking?

836
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,967
科恩做的不错，可以照他说的干。
Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.

837
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:54,508
什么意思？
What does that mean?

838
01:13:56,675 --> 01:14:00,592
就是说，你知道的，
It means, as you very well know,

839
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:05,133
你是这里很重要的一员。
that you are a very important piece of this puzzle.

840
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:39,758
这可不是白给的。
It's not a gift.

841
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,217
我要知道这件事上你和我在同一战线。
I need to know you are with me on this.

842
01:14:46,258 --> 01:14:47,633
我和公司站在一起。
I'm with the firm John.

843
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:55,050
除非你的人相信你，否则我从这些人那什么都得不到……
I won't get what I need out of your boys
on the floor, unless they believe you...

844
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,383
他们得完全信任你才行。
unless they believe in you completely.

845
01:15:03,675 --> 01:15:04,758
帮我一把，行么？
Are you in, on this?

846
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,425
我说过了我持保留意见。
I told you my reservations.

847
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:10,675
你不能有任何保留！
You can't have reservations!

848
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,550
我现在就要知道！
And I need to know now.

849
01:15:16,883 --> 01:15:22,925
听着，约翰。我一直都是为公司考虑的。让我过去。
Look John..I'm  completely with the firm, as I
always have been. Excuse me.

850
01:15:48,008 --> 01:15:52,425
好吧，威尔，我会被炒吗？
Alright, Will. Am I getting fired?

851
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:54,258
我不知道。
I don't know.

852
01:15:58,967 --> 01:16:01,758
会的吧，基本上肯定会。
Yeah, almost definitely.

853
01:16:03,758 --> 01:16:08,050
- 那你呢？
- 我不会。
- Are you?
- No.

854
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:13,800
塞斯，这不是因为你做错了什么。
只是你在错误的时间，加入了错误的公司。
Seth, its nothing you did.
You're just in a wrong firm, in a wrong time.

855
01:16:14,467 --> 01:16:18,050
年轻人总是被裁员的那个。
我没什么好劝你的。
Young guys are always the one to get called.
Listen, nothing i can say'll make you better

856
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:21,550
你会难受一阵子，过些日子就好了。
It's gonna suck for a while...
and then you'll be fine.

857
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:27,717
你还好吧？
You alright?

858
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,217
嗯，我没事。
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

859
01:16:31,217 --> 01:16:35,217
就现在来说，我很抱歉发生这样的事情。
For what its worth,
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

860
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,842
不用，你没必要这么说。
Don't be. You didn't do it to me.

861
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:42,425
总之，起码你走的时候会拿到一大笔钱。
Still, at least you're gonna
have some nice cash to walk away with.

862
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:45,050
也许吧。
I guess.

863
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,925
- 这种事真的会影响到别人的。
- 没错，像我这样的。
- This is really gonna effect people.
- Yeah, it's gonna affect people like me.

864
01:16:49,383 --> 01:16:50,550
不是，我是说其他人。
No, real people.

865
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:52,133
行了吧，塞斯。
Jesus, Seth.

866
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:56,675
如果你真的想在这个行当做下去，
你必须相信你自己很重要。而且你就是不错。
If you really wanna do this with your life.
You have to believe you're necessary. And you are.

867
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:00,425
大家想要这样的生活，香车、豪宅，可是他们根本都付不起。
People wanna live like this. In their cars
and their big fucking houses, that they can't even pay for.

868
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,508
这时候你就非常重要了。
Then, you're necessary.

869
01:17:03,508 --> 01:17:06,008
他们能活得像个国王的唯一理由是
The only reason, that they all get
continue living like kings is

870
01:17:07,258 --> 01:17:08,425
我们用手指把天平往他们那边压了一下。
'cos we got our fingers on the scales in their favour.

871
01:17:08,425 --> 01:17:09,467
我把手拿走了。
I take my hand off.

872
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,258
然后世界才是他妈的真正公平的，但是很快他们就说不要这样。
Well then the whole world gets really fucking fair,
really fucking quickly and nobody asks you one shite.

873
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,383
他们想要我们给他们更多的东西。
They want what we've to give them..

874
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:23,925
但同时又想假装无辜假装不知道这些东西怎么来的。
but they also wanna you know, play innocent
and pretend they've no idea where it came from.

875
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:27,092
那就要我来为他们的这些行为埋单，操。
That's more hypocracy than I'm willing to swallow.
So, fuck them.

876
01:17:27,925 --> 01:17:29,092
都他妈傻逼！
Fuck normal people!

877
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:32,592
你知道么，有趣的是，明天如果这事儿曝光了。
You know, the funny thing is.
Tommorow, if all of these goes tits up.

878
01:17:34,508 --> 01:17:37,300
他们会把我们钉上十字架，极其野蛮。
They're gonna crucify us.
For being, too reckless.

879
01:17:37,342 --> 01:17:38,508
但如果我们错了，
But if we are wrong??

880
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:40,175
一切又都回到原来那样。
And everything gets back on track.

881
01:17:42,175 --> 01:17:45,092
同样这帮人会开心到尿裤子。
Well then, the same people
are gonna laugh until they piss their pants.

882
01:17:45,717 --> 01:17:48,133
因为我们看起来像穿过那扇门最大的傻逼。
Because, we are gonna look like the biggest
pussies that God ever let through the door.

883
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:55,258
你觉得我们会错么？
Do you think we are gonna be wrong?

884
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:58,883
我不知道，别问我。
Nah, i don't know..fuck.

885
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,133
早上好。
Good morning.

886
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:16,883
皮特……
Peter...

887
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:18,758
续一根儿？
you want one?

888
01:18:20,592 --> 01:18:21,883
我不抽烟。
I don't smoke.

889
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:24,800
真好，我也不怎么抽的。
That's good. I don't much either.

890
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:37,217
累吗？
Are you tired?

891
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:39,508
累什么？
Of what?

892
01:18:40,092 --> 01:18:41,342
我又没像你那么拼命的工作。
Remember, I don't work as hard as you do.

893
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,383
不是吧。
Oh, That's not true.

894
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:43,925
就是，我没有。
No it is...actually.

895
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:50,633
- 我们今天会被解雇吗？
- 也许吧。
- Are we all getting fired after today?
- Probably.

896
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,883
他们会炒了你？
Are they going to fire you?

897
01:18:55,092 --> 01:18:56,342
他们会换种说法。
Well, they won't exactly call it that.

898
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:02,050
算作怜悯的辞退吧。你不用陪我在这站着。
but... it'll be a mercy killing really.
You don't have to stand out here for me.

899
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:07,342
我知道，我只是现在还不想回去。
No, I know. I really
don't want to go back in there just yet.

900
01:19:08,883 --> 01:19:10,133
我理解。
I understand that.

901
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:13,967
我应该认识你儿子。
I think I know your son.

902
01:19:14,925 --> 01:19:15,925
真的？
Really?

903
01:19:16,342 --> 01:19:18,800
不是很熟……但是看起来是个好人。
Not well... but, he always seemed
like a nice person.

904
01:19:20,217 --> 01:19:21,758
他是个好人。
He is a nice person.

905
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,217
还是骂别人坏的词比较多。
I guess you could say a lot worse about a guy.

906
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,550
他知道会发生什么吗？
Does he know what's about to happen?

907
01:19:29,383 --> 01:19:30,425
什么意思？
What do you mean?

908
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:34,217
你跟他说过吗？
Did you talk to him?

909
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:37,425
没有，我从没想过要跟他说这个。
No..I hadn't even thought of it.

910
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,883
他们来了。
They're all coming in now.

911
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,592
是啊都来了。
Yes they are.

912
01:19:53,967 --> 01:19:55,592
你以前做过这样的事吗？
Have you ever done anything like this?

913
01:19:57,217 --> 01:20:01,342
从来没有，一点都没有。
No... never.... not even close.

914
01:20:07,342 --> 01:20:09,842
你确定我们只能这么……
Are you sure..it's the only...

915
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:13,050
这么做对吗？
or the... right thing to do?

916
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:17,592
对谁来说？
For who?

917
01:20:20,508 --> 01:20:21,592
我不知道。
I'm not sure.

918
01:20:22,675 --> 01:20:23,925
我也不知道。
Neither am I.

919
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:09,175
你没事吧？
You alright?

920
01:22:12,717 --> 01:22:14,383
你要解雇我。
You are about to fire me.

921
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:34,425
知道么，我很喜欢在这里工作。
You know, this is..
This is all I've ever wanted to do.

922
01:22:41,425 --> 01:22:42,675
真的？
Really?

923
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:20,133
你也是吧，嗯？
You as well, huh?

924
01:23:20,175 --> 01:23:21,175
对。
Yes.

925
01:23:22,717 --> 01:23:24,092
真行。
Jesus!

926
01:23:26,758 --> 01:23:27,592
抱歉。
Sorry.

927
01:23:27,592 --> 01:23:28,883
谢谢。
Thank you.

928
01:23:43,592 --> 01:23:45,967
我想他们不光是让你回来。
I didn't think they were going
to be able to get you back here.

929
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:51,300
他们说接下来2年都要我和他们一起……
They told me they were going to drag me
through hell on everything

930
01:23:51,758 --> 01:23:54,383
我的期货、医疗保险……
the next two years..
my options, my healthcare

931
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:57,133
或者我可以回来挣……
or I could come back here and make...

932
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,717
每个小时17万6千471美元
$176,471.00 an hour

933
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:03,800
就是在这静静坐着。
to sit quietly...  in this room.

934
01:24:07,383 --> 01:24:09,008
好像也没什么别的选择。
I couldn't see much of choice.

935
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:11,592
从来就没得选。
It never is.

936
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,467
回过头来看，
Obviously looking back,

937
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:22,092
之前我们没有足够的紧迫感……
It was expressed with insufficient urgency...

938
01:24:23,342 --> 01:24:24,717
但是你的观点现在大家都知道了。
but your point was passed on...

939
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:26,883
我希望你知道这点。
I need you to know that.

940
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,633
埃里克。
Eric.

941
01:24:29,675 --> 01:24:32,675
没事，我理解，相信我。
Its okay, I understand,
believe me.

942
01:24:32,883 --> 01:24:34,300
你也做不了什么。
there was nothing you could have done.

943
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:37,133
我觉得也是……
I guess...

944
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:43,050
那个时候……好像也没什么选择。
at the time... it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

945
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:45,675
从来没有过。
It never does.

946
01:25:08,425 --> 01:25:10,050
你的信封会是什么样的？
What is your package going to be like?

947
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:15,758
我不知道，我正等着呢。
I don't know,
that's what I'm waiting for now.

948
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,717
可能会不错。
It probably pretty good.

949
01:25:20,175 --> 01:25:21,383
最好是。
It better be.

950
01:25:37,675 --> 01:25:40,217
非常感谢大家能来这么早。
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning,

951
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:45,258
我知道昨天很糟糕，我希望今天能跟大家说情况有所好转，
I know yesterday was pretty bad,
and I wish I could say that today is going to be less so,

952
01:25:45,258 --> 01:25:46,300
但其实并不是。
but that isn't going to be the case.

953
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,842
现在我应该给你们读这份通知，
Now, I am supposed to read this
statement here to you all here,

954
01:25:49,842 --> 01:25:52,967
但你们有空了自己看吧，我只想告诉你们这发生了什么。
but how bout you read it on your own time
and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.

955
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,717
我昨天整宿都在这。
I've been here all night.

956
01:25:56,883 --> 01:25:58,342
和董事会的人开会讨论。
meeting with the executive committee.

957
01:25:59,758 --> 01:26:06,258
最终决定卖出公司几个关键财产类的所有东西。
and the decision has been made to unwind a considerable
portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes.

958
01:26:10,383 --> 01:26:11,967
问题是，在公司看来，
The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking.

959
01:26:12,508 --> 01:26:15,050
派对在今天早上结束了。
the party is over as of this morning.

960
01:26:16,092 --> 01:26:20,008
在未来一段时间里，市场会有很大动荡。
There is going to be considerable turmoil
in the markets for the foreseeable future.

961
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:23,842
他们觉得，这个动荡最好从我们这里开始。
And they believe...
it is better, that this turmoil begin with us...

962
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:28,383
结果就是……
as a result...

963
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:30,800
公司决定卖出
the firm has decided to liquidate

964
01:26:32,008 --> 01:26:34,425
大部分的固定收入的按揭证券
its majority positions of fixed income MBS..

965
01:26:36,092 --> 01:26:37,092
今天一天。
today.

966
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:39,342
这是你们的信函，
These are your packets,

967
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:43,425
你们会看到你们今天的任务是什么。
you will see what accounts you are  responsible for today.

968
01:26:44,883 --> 01:26:46,467
我想你们会很快
I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to..

969
01:26:48,258 --> 01:26:49,925
明白这次买卖的意义。
understand the implications of this sale.

970
01:26:51,008 --> 01:26:58,133
对于你们和对手的关系，
还有你们的事业产生什么样的影响。
on your relationships with your counter-parties
and as a result...on your careers.

972
01:26:58,175 --> 01:26:59,258
我对董事会说出了
I have expressed this

973
01:26:59,675 --> 01:27:00,717
真相
reality

974
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:04,633
他们也很理解这一点。
to the executive committee and they understand.

975
01:27:04,675 --> 01:27:05,008
所以，
As a result,

976
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:08,717
如果你能卖出你手里93%的资产，
if you achieve a 93% sale of your assets...

977
01:27:09,383 --> 01:27:13,967
你会得到140万美元的奖金。
you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

978
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,133
如果这层楼整体
If the floor as a whole

979
01:27:16,842 --> 01:27:25,342
销售完成了93%，你们每人会另外获得130万美元的奖励。
achieves a 93% sale you will
get an additional 1.3 million a piece.

980
01:27:25,967 --> 01:27:28,008
如果你们没有经历过这样的事，
For those of you who have never been
through this before,

981
01:27:28,717 --> 01:27:31,050
那么我告诉你这就是大甩卖的开始。
this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like.

982
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:35,758
不用我告诉你头一个半小时有多么重要了。
I cannot begin to tell you
how important first hour and half is gonna be.

983
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:38,133
我要你们找到每一个可以找到的买家。
I want you to hit every bite you can find.

984
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:39,925
商人、经纪人、顾客……
Dealers, brokers, clients...

985
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:41,592
甚至如果你妈也想买的话。
Your mother, if she respond.

986
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:44,550
不要掉期交易，
No swaps.

987
01:27:45,175 --> 01:27:48,175
我们今天只卖出。
It's outgoing only,
today.

988
01:27:50,758 --> 01:27:54,967
显然这不是我们所希望看到的，
Obviously, this isn't going  down the way
that any of us would've hoped.

989
01:27:55,883 --> 01:27:58,967
但是我们脚下的大地在颤抖了，
but the ground is shifting below our feet,

990
01:27:59,133 --> 01:28:01,550
我们也没有别的选择。
And apparently,
there is no other way out.

991
01:28:21,508 --> 01:28:28,258
上帝啊，现在真的面临一个很特殊的局面……
Gods... this is Obviously,
a very very unique situation...

992
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,050
如果我们今天成功了，
if we are successful today.

993
01:28:31,383 --> 01:28:34,092
我们同时也会成功的砸了我们以后的饭碗。
We will have been successful in
destroying our own jobs...

994
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:38,092
我不能像你们保证所有人都……
I can not promise that any of you..
all of you...

995
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,425
你们当中有一些人还是会被公司解雇。
Some of you would be repositioned within the firm.

996
01:28:44,675 --> 01:28:45,842
但我可以说，我为我们今天在这里的工作感到骄傲。
but I can tell you that, I am very proud
of the work we've done here today.

997
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:53,175
我在这家公司，
I have been at this place,

998
01:28:54,675 --> 01:28:55,842
已经34年了，
34 years,

999
01:28:57,258 --> 01:29:03,008
从我的经验来看，有人会对我们今天做的事情问候你们八辈儿祖宗。
I can tell you from experience, that people are going to say
some very nasty things about what we do here today.

1000
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:05,883
同时也会这样问候你们所效力的公司。
about what you've dedicated a portion of your lives to.

1001
01:29:09,217 --> 01:29:11,967
但说实话，总体来说，
But have faith that in the bigger picture,

1002
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,008
我们展现了我们的能力，
our skills have not been wasted,

1003
01:29:14,758 --> 01:29:16,383
我们获得了许多成就，
we have accomplished much,

1004
01:29:16,883 --> 01:29:18,133
我们的天赋，
and our talents

1005
01:29:18,842 --> 01:29:20,133
用以
have been used...

1006
01:29:22,175 --> 01:29:23,675
达成更伟大的事业。
for the greater good.

1007
01:29:24,967 --> 01:29:28,008
这是你们的信函，加油干吧。
Here's your packets,
get to work.

1008
01:30:02,758 --> 01:30:05,383
接线员：西铁事务所，我是埃里克。
- 让埃利奥特接电话。
Phone man: City..this is Eric.
- Give me Elliott.

1009
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:08,300

- 嘿，我是威尔・艾默生。
- City.
- Hey, its Will Emerson.

1010
01:30:09,383 --> 01:30:10,717

- 我很好，最近干的怎么样？
- William, how are you?
- I'm alright, how's the trouble at scribes?

1011
01:30:10,717 --> 01:30:11,758
总是输的一塌糊涂。
Busting my ass, as always.

1012
01:30:12,092 --> 01:30:14,550
你看，我就说你应该相信我。
You see, that's what i've been trying to tell you.
John, why do you thing I'm saying this?

1013
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:15,592
我知道。
I know you did.

1014
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:16,633
你要我做什么？
What can i do for you?

1015
01:30:16,592 --> 01:30:19,175
我刚得到点儿消息，
Listen, I just got tapped on my shoulder,

1016
01:30:19,175 --> 01:30:21,758
我们有点项目要转移。
we've got some words over here
that we need to move.

1017
01:30:21,758 --> 01:30:22,800
所以今天我的亏损就是你的收益。
So, today. It looks like my lost is your gain.

1018
01:30:21,758 --> 01:30:24,383
多大的盘子？
What kind of size you're talking about?

1019
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:26,967
应该在你的屏幕上，我发给你了。

I just sent it.

1020
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:29,633

- Jesus, what is this gonna land?
- 96 on a dollar.

1021
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,758

- 91?
- Whole three and we're done at 94.

1022
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,883

- 成交！
- 93 and a half?

- Hello, gorgious.

1024
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:40,050
- 威尔，你们那怎么了？
- 今天是转移交易日。
- Will, what's happening over there?
- Today's moving day.

1025
01:30:40,092 --> 01:30:44,467
- 你们他妈的要干什么？
- 他们什么都没说，我就知道这个
- What's the fuck are you guys so worked up about?
- You think they tell me anything, all i know is that

1026
01:30:44,717 --> 01:30:47,300
今天我的亏损就是你的收益。你对我们那么好，
today my loss is your gain.
Now, you're friendly

1027
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,925
所以我就先找你来了。
So, I'm coming to you first.
I got two seventy mill

1028

a fifteen year paying at a twenty half a part.

1029
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:55,175
- 从哪来的？
- 哪来的？谁在乎这个？
- Where is it from?
- Where is it from? Do you care?

1030
01:30:55,175 --> 01:30:57,758
不是吧……
No, not really. Now...

1031
01:30:57,758 --> 01:31:04,300
- 哪交易的？我听说你们……
- 我现在只告诉了你这个事。
- Where's the trade? I'm hearing that you guys....
- I'm only sharing this with you right now!

1033

01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,675
- 操你妈，你这个骗子。
- 不是吧，你还为那事儿生气呢？
- Fuck you, you lying bastard.
- Come on, are you still angry about that.

1037
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:17,133
这事儿都传出去了，我挂了。
Word is out, i'm hanging up.

- 我劳伦斯。
- Merryll?
- Lawrence.

1039
01:31:19,758 --> 01:31:22,383
你们他妈的在干吗啊？
What the fuck are you guys doing over there?

1040
01:31:22,383 --> 01:31:25,425
- 就是一次春季扫货。
- 我听说可不是这样的。
- Just a little spring cleaning.
- That is not what i'm hearing.

1041
01:31:25,675 --> 01:31:28,383
- 好了劳伦斯，你是个买家吗？
- 不一定，什么东西？
- Alright, Lawrence. Are you a buyer?
- I'm not sure anymore. Where at?

1042
01:31:28,925 --> 01:31:30,342
怎么搞得，好像我要问你要卖什么货一样？
Why, it sounds like I should be asking 'Where at.'

1043
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:33,300
75美分的三十年付清混合担保。
- 操……
- 375 mill at third year mix.
- Fuck me..

1044
01:31:34,633 --> 01:31:37,217
你要不要？
Are you with me on this?

1045
01:31:37,217 --> 01:31:39,842
- 63美分。
- 别蛋逼了，我挂了。
- 63 cents?
- or fuck you, I'm hanging up.

1046
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:43,342
- 就63。
- 我问一下，5分钟后告诉你。
- 63?
- I'll come back to you on five.

1047
01:31:43,342 --> 01:31:44,383
或者65.5。
Maybe, sixty five and five.

1048
01:31:45,383 --> 01:31:47,758
稍等，别挂。
Well, alright then, stay on the line.

1049
01:31:48,758 --> 01:31:50,133
山姆，接电话。
Sam, pick up the phone.

1050
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:53,217
山姆，接电话！
Sam...get on the line!

1051
01:31:53,217 --> 01:31:55,800
- 我刚联系了劳伦斯。
- 什么情况？
- I got Lawrence in now.
- Where are we?

1052
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,758
- 63美分。
- 老天，买什么？
- sixty three cent.
- Jesus, and what?

1053
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,717
给他65，卖了。
Get him to sixty five and hit it.

1054
01:32:01,842 --> 01:32:03,133
你他妈开什么玩笑？
Are you fucking kidding me on this?

1055
01:32:03,967 --> 01:32:06,592
那可是在一个交易上就损失了1亿美元。
That's a hundred million lost on a single trade.

1056
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:11,217
我知道，卖了。
I understand...hit it.

1057
01:32:11,508 --> 01:32:13,383
好吧劳伦斯，65，靠谱儿么？
Well, Lawrence. We'd fill a kill at sixty five.

1058
01:32:13,675 --> 01:32:15,258
妥了。
It's filled.

1059
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,675
干的不错。
Well done.

1060
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:49,092
我想过来帮帮你，但他们现在就开始裁员了。
I just wanna give you heads up.
They're gonna start sending a few people home now.

1061
01:32:53,425 --> 01:32:56,008
- 现在？
- 对，而且没什么商量的。
- Now?
- Yes, I know this ends.

1062
01:34:13,467 --> 01:34:14,675
坐。
Please sit.

1063
01:34:15,425 --> 01:34:16,842
恭喜你把这事儿干的有条不紊。
Congratulations are clearly in order.

1064
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,383
我们尽力了。
We did the best we could.

1065
01:34:21,467 --> 01:34:22,467
你确实做了不少事情。
You did a hell of a job.

1066
01:34:24,175 --> 01:34:25,175
我很感激，坐吧。
And i thank you for that.
C'mon sit.

1067
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:27,300
不好意思我在吃东西，
Excuse me for eating, but...

1068
01:34:29,342 --> 01:34:30,717
今天真的很不容易。
It's been a long day.

1069
01:34:31,383 --> 01:34:33,050
- 你要点什么吗？
- 不用了，谢谢。
- Can i get you something?
- No, nothing, Thanks.

1070
01:34:38,383 --> 01:34:40,550
- 要我做什么？
- 我要辞职。
- What can i do for you?
- I want out.

1071
01:34:42,467 --> 01:34:43,925
- 我做完了，我要辞职。
- I'm done, I want out.

1072
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:49,967
- 这一天很不容易……
- 我要你把我的期货全都放了，
- It's a very difficult day for all...
- I need you to release my options,

1073
01:34:50,425 --> 01:34:52,842
如果以后它们还值钱的话，我要我的分红，但是我要辞职。
If they're worth anything today,
I want my bonus, I am out.

1074
01:34:53,133 --> 01:34:53,925
你可以保留你的分红，你的期货……
You'll get your bonus,
your options...

1075
01:34:54,258 --> 01:34:56,883
但是蛋腚点儿。但我要你再干24个月。
and keep a calm face. But i need you to stay
with me for next 24 months..

1076
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,550
你今天做的很好，你也这么觉得吧。
You did some good today,
you said that yourself.

1077
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,758
知道吗
You know...

1078
01:35:10,258 --> 01:35:13,300
这之后我对整件事的感觉好多了。
I'm starting to feel
a little better about all this whole thing.

1079
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:17,050
山姆，你是世界上最幸运的人。
You're one of the luckiest guy in the world, Sam.

1080
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:18,883
如果不是做这个你还在挖战壕呢。
You could've been digging dicks
all this years.

1081
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:22,217
那倒是。
That's true.

1082
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,050
如果我那么做的话，至少
And if i had, at least...

1083
01:35:29,425 --> 01:35:32,758
我就不知道我们怎么把事搞得这么恶心？
How the hell did we fuck this up,
quite so much?

1084
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,383
你什么时候开始觉得对不起大家了……真受不了你。
When did you start feeling so sorry
for yourself..its unbearable.

1085
01:35:40,425 --> 01:35:43,758
怎么，你觉得我们今天让一些人破产了。
So, you think we might've put a few
people out of business today.

1086
01:35:43,758 --> 01:35:44,800
这都是徒然。
It's all for note.

1087
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:50,508
但你做这样的事情都快40年了。
But you've been doing that everyday,
for almost 40 years Sam

1088
01:35:52,383 --> 01:35:55,425
如果你觉得这是浮云，那所有的东西都是了。
If this is all for note, then so is everything out there.

1089
01:35:59,175 --> 01:36:00,467
这就是钱的事儿。
Its just money.

1090
01:36:01,092 --> 01:36:02,050
都是假的，虚构的。
It's made up.

1091
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:05,717
纸上画着画，
It's pieces of paper with a picture on it.
So, we don't have to

1092
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:07,842
所以我们就不用相互残杀，来点东西吃吧。
kill each other, just to get something to eat.

1093
01:36:10,175 --> 01:36:11,508
这没什么不对的。
Its not wrong.

1094
01:36:11,508 --> 01:36:12,550
现在和原来也没什么区别。
And it's certainly not different today,
then it's ever been.

1095
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:21,675
1637, 1797, 1819, 1937，1957

1096
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:23,842
1984,

1097
01:36:25,342 --> 01:36:27,425
1901, 1907

1098
01:36:28,133 --> 01:36:31,258
1929, 1937..1974

1099
01:36:31,967 --> 01:36:34,300
还有1987年，天啊！都差点整死我。
1987, Jesus!
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1100
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:37,675
1992、1997、2000年，不管怎么说。
92, 97..2000
and whatever we wanna call this.

1101
01:36:38,467 --> 01:36:40,925
都是同样的事情，周而复始的，我们改变不了什么。
All just for same thing,
over and over..we can't help ourselves.

1102
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:43,800
我们会想要，嗯……
And we wanna like uh,

1103
01:36:47,925 --> 01:36:51,133
控制它、或者阻止它或者减缓它的发展。
可是我们从来都没能改变过什么。
Control it, or stop it or even slow it.
We haven't even since slightly altered.

1104
01:36:52,508 --> 01:36:53,758
我们只能应对。
We just react.

1105
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,800
如果我们做对了，就能赚到很多钱。
We get a lot of money,
if we get it right.

1106
01:36:57,717 --> 01:36:59,383
而如果我们做错了，就被人们抛弃。
And we get left by the side of road,
if we get it wrong.

1107
01:37:00,967 --> 01:37:04,467
一直就是这样，以后也会一直这样，赢家和输家的比例是不变的。
And there has always been, and always will be..
the same percentage of winners and losers

1108
01:37:04,467 --> 01:37:05,508
快乐的小二逼和可怜的倒霉蛋。
happy fucks and sad sacks.

1109
01:37:06,217 --> 01:37:07,383
世界上就是肥猫和饿狗。
Fat cats and starving dogs, in this world.

1110
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,300
现在世界上可能我们这样的人比之前多。
Yeah, then maybe more of us today,
than there ever been...

1111
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,883
但是比例，
but the percentage,

1112
01:37:17,717 --> 01:37:19,425
和原来是一样的。
they stand exactly the same.

1113
01:37:38,842 --> 01:37:41,675
好吧我会继续干，但不是因为你的一分钟演说，
I'll do it John, not but because of the little speech,

1114
01:37:43,467 --> 01:37:44,800
而是因为我需要钱。
But because I need the money.

1115
01:37:46,258 --> 01:37:51,883
真不敢相信，这么多年了，我还是需要拼命挣钱。
Hard to believe, after all this years..
But I... need the money.

1116
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:03,883
你要留着那小子吗？
Are you gonna keep the kid?

1117
01:38:07,008 --> 01:38:08,258
留着他？他会升职的。
Keep him? He's gonna promote him.

1118
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:10,800
看戴克怎么处理了。
Its all hands on deck now Sam.

1119
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,175
这事儿之后我们会有很多钱可挣，
There's gonna be a lot of money to be made,
coming out of this mess.

1120
01:38:14,175 --> 01:38:16,925
所以我们需要所有能找到的智囊团来帮我们。
And they're gonna need all the brains,
we can get out on here.

1121
01:40:41,633 --> 01:40:45,342
我从兽医那回来，我不知道能去哪儿。
I went home from the vet
and I couldn't think of where as to go.

1122
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:48,383
她属于这。
She belongs here.

1123
01:40:50,425 --> 01:40:53,758
我知道，但山姆你已经不在这住了。
I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.

1124
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:03,258
你没事吧？你看起来不太好。
Are you alright?
You don't look so good.

1125
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,592
没事，今天真是够背的。
Yeah, it's been a rough day all the way around.

1126
01:41:07,133 --> 01:41:08,508
我知道，萨米说了。
I know, Sammy called.

1127
01:41:08,508 --> 01:41:09,550
他还好么？
Is he alright?

1128
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:11,675
他被裁了，
They got hammered,

1129
01:41:11,675 --> 01:41:14,175
但他还好。
but got out alive.

1130
01:41:14,175 --> 01:41:15,217
那就好。
Good.

1131
01:41:22,633 --> 01:41:29,008
好吧我先进屋睡了。
Well, I am going to go back inside and go back to bed.

1133
01:41:29,675 --> 01:41:33,217
有警报，所以别想闯进来。
The alarm is on so don't try to break in.

1134
01:41:42,717 --> 01:41:44,050
你自己保重。
Take care of yourself.

01:41:47,000 --> 01:43:00,000
