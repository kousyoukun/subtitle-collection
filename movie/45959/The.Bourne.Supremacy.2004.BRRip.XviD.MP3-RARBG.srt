Pam, I think you might

a little past
your pay grade.

191
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,292
That's a warrant
from Director Marshall

192
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,585

unrestricted access

193
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,504

Then let's cut the crap.

212
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,214
Conklin had these
guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.

213
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,007
Bourne was his number one.

214
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,135
The guy went for a job,
screwed the op, never
came back.

215
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,721
Conklin couldn't fix it,
couldn't find Bourne,
couldn't adjust.

lt all went sideways.

217
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,391

ln the investigation
that followed

240
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,813
we were contacted by
a Russian politician,
Vladimir Neski.

241
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,775
Neski claimed we had a leak
and that we'd been ripped
off by one of our own.

And were we?

Now I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject
around here,

when we dug a little deeper.

This is Conklin's

254

nor had clearance for.

on a personal account
in the amount of $760,000.

What's definitive
is that I just lost
two people in Berlin.

266
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,503

Conklin's reaching out
from the grave

his good name?
