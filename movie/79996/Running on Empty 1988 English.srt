1
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,194
Shit.

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,909
Hang in there, man.

3
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,038
Lighten up, McNally. It's only a game.

4
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,229
Hey, man, believe it or not,
you made the starting line-up.

5
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,429
No shit?

6
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,033
Yeah, Andrews has the chicken pox.

7
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,516
You're good for two games, at least.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,874
Well, that's great.

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,390
If you don't like it, why do you do it?

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,992
Baseball's my life.

11
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,233
Jomo. Jomo! Come here.

12
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,435
Come here.

13
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,555
Now, listen, Jomo.

14
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,911
I want you to take this to Harry, all right?

15
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,759
Take it to Harry! Come on!
Take it to Harry! Take it to Harry!

16
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,829
Go on! Take it to Harry!

17
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,269
Take it to Harry!

18
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,109
Go on! Go on, Jomo!

19
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,069
Jomo! Jomo!

20
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,629
Come on! Come on!

21
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,475
Get down! Get down!

22
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,909
All right, come on.

23
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,912
- I still think you should go.
- No, I can't get off from work.

24
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,117
But you're the only one that knows all
those statistics. I can't remember nothing.

25
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,236
My brain's a sieve.
How do you learn it all that stuff?

26
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,629
It's in the government reports.
It's in the library.

27
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,233
You think they'll really listen to us?

28
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,552
Well, if they don't, there's going to be
1,500 barrels of radioactive waste...

29
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,629
buried just a few miles from here...

30
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,756
and you might have grandchildren
with three heads.

31
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,953
Now, look, I'm going to rehearse you.

32
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,237
And there's a delegation
from Point Arena going, too.

33
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,992
Jerry Baker. He's very good on his feet.

34
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,599
And Joe will be there.

35
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,035
Look, I got to go. I'll miss my ride. Okay?

36
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,790
Martha, remember the study group's
at my place on Thursday.

37
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,869
Okay!

38
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,469
How did it go?

39
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,278
They wanted me to go to Tallahassee
and lobby.

40
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,839
I talked them into sending Joe and Paula.

41
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,989
Joe and Paula?

42
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,752
It's okay. They'll be all right.

43
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,435
The nerve those assholes have,
putting that shit near human beings.

44
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,750
Let's blow this pop stand. I'm starving.

45
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,273
We got shoes, two cars, four feds.

46
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,433
Mom, there's Jomo.

47
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,552
You two,
get out of your jeans and into bed.

48
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,591
What's gonna happen to her?

49
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
- Someone will take her home.
- We never had to leave her before.

50
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,589
Sorry, kid.

51
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,830
- He got to keep that.
- I thought I told you to get in to bed.

52
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,433
- It's morning.
- Get into bed!

53
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,792
I'm going to wash my hair.

54
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,834
Who's this?

55
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,637
Mom and Dad. Who do you think?

56
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,233
You're kidding.

57
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,156
"Arthur and Annie Pope
continue to elude capture...

58
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,359
"despite sightings of the couple,
who went underground...

59
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,433
"after claiming responsibility
for the 1971 bombing...

60
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,717
"of the University of Massachusetts
military research lab. "

61
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,913
What does "elude" mean?

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,433
Not getting caught.

63
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,633
"The laboratory is credited
with the development of napalm...

64
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,117
"used extensively in the Vietnam War. "

65
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,153
Why did they have to blow it up?

66
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,959
They didn't stop making it
when they asked them politely.

67
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,917
Come on, Danny, I'm serious!

68
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,272
They were dropping that stuff on people.

69
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,828
"Annie Pope is the former
Anne Patterson...

70
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,391
"daughter of Donald Patterson,
president of American Telekinetics. "

71
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,158
Is this Grandpa?

72
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,115
- It must be.
- And Grandma?

73
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,309
Yeah.

74
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,192
Do you remember them?

75
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,277
- No.
- Not even a little?

76
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,511
They look kind of uptight.

77
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,399
- Industrial waste all around.
- Rad!

78
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,517
Get them while they're hot.
Get them before they rot.

79
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,159
- Where's your mother?
- She's in the shower.

80
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,512
I talked this morning with some of the
people who knew the Pope family best.

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,591
John Kungle played ball
with the young man...

82
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,478
who was known here in Florida City
as Richard McNally.

83
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,478
He was a good student, and a good friend?

84
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,948
He was a cool dude.

85
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,672
That's how legends are made.

86
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,671
What's his IQ? 49?

87
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,509
- He's going to UCLA.
- No kidding?

88
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,678
No, I'm not kidding.
I said, he's going to UCLA.

89
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,035
Excuse me.

90
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,511
These photos of the couple
are 20 years old...

91
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,477
and are not considered too reliable.

92
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,912
The couple is still wanted for the
1971 bombing of their university lab...

93
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,752
in which a janitor was blinded.

94
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,594
FBl officials in Miami said that despite
the presence of their two children...

95
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,036
the Popes should be considered
as possibly armed and dangerous.

96
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,912
In further local news...

97
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,833
There's food for you.

98
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,314
You look pretty, Mom.

99
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,992
Get into bed, Kimosabe.

100
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,790
Okay, let's see.

101
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,952
Blue eyes, blond hair. You're okay.

102
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,154
Or are you?

103
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,999
What's the matter, kid?

104
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,354
I don't know.

105
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,397
I just feel kind of lousy, you know?

106
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,436
You're supposed to feel that way at 17.

107
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,589
Really?

108
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,238
It's terrific not recognizing yourself
when you look in the mirror.

109
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
It's wonderful having a new name
every six months.

110
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,080
We were there a long time.
It's hard to leave.

111
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,516
We may have to cut your hair, too.

112
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,154
Maybe this time I could shave my head.

113
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,393
- Send your brother in.
- Yeah.

114
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,632
I hate this.

115
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,390
The Phillies won again last night.

116
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,117
Things are looking good, then.

117
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,077
Things are looking great.

118
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,231
The MacArthur feud with Truman.

119
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,709
I don't think we covered that
in the local paper.

120
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,871
Maybe you better try The Washingtonian.

121
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,191
No, I'm interested in how it affected
the heartland of the nation...

122
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,474
the small communities.

123
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,555
- This is social history.
- I could show you The Eagle.

124
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,917
We just put our back issues on microfilm.

125
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,680
- This is it?
- Take it right over there.

126
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,749
Thank you.

127
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,070
St. Martin's Hospital, Medical Records.

128
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,356
- Three dollars?
- Yes.

129
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,196
Where do you want it mailed,
Mr. Mansfield?

130
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,395
Manfield.

131
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,199
No, I'll pick it up.

132
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,073
I need to get a passport.
The company's sending me to Cairo.

133
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,679
- Are you in oil?
- Military.

134
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,636
You're listening to your favorite
oldies station in Norfolk, Virginia...

135
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,639
Ralph, the cat needs to be fed.

136
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,194
Need anything else?

137
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,477
- No. I'll call the booth again in two weeks.
- Okay.

138
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,239
Listen, your mother...

139
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,033
She died four weeks ago. Cancer.

140
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,518
Your father was with her.

141
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,511
You were just too hot to contact.

142
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,438
He said to tell you not to worry about him.
He's okay.

143
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,195
Sorry.

144
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,718
Okay, who wants lunch?

145
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,915
Me.

146
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,349
How's tuna?

147
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,029
Yecch.

148
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,630
There's a kid in my class who traded me
Duke Snider for Valenzuela.

149
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,278
Yeah, so?

150
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,479
So, he's a jerk.

151
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,475
Snider's worth about $20.

152
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,070
He's from the Brooklyn Dodgers.

153
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,073
He's old.

154
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,878
This card is an antique.

155
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,550
- Can I have white bread?
- Just eat it.

156
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,554
Hey, kid.

157
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,631
You. What's your name?

158
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,995
Michael.

159
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,678
- Why are you asking him that?
- He's not used to it yet.

160
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,996
He better get used to it fast.

161
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,874
What's my name?

162
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,512
- Paul.
- Paul what?

163
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,912
- Paul Manfield.
- Spell it.

164
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,160
M- A-N...

165
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,757
F- I-E-L-D.

166
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,228
- What's your mother's name?
- Just stop it.

167
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,309
I'm waiting.

168
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,875
Cynthia.

169
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,075
And your brother?

170
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,914
Stephen, all right?

171
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,318
What the hell's your problem?

172
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,152
I got some clothes in the city.

173
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,555
You can wear the thrift shop ones.
The new ones...

174
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,632
have to be washed first.

175
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,634
Yes, sir!

176
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,832
Sorry about this afternoon.

177
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,794
Sophie's dead.

178
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,309
What?

179
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,792
A month ago. The big "C."

180
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,829
Oh, babe.

181
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,596
I talked to her after the feds came,
to tell her we were okay.

182
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,033
She never let on.

183
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,080
I can just see her
standing there with Morris.

184
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,789
Two fat old Jews, ex-Bolsheviks...

185
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,635
talking to their red-diaper baby
on a phone from a Laundromat...

186
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,717
and she's fucking dying.

187
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,992
That lady loved me.

188
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,797
Last winter, when they arranged
for her to meet me in Chicago...

189
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,680
she flew there on an hour's notice...

190
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,310
alone, in a blizzard.

191
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,712
She's terrified of flying.

192
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,270
She was green when she got off the plane.

193
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,150
I took her over to the lounge to talk...

194
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,472
and we sat in a corner and I said,
"I wish it was easier. "

195
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,636
"You wish it were easier," she says.

196
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,150
She's correcting my grammar...

197
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,869
like I'm one of the kids she teaches.

198
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,350
There's nothing left to go back to now.

199
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,398
There's only us and the boys.

200
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,312
We're all that's left.

201
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,914
We must...

202
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,069
We have to hang on to each other.

203
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,519
May I see his records?

204
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,591
I'm afraid I lost his records.

205
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,636
They gave them to me,
and I know I packed them...

206
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,153
but I just can't find them.

207
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,955
I'm always losing things, right?

208
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,958
My husband says I'd probably lose
my head if it weren't screwed on.

209
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,197
But I can write for a copy.

210
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,191
Make sure to write for those records,
okay?

211
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,397
You can have two electives.

212
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,472
Music, typing, mechanics, computer
programming, or home economics?

213
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,709
Music.

214
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,714
- And?
- And?

215
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,000
- Home economics.
- His dad's a cook.

216
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,471
Find an empty seat, Mr. Manfield.

217
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,352
All right, listen up, everyone.

218
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,072
Listen again, please.

219
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,354
Now, can anyone tell me the difference
between these two pieces?

220
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,155
Yes?

221
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,755
One is pop and the other is classical.

222
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,636
At least we know you're not deaf.

223
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,477
How about you, Mr. Spaulding?

224
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,230
Could you give us a deeper distinction?

225
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,350
The first one's bad...

226
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,119
and the second one's good.

227
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,313
That's a matter of opinion, not a fact.

228
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,437
I'm sure there are several people in this
room who would disagree with you.

229
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,390
How about you, Mr. Manfield?

230
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,431
Would you care to venture a guess?

231
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,758
You can't dance to Beethoven.

232
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,150
That's very good, Manfield.
Do you listen to much Beethoven?

233
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,514
No, not really.

234
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,511
How did you identify this piece?

235
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,555
I guess I've heard some.

236
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,673
I'm sure the rest of the class
can identify the other composer.

237
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,715
You're quite correct.
You can't dance to Mr. Beethoven.

238
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,070
Can you tell me why, Mr. Manfield?

239
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,870
Because the Beethoven piece...

240
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,033
doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo!

241
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,715
Madonna is 4/4 time all the way through.

242
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,999
The melody changes,
but the rhythm is constant.

243
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,799
So you can dance to it.

244
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,148
The quartet changes
both melodically and rhythmically.

245
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,789
I'm going to play them again.
Listen for this.

246
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,429
Mr. Manfield.

247
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,952
We'll have to find an instrument for you.

248
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,109
An instrument?

249
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,110
Everybody who takes music
is required to play in the orchestra.

250
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,915
Do you play something?

251
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,115
Piano.

252
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,319
Play something.

253
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,591
Well, there's one thing you don't have
to do, and that's play in the orchestra.

254
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,992
I'd like to hear how you sound
on the Steinway I have at home.

255
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,593
Get out of here.

256
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,712
- Get a job, Dad?
- You betcha I did. Right in town.

257
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,519
- I'm a cook. Guess which kind?
- Italian?

258
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,716
- You got it.
- Radical!

259
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,631
Do you have to say that?

260
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,680
- Where'd you get this?
- Public library lost and found.

261
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,318
It's right around the corner
from the restaurant.

262
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,597
April can be cold up here.
I thought you might need these.

263
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,155
Keep those slugger hands from cracking.

264
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,832
- Did you make the team?
- Yeah.

265
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,990
- Great.
- What about me?

266
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,550
Sorry, kid. Nothing in your size. Have to
try a movie theater on the weekend.

267
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,029
Which reminds me, we have to chop
some firewood on Saturday.

268
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,997
Oh, Dad, I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm not going to school.

269
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,111
- How come?
- They're taking class pictures.

270
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,229
Right.

271
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,879
- How is that school?
- Not bad.

272
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,796
- Teachers know anything you don't?
- Yeah, they're okay.

273
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,552
Did you have any trouble
with the registration?

274
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,676
I had to see the guidance counselor
at the end of the day.

275
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,875
And?

276
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,872
He wanted to know
what colleges I was applying to.

277
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,993
What did you tell him?

278
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,991
Well, I said I hadn't decided yet.

279
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,755
Good. Just tell them something,
and forget about it.

280
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,796
Otherwise they'll keep bugging you.

281
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,077
- How about you, small stuff?
- I don't want peppers.

282
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,269
Bless you.

283
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,233
There's a kid in my class
who's really crazy.

284
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,194
You're not exactly the poster child
for mental health.

285
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,748
He knows train schedules.

286
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,592
You never know.
It might have come in handy.

287
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,148
Really, Dad. All over the country.

288
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,796
He knows what time trains leave
from Omaha to Atlanta, Georgia.

289
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,909
Stuff like that.

290
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,434
Get to know this kid.
What are you doing with that safety pin?

291
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,953
What safety pin?

292
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,196
- I got a job.
- Really?

293
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,079
Tell us, my dear.

294
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,072
How are you going to contribute
to this false, capitalist economy?

295
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,196
I'm going to be a receptionist
for a Dr. Milton Cosswell.

296
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

297
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,311
There was a sign up at the post office.

298
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,231
He doesn't mind paying me in cash.

299
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,478
He didn't even ask why.

300
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,279
It's probably good for his taxes,
or something.

301
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,438
Anyway, it means I can pick up supplies,
if we need them.

302
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,752
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

303
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,752
Mom, thanks.

304
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,316
Sounds good.
Looks like we all got what we wanted.

305
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,152
Hello, is anyone home?

306
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,469
Hello?

307
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,953
Who are you?

308
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,872
I live here. Who are you?

309
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,629
- Is Mr. Phillips your father?
- Yes.

310
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,759
And is this you in the pink-

311
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,034
I've destroyed the negative.

312
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,793
So now we've determined
that I belong here. Let's talk about you.

313
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,556
Your father said I could use the piano.
And the door was open.

314
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,029
- We do have a bell.
- I rang the bell.

315
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,839
No one answered, so I came in. I'm sorry.

316
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,638
You go to the school?

317
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,915
Yeah.

318
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,117
- I haven't seen you there.
- That's because I just started.

319
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,758
So how come you're not there?

320
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,320
I had a fever last night.
My mom made me stay home.

321
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,836
- Why didn't you?
- I felt better today. And I was bored.

322
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,830
You're strange. I cut.

323
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,838
I didn't feel like having my picture taken
with those subhumans.

324
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,833
You're very good, you know.

325
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,552
I'm okay.

326
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,673
What's your name?

327
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,110
- Michael.
- I'm Lorna.

328
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,035
I'd better be going.

329
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,236
- Where are you from?
- Oakland.

330
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,000
- You born in California?
- No, New York.

331
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,315
Really?

332
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,597
I want to go to school in New York,
but my mother's afraid I'll get mugged.

333
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,032
Your family move around a lot?

334
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,559
No, not really. You play?

335
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,470
God, no. I couldn't stand to practice.

336
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,910
My older brother is the virtuoso.

337
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,596
He's at Yale. He does everything right.
Where are you going?

338
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,719
Oh, that.
I haven't thought about that much.

339
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,635
You haven't though about it much? You're
going to have to apply next semester.

340
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,709
Yeah?

341
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,112
What do you mean, "Yeah?"

342
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,711
Look, I really... I gotta go.

343
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,712
You're certifiable.

344
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,633
You're welcome.

345
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,630
Mr. Manfield, I'd like a word with you.

346
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
I understand you had occasion
to visit my house yesterday.

347
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,152
I went to look at your piano.

348
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,435
I understand you did more than look at it.

349
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,550
- Do you have a piano at home?
- No, sir.

350
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,994
How do you practice?

351
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,954
I can't much.

352
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,357
You're a talented musician, Manfield...

353
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,715
but that doesn't give you the right
to act like a criminal.

354
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,074
Is that clear?

355
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,549
Yes, sir.

356
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,949
Manfield?

357
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,752
We'll find you a piano.

358
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,831
Now let me see, girls.

359
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,513
Thank you. Just go to the back of the line.

360
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,155
You are certifiable.

361
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,798
What is this? Some sort of smart-ass joke?
You're taking cooking?

362
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,154
I want to learn how to cook.

363
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,949
Yeah, right. You have a burning desire
to learn how to make Apple Brown Betty.

364
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,077
What are you doing here,
if you think so highly of it?

365
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,037
They wouldn't let me take
auto mechanics...

366
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,475
and I didn't have time to take the issue
to the Supreme Court.

367
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,950
Now that leaves Phillips and Manfield.

368
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,629
Please, would you take the last booth?

369
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,711
Today's menu...

370
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,033
is tuna-walnut casserole.

371
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,270
This may be auto mechanics after all.

372
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,349
Take your four-cup measuring bowl.

373
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,034
You know, my father thinks
you're the best thing since sliced bread.

374
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,951
That's not what he told me.

375
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,753
A can of tuna.

376
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,872
Listen, don't worry.
Don't let him scare you.

377
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,996
You can do anything
if he thinks you can play music.

378
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,711
Half a cup of walnuts.

379
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,789
We're having
a chamber music concert Saturday.

380
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,195
And they're boring as hell,
you have to dress for a funeral...

381
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,713
but you'd probably like it.
You want to come?

382
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,711
Two stalks of celery.

383
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,397
- Yeah, I've got to think about it. Celery.
- Celery.

384
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,749
Here.

385
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,393
He's getting seduced
by all this bourgeois crap.

386
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,358
- Fucking chamber music.
- It's music, for God's sake.

387
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,318
Decadent, white-skinned, privileged crap.

388
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,997
Lot of people sitting around in ties
and pantyhose in wing chairs...

389
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,991
- like at your mother's house.
- Like at my mother's house.

390
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,354
He's not going.

391
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,756
- Says who?
- Says me!

392
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,037
- I don't believe you.
- Read my lips: He's not going.

393
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,430
Since when did you become
the minister of culture?

394
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,351
You'd let him go
if it was a rock 'n' roll concert.

395
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,510
- That's right! You bet I would. Yes.
- Unbelievable.

396
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,511
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,310
I'm not letting him go
because it's not safe.

398
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,794
He doesn't have to be on display
for the entire community of Waterford.

399
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,270
And because it's not rock and roll.

400
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,273
You think you're cute, Dad,
but you're full of shit.

401
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,796
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Why?

402
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,190
Aren't we supposed to question authority?
You taught me that!

403
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,276
Who do you think you are?
General Patton?

404
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,511
Why is it any more dangerous for me to go
to school than it is to go to the concert?

405
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,036
Because there are 600 other kids
at the school.

406
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,713
Give me a break.

407
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,639
You're not going.

408
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,830
Mr. Manfield!
To what do we owe this pleasure?

409
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,433
Lorna invited me.

410
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,160
She usually doesn't show
such good judgment.

411
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,677
I'm delighted.
There's some people I want you to meet.

412
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,309
Sam, this is Michael Manfield,
the boy I was telling you about.

413
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,389
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

414
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,710
Perhaps we can convince you
to play something for us.

415
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,791
I have nothing prepared.

416
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,758
I heard you working on some Brahms
the other day. It was perfectly lovely.

417
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,558
You can play it
after the second intermission.

418
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,235
I'd like to, but I really have to go
pick up my brother at a friend's house.

419
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,197
You can play before you have to go.

420
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,269
Listen, Dad, would you excuse me?

421
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,509
I'd like to get Michael something to eat.

422
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,875
- Hope to hear you soon.
- It was really good stuff.

423
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,800
How come you didn't want
to play for them?

424
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,715
Personally, I wouldn't consider it,
but you're supposed to love this stuff.

425
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,989
It's all right. You don't have to explain.
Mozart was crazy, too.

426
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,755
- Want to go up to my room?
- Okay.

427
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,670
All right. Finish your milk.

428
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,353
Excuse me.

429
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,552
Guitar is my life.

430
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,750
You're very confusing, you know.

431
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,790
Who, me? Why?

432
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,953
'Cause sometimes you can be so straight...

433
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,270
and then other times,
you turn around and you're like that.

434
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,832
- It's always, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir. "
- I'm polite.

435
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,196
- Polite is phony.
- It's not phony.

436
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,032
- It avoids confrontation.
- Is that what you're doing now?

437
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,031
You're avoiding confrontation?

438
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,276
Don't you ever want to say, "Cut the shit"?

439
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,198
Lorna! Is Michael in there with you?
I want him to play.

440
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,433
He left. He went to pick up his brother.

441
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,876
I thought this was my room.

442
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,790
Your mother wants you downstairs.

443
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,388
There's a tree.

444
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,149
Mrs. Powell? The doctor will see you now.

445
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,030
Did I leave my purse out here?

446
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,309
Thank you.

447
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,714
Excuse me?

448
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,349
Excuse me!

449
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,918
Do you have an appointment?

450
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,314
Nope.

451
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,834
Gus!

452
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,957
What's cooking, mama?

453
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,796
I look at you, and I can see you standing
on the corner of Michigan Avenue...

454
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,552
in a Mexican blouse
and those crazy silver things.

455
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,478
Big silver earrings.

456
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,391
God, that was a long time ago.

457
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,074
How's Artie?

458
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,194
He's okay.

459
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,911
He's great, actually.

460
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,077
He did some work in Florida
on a toxic waste dump.

461
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,159
Here, he organized a food co-op...

462
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,037
and he's trying to
get his restaurant to unionize.

463
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,190
And how's you and Artie?

464
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,194
We're okay.

465
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,675
I mean, you know, it's hard.

466
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,193
I think about you.

467
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,473
I think about you.

468
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,473
I hope you're safe.

469
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,432
How do you manage this?

470
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,994
Got a house...

471
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,754
two kids.

472
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,154
It's kind of like
you're leading a regular life.

473
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,473
I'm a good liar.

474
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,478
But I'm tired.

475
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,873
Shit.

476
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,709
Oh, God.

477
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,269
Hey, chief.

478
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,029
Hello.

479
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,434
Hello?

480
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,389
That's all you got to say to this guy
that just drove...

481
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,914
800 miles out of his way to see you?

482
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,714
You look great.

483
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,552
Then how come I feel so uneasy?

484
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,871
Artie, let's take a walk.
I got stuff to talk to you about.

485
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,995
I'm tired.

486
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,595
Go ahead, Paul. Take a walk with him.
You haven't seen him for 12 years.

487
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,352
You're out of your fucking mind!

488
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,318
- You owe us!
- I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

489
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,120
Do you know what
your asshole friend here wants me to do?

490
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,228
Rob a fucking bank! Can you believe it?
A fucking bank!

491
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,470
A "political action," he calls it.

492
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,553
We've been assigned this little job
by the Liberation Army.

493
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,393
Who are under the mistaken impression
that they've been supporting us...

494
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,072
and we owe them something!

495
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,031
What do they want my kids to do?

496
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,395
Knock off the fucking president?

497
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,156
You want to show
what you got in your car?

498
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,276
Nothing. It's my stuff.

499
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,716
That's not the impression you gave me.

500
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,390
Let's look, shall we?

501
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,638
Get the kids down here.
I want them to see this.

502
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,597
This guy's still a fucking maniac!

503
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,669
Just stop it.

504
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,718
Boys! Get down here! Now!

505
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,354
I want you to know
guns are not what we're about.

506
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,998
Now, get back in the house.

507
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,276
You're going to change the world, Artie...

508
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,197
by organizing these little food co-ops?

509
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,674
I'm going out.

510
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,272
You can stay the night...

511
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,353
but when I get back, I don't want to see
these things within 10 miles of my kids.

512
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,710
Annie, I'd like to explain this.

513
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,314
I'm listening.

514
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,750
You know,
we've been under a long time.

515
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,554
A lot of bad shit has happened.
A lot of bad shit keeps happening.

516
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,913
But we're dead...

517
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,590
as far as the world is concerned.

518
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,069
We pull an action
and they bury it in the newspapers.

519
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,671
It's like it didn't happen.

520
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,193
The only time the pigs
or the media pay attention...

521
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,238
is when something
or somebody gets blown away.

522
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,437
Great. If you can't beat them, join them.

523
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,233
Do you think we're going to win this
by turning the other cheek?

524
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,036
Why don't you try walking on water?

525
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,317
Why don't you try growing up?
There's nothing to win.

526
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,031
It was over as soon as the war ended.

527
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,475
The war didn't end, Annie.
The war ain't never going to end.

528
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,395
This has nothing to do with politics
or the merchandise in my car.

529
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,357
This is just Artie's pissed.

530
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,719
Artie's pissed...

531
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,119
'cause Artie's jealous.

532
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,351
And Artie's jealous...

533
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,358
because you want me.

534
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,352
And I sure want you.

535
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,272
That's a bad situation.

536
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,600
Sooner or later,
they're just going to blow up.

537
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,631
You know, I feel sorry for you.

538
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,115
I do.

539
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,671
You're a 46-year-old infant.

540
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,591
Everything has to be your way, doesn't it?
When you want it, where you want it.

541
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,358
You're not a revolutionary.

542
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,592
That requires more than playing with guns
or with yourself.

543
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,193
It requires compassion, discipline.

544
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,430
Are you judging me?

545
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,030
You judge yourself, lady.

546
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,473
You're living like some kind of silly-ass,
middle-class, suburban housewife.

547
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,272
You're living a lie...

548
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,151
just like you said.

549
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,870
Why don't you take this little
Norman Rockwell family and turn them in?

550
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,957
The feds would be glad to get them.

551
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,633
And then you could get the fuck out.

552
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,434
I wish I could.

553
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,433
Now get out.

554
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,159
Are you okay, Mom?

555
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,909
Yeah.

556
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,074
Fine.

557
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,874
Go to bed.

558
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,395
I am not Paul. I am not Paul! I am-

559
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,313
- Paul, come in.
- I'm not Paul.

560
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,794
I'm Arthur.

561
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,475
Don't call me "Paul. " I am Arthur.

562
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,719
I am Arthur Eli Pope!

563
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,989
- What's the matter with Dad?
- He's just had a lot to drink.

564
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,835
Born in Plattsburg, New York,
July 16, 1944!

565
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,749
A US citizen. My mother's...

566
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,670
maiden name is Silbowitz.

567
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,276
My father's real name is Popov.
Morris Popov.

568
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,120
My driver's license number is 4-3-5-7...

569
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,955
1-1.

570
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,633
My draft number is M-S-8-9...

571
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,236
-3-5-8-4.
- It's okay.

572
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,111
My name is Pope.

573
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,309
It's okay.

574
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,350
You said walk, not hike.

575
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,552
- Are you tired?
- No.

576
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,349
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

577
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,470
You know,
I was really surprised when you called me.

578
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,749
Why?

579
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,909
I wasn't sure if you liked me or not.

580
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,474
Sometimes you're so...

581
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,594
distant.

582
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,990
I'm not too sure
if you like me too much, either.

583
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,473
Take it on faith. I usually don't follow
people I don't like for 10 miles...

584
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,993
into the middle of the woods.

585
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,513
Why are you so angry?

586
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,992
That's wit, not anger.

587
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,793
- You scare a lot of people.
- Who, besides you?

588
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,957
A lot of people scare me.

589
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,598
Who scares you?

590
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,318
People who are nice, like my parents.

591
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,831
What's wrong with being nice?

592
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,391
Let's put it like this.

593
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,589
My mother is really nice.

594
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,077
She never does anything wrong or mean.

595
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,835
She even gives her old clothes
to the maid...

596
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,071
but she doesn't really want to know her.

597
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,720
In 10 years,
she's never even seen Betty's husband.

598
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,269
He waits in the car
when he comes to pick her up.

599
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,151
Your father's sure not like that.

600
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,277
Why? Because he plays Madonna in class?

601
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,079
What does he know about you,
except that you're good on the piano?

602
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,711
They see what they want to see,
and they block out everything else...

603
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,109
especially if it might not be nice.

604
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,277
They don't seem to get in your way much.

605
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,591
My parents? It's just their way
of not believing who I really am.

606
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,228
They think that eventually,
I'll turn back into the little girl...

607
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,153
in the pink dress
that's in the picture on the piano.

608
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,473
And what do you think?

609
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,792
You really want to know?

610
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,715
I think that I'll go to New York
and learn to write...

611
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,190
and that I'll come home every Christmas...

612
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,159
and everyone will be really polite.

613
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,191
That's doesn't sound so bad.

614
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,789
Maybe not, but I'm not in New York yet.

615
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,188
So what about you?

616
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,631
I don't know a thing about you.

617
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,917
You might as well have sprung full-grown
out of the head of Zeus.

618
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,630
Who are your parents? Ozzie and Harriet?

619
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,552
Yeah, sometimes.

620
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,590
Do I get to meet them
and see how you came out so perfect?

621
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,079
I mean, it seems only fair.

622
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,155
I showed you mine, you show me yours.

623
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,750
I guess this is the end of the rest stop.

624
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,712
What did I say?

625
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,270
I thought it would be nicer down here.

626
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,520
You don't transmit too much information.

627
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,309
What?

628
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,558
I said,
you don't transmit too much information.

629
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,034
Sorry.

630
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,670
What are you doing over the summer?

631
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,830
I have a job pumping gas.

632
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,879
You finally got the Supreme Court
to hear your case, huh?

633
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,193
What about you?

634
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,754
I don't know.

635
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,071
You thought it'd be nicer over here?

636
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,149
Yeah.

637
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,399
What are you doing?

638
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,233
I'm looking for something
for my mom's birthday.

639
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,679
You mean,
in case somebody happened to leave...

640
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,512
a Cuisinart or a diamond ring
lying on the beach?

641
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,917
Yeah, that would qualify. It has to be
something either you make or find.

642
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,434
- When's her birthday?
- Next week.

643
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,913
That's beautiful.

644
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,592
It's for your mother.

645
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,593
You give it to her.

646
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,189
Okay.

647
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,553
It must be nicer over there.

648
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,790
Here, chop these.

649
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,158
No, no, no. Watch. Move.

650
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,392
You hold the knife...

651
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,550
and you just do that.

652
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,233
That's neat. Let me try.

653
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,632
No, no. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want
pieces of tiny little fingers in my stew.

654
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,994
Here. You stir.

655
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,118
Were you expecting someone?

656
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,349
Hi.

657
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,154
I'm Lorna.

658
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,952
Michael invited me.

659
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,992
Well, come in.

660
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,113
Your friend's here.

661
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,549
Hi.

662
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,158
- Hi.
- Can I help?

663
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,750
No. No, it's okay. Thank you.

664
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,673
You cut your finger.

665
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,749
Yeah.

666
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,992
Is this your girlfriend?

667
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,072
Hi, I'm Stephen.

668
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,793
That was delicious, babe.
You outdid yourself.

669
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,077
This pilgrim food for my very own WASP.

670
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,312
But you must forgive me, my darling.

671
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,789
I couldn't get myself
to make one of those Jell-O molds.

672
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,152
You're forgiven this time.

673
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,629
And now, for the pice de rsistance.

674
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,917
- Let me, Dad.
- You're under arrest.

675
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,430
Look at this.
You got it all over your bellybutton.

676
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,112
Look at that.

677
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,075
Oh, God. I'm old enough
to set the house on fire.

678
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,198
I'm sorry, I thought your mother's name
was Cynthia.

679
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,431
On birthdays, we're all Sam.

680
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,073
It's a little family tradition...

681
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,675
resulting from a particularly good LSD trip
I took in 1968.

682
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,314
More wine?

683
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,519
- Would you give me a break?
- In Europe, kids drink wine.

684
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,752
Get your mother her present
before I call Alcoholics Anonymous.

685
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,669
Thanks.

686
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,918
It's just what I wanted.

687
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,230
- Really?
- Absolutely.

688
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,118
What is that, a butterfly?

689
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,395
No, it's a whale of a present.

690
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,272
- Thanks.
- I'll play it for you sometime.

691
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,589
This is from Lorna.

692
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,712
That's beautiful.

693
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,192
Thank you, Lorna.

694
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,070
Mine, you get later.

695
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,675
You bet.

696
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,914
On your feet!

697
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,434
Let me help.

698
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,033
I like her.

699
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,155
Yeah?

700
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,470
- I like her, too.
- I know.

701
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,075
You sure this is the Phillips' kid?

702
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,788
They didn't switch you at the hospital,
or anything, did they?

703
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,672
You know,
I can't believe how incredible they are.

704
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,949
Do you know what my mother would do
if I gave her a shell for her birthday?

705
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,952
They're okay.

706
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,559
That's you all over,
afraid to commit yourself.

707
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,192
I thought it was just me.

708
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,998
I'm very happy with you.

709
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,670
I'm very happy with you, too.

710
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,551
It's okay, I want to.

711
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,069
- You weren't in cooking.
- You noticed.

712
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,471
- Where were you?
- I cut.

713
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,395
- Why?
- I didn't want to see you.

714
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,158
Manfield, could I talk to you for a minute?

715
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,520
You don't have to look so anxious.
If you've done something wrong...

716
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,512
I don't know about it. I just want
to talk to you about your college plans.

717
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,434
I was thinking of taking a year off, maybe
traveling to Europe, listening to music.

718
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,876
I can't tell you what to do, but I think you
ought to make an application, anyway.

719
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,837
You can always postpone entry.

720
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,195
I'd like you to consider applying
to Juilliard.

721
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,759
Early admission.

722
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,194
I looked at your academic records.
You should have no trouble getting in.

723
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,709
Where's the rest of it, by the way?

724
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,756
There's nothing in your file
from your old school.

725
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,470
It was lost when we moved.

726
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,193
When it comes through, I'd like to see it.

727
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,311
In the meantime, you look at that.

728
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,236
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

729
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,114
Thank you.

730
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,389
Get back to me when you've looked at it.

731
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,151
You wouldn't talk to me.

732
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,834
Now, get up.

733
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,589
Go down the stairs and out the back door.

734
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,513
Be quiet.

735
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,712
I'll be right behind you.

736
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,512
I'm barefoot.

737
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,795
Sit down.

738
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,879
What am I doing?

739
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,516
I just wanted to talk to you.

740
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,910
You wouldn't listen,
the other day at school.

741
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,231
I couldn't stay with you that night.
Not because I didn't want to.

742
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,870
If you want to go back, it's fine with me.

743
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,796
- You're a bully.
- No.

744
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,639
I'm a liar.

745
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,632
My name isn't Michael.

746
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,069
It's Danny.

747
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,115
My parents are Arthur and Annie Pope.

748
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,592
They're in trouble with the FBl
for blowing up a napalm lab in 1971.

749
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,477
There was a man who was almost killed.

750
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,391
A janitor,
who wasn't supposed to be there.

751
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,278
We put "Sam" on the birthday cakes,
on all the birthday cakes...

752
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,475
because we change our names
every time we move.

753
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,357
I've been doing this since I was two.

754
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,112
I don't know any other way.

755
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,991
I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry.

756
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,117
I wanted to explain
why I can't talk about a lot of things.

757
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,150
Like college. I can't go to college.
I can't leave them.

758
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,472
And I wanted to tell you...

759
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,238
why I couldn't be with you.

760
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,919
Not without your knowing.
I didn't want to lie to you.

761
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,395
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

762
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,199
It's dangerous for you,
and it's dangerous for them.

763
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,396
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

764
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,316
You can do what you want to. You can
tell your dad anything. I don't care.

765
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,032
I just needed you to know.

766
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,870
I don't know what I'm doing.

767
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,794
And I love you.

768
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,474
I love you.

769
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,433
What do I call you?

770
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,432
Michael. Nothing changes.

771
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,550
They really don't want you
to go to school, huh?

772
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,792
We haven't talked about it.

773
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,238
- I can't ask them.
- Why not?

774
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,360
It would mean breaking up the family,
not seeing them again.

775
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,637
They don't have anything else.

776
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,870
I can't believe that they'd want you to
give up your whole life to stay with them.

777
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,670
Talk to them. They'll understand.

778
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,190
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

779
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,598
Now you have another one.

780
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,993
Been to see Lorna?

781
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,073
I like that one.

782
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,112
She's full of beans.

783
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,472
You really like her, don't you?

784
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,910
The smart ones are always the best.

785
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,718
Are you sleeping with her?

786
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,351
- Yeah.
- Okay.

787
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,599
Go ahead, hit the sack.
You got school tomorrow.

788
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,270
How long have you been playing violin...

789
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,397
after you stopped playing seriously piano?

790
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,268
About five years.

791
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,078
When did you come to the States?

792
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,108
In 1980.

793
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,191
All right. Thank you very much.

794
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,638
Mr. Manfield. We're ready for you now.

795
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,275
Who did you say you studied with?

796
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,319
Edward Phillips.

797
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,709
- Where was this?
- Waterford.

798
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,430
- New Jersey?
- That's right.

799
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,830
We seem not to have
all your school records.

800
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,639
There was a school fire at my old school,
and the records were lost.

801
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,229
We only moved to New Jersey this year.

802
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,952
So you've only studied with Mr. Phillips
for a short time.

803
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,634
Yes, ma'am.

804
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,631
Who else have you worked with?

805
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,274
A lot of different people.
No one important.

806
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,591
We move a lot.

807
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,031
You'll have to supply us
with SAT scores and...

808
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,758
we'll have to have those records.

809
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,189
Mr. Manfield.

810
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,989
Oh, sorry.

811
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,230
You are very talented, you know.

812
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,193
Thank you, ma'am.

813
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,469
A cheese pizza for Mrs. Patterson.

814
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,434
I don't think Mrs. Patterson
ordered a pizza.

815
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,714
Is this Murray Hill 68434?

816
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,717
- Yes.
- Someone ordered it.

817
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,309
Just a minute.

818
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,196
What's this about a pizza?

819
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,518
You ordered one.

820
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,319
I didn't.

821
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,992
Will you have to pay for it?

822
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,549
No, I'll have to eat it.

823
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:11,432
I really don't care. Hold on.
Could you knock next time?

824
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,189
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, I have to go. Yeah. Bye.

825
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,915
I was wondering if Michael
had ever mentioned anything to you...

826
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,989
about his old school.

827
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,469
Not much. Why?

828
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,312
They never sent his records.

829
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,475
So?

830
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,552
I called the school.
They have no record of him.

831
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,677
They probably got eaten by a computer,
or something.

832
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,313
They don't have a computer
in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

833
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,397
What are you on his case for?

834
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,551
- We know nothing about him.
- So, he's an axe murderer.

835
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,713
I mean, come on! I thought he was
the best music student you ever had.

836
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,519
He is, but that doesn't explain
his missing records.

837
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,360
If you want to know who he is,
why don't you talk to him?

838
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,712
He's a person!

839
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,431
He's not a computer printout!

840
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,350
Would you please close the door?

841
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,229
- Mrs. Manfield?
- Yes.

842
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,112
- Thank you for coming.
- How do you do?

843
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,191
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

844
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,918
I want to talk to you about Michael.

845
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,432
I didn't want to meet at school,
because he doesn't know we're talking.

846
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,317
But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

847
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,550
I thought
maybe there was something at home.

848
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,909
No.

849
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,673
I know these things are private. I just
thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

850
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,798
But there isn't anything. Really.

851
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,236
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

852
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,789
Juilliard?

853
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,478
You know about his plans?

854
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,554
- Yeah, sure.
- And you don't object?

855
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,029
No.

856
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,355
They were very impressed
with his audition.

857
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,272
They're prepared to take him,
just as soon as they get his records.

858
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,435
He'll have to go then, won't he?

859
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,356
Is there a financial problem?

860
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,469
We're not the Rockefellers.

861
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,837
He could be worried about that.

862
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,478
We always manage.

863
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,200
There are scholarships. He could get one.

864
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,833
He's very talented.

865
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,197
We may not have a lot,
but we care about our kids.

866
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,713
I'm sure you do.

867
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,069
I was just wondering,
has he ever had a serious teacher?

868
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,911
How has he gotten this far?

869
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,479
I don't know.

870
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,996
He's picked up a little here and there.
We move around a lot. Why?

871
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,998
I called Blue Hill and they have no record
of Michael Manfield.

872
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,349
That's because he wasn't registered
there under Manfield.

873
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,875
See, I was married before,
and Paul adopted him.

874
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,758
But it took until just this year
to adopt his name legally.

875
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,400
He's under my old husband's name
at Blue Hill.

876
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,709
He can't finish his application
without those records.

877
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,074
I'll get them.

878
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,118
You'll have to, because they won't
release them to anyone but a parent-

879
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,509
I said, I'll get them. All right?

880
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,192
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

881
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,873
What's wrong, Mom?

882
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,795
Nothing.

883
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,353
I just love you.

884
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,471
I've got to pick up your father.

885
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,229
Do you like it? I traded the van in for it.
Thought it'd be more practical.

886
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,677
Besides, it keeps them guessing.

887
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,113
What's up, Sam?

888
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,992
Don't call me that.

889
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,029
Okay.

890
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,431
Danny's applied to college.

891
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:31,875
Where?

892
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,434
Juilliard.

893
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,595
How do you know?

894
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,069
Phillips. He wants him to go.

895
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,159
Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose
out of our business?

896
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,151
Because he thinks he's talented.

897
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,039
Has Danny told you about any of this?

898
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,309
No.

899
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,039
What are we going to do?

900
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,834
Shit.

901
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,119
Goddamn fucking shit!

902
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,114
Why can't he go?

903
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,231
Because we'll never see him again
if he does.

904
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,515
Why? We could arrange to meet him.

905
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:09,634
Is that what you want?

906
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:14,191
Ten minutes at an airport lounge, and the
FBl all over his ass the rest of the time?

907
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,750
You want him standing in phone booths
and Laundromats like my parents...

908
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,872
only connecting with us
through the network? I don't think so.

909
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,150
If he goes,
we're never going to see him again...

910
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,990
and that is unacceptable to me.

911
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,278
I never even let myself think about this.

912
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,790
I was so stupid.

913
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,510
All I wanted
was that we would be together.

914
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,633
We should have left Danny
with my mother.

915
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,230
- We never should have had Harry.
- Stop it.

916
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,359
I can't, Arthur.
Look what we're doing to these kids.

917
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,310
They've been running their whole lives
like criminals.

918
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,674
And they didn't do anything!

919
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,149
It isn't fair.

920
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,470
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

921
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,748
They've taken some bumps, but it's not
going to help anything to beat yourself up.

922
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,631
Look at them, for God's sake.

923
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,439
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

924
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,513
They're beautiful.

925
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,591
And bright. Caring.

926
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,597
How badly could we have done?

927
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,752
We should turn ourselves in.

928
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,068
So we can sit in prison
for the next 15 years...

929
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,355
and look at the kids through bars?

930
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,190
You can only get through this
one day, one hour at a time.

931
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,351
That's what I'm doing.

932
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,911
And Danny's all grown up.

933
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,799
We have to let him go.

934
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,071
This tooth is killing me.

935
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,197
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

936
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,073
I'll take a bus.

937
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,710
- I always worry when you go into the city.
- Why?

938
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,111
Because that's where they get everyone.

939
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,793
It's been quiet.

940
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,991
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

941
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,550
Remember what you used to say
when the kids were small?

942
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,950
"Don't worry
unless you don't hear anything. "

943
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,512
Be careful, all right?

944
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,433
I don't see anything.
And there's nothing on the x-ray.

945
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,112
I'm not complaining.

946
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,119
You need anything else?

947
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,555
No, thanks. We're okay.
I'm working for a GP.

948
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,793
How about cash?

949
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,955
Okay.

950
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,474
If you'd give me some notice,
I could arrange to have more.

951
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,280
No. This is great. Thanks.

952
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,758
- You always make me feel so guilty.
- Why?

953
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,479
You're living it.

954
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,560
Yeah, I guess I am.

955
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,155
Jonah, I need you
to make a phone call for me.

956
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,149
Of course.

957
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,309
Madame?

958
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,835
Hi, Dad.

959
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,590
I asked Jonah to set this up.

960
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,272
You can call the cops if you want to.

961
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,239
I'm sorry.

962
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,232
This is hard for me, too.

963
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,160
- Will madame have a drink?
- No, thank you.

964
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,798
I wonder if you'll ever know
what it's like...

965
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,474
not to see your child for 14 years.

966
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,439
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

967
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,754
Not knowing whether that child...

968
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,918
is responsible for the death
and mutilation of other human beings.

969
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,109
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

970
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,352
for that death and mutilation...

971
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,634
because it is your child who is pulling
the triggers, setting the bombs.

972
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,631
I didn't kill anybody.

973
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,715
I didn't come here to defend myself
or to talk politics.

974
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,391
If you don't believe by now that what I did
was an act of conscience to stop the war...

975
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,758
then there's nothing I can say to you
that's going to make you understand.

976
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,751
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

977
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,512
He wasn't supposed to be there.

978
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,239
Don't you think there have been times...

979
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,118
that I would have blinded
and paralyzed myself to take that back?

980
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,913
It's all Arthur's influence.

981
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,592
No, Dad, it isn't.

982
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,759
It was my idea.

983
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,709
I'm living with the consequences
of my own choice.

984
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,597
- I don't believe it.
- Well, that's your problem.

985
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,193
Your mother and me...

986
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,879
Do you think about us?

987
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,954
- Do you really have to ask that?
- Yes.

988
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,789
The last thing
I remember you saying to me...

989
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,469
was that I was an imperialist pig...

990
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,510
personally responsible for the war,
the spread of poverty, racism.

991
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,278
- I was young.
- Yes.

992
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,592
You were young.

993
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,314
And talented.

994
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,275
And beautiful.

995
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,312
And so full of love.

996
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,117
My God, Annie.
Why did you throw it all away?

997
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,197
Your mother misses you terribly.
And Danny.

998
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,312
Will you take him, Dad?

999
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,438
He wants to study music.

1000
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,713
He's good.

1001
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,838
They want him at Juilliard.

1002
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,711
Just like they wanted you.

1003
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,309
Do you still have that practice board?

1004
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,876
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

1005
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,232
So you taught him?

1006
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,558
There's some irony in this,
don't you think?

1007
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,599
Here you are...

1008
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,510
asking me to take Danny...

1009
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,359
into a life that you ran from
like a shot out of hell.

1010
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,518
Is this what he wants?

1011
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,033
I think so.

1012
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,278
He got himself an audition
without telling me.

1013
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,475
He'll need money,
and people to care for him.

1014
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,790
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

1015
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,672
I hardly know the boy.

1016
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,113
If we take him...

1017
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,389
there'd be FBl agents
following us everywhere we go.

1018
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:18,999
You'd never be able to see him.

1019
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,552
We're too old for this.

1020
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,989
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

1021
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,072
I have another son.

1022
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,990
He's 10. Harry.

1023
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,672
I heard about it on the news.

1024
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,192
I plan to turn myself in...

1025
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,955
when he doesn't need me anymore.
When he's old enough.

1026
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,954
And Arthur?

1027
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,953
I can't speak for him.

1028
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,552
Please think about this.

1029
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,513
I should go.

1030
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,429
Annie.

1031
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,358
He can come to us.

1032
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,319
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

1033
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,310
And I've thought about you both so often.

1034
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,551
I've called out to you.

1035
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,277
I'm sorry
that I've caused you so much pain.

1036
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,400
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

1037
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,749
I love you, Dad.

1038
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,392
I saw my father.

1039
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,435
You what?

1040
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,672
I saw Donald.

1041
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,638
You just walked into his office
and sat down at his desk?

1042
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,829
No.

1043
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,430
I had lunch with him at La Petite Marmite.

1044
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,669
What for?

1045
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,711
To see if he'd take Danny.

1046
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,112
Take Danny?

1047
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,477
So he can go to college.

1048
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,514
You're kidding.

1049
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,153
He said he would.

1050
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,552
He said he would?

1051
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,796
You know what could have happened?

1052
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,830
Did Phillips put you up to this?

1053
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,235
Nobody put me up to this.

1054
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,318
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

1055
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:29,428
He wants to go. He applied.
He went to an audition.

1056
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,273
- He went fucking where?
- Juilliard.

1057
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,352
I don't believe my ears.

1058
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,351
Just give him a chance.

1059
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,838
I'm going to call Deborah and see
if she can make him up some records.

1060
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,069
Why?

1061
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,720
Because Phillips called the school
I put on the registration form...

1062
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,836
and they told him
there was no Michael Manfield.

1063
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,871
It's going to be okay.

1064
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,469
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

1065
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,990
We're moving base camp, kids.

1066
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,872
We have a few days, and we're gone.

1067
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,793
Cover your tracks.

1068
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,514
You hear me?

1069
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,757
You have anything you want to tell me?

1070
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,269
No.

1071
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,429
Good.

1072
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,032
My father wants to move on.

1073
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,029
Why?

1074
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,758
He gets a sense.

1075
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,475
Just like that?

1076
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,633
Just like that.

1077
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,115
When?

1078
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,195
Anytime.

1079
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,992
You'll just disappear?

1080
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,873
What about us?

1081
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,155
- They need me.
- I need you!

1082
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,832
You didn't talk to them?

1083
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,756
You can't keep running from something
you had nothing to do with.

1084
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,150
You deserve your own chance.

1085
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,309
- I want to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

1086
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,753
Phillips knows too much.

1087
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,070
You were letting your feelings
affect your judgment.

1088
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,231
Besides, it's academic.

1089
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,519
Nobody will talk.

1090
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,115
You don't know that.

1091
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,880
They're going to try
to pick up everyone they can now.

1092
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,268
We're finished here.

1093
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,674
- We can close up shop slowly, can't we?
- We'll have to.

1094
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,480
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

1095
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,715
Everybody goes to work and school
until further notice.

1096
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,872
If there's a problem,
will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

1097
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,236
There's no reason
to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

1098
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,278
- Dad, can I talk to you a minute?
- Not now.

1099
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,471
I was thinking about staying.

1100
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,353
- Don't you have school?
- In half an hour.

1101
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,869
I want to stay.

1102
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,355
Stay?

1103
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,316
Do you think this is a good time
to discuss this?

1104
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,869
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

1105
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,559
I taught you!

1106
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,349
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

1107
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,110
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

1108
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,349
We're a unit!

1109
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,989
I taught you all of this,
don't you remember that?

1110
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,513
I don't want to hear you
talking about this...

1111
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,477
in front of your mother or your brother,
do you hear me?

1112
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,993
I said, do you hear me?

1113
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,957
Are we finished talking about this now?

1114
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,389
Mrs. Taylor.

1115
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,757
Just remove everything
and put on the gown.

1116
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,478
The doctor will see you in a few minutes.

1117
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,437
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

1118
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,150
Could you help me with this zipper, dear?

1119
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,994
Did you hear what happened
to Elizabeth Powell last night?

1120
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,109
No, I didn't.

1121
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,550
The FBl came to see her.

1122
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,510
The car that was used
in that bank robbery...

1123
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,559
where they killed those policemen...

1124
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,029
it was rented with her credit card.

1125
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,039
Can you believe it?

1126
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,354
How could they have got hold of her card?
She never even uses it herself.

1127
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,479
That's how come she didn't notice
it was gone.

1128
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,431
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

1129
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,670
They probably just took her name
out of the phone book...

1130
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,988
and made up a false card.

1131
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,158
Can you imagine the bad luck?

1132
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,317
Paul Manfield, please. His wife.

1133
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,999
We're in a hurry.

1134
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:12,749
Gus took plastic from one of my patients.
He used it to rent the car.

1135
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,113
Frankie? I'm going out for a smoke.

1136
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,517
- Are we in a hurry, Mom?
- Yeah. We have to get Danny.

1137
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,591
I hope your husband is all right.

1138
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,594
Okay, let's go.

1139
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,750
- Mom, I'll meet you there.
- We don't have much time.

1140
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,239
Salinger uses imagery
in Catcher in the Rye to-

1141
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,195
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1142
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,874
Mr. McGuire would like
to see Lorna Phillips.

1143
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,349
- Did he send a note?
- No, ma'am.

1144
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,189
Ms. Phillips?

1145
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,634
We're leaving.

1146
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,032
You didn't ask them?

1147
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,995
I did.

1148
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,313
Artie fell apart.

1149
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,392
He didn't even make any sense.

1150
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,197
Without us, he can't keep it going.

1151
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,072
He needs us to hold him up.

1152
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,391
All families break up.

1153
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,515
Why do you have to carry the burden
of someone else's life?

1154
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,953
He's my father.

1155
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,759
I love you.

1156
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,112
But I have to go.

1157
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,676
I don't know how to say goodbye.

1158
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,435
Well, don't.

1159
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,676
- Where is he?
- He'll be here.

1160
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,035
He went to say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1161
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,357
He knows better than this.

1162
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,159
This is Bob Stone, with a Z-90 newsbreak.

1163
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,319
New Jersey police have reported the death
of Liberation Army member Gus Winant...

1164
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,551
at large after the bank robbery
yesterday afternoon.

1165
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:22,870
He was shot resisting arrest
near Waterford...

1166
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,428
where he had stolen a car,
and was attempting to flee.

1167
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,275
More at 5:00.
We return you now to the ball game.

1168
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,311
Get the bike out of the back.

1169
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,037
Now get on it.

1170
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,594
What are you talking about, Dad-

1171
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:06,355
Get on the bike. You're on your own, kid.

1172
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,032
I want you to go to Juilliard.

1173
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,031
But, Dad, I want to go with you.

1174
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,152
We'll see you again. You can be sure.

1175
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,351
Your mother has arranged things
with your grandfather.

1176
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,714
Call him.

1177
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,071
And I think you have some friends
around here.

1178
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,513
I love you, baby.

1179
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,990
We all love you.

1180
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,349
Now, go out there and make a difference.

1181
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,312
Your mother and I tried.

1182
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,589
Don't let anyone tell you any different.

1183
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:03,596
Goodbye, Danny!

1184
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,909
English
