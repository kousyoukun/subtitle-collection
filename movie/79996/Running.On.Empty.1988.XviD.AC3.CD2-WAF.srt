1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,216
對不起。
Sorry.

2
00:00:03,116 --> 00:00:05,273
你夏天要幹什麼？
What are you doing over the summer?

3
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:09,609
我在加油站找了份工作
I have a job pumping gas.

4
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:12,787
你終於讓最高法院聽你的了，嗯？
You finally got the Supreme Court to hear your case, huh?

5
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:17,286
你呢？
What about you?

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:19,956
不知道。
I don't know.

7
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,457
你覺得在這更好？
You thought it'd be nicer over here?

8
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:27,666
嗯
Yeah.

9
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,353
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

10
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:44,435
找點什麼送我媽媽生日禮物
I'm looking for something for my mom's birthday.

11
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:48,028
你的意思是說，萬一有人偶爾在沙灘上丟了
You mean, in case somebody happened to leave...

12
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:49,938
一個Cuisinart（美國廚具品牌）的東西或者一個鑽石戒指？
a Cuisinart or a diamond ring lying on the beach?

13
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:53,489
是啊，那就行。必須得是你做的，或者是你找到的東西。
Yeah, that would qualify. It has to be omething either you make or find.

14
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:56,113
- 她生日是什麼時候？
- 下周。
- When's her birthday?
- Next week.

15
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,550
真美。
That's beautiful.

16
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:23,386
給你媽媽的。
It's for your mother.

17
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:27,558
你送給她。
You give it to her.

18
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:31,307
好
Okay.

19
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:36,899
在那一定更好。
It must be nicer over there.

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,317
過來，切這些。
Here, chop these.

21
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,212
不對，不對，不對。看。你到一邊去。
No, no, no. Watch. Move.

22
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,540
拿著刀……
You hold the knife...

23
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:58,791
就這麼做。
and you just do that.

24
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,545
很乾淨。我試試
That's neat. Let me try.

25
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:05,131
不，不。我是個素食者，我可不想你把你的小手指頭切到菜裡去。
No, no. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want pieces of tiny little fingers in my stew.

26
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,552
這。你來攪拌。
Here. You stir.

27
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,852
你在等誰嗎？
Were you expecting someone?

28
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,476
嗨。
Hi.

29
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,400
我是羅娜。
I'm Lorna.

30
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,317
麥克邀請了我。
Michael invited me.

31
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:29,487
好吧，進來吧
Well, come in.

32
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,912
你朋友在這
Your friend's here.

33
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:39,452
嗨
Hi.

34
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,257
- 嗨。
- 我可以幫忙麼？
- Hi.
- Can I help?

35
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:46,959
不用，不用，沒關係。謝謝。
No. No, it's okay. Thank you.

36
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,964
你切到手指了。
You cut your finger.

37
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,086
是啊
Yeah.

38
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,424
這是你女朋友？
Is this your girlfriend?

39
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,593
嗨，我是史蒂芬。
Hi, I'm Stephen.

40
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:00,558
真好吃，寶貝。完全超出你的水平
That was delicious, babe.You outdid yourself.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,982
為我自己的安格魯-撒克遜教徒準備的朝聖食物。
This pilgrim food for my very own WASP.

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,312
但是你得原諒我，親愛的
But you must forgive me, my darling.

43
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:08,894
我沒法做出這種果凍模具
I couldn't get myself to make one of those Jell-O molds.

44
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,401
這次就原諒你了
You're forgiven this time.

45
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:14,983
現在，（法語）
And now, for the pi鎗e de r閟istance.

46
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,412
- 我來，爸爸
- 你被逮捕了
- Let me, Dad.
- You're under arrest.

47
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,414
看看，你弄得肚臍那到處都是
Look at this.You got it all over your bellybutton.

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,168
看看
Look at that.

49
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:36,300
哦天哪。我老得都能把這房子弄著火。
Oh, God. I'm old enough to set the house on fire.

50
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:02,494
抱歉，我以為你媽媽叫辛西婭。
I'm sorry, I thought your mother's name was Cynthia.

51
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,822
過生日的時候我們都叫山姆
On birthdays, we're all Sam.

52
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,534
這是我們家小小的傳統……
It's a little family tradition...

53
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:10,289
是因為我1968年那次超棒的用迷幻劑的經歷
resulting from a particularly good LSD trip I took in 1968.

54
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,126
再來點酒？
More wine?

55
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:19,510
- 你能讓我歇會麼？
- 在歐洲，小孩子就能喝酒。
- Would you give me a break?
- In Europe, kids drink wine.

56
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:23,924
在我給「匿名酗酒者（美國一家幫助戒酒的機構）」打電話（指喝醉）之前，把給你媽媽的禮物拿來。
Get your mother her present before I call Alcoholics Anonymous.

57
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,263
謝謝
Thanks.

58
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:42,864
這就是我想要的
It's just what I wanted.

59
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,275
- 真的？
- 千真萬確
- Really?
- Absolutely.

60
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,414
那是什麼，蝴蝶？
What is that, a butterfly?

61
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,787
不是，是個鯨魚，當做禮物了
No, it's a whale of a present.

62
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,042
- 謝謝
- 我會彈奏它的
- Thanks.- I'll play it for you sometime.

63
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:06,500
這是羅娜的禮物
This is from Lorna.

64
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:16,012
真美
That's beautiful.

65
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,597
謝謝你，羅娜
Thank you, Lorna.

66
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:23,684
我的禮物，等會給你
Mine, you get later.

67
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,357
你保證
You bet.

68
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:27,692
沒問題
On your feet!

69
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,276
我來幫忙。
Let me help.

70
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:33,029
我喜歡她。
I like her.

71
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,199
嗯？
Yeah?

72
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,613
- 我也喜歡她。
- 我知道
- I like her, too.- I know.

73
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:34,586
你確定這是菲利普斯家的孩子？
You sure this is the Phillips' kid?

74
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,415
你在醫院沒被掉包吧，嗯？
They didn't switch you at the hospital,or anything, did they?

75
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,808
你知道，我不敢想像他們有多不可理喻。
You know, I can't believe how incredible they are.

76
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:44,310
你知道如果我給我媽媽一個貝殼當做生日禮物，她會怎麼做？
Do you know what my mother would do if I gave her a shell for her birthday?

77
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,397
沒關係吧
They're okay.

78
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:50,158
那就是你，害怕承認自己
That's you all over,afraid to commit yourself.

79
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,903
我以為這就是我
I thought it was just me.

80
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,957
和你在一起我很開心
I'm very happy with you.

81
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,828
我也是
I'm very happy with you, too.

82
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,174
沒關係，我想這樣
It's okay, I want to.

83
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,930
- 你沒去上廚藝課
- 你注意到了。
- You weren't in cooking.
- You noticed.

84
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:01,435
- 你去哪了？
- 我翹課了
- Where were you?- I cut.

85
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,527
- 為什麼？
- 我不想見你。
- Why?- I didn't want to see you.

86
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:31,344
曼菲爾德，我能和你說幾句話麼
Manfield, could I talk to you for a minute?

87
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:39,020
你沒必要這麼緊張。就算你做了錯事……
You don't have to look so anxious.If you've done something wrong...

88
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,140
我也不知道。我只是想知道你對大學的計劃。
I don't know about it. I just want to talk to you about your college plans.

89
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:46,229
我想休息一年，也許去歐洲旅行，聽聽音樂。
I was thinking of taking a year off, maybe traveling to Europe, listening to music.

90
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,818
我不能要求你做什麼，但是我覺得你應該申請大學
I can't tell you what to do, but I think you ought to make an application, anyway.

91
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:51,862
你可以推遲入學的
You can always postpone entry.

92
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,320
我想讓你考慮考慮申請朱利亞德（紐約一所藝術學院）
I'd like you to consider applying to Juilliard.

93
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,951
提前錄取
Early admission.

94
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,703
我看了你成績的檔案，被錄取應該沒問題
I looked at your academic records.You should have no trouble getting in.

95
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,283
不過，剩下的呢？
Where's the rest of it, by the way?

96
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,417
你的檔案裡沒有原先的學校的。
There's nothing in your file from your old school.

97
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,289
我們搬家的時候弄丟了。
It was lost when we moved.

98
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,127
找回來的時候，我想看看。
When it comes through, I'd like to see it.

99
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,378
同時，你看看這個。
In the meantime, you look at that.

100
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,598
我會樂意給你寫推薦信的。
I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation.

101
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,556
謝謝
Thank you.

102
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,057
看完之後還給我
Get back to me when you've looked at it.

103
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:39,578
你不和我說話
You wouldn't talk to me.

104
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,417
現在，起床
Now, get up.

105
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,289
下樓，從後門出去
Go down the stairs and out the back door.

106
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,296
悄悄的
Be quiet.

107
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,972
我就在你後面。
I'll be right behind you.

108
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,359
我光著腳呢
I'm barefoot.

109
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,018
坐下
Sit down.

110
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,532
我在幹嘛？
What am I doing?

111
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:04,409
我就是想和你說話。
I just wanted to talk to you.

112
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,991
你那天在學校不聽我講。
You wouldn't listen, the other day at school.

113
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:19,751
我那天晚上沒和你在一起，不是因為我不想。
I couldn't stay with you that night. Not because I didn't want to.

114
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:31,887
如果你想回去，對我來說沒什麼。
If you want to go back, it's fine with me.

115
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:35,979
- 你是個笨蛋。
- 不。
- You're a bully.- No.

116
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,028
我說了謊。
I'm a liar.

117
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:46,234
我真名不是麥克
My name isn't Michael.

118
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:49,818
是丹尼。
It's Danny.

119
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:55,079
我父母是阿瑟和安妮·波普
My parents are Arthur and Annie Pope.

120
00:14:57,504 --> 00:15:01,832
1971年他們因為讓汽油彈實驗室爆炸，和聯邦調查局惹上了麻煩
They're in trouble with the FBl for blowing up a napalm lab in 1971.

121
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,797
有一個人差點就死了
There was a man who was almost killed.

122
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,793
那是個看門人，當時不該在那的
A janitor,abcwho wasn't supposed to be there.

123
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:08,803
我們在所有生日蛋糕上都寫「山姆」
We put "Sam" on the birthday cakes, on all the birthday cakes...

124
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,136
是因為每到一個地方，我們就換新名字
because we change our names every time we move.

125
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:18,269
從我兩歲起，就一直這樣了
I've been doing this since I was two.

126
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,140
我不知道別的辦法。
I don't know any other way.

127
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:25,184
我只是想告訴你我很抱歉
I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry.

128
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,572
我想解釋我為什麼說不了太多事
I wanted to explain why I can't talk about a lot of things.

129
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:35,778
比如大學。我不能去上大學。我不能離開他們。
Like college. I can't go to college.I can't leave them.

130
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,325
我還想告訴你……
And I wanted to tell you...

131
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,209
我為什麼不能和你在一起。
why I couldn't be with you.

132
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:48,047
不能讓你不知道。我不想對你說謊。
Not without your knowing.I didn't want to lie to you.

133
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,757
現在我沒權利和你說這些的
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

134
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,680
對你，對他們，都很危險。
It's dangerous for you,and it's dangerous for them.

135
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:01,057
對不起，我只是控制不住自己
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

136
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,142
你想做什麼都可以做，你可以告訴你爸爸。我不介意
You can do what you want to. You can tell your dad anything. I don't care.

137
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:07,974
我只是想要你知道
I just needed you to know.

138
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,976
我不知道我在做什麼
I don't know what I'm doing.

139
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:16,067
我愛你
And I love you.

140
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:21,990
我愛你
I love you.

141
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,310
那我要叫你什麼？
What do I call you?

142
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:58,437
麥克。什麼都不用變
Michael. Nothing changes.

143
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:01,688
他們真的不想讓你上大學麼？
They really don't want you to go to school, huh?

144
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:06,110
我們還沒有談
We haven't talked about it.

145
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,661
- 我不能問他們
- 為什麼不？
- I can't ask them.- Why not?

146
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,958
那就意味著拆散整個家庭，我再也見不到他們。
It would mean breaking up the family,not seeing them again.

147
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:16,375
他們除了我們，什麼都沒有
They don't have anything else.

148
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:22,874
我不能相信他們會要求你耗費自己的生命去陪著他們
I can't believe that they'd want you to give up your whole life to stay with them.

149
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:25,793
和他們談。他們會理解的。
Talk to them. They'll understand.

150
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,590
你有很多秘密，不是麼
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

151
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,144
現在你又多了一個。
Now you have another one.

152
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,302
去和羅娜約會了？
Been to see Lorna?

153
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:30,855
我喜歡她。
I like that one.

154
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,980
她很活潑
She's full of beans.

155
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,526
你真心喜歡她，不是麼
You really like her, don't you?

156
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,110
聰明的人總是最好的
The smart ones are always the best.

157
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,080
你和她睡了麼？
Are you sleeping with her?

158
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,868
- 嗯。
- 好。
- Yeah.
- Okay.

159
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,298
快去，睡覺去。明天還要上學。
Go ahead, hit the sack.You got school tomorrow.

160
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,894
你在停止專業鋼琴之後
How long have you been playing violin...

161
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,155
演奏了多久小提琴？
after you stopped playing seriously piano?

162
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,105
大概五年
About five years.

163
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:11,992
什麼時候來美國的？
When did you come to the States?

164
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,109
1980年
In 1980.

165
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:16,280
好的，非常感謝
All right. Thank you very much.

166
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,874
曼菲爾德先生，我們準備好面試你了。
Mr. Manfield. We're ready for you now.

167
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:53,802
你說你和誰學的？
Who did you say you studied with?

168
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:56,976
愛德華·菲利普斯
Edward Phillips.

169
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,467
- 在哪？
- 沃特福德。
- Where was this?- Waterford.

170
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:02,305
- 新澤西？
- 對
- New Jersey?- That's right.

171
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,807
我們好像沒有你的學校檔案
We seem not to have all your school records.

172
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,863
我以前的學校有，但是丟了
There was a school fire at my old school, and the records were lost.

173
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,563
今年我們剛搬到新澤西
We only moved to New Jersey this year.

174
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:18,487
所以你和菲利普斯先生只學了很短時間
So you've only studied with Mr. Phillipsfor a short time.

175
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,241
是的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,323
你還和誰學過？
Who else have you worked with?

177
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:27,165
很多不同的，但沒有一個這麼重要
A lot of different people.No one important.

178
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,579
我們經常搬家
We move a lot.

179
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:33,166
你必須給我們你的SAT成績，還有……
You'll have to supply us with SAT scores and...

180
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,010
我們必須要那些檔案
we'll have to have those records.

181
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:41,672
曼菲爾德先生。
Mr. Manfield.

182
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,549
哦，對不起
Oh, sorry.

183
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:49,014
你很有才華，你知道
You are very talented, you know.

184
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:53,145
謝謝，太太
Thank you, ma'am.

185
00:24:59,838 --> 00:25:02,244
給帕特森太太的芝士比薩。
A cheese pizza for Mrs. Patterson.

186
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:05,336
帕特森太太沒訂比薩。
I don't think Mrs. Patterson ordered a pizza.

187
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:10,841
這是莫裡山68434號麼?
Is this Murray Hill 68434?

188
00:25:11,057 --> 00:25:12,929
- 是
- 那有人定了比薩。
- Yes.- Someone ordered it.

189
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,590
稍等。

190
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:28,025
這比薩是怎麼回事？

191
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,489
你訂了一個。
You ordered one.

192
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,409
我沒有。
I didn't.

193
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,239
那你得付錢麼？
Will you have to pay for it?

194
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,946
不，我得吃
No, I'll have to eat it.

195
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,422
我真的不在乎。等等。你下次不能敲門麼？
I really don't care. Hold on.Could you knock next time?

196
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,296
- 對不起。
- 聽著，我得走了。嗯。拜拜
- I'm sorry.- Listen, I have to go. Yeah. Bye.

197
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,265
我在想麥克有沒有和你提到……
I was wondering if Michael had ever mentioned anything to you...

198
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,386
他以前的學校
about his old school.

199
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,929
不多。怎麼問這個？
Not much. Why?

200
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,850
都沒把他的檔案寄來。
They never sent his records.

201
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,106
然後呢？
So?

202
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,271
我打電話給學校，說沒有他的檔案。
I called the school.They have no record of him.

203
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,529
有可能是電腦刪掉了，或者什麼的。
They probably got eaten by a computer,or something.

204
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,320
在肯塔基州的藍山，沒有電腦的
They don't have a computer in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

205
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,536
你研究他做什麼？
What are you on his case for?

206
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:28,866
- 我們對他一無所知。
- 嗯，他以前是個殺人犯
- We know nothing about him.- So, he's an axe murderer.

207
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:33,205
我說，拜託！我以為他是你教過的音樂最好的學生。
I mean, come on! I thought he was the best music student you ever had.

208
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:36,131
他是，但這解釋不了他檔案丟失的問題
He is, but that doesn't explain his missing records.

209
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:40,136
如果你想知道他究竟是誰，為什麼不直接找他談？
If you want to know who he is, why don't you talk to him?

210
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,588
他是個人！
He's a person!

211
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:46,465
他不是電腦裡的數據
He's not a computer printout!

212
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,765
能不能把門關上？
Would you please close the door?

213
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:05,022
- 曼菲爾德太太？
- 是
- Mrs. Manfield?- Yes.

214
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:06,986
- 謝謝你能來
- 您好
- Thank you for coming.- How do you do?

215
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,153
- 要不要來點咖啡？
- 不，謝謝
- Would you like some coffee?- No, thanks.

216
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:16,166
我想和您聊聊麥克
I want to talk to you about Michael.

217
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:19,830
我不想在學校見，這樣他就不知道我們談過
I didn't want to meet at school,because he doesn't know we're talking.

218
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,795
但是他最近很失落也很緊張
But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

219
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:24,123
我以為可能是家裡出了點事
I thought maybe there was something at home.

220
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:26,583
沒有
No.

221
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:31,550
我知道這是私人事情。我只是覺得如果我知道的話，我能幫得上忙。
I know these things are private. I just thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

222
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:33,765
但是真的什麼事都沒有。
But there isn't anything. Really.

223
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:37,349
也許他擔心朱利亞德。
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

224
00:27:38,982 --> 00:27:40,012
朱利亞德？
Juilliard?

225
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,815
您知道他的計劃？
You know about his plans?

226
00:27:43,403 --> 00:27:46,023
- 是啊，當然
- 您不反對？
- Yeah, sure.- And you don't object?

227
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,561
不反對
No.

228
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:51,028
他們對他的面試印象深刻
They were very impressed with his audition.

229
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:56,154
他們打算一拿到他的檔案就錄取他
They're prepared to take him, just as soon as they get his records.

230
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,537
那時候他就得去了，是不是？
He'll have to go then, won't he?

231
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:04,583
是不是經濟困難？
Is there a financial problem?

232
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,828
我們可不像洛克菲勒家族那麼有錢。
We're not the Rockefellers.

233
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:10,298
他可能會擔心錢的問題
He could be worried about that.

234
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,008
我們還過得下去。
We always manage.

235
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,847
有獎學金的。他可以拿
There are scholarships. He could get one.

236
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,549
他很有才華
He's very talented.

237
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:20,056
我們也許不富裕，但我們關心孩子
We may not have a lot, but we care about our kids.

238
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:21,637
我當然知道您關心
I'm sure you do.

239
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:26,178
我只是想知道他有過專業的老師麼？
I was just wondering,has he ever had a serious teacher?

240
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,141
他是怎樣達到這個水平的？
How has he gotten this far?

241
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,777
我不知道
I don't know.

242
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:34,443
他在這學一點，那學一點。我們經常搬家。為什麼問這個
He's picked up a little here and there.We move around a lot. Why?

243
00:28:34,574 --> 00:28:37,573
我給藍山打了電話，沒有麥克·曼菲爾德的檔案
I called Blue Hill and they have no record of Michael Manfield.

244
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:45,237
那是因為他在那註冊的時候沒有用曼菲爾德這個名字
That's because he wasn't registered there under Manfield.

245
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,870
你看，我以前結過婚，保羅收養了他
See, I was married before,and Paul adopted him.

246
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,877
但是直到今年才能合法地跟他的姓
But it took until just this year to adopt his name legally.

247
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:53,632
在藍山，他跟的是我前夫的姓
He's under my old husband's name at Blue Hill.

248
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:57,081
沒有這些檔案，他不能完成申請
He can't finish his application without those records.

249
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:58,505
我會拿到的
I'll get them.

250
00:28:58,763 --> 00:29:01,679
你必須得拿，因為他們只把檔案給家長……
You'll have to, because they won't release them to anyone but a parent-

251
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,170
我說了，我會拿到的。行了麼？
I said, I'll get them. All right?

252
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,010
- 現在，我得走了
- 好的，當然
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

253
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,089
怎麼了，媽媽？
What's wrong, Mom?

254
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:23,136
沒什麼
Nothing.

255
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:27,888
我愛你
I just love you.

256
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:47,821
我要去接你爸爸
I've got to pick up your father.

257
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:04,249
喜歡麼？我把貨車賣了，買了這個。我覺得這樣更實際一點。
Do you like it? I traded the van in for it.Thought it'd be more practical.

258
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,802
而且，這讓他們一直猜測
Besides, it keeps them guessing.

259
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:18,725
怎麼了，山姆？
What's up, Sam?

260
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:20,684
別那麼叫我
Don't call me that.

261
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,808
好吧
Okay.

262
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,483
丹尼去申請大學了
Danny's applied to college.

263
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:33,074
在哪？
Where?

264
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,699
朱利亞德
Juilliard.

265
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,952
你怎麼知道的？
How do you know?

266
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,531
菲利普斯。他想讓他去
Phillips. He wants him to go.

267
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,838
他為什麼不離咱們家的事遠點？
Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose out of our business?

268
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:46,915
因為他覺得他很有才華。
Because he thinks he's talented.

269
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:49,926
丹尼告訴你這些了麼？
Has Danny told you about any of this?

270
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:52,293
沒有。
No.

271
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,268
我們要怎麼做？
What are we going to do?

272
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,139
媽的
Shit.

273
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,564
去他媽的！
Goddamn fucking shit!

274
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,643
他為什麼不能去上大學？
Why can't he go?

275
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,851
因為如果他去了，我們就再也見不到他了。
Because we'll never see him again if he does.

276
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,232
為什麼不能？我們可以安排和他見面。
Why? We could arrange to meet him.

277
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,441
你想這樣？
Is that what you want?

278
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:17,192
在機場休息室見十分鐘，然後聯邦調查局一輩子跟在他屁股後面？
Ten minutes at an airport lounge, and the FBl all over his ass the rest of the time?

279
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,946
你想讓他像我父母一樣站在電話亭，洗衣房……
You want him standing in phone booths and Laundromats like my parents...

280
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,201
只能通過通信網絡和我們聯繫？我不想這樣。
only connecting with us through the network? I don't think so.

281
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,619
如果他去了，我們就再也見不到他了
If he goes,we're never going to see him again...

282
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:31,579
我不能接受。
and that is unacceptable to me.

283
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:44,391
我連想都不會想。
I never even let myself think about this.

284
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:48,053
我真傻。
I was so stupid.

285
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,973
我只想讓我們在一起
All I wanted was that we would be together.

286
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:59,357
我應該把丹尼扔給我媽媽的
We should have left Danny with my mother.

287
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:03,108
- 我們都不該有哈利
- 閉嘴。
- We never should have had Harry.- Stop it.

288
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:07,413
我不能這樣，阿瑟。看看我們對孩子都做了些什麼。
I can't, Arthur.Look what we're doing to these kids.

289
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,490
他們一輩子都像罪犯一樣在逃亡。
They've been running their whole lives like criminals.

290
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:11,912
他們什麼都沒做！
And they didn't do anything!

291
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:13,449
這不公平
It isn't fair.

292
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,869
我知道這他媽的不公平。
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

293
00:34:16,381 --> 00:34:20,329
他們經過了一些衝擊，但是你這樣逼自己於事無補
They've taken some bumps, but it's not going to help anything to beat yourself up.

294
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,378
看看他們，看在上帝的份上。
Look at them, for God's sake.

295
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:27,305
看看這些孩子。他們多麼優秀
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

296
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,469
他們很美
They're beautiful.

297
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,634
很聰明很體貼
And bright. Caring.

298
00:34:32,814 --> 00:34:34,770
我們能做得多壞呢？
How badly could we have done?

299
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,143
我們應該自首
We should turn ourselves in.

300
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:44,643
然後接下來15年都呆在監獄裡……
So we can sit in prison for the next 15 years...

301
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,027
從鐵窗裡看我們的孩子們？
and look at the kids through bars?

302
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:51,026
每次還只能看一個小時
You can only get through this one day, one hour at a time.

303
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,322
我就準備這麼做。
That's what I'm doing.

304
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,033
丹尼已經長大了。
And Danny's all grown up.

305
00:35:01,672 --> 00:35:03,129
我們該放他走了
We have to let him go.

306
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,883
這顆牙疼死我了
This tooth is killing me.

307
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:18,141
我覺得補的東西掉了。該去看看喬納。
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

308
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:21,139
我會坐公交車。
I'll take a bus.

309
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:23,889
- 你去市內的時候我總是擔心
- 為什麼？
- I always worry when you go into the city.- Why?

310
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:26,392
因為在那他們誰都能看見
Because that's where they get everyone.

311
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:28,146
很安靜。
It's been quiet.

312
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:31,480
有時候太安靜了
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

313
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:34,148
你還記得孩子小時候你常說的話麼？
Remember what you used to say when the kids were small?

314
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:36,651
「別著急，除非你什麼都聽不見了。」
"Don't worry unless you don't hear anything. "

315
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:39,322
小心點，好不好？
Be careful, all right?

316
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:52,793
我什麼都沒看見。X光片裡也什麼都沒有。
I don't see anything. And there's nothing on the x-ray.

317
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,543
我沒在抱怨。
I'm not complaining.

318
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:58,722
還需要什麼嗎？
You need anything else?

319
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:04,389
不，謝謝。我們很好。我在為一個全科醫生工作。
No, thanks. We're okay. I'm working for a GP.

320
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,722
現金可以嗎？
How about cash?

321
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:08,976
可以
Okay.

322
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:14,730
如果你提前告訴我，我可以安排更多的
If you'd give me some notice, I could arrange to have more.

323
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:17,656
不。很好了。謝謝
No. This is great. Thanks.

324
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:22,325
- 你總是讓我覺得這麼愧疚。
- 為什麼？
- You always make me feel so guilty. - Why?

325
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:24,120
這就是你的生活方式。
You're living it.

326
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:27,331
是啊，我猜我是。
Yeah, I guess I am.

327
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:33,164
喬納，我需要你幫我打個電話
Jonah, I need youabcto make a phone call for me.

328
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,244
當然可以
Of course.

329
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:44,795
夫人？
Madame?

330
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,492
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Dad.

331
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,493
我讓喬納做的這個
I asked Jonah to set this up.

332
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:26,460
如果你想，可以叫警察
You can call the cops if you want to.

333
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,851
對不起。
I'm sorry.

334
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,014
這對我也很難
This is hard for me, too.

335
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:46,153
- 夫人要點什麼飲料？
- 不，謝謝
- Will madame have a drink?- No, thank you.

336
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:56,202
我想知道14年不見你的孩子
I wonder if you'll ever know what it's like...

337
00:37:56,288 --> 00:37:58,991
是什麼感覺
not to see your child for 14 years.

338
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:05,210
連他是死是活都不知道
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

339
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:13,880
不知道這孩子是不是
Not knowing whether that child...

340
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:19,264
要對別人的死亡或者傷殘負責
is responsible for the death and mutilation of other human beings.

341
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:23,632
要不要讓你自己
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

342
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:25,971
為那死亡或傷殘負責任
for that death and mutilation...

343
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:30,437
因為扣動扳機，引爆炸彈的是你的孩子
because it is your child who is pulling the triggers, setting the bombs.

344
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,518
我沒殺任何人
I didn't kill anybody.

345
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:38,861
我不是來為自己辯護或是談政治的
I didn't come here to defend myself or to talk politics.

346
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:44,779
如果你不相信我當時那麼做是出於良心要結束戰爭
If you don't believe by now that what I did was an act of conscience to stop the war...

347
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:48,290
那我說什麼你都不會明白
then there's nothing I can say to you that's going to make you understand.

348
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,368
一個人失明，還殘疾了
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

349
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,204
他本不該在那的。
He wasn't supposed to be there.

350
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,175
你不覺得，有些時候
Don't you think there have been times...

351
00:38:58,261 --> 00:39:01,177
我寧願讓自己失明，讓自己殘疾，來挽回這一切麼？
that I would have blinded and paralyzed myself to take that back?

352
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,047
那都是阿瑟的影響。
It's all Arthur's influence.

353
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,798
不，爸爸，不是
No, Dad, it isn't.

354
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:07,058
是我的主意。
It was my idea.

355
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:10,133
我活在我自己的選擇帶來的後果中
I'm living with the consequences of my own choice.

356
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,102
- 我不信。
- 那是你的問題
- I don't believe it.- Well, that's your problem.

357
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,766
你媽媽和我……
Your mother and me...

358
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,567
你為我們考慮過麼？
Do you think about us?

359
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:26,027
- 你非得這麼問麼
- 對。
- Do you really have to ask that?- Yes.

360
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:34,196
上一次我記得你對我說
The last thing I remember you saying to me...

361
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:38,034
我是個帝國主義的蠢豬
was that I was an imperialist pig...

362
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:43,290
一個人為了戰爭，貧窮和種族主義承擔責任
personally responsible for the war, the spread of poverty, racism.

363
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:46,176
- 我還年輕
- 是
- I was young.- Yes.

364
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,715
你還年輕
You were young.

365
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,554
有才華
And talented.

366
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:57,641
美麗
And beautiful.

367
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,807
那麼充滿了愛
And so full of love.

368
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:06,860
上帝啊，安妮。你為什麼把它們都拋棄了？
My God, Annie.Why did you throw it all away?

369
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,326
你媽媽很想你。還有丹尼
Your mother misses you terribly. And Danny.

370
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,702
你會收留他麼，爸爸
Will you take him, Dad?

371
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,004
他想學音樂
He wants to study music.

372
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,376
他很好
He's good.

373
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,590
他們想讓他去朱利亞德
They want him at Juilliard.

374
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,629
就像他們當時想讓你一樣
Just like they wanted you.

375
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,466
你還有那個用來練習的板？
Do you still have that practice board?

376
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,228
一直到現在。丹尼就是在那上面學會彈琴。
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

377
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:49,726
你教他的？
So you taught him?

378
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:56,321
不覺得這有點諷刺麼？
There's some irony in this, don't you think?

379
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,492
你現在在這
Here you are...

380
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:02,528
求我把丹尼帶到
asking me to take Danny...

381
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,583
你曾經唯恐避之不及的人生裡
into a life that you ran from like a shot out of hell.

382
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:11,919
他真的想要麼？
Is this what he wants?

383
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,499
我覺得是
I think so.

384
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:16,882
他沒告訴我就自己去了面試
He got himself an audition without telling me.

385
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,342
他會需要錢和照顧他的人
He'll need money, and people to care for him.

386
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,799
你不覺得你要的太多了麼？
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

387
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:29,804
我幾乎不認識這男孩
I hardly know the boy.

388
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,392
如果我們收留了他
If we take him...

389
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:39,936
那我們去哪都會有聯邦調查局的人跟著
there'd be FBl agents following us everywhere we go.

390
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:42,656
你就再也見不到他
You'd never be able to see him.

391
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,360
我們太老了，不能這麼做了
We're too old for this.

392
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:52,030
嗯，我覺得我要的太多了
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

393
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:00,456
我還有一個兒子
I have another son.

394
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,499
他十歲。叫哈利。
He's 10. Harry.

395
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:07,337
我在新聞上聽說了
I heard about it on the news.

396
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,007
我打算
I plan to turn myself in...

397
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:14,931
在他再也不需要我的時候就去自首，在他足夠大的時候
when he doesn't need me anymore.When he's old enough.

398
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:17,016
阿瑟呢？
And Arthur?

399
00:42:17,524 --> 00:42:19,100
我不能為他說話
I can't speak for him.

400
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:24,936
請你考慮考慮
Please think about this.

401
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:34,280
我該走了
I should go.

402
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,363
安妮。
Annie.

403
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,502
他可以來我們家
He can come to us.

404
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:02,228
請您告訴媽媽，我愛她
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

405
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,389
我經常想你倆
And I've thought about you both so often.

406
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:09,768
我把你叫出來。
I've called out to you.

407
00:43:12,406 --> 00:43:15,738
對不起我給你們帶來這麼多痛苦
I'm sorry that I've caused you so much pain.

408
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,165
我猜我要知道這是什麼感覺了
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

409
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:29,784
我愛你，爸爸
I love you, Dad.

410
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:07,988
我去見了我父親
I saw my father.

411
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,161
你什麼？
You what?

412
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:13,493
我見了唐納德
I saw Donald.

413
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:18,670
你就那麼走進他辦公室坐在他桌邊？
You just walked into his office and sat down at his desk?

414
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:19,913
沒有
No.

415
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,667
我在「小鍋」和他吃了午飯
I had lunch with him at La Petite Marmite.

416
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:26,002
幹什麼？
What for?

417
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:29,173
想看看他要不要收留丹尼.
To see if he'd take Danny.

418
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,676
收留丹尼？
Take Danny?

419
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,143
這樣他就可以上大學了
So he can go to college.

420
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,308
你開玩笑吧
You're kidding.

421
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,060
他說他會的
He said he would.

422
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:42,560
他說他會？
He said he would?

423
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:45,943
你知不知道會發生什麼？
You know what could have happened?

424
00:44:47,992 --> 00:44:50,149
菲利普斯要你這麼做的？
Did Phillips put you up to this?

425
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:52,657
沒人要求我這麼做
Nobody put me up to this.

426
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:56,914
和菲利普斯無關。這是為了丹尼。
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

427
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:01,198
他想去。他申請了，去了面試。
He wants to go. He applied.He went to an audition.

428
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:04,165
- 他他媽的去哪了？
- 朱利亞德
- He went fucking where?- Juilliard.

429
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:08,418
我不相信我的耳朵。
I don't believe my ears.

430
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:10,502
就給他一次機會吧。
Just give him a chance.

431
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:14,138
我要給黛博拉打電話，看看她能不能假造些檔案
I'm going to call Deborah and see if she can make him up some records.

432
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:15,422
為什麼？
Why?

433
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:18,185
因為菲力普斯給我填在申請表上的學校打了電話Because Phillips called the school I put on the registration form...

434
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,391
然後他們告訴他沒有叫麥克·曼菲爾德的人
and they told him there was no Michael Manfield.

435
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,512
會沒事的。
It's going to be okay.

436
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:25,221
他可以及時做好檔案的。阿瑟！
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

437
00:45:28,737 --> 00:45:30,977
我們要搬了，孩子們
We're moving base camp, kids.

438
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:33,982
再呆幾天，我們就走。
We have a few days, and we're gone.

439
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:35,986
把蹤跡都銷毀掉。
Cover your tracks.

440
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:37,780
聽見沒？
You hear me?

441
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,161
你有想告訴我的事麼？
You have anything you want to tell me?

442
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:42,736
沒有。
No.

443
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,946
好。
Good.

444
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,385
我爸爸想要搬走。
My father wants to move on.

445
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,680
為什麼？
Why?

446
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:14,525
他有眼見。
He gets a sense.

447
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,400
就那樣？
Just like that?

448
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:20,651
就那樣。
Just like that.

449
00:46:24,163 --> 00:46:25,324
什麼時候？
When?

450
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:27,492
隨時。
Anytime.

451
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,408
你就那麼消失了？
You'll just disappear?

452
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,668
那我們怎麼辦？
What about us?

453
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:45,175
- 他們需要我。
- 我需要你！
- They need me.- I need you!

454
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,009
你沒和他們談？
You didn't talk to them?

455
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:56,227
你不能一直逃離你沒有責任的事
You can't keep running from something you had nothing to do with.

456
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:58,723
你應該有你自己的機會
You deserve your own chance.

457
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,570
- 我想和你談談
- 沒什麼可談的
- I want to talk to you.- There's nothing to talk about.

458
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,076
菲利普斯知道的太多了
Phillips knows too much.

459
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,492
你在讓你的情感影響你的判斷。
You were letting your feelings affect your judgment.

460
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,745
而且，這就是上學
Besides, it's academic.

461
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:35,599
沒人會說的
Nobody will talk.

462
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:37,263
你不知道。
You don't know that.

463
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:41,189
他們能抓的都會抓。
They're going to try to pick up everyone they can now.

464
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:44,721
我們在這的日子到頭了。
We're finished here.

465
00:47:53,034 --> 00:47:55,570
- 我們可以慢慢收手的，不是麼？
- 我們必須走了
- We can close up shop slowly, can't we?- We'll have to.

466
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:58,496
不然就會引起注意
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

467
00:47:59,414 --> 00:48:01,868
大家都去上班和上學，等接下來的通知
Everybody goes to work and school until further notice.

468
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:05,161
如果有問題我們就在80號公路附近的野餐區見面
If there's a problem,will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

469
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:08,667
還沒有理由覺得他們在追捕我們，所以冷靜
There's no reason to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

470
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:32,691
- 爸爸，我能和你說一會話麼？
- 現在不行。
- Dad, can I talk to you a minute?- Not now.

471
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:41,233
我想留下。
I was thinking about staying.

472
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:44,238
- 你不得去上課麼？
- 還有半個小時
- Don't you have school?- In half an hour.

473
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:02,501
我想留下。
I want to stay.

474
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:05,092
留下？
Stay?

475
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,221
你覺得現在是討論這個問題的時候麼
Do you think this is a good time to discuss this?

476
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,926
我們現在不能說。我們遇到麻煩了。
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

477
00:49:14,274 --> 00:49:15,731
我告訴你了！
I taught you!

478
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:18,640
我告訴你了！我們不能打破我們之間的聯繫
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

479
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:21,519
一個集體的能力是由它最弱的一環決定的
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

480
00:49:21,614 --> 00:49:22,811
我們是一個集體！
We're a unit!

481
00:49:25,158 --> 00:49:27,647
這些都是我教你的，不記得了麼？
I taught you all of this,don't you remember that?

482
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:31,322
我不想聽你
I don't want to hear you talking about this...

483
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:33,370
在你媽媽或者你弟弟面前說這些，聽見沒有？
in front of your mother or your brother, do you hear me?

484
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:34,951
我說，聽見沒有？
I said, do you hear me?

485
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,083
這回說完了沒？
Are we finished talking about this now?

486
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:47,874
泰勒女士
Mrs. Taylor.

487
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,386
把所有東西都拿出來，穿上袍子就行
Just remove everything and put on the gown.

488
00:49:51,474 --> 00:49:53,180
幾分鐘內就可以見醫生了
The doctor will see you in a few minutes.

489
00:49:55,102 --> 00:49:58,350
好的。我馬上就回來給你稱體重
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

490
00:49:59,023 --> 00:50:01,180
能幫我拉拉鏈麼，親愛的？
Could you help me with this zipper, dear?

491
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,230
你知道昨晚伊利莎白·鮑威爾怎麼了麼？
Did you hear what happened to Elizabeth Powell last night?

492
00:50:06,363 --> 00:50:07,393
不知道
No, I didn't.

493
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:09,938
聯邦調查局找她了

494
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:13,023
搶銀行，還殺死了警察的那次
The car that was used in that bank robbery...

495
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,160
他們用的車
where they killed those policemen...

496
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,734
是用她的信用卡租的
it was rented with her credit card.

497
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:19,830
你相信麼？
Can you believe it?

498
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:24,329
他們怎麼能拿到她的卡？她自己都從來不用。
How could they have got hold of her card? She never even uses it herself.

499
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:28,630
這就是為什麼她沒注意到卡不見了
That's how come she didn't notice it was gone.

500
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:31,708
那些人是一幫惡棍，泰勒女士
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

501
00:50:31,802 --> 00:50:34,042
他們很有可能就是從通訊錄裡查出她的電話
They probably just took her name out of the phone book...

502
00:50:34,137 --> 00:50:35,416
然後假造了一張卡。
and made up a false card.

503
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:37,679
能想像這多背運麼？
Can you imagine the bad luck?

504
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:50,356
請找保羅·曼菲爾德先生。我是他妻子。

- Mom, I'll meet you there.- We don't have much time.

512
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:03,258

- Did he send a note?- No, ma'am.

我們要走了。
We're leaving.

518

你沒和他們談？
You didn't ask them?

519
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,366
我談了。
I did.

520
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,783
阿瑟崩潰了。
Artie fell apart.

521
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:40,951
他根本不講理。

沒有我們他活不下去。

他需要我們支撐著他。

524
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,375
所有家庭都會拆散的。

525
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:56,718
為什麼要把別人的人生當做自己的負擔？
Why do you have to carry the burden of someone else's life?

526
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:00,302
他是我父親

- 他在哪？
- 他會來這。

他去和她女朋友道別了
He went to say goodbye to his girlfriend.

533
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,109
他比這知道得多
