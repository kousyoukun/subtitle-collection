1
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,513
Ah, shit.

2
00:01:58,223 --> 00:01:59,307
Hang in there, man.

3
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:09,859
Lighten up, McNally.
Come on, it's only a game.

4
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,623
Hey, man, believe it or not,
you made the starting line-up.

5
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:24,874
No shit?

6
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:26,542
Yeah, Andrews has the chicken pox.

7
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:29,128
You're good for two games, at least.

8
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:30,546
Well, that's great.

9
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:33,174
If you don't like it, why do you do it?

10
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:36,928
Baseball's my life.

11
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:44,387
Jomo. Jomo! Come here.

12
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:46,681
Come here.

13
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:47,849
Now, listen, Jomo.

14
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:50,310
I want you to take this to Harry, all right?

15
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,271
Take it to Harry! Come on!
Take it to Harry! Take it to Harry!

16
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:54,397
Go on! Take it to Harry!

17
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:55,899
Take it to Harry!

18
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,860
Go on! Go on, Jomo!

19
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,715
Jomo! Jomo!

20
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,384
Come on! Come on!

21
00:05:26,262 --> 00:05:27,388
Get down! Get down!

22
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,274
All right, come on.

23
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,744
- I still think you should go.
- No, I can't get off from work.

24
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:53,080
But you're the only one that knows all
those statistics. I can't remember nothing.

25
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,291
My brain's a sieve.
How do you learn it all that stuff?

26
00:05:55,374 --> 00:05:57,793
It's in the government reports.
It's in the library.

27
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,462
You think they'll really listen to us?

28
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:02,923
Well, if they don't, there's going to be
1,500 barrels of radioactive waste...

29
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,049
buried just a few miles from here...

30
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,260
and you might have grandchildren
with three heads.

31
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,554
Now, look, I'm going to rehearse you.

32
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,931
And there's a delegation
from Point Arena going, too.

33
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,766
Jerry Baker. He's very good on his feet.

34
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,435
And Joe will be there.

35
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,979
Look, I got to go. I'll miss my ride. Okay?

36
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,899
Martha, remember the study group's
at my place on Thursday.

37
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,026
Okay!

38
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,694
How did it go?

39
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,571
They wanted me to go to Tallahassee
and lobby.

40
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,197
I talked them into sending Joe and Paula.

41
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:28,407
Joe and Paula?

42
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,242
It's okay. They'll be all right.

43
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:34,079
The nerve those assholes have,
putting that shit near human beings.

44
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,498
Let's blow this pop stand. I'm starving.

45
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,706
We got shoes, two cars, four feds.

46
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:18,349
Mom, there's Jomo.

47
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,560
You two,
get out of your jeans and into bed.

48
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:22,687
What's gonna happen to her?

49
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,773
- Someone will take her home.
- We never had to leave her before.

50
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:26,858
Sorry, kid.

51
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,193
- He got to keep that.
- I thought I told you to get in to bed.

52
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,862
- It's morning.
- Get into bed!

53
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,408
I'm going to wash my hair.

54
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,877
Who's this?

55
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:48,796
Mom and Dad. Who do you think?

56
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,464
You're kidding.

57
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,552
"Arthur and Annie Pope
continue to elude capture...

58
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,888
"despite sightings of the couple,
who went underground...

59
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:02,143
"after claiming responsibility
for the 1971 bombing...

60
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,563
"of the University of Massachusetts
military research lab. "

61
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,899
What does "elude" mean?

62
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,484
Not getting caught.

63
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,864
"The laboratory is credited
with the development of napalm...

64
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:18,492
"used extensively in the Vietnam War. "

65
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:20,619
Why did they have to blow it up?

66
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,539
They didn't stop making it
when they asked them politely.

67
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,583
Come on, Danny, I'm serious!

68
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,086
They were dropping that stuff on people.

69
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,926
"Annie Pope is the former
Anne Patterson...

70
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,681
"daughter of Donald Patterson,
president of American Telekinetics. "

71
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,559
Is this Grandpa?

72
00:09:49,606 --> 00:09:51,859
- It must be.
- And Grandma?

73
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,153
Yeah.

74
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,155
Do you remember them?

75
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,410
- No.
- Not even a little?

76
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,831
They look kind of uptight.

77
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,962
- Industrial waste all around.
- Rad!

78
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,215
Get them while they're hot.
Get them before they rot.

79
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,053
- Where's your mother?
- She's in the shower.

80
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,685
I talked this morning with some of the
people who knew the Pope family best.

81
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,854
John Kungle played ball
with the young man...

82
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:31,857
who was known here in Florida City
as Richard McNally.

83
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:34,985
He was a good student, and a good friend?

84
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,528
He was a cool dude.

85
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,364
That's how legends are made.

86
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,449
What's his IQ? 49?

87
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,411
- He's going to UCLA.
- No kidding?

88
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,706
No, I'm not kidding.
I said, he's going to UCLA.

89
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:49,124
Excuse me.

90
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:51,710
These photos of the couple
are 20 years old...

91
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,753
and are not considered too reliable.

92
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,383
The couple is still wanted for the
1971 bombing of their university lab...

93
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,301
in which a janitor was blinded.

94
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:04,305
FBl officials in Miami said that despite
the presence of their two children...

95
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,892
the Popes should be considered
as possibly armed and dangerous.

96
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,853
In further local news...

97
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,897
There's food for you.

98
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:14,440
You look pretty, Mom.

99
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:16,192
Get into bed, Kimosabe.

100
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,453
Okay, let's see.

101
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,791
Blue eyes, blond hair. You're okay.

102
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:36,170
Or are you?

103
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,089
What's the matter, kid?

104
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,635
I don't know.

105
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,848
I just feel kind of lousy, you know?

106
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,975
You're supposed to feel that way at 17.

107
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,184
Really?

108
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,980
It's terrific not recognizing yourself
when you look in the mirror.

109
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,816
It's wonderful having a new name
every six months.

110
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,153
We were there a long time.
It's hard to leave.

111
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,699
We may have to cut your hair, too.

112
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,622
Maybe this time I could shave my head.

113
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,086
- Send your brother in.
- Yeah.

114
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,507
I hate this.

115
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,598
The Phillies won again last night.

116
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,434
Things are looking good, then.

117
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,478
Things are looking great.

118
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,858
The MacArthur feud with Truman.

119
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,444
I don't think we covered that
in the local paper.

120
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,697
Maybe you better try The Washingtonian.

121
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,158
No, I'm interested in how it affected
the heartland of the nation...

122
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,493
the small communities.

123
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:53,747
- This is social history.
- I could show you The Eagle.

124
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:57,251
We just put our back issues on microfilm.

125
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:03,298
- This is it?
- Take it right over there.

126
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,383
Thank you.

127
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,211
St. Martin's Hospital, Medical Records.

128
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:45,674
- Three dollars?
- Yes.

129
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,635
Where do you want it mailed,
Mr. Mansfield?

130
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,886
Manfield.

131
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:51,763
No, I'll pick it up.

132
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,766
I need to get a passport.
The company's sending me to Cairo.

133
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,434
- Are you in oil?
- Military.

134
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,606
You're listening to your favorite
oldies station in Norfolk, Virginia...

135
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:13,076
Ralph, the cat needs to be fed.

136
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:31,862
Need anything else?

137
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:35,282
- No. I'll call the booth again in two weeks.
- Okay.

138
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,160
Listen, your mother...

139
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,122
She died four weeks ago. Cancer.

140
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,708
Your father was with her.

141
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,794
You were just too hot to contact.

142
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,881
He said to tell you not to worry about him.
He's okay.

143
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,716
Sorry.

144
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,351
Okay, who wants lunch?

145
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,602
Me.

146
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,189
How's tuna?

147
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,941
Yecch.

148
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:55,737
There's a kid in my class who traded me
Duke Snider for Valenzuela.

149
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:57,447
Yeah, so?

150
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,741
So, he's a jerk.

151
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,869
Snider's worth about $20.

152
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:05,580
He's from the Brooklyn Dodgers.

153
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:07,665
He's old.

154
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:12,670
This card is an antique.

155
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,678
- Can I have white bread?
- Just eat it.

156
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:22,764
Hey, kid.

157
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,933
You. What's your name?

158
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,351
Michael.

159
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:30,188
- Why are you asking him that?
- He's not used to it yet.

160
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,650
He better get used to it fast.

161
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,653
What's my name?

162
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,448
- Paul.
- Paul what?

163
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:42,950
- Paul Manfield.
- Spell it.

164
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:47,413
M- A-N...

165
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:53,211
F- I-E-L-D.

166
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,754
- What's your mother's name?
- Just stop it.

167
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm waiting.

168
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:57,507
Cynthia.

169
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,758
And your brother?

170
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,676
Stephen, all right?

171
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,350
What the hell's your problem?

172
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,268
I got some clothes in the city.

173
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:13,856
You can wear the thrift shop ones.
The new ones...

174
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:16,025
have to be washed first.

175
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,110
Yes, sir!

176
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,959
Sorry about this afternoon.

177
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,473
Sophie's dead.

178
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:52,186
What?

179
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,814
A month ago. The big "C."

180
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,112
Oh, babe.

181
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:08,118
I talked to her after the feds came,
to tell her we were okay.

182
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:11,705
She never let on.

183
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,002
I can just see her
standing there with Morris.

184
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:19,796
Two fat old Jews, ex-Bolsheviks...

185
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:23,800
talking to their red-diaper baby
on a phone from a Laundromat...

186
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,969
and she's fucking dying.

187
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,517
That lady loved me.

188
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:37,522
Last winter, when they arranged
for her to meet me in Chicago...

189
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:40,525
she flew there on an hour's notice...

190
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,278
alone, in a blizzard.

191
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,780
She's terrified of flying.

192
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,450
She was green when she got off the plane.

193
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,453
I took her over to the lounge to talk...

194
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,957
and we sat in a corner and I said,
"I wish it was easier. "

195
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,295
"You wish it were easier," she says.

196
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,965
She's correcting my grammar...

197
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,801
like I'm one of the kids she teaches.

198
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,601
There's nothing left to go back to now.

199
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,813
There's only us and the boys.

200
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:20,815
We're all that's left.

201
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,526
We must...

202
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,821
We have to hang on to each other.

203
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:33,536
May I see his records?

204
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,705
I'm afraid I lost his records.

205
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,832
They gave them to me,
and I know I packed them...

206
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:39,417
but I just can't find them.

207
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,337
I'm always losing things, right?

208
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:45,465
My husband says I'd probably lose
my head if it weren't screwed on.

209
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:47,800
But I can write for a copy.

210
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,886
Make sure to write for those records,
okay?

211
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,180
You can have two electives.

212
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,391
Music, typing, mechanics, computer
programming, or home economics?

213
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:56,684
Music.

214
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,812
- And?
- And?

215
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,318
- Home economics.
- His dad's a cook.

216
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:25,629
Find an empty seat, Mr. Manfield.

217
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,632
All right, listen up, everyone.

218
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:12,134
Listen again, please.

219
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:55,177
Now, can anyone tell me the difference
between these two pieces?

220
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:57,053
Yes?

221
00:22:57,137 --> 00:23:00,807
One is pop and the other is classical.

222
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,853
At least we know you're not deaf.

223
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:07,814
How about you, Mr. Spaulding?

224
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,692
Could you give us a deeper distinction?

225
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,945
The first one's bad...

226
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,823
and the second one's good.

227
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:20,160
That's a matter of opinion, not a fact.

228
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:23,413
I'm sure there are several people in this
room who would disagree with you.

229
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,542
How about you, Mr. Manfield?

230
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,669
Would you care to venture a guess?

231
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,344
You can't dance to Beethoven.

232
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,103
That's very good, Manfield.
Do you listen to much Beethoven?

233
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:49,564
No, not really.

234
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,649
How did you identify this piece?

235
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:54,819
I guess I've heard some.

236
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:59,115
I'm sure the rest of the class
can identify the other composer.

237
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,327
You're quite correct.
You can't dance to Mr. Beethoven.

238
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:05,788
Can you tell me why, Mr. Manfield?

239
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,750
Because the Beethoven piece...

240
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:14,088
doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo!

241
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:21,053
Madonna is 4/4 time all the way through.

242
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:24,473
The melody changes,
but the rhythm is constant.

243
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,350
So you can dance to it.

244
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:30,896
The quartet changes
both melodically and rhythmically.

245
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,649
I'm going to play them again.
Listen for this.

246
00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:42,658
Mr. Manfield.

247
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:51,542
We'll have to find an instrument for you.

248
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,751
An instrument?

249
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:56,922
Everybody who takes music
is required to play in the orchestra.

250
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,884
Do you play something?

251
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,136
Piano.

252
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:04,430
Play something.

253
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:36,479
Well, there's one thing you don't have
to do, and that's play in the orchestra.

254
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,024
I'd like to hear how you sound
on the Steinway I have at home.

255
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:43,778
Get out of here.

256
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,501
- Get a job, Dad?
- You betcha I did. Right in town.

257
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:01,421
- I'm a cook. Guess which kind?
- Italian?

258
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,714
- You got it.
- Radical!

259
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,716
Do you have to say that?

260
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:10,972
- Where'd you get this?
- Public library lost and found.

261
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,682
It's right around the corner
from the restaurant.

262
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,102
April can be cold up here.
I thought you might need these.

263
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,771
Keep those slugger hands from cracking.

264
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:20,523
- Did you make the team?
- Yeah.

265
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:22,775
- Great.
- What about me?

266
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,487
Sorry, kid. Nothing in your size. Have to
try a movie theater on the weekend.

267
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,073
Which reminds me, we have to chop
some firewood on Saturday.

268
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:31,117
Oh, Dad, I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm not going to school.

269
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:33,327
- How come?
- They're taking class pictures.

270
00:27:33,494 --> 00:27:34,495
Right.

271
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,290
- How is that school?
- Not bad.

272
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:42,378
- Teachers know anything you don't?
- Yeah, they're okay.

273
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,213
Did you have any trouble
with the registration?

274
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,423
I had to see the guidance counselor
at the end of the day.

275
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,675
And?

276
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,803
He wanted to know
what colleges I was applying to.

277
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,013
What did you tell him?

278
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,099
Well, I said I hadn't decided yet.

279
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:57,977
Good. Just tell them something,
and forget about it.

280
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:00,104
Otherwise they'll keep bugging you.

281
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:03,524
- How about you, small stuff?
- I don't want peppers.

282
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:13,117
Bless you.

283
00:28:16,537 --> 00:28:19,331
There's a kid in my class
who's really crazy.

284
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,417
You're not exactly the poster child
for mental health.

285
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:25,087
He knows train schedules.

286
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,005
You never know.
It might have come in handy.

287
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,675
Really, Dad. All over the country.

288
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:33,470
He knows what time trains leave
from Omaha to Atlanta, Georgia.

289
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:34,638
Stuff like that.

290
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:37,266
Get to know this kid.
What are you doing with that safety pin?

291
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:38,850
What safety pin?

292
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,357
- I got a job.
- Really?

293
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,317
Tell us, my dear.

294
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:50,445
How are you going to contribute
to this false, capitalist economy?

295
00:28:51,238 --> 00:28:54,741
I'm going to be a receptionist
for a Dr. Milton Cosswell.

296
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:55,867
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

297
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:57,994
There was a sign up at the post office.

298
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,996
He doesn't mind paying me in cash.

299
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,332
He didn't even ask why.

300
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:05,252
It's probably good for his taxes,
or something.

301
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,547
Anyway, it means I can pick up supplies,
if we need them.

302
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:12,008
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

303
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,265
Mom, thanks.

304
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:23,019
Sounds good.
Looks like we all got what we wanted.

305
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,567
Hello, is anyone home?

306
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:07,456
Hello?

307
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:08,910
Who are you?

308
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,912
I live here. Who are you?

309
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,832
- Is Mr. Phillips your father?
- Yes.

310
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,043
And is this you in the pink-

311
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:18,377
I've destroyed the negative.

312
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:21,255
So now we've determined
that I belong here. Let's talk about you.

313
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:25,176
Your father said I could use the piano.
And the door was open.

314
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:27,762
- We do have a bell.
- I rang the bell.

315
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:30,681
No one answered, so I came in. I'm sorry.

316
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,558
You go to the school?

317
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,893
Yeah.

318
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:37,229
- I haven't seen you there.
- That's because I just started.

319
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:38,940
So how come you're not there?

320
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,693
I had a fever last night.
My mom made me stay home.

321
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:46,322
- Why didn't you?
- I felt better today. And I was bored.

322
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:49,450
You're strange. I cut.

323
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:52,578
I didn't feel like having my picture taken
with those subhumans.

324
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,663
You're very good, you know.

325
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,457
I'm okay.

326
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,667
What's your name?

327
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,212
- Michael.
- I'm Lorna.

328
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:03,214
I'd better be going.

329
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:05,508
- Where are you from?
- Oakland.

330
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:08,385
- You born in California?
- No, New York.

331
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:09,762
Really?

332
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:13,182
I want to go to school in New York,
but my mother's afraid I'll get mugged.

333
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:15,726
Your family move around a lot?

334
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:17,311
No, not really. You play?

335
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:20,356
God, no. I couldn't stand to practice.

336
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:22,900
My older brother is the virtuoso.

337
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,737
He's at Yale. He does everything right.
Where are you going?

338
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:34,161
Oh, that.
I haven't thought about that much.

339
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:38,248
You haven't though about it much? You're
going to have to apply next semester.

340
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,460
Yeah?

341
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:43,962
What do you mean, "Yeah?"

342
00:34:46,423 --> 00:34:49,801
Look, I really... I gotta go.

343
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,930
You're certifiable.

344
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,931
You're welcome.

345
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:04,316
Mr. Manfield, I'd like a word with you.

346
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:10,614
I understand you had occasion
to visit my house yesterday.

347
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:13,200
I went to look at your piano.

348
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:15,577
I understand you did more than look at it.

349
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,830
- Do you have a piano at home?
- No, sir.

350
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,374
How do you practice?

351
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,418
I can't much.

352
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,963
You're a talented musician, Manfield...

353
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,424
but that doesn't give you the right
to act like a criminal.

354
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:30,842
Is that clear?

355
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:33,428
Yes, sir.

356
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,059
Manfield?

357
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:43,021
We'll find you a piano.

358
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,489
Now let me see, girls.

359
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:59,454
Thank you. Just go to the back of the line.

360
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:04,292
You are certifiable.

361
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:08,087
What is this? Some sort of smart-ass joke?
You're taking cooking?

362
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,505
I want to learn how to cook.

363
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:13,468
Yeah, right. You have a burning desire
to learn how to make Apple Brown Betty.

364
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,721
What are you doing here,
if you think so highly of it?

365
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,765
They wouldn't let me take
auto mechanics...

366
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:21,309
and I didn't have time to take the issue
to the Supreme Court.

367
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:24,937
Now that leaves Phillips and Manfield.

368
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,732
Please, would you take the last booth?

369
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,986
Today's menu...

370
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:35,448
is tuna-walnut casserole.

371
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,783
This may be auto mechanics after all.

372
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:40,995
Take your four-cup measuring bowl.

373
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:43,789
You know, my father thinks
you're the best thing since sliced bread.

374
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:45,791
That's not what he told me.

375
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,668
A can of tuna.

376
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,879
Listen, don't worry.
Don't let him scare you.

377
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:52,089
You can do anything
if he thinks you can play music.

378
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:54,925
Half a cup of walnuts.

379
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:58,137
We're having
a chamber music concert Saturday.

380
00:36:58,304 --> 00:37:00,639
And they're boring as hell,
you have to dress for a funeral...

381
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:02,224
but you'd probably like it.
You want to come?

382
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:04,310
Two stalks of celery.

383
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:08,147
- Yeah, I've got to think about it. Celery.
- Celery.

384
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:09,565
Here.

385
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:14,403
He's getting seduced
by all this bourgeois crap.

386
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:17,489
- Fucking chamber music.
- It's music, for God's sake.

387
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,576
Decadent, white-skinned, privileged crap.

388
00:37:21,076 --> 00:37:24,413
Lot of people sitting around in ties
and pantyhose in wing chairs...

389
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:26,498
- like at your mother's house.
- Like at my mother's house.

390
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:27,916
He's not going.

391
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:30,419
- Says who?
- Says me!

392
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:33,839
- I don't believe you.
- Read my lips: He's not going.

393
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:36,341
Since when did you become
the minister of culture?

394
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,343
You'd let him go
if it was a rock 'n' roll concert.

395
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:40,596
- That's right! You bet I would. Yes.
- Unbelievable.

396
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,681
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:46,643
I'm not letting him go
because it's not safe.

398
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,315
He doesn't have to be on display
for the entire community of Waterford.

399
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,943
And because it's not rock and roll.

400
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:59,114
You think you're cute, Dad,
but you're full of shit.

401
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,784
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Why?

402
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:05,287
Aren't we supposed to question authority?
You taught me that!

403
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:07,456
Who do you think you are?
General Patton?

404
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:10,834
Why is it any more dangerous for me to go
to school than it is to go to the concert?

405
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:14,504
Because there are 600 other kids
at the school.

406
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,341
Give me a break.

407
00:38:18,884 --> 00:38:20,343
You're not going.

408
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,181
Mr. Manfield!
To what do we owe this pleasure?

409
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:50,850
Lorna invited me.

410
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,728
She usually doesn't show
such good judgment.

411
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:57,356
I'm delighted.
There's some people I want you to meet.

412
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:00,109
Sam, this is Michael Manfield,
the boy I was telling you about.

413
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,235
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

414
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,654
Perhaps we can convince you
to play something for us.

415
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:05,823
I have nothing prepared.

416
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,909
I heard you working on some Brahms
the other day. It was perfectly lovely.

417
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:10,786
You can play it
after the second intermission.

418
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:14,623
I'd like to, but I really have to go
pick up my brother at a friend's house.

419
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,667
You can play before you have to go.

420
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,793
Listen, Dad, would you excuse me?

421
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,086
I'd like to get Michael something to eat.

422
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,547
- Hope to hear you soon.
- It was really good stuff.

423
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,932
How come you didn't want
to play for them?

424
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:37,021
Personally, I wouldn't consider it,
but you're supposed to love this stuff.

425
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,569
It's all right. You don't have to explain.
Mozart was crazy, too.

426
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,532
- Want to go up to my room?
- Okay.

427
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,577
All right. Finish your milk.

428
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,182
Excuse me.

429
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,562
Guitar is my life.

430
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:30,240
You're very confusing, you know.

431
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:33,410
Who, me? Why?

432
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,662
'Cause sometimes you can be so straight...

433
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,081
and then other times,
you turn around and you're like that.

434
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:47,007
- It's always, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir. "
- I'm polite.

435
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,467
- Polite is phony.
- It's not phony.

436
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:54,514
- It avoids confrontation.
- Is that what you're doing now?

437
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,599
You're avoiding confrontation?

438
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,935
Don't you ever want to say, "Cut the shit"?

439
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,980
Lorna! Is Michael in there with you?
I want him to play.

440
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:07,443
He left. He went to pick up his brother.

441
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,988
I thought this was my room.

442
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,075
Your mother wants you downstairs.

443
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:27,213
There's a tree.

444
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:19,098
Mrs. Powell? The doctor will see you now.

445
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:26,272
Did I leave my purse out here?

446
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:29,692
Thank you.

447
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,280
Excuse me?

448
00:43:34,947 --> 00:43:35,990
Excuse me!

449
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,659
Do you have an appointment?

450
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:42,204
Nope.

451
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:56,301
Gus!

452
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,597
What's cooking, mama?

453
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:05,644
I look at you, and I can see you standing
on the corner of Michigan Avenue...

454
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,564
in a Mexican blouse
and those crazy silver things.

455
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:11,566
Big silver earrings.

456
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,611
God, that was a long time ago.

457
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,406
How's Artie?

458
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:19,616
He's okay.

459
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,452
He's great, actually.

460
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,790
He did some work in Florida
on a toxic waste dump.

461
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:30,001
Here, he organized a food co-op...

462
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,962
and he's trying to
get his restaurant to unionize.

463
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,214
And how's you and Artie?

464
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,299
We're okay.

465
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,971
I mean, you know, it's hard.

466
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,556
I think about you.

467
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,976
I think about you.

468
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,146
I hope you're safe.

469
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,275
How do you manage this?

470
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,902
Got a house...

471
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,737
two kids.

472
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,282
It's kind of like
you're leading a regular life.

473
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,701
I'm a good liar.

474
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,830
But I'm tired.

475
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,417
Shit.

476
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,592
Oh, God.

477
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,518
Hey, chief.

478
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,396
Hello.

479
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,898
Hello?

480
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,984
That's all you got to say to this guy
that just drove...

481
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,612
800 miles out of his way to see you?

482
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,489
You look great.

483
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,407
Then how come I feel so uneasy?

484
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,869
Artie, let's take a walk.
I got stuff to talk to you about.

485
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,037
I'm tired.

486
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,791
Go ahead, Paul. Take a walk with him.
You haven't seen him for 12 years.

487
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,224
You're out of your fucking mind!

488
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,310
- You owe us!
- I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

489
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,271
Do you know what
your asshole friend here wants me to do?

490
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,526
Rob a fucking bank! Can you believe it?
A fucking bank!

491
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,904
A "political action," he calls it.

492
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,115
We've been assigned this little job
by the Liberation Army.

493
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,077
Who are under the mistaken impression
that they've been supporting us...

494
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,828
and we owe them something!

495
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,915
What do they want my kids to do?

496
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,376
Knock off the fucking president?

497
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,253
You want to show
what you got in your car?

498
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,507
Nothing. It's my stuff.

499
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,051
That's not the impression you gave me.

500
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,845
Let's look, shall we?

501
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,181
Get the kids down here.
I want them to see this.

502
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,225
This guy's still a fucking maniac!

503
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,351
Just stop it.

504
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,521
Boys! Get down here! Now!

505
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:22,255
I want you to know
guns are not what we're about.

506
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,136
Now, get back in the house.

507
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,941
You're going to change the world, Artie...

508
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:45,028
by organizing these little food co-ops?

509
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,699
I'm going out.

510
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,453
You can stay the night...

511
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:57,707
but when I get back, I don't want to see
these things within 10 miles of my kids.

512
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,979
Annie, I'd like to explain this.

513
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:22,690
I'm listening.

514
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:27,320
You know,
we've been under a long time.

515
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:32,325
A lot of bad shit has happened.
A lot of bad shit keeps happening.

516
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:35,828
But we're dead...

517
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:42,794
as far as the world is concerned.

518
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,379
We pull an action
and they bury it in the newspapers.

519
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,091
It's like it didn't happen.

520
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,761
The only time the pigs
or the media pay attention...

521
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:54,931
is when something
or somebody gets blown away.

522
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:59,310
Great. If you can't beat them, join them.

523
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:04,315
Do you think we're going to win this
by turning the other cheek?

524
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:08,277
Why don't you try walking on water?

525
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:11,697
Why don't you try growing up?
There's nothing to win.

526
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:14,533
It was over as soon as the war ended.

527
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:19,163
The war didn't end, Annie.
The war ain't never going to end.

528
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:24,293
This has nothing to do with politics
or the merchandise in my car.

529
00:49:24,376 --> 00:49:26,337
This is just Artie's pissed.

530
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:30,883
Artie's pissed...

531
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:33,385
'cause Artie's jealous.

532
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,806
And Artie's jealous...

533
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,020
because you want me.

534
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,148
And I sure want you.

535
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:52,321
That's a bad situation.

536
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,910
Sooner or later,
they're just going to blow up.

537
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,166
You know, I feel sorry for you.

538
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:05,709
I do.

539
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:08,378
You're a 46-year-old infant.

540
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:14,551
Everything has to be your way, doesn't it?
When you want it, where you want it.

541
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:18,472
You're not a revolutionary.

542
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:22,893
That requires more than playing with guns
or with yourself.

543
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,689
It requires compassion, discipline.

544
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:30,025
Are you judging me?

545
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:38,992
You judge yourself, lady.

546
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:44,664
You're living like some kind of silly-ass,
middle-class, suburban housewife.

547
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:49,669
You're living a lie...

548
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,672
just like you said.

549
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:59,679
Why don't you take this little
Norman Rockwell family and turn them in?

550
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:02,891
The feds would be glad to get them.

551
00:51:04,225 --> 00:51:05,685
And then you could get the fuck out.

552
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:10,690
I wish I could.

553
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:14,861
Now get out.

554
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,765
Are you okay, Mom?

555
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,642
Yeah.

556
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:48,895
Fine.

557
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,455
Go to bed.

558
00:52:53,334 --> 00:52:57,004
I am not Paul. I am not Paul! I am-

559
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:03,177
- Paul, come in.
- I'm not Paul.

560
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,720
I'm Arthur.

561
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:07,514
Don't call me "Paul. " I am Arthur.

562
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:10,893
I am Arthur Eli Pope!

563
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:14,313
- What's the matter with Dad?
- He's just had a lot to drink.

564
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:19,359
Born in Plattsburg, New York,
July 16, 1944!

565
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,404
A US citizen. My mother's...

566
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:25,449
maiden name is Silbowitz.

567
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:29,202
My father's real name is Popov.
Morris Popov.

568
00:53:30,537 --> 00:53:33,206
My driver's license number is 4-3-5-7...

569
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:35,125
1-1.

570
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:38,962
My draft number is M-S-8-9...

571
00:53:39,212 --> 00:53:42,716
-3-5-8-4.
- It's okay.

572
00:53:43,717 --> 00:53:45,719
My name is Pope.

573
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:46,970
It's okay.

574
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,293
You said walk, not hike.

575
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:21,629
- Are you tired?
- No.

576
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:30,805
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

577
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,144
You know,
I was really surprised when you called me.

578
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:38,521
Why?

579
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:41,816
I wasn't sure if you liked me or not.

580
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,528
Sometimes you're so...

581
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:47,739
distant.

582
00:54:49,866 --> 00:54:53,369
I'm not too sure
if you like me too much, either.

583
00:54:54,954 --> 00:54:59,083
Take it on faith. I usually don't follow
people I don't like for 10 miles...

584
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,668
into the middle of the woods.

585
00:55:00,793 --> 00:55:02,253
Why are you so angry?

586
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:04,839
That's wit, not anger.

587
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:08,801
- You scare a lot of people.
- Who, besides you?

588
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:15,224
A lot of people scare me.

589
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:16,934
Who scares you?

590
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:24,984
People who are nice, like my parents.

591
00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:28,654
What's wrong with being nice?

592
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:31,323
Let's put it like this.

593
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,660
My mother is really nice.

594
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:38,289
She never does anything wrong or mean.

595
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:42,209
She even gives her old clothes
to the maid...

596
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:45,588
but she doesn't really want to know her.

597
00:55:45,671 --> 00:55:48,340
In 10 years,
she's never even seen Betty's husband.

598
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:52,052
He waits in the car
when he comes to pick her up.

599
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:57,141
Your father's sure not like that.

600
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,351
Why? Because he plays Madonna in class?

601
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:02,271
What does he know about you,
except that you're good on the piano?

602
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:06,066
They see what they want to see,
and they block out everything else...

603
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:08,569
especially if it might not be nice.

604
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,864
They don't seem to get in your way much.

605
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:15,325
My parents? It's just their way
of not believing who I really am.

606
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,078
They think that eventually,
I'll turn back into the little girl...

607
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:21,123
in the pink dress
that's in the picture on the piano.

608
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:25,627
And what do you think?

609
00:56:26,295 --> 00:56:28,046
You really want to know?

610
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:32,134
I think that I'll go to New York
and learn to write...

611
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:34,720
and that I'll come home every Christmas...

612
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,806
and everyone will be really polite.

613
00:56:38,974 --> 00:56:40,976
That's doesn't sound so bad.

614
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,730
Maybe not, but I'm not in New York yet.

615
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:52,446
So what about you?

616
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,032
I don't know a thing about you.

617
00:56:56,158 --> 00:56:59,452
You might as well have sprung full-grown
out of the head of Zeus.

618
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:02,289
Who are your parents? Ozzie and Harriet?

619
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:04,291
Yeah, sometimes.

620
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,460
Do I get to meet them
and see how you came out so perfect?

621
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:09,004
I mean, it seems only fair.

622
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:12,215
I showed you mine, you show me yours.

623
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:20,140
I guess this is the end of the rest stop.

624
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:25,311
What did I say?

625
00:57:27,772 --> 00:57:30,066
I thought it would be nicer down here.

626
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,529
You don't transmit too much information.

627
00:57:35,363 --> 00:57:36,364
What?

628
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:39,742
I said,
you don't transmit too much information.

629
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,328
Sorry.

630
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:46,124
What are you doing over the summer?

631
00:57:48,126 --> 00:57:50,461
I have a job pumping gas.

632
00:57:50,795 --> 00:57:53,631
You finally got the Supreme Court
to hear your case, huh?

633
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:58,136
What about you?

634
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,805
I don't know.

635
00:58:03,307 --> 00:58:05,309
You thought it'd be nicer over here?

636
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:08,521
Yeah.

637
00:58:17,822 --> 00:58:19,198
What are you doing?

638
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:25,288
I'm looking for something
for my mom's birthday.

639
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,874
You mean,
in case somebody happened to leave...

640
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,793
a Cuisinart or a diamond ring
lying on the beach?

641
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:34,338
Yeah, that would qualify. It has to be
something either you make or find.

642
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:36,966
- When's her birthday?
- Next week.

643
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:00,406
That's beautiful.

644
00:59:02,616 --> 00:59:04,243
It's for your mother.

645
00:59:06,954 --> 00:59:08,414
You give it to her.

646
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,167
Okay.

647
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:17,756
It must be nicer over there.

648
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,177
Here, chop these.

649
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:35,065
No, no, no. Watch. Move.

650
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:37,401
You hold the knife...

651
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,653
and you just do that.

652
00:59:39,987 --> 00:59:41,405
That's neat. Let me try.

653
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:45,992
No, no. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want
pieces of tiny little fingers in my stew.

654
00:59:46,076 --> 00:59:47,411
Here. You stir.

655
00:59:49,913 --> 00:59:51,706
Were you expecting someone?

656
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,341
Hi.

657
01:00:02,926 --> 01:00:04,261
I'm Lorna.

658
01:00:05,512 --> 01:00:07,180
Michael invited me.

659
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:10,350
Well, come in.

660
01:00:16,273 --> 01:00:17,774
Your friend's here.

661
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,318
Hi.

662
01:00:23,363 --> 01:00:25,115
- Hi.
- Can I help?

663
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:27,826
No. No, it's okay. Thank you.

664
01:00:28,368 --> 01:00:29,828
You cut your finger.

665
01:00:29,953 --> 01:00:30,954
Yeah.

666
01:00:31,454 --> 01:00:33,289
Is this your girlfriend?

667
01:00:33,623 --> 01:00:35,458
Hi, I'm Stephen.

668
01:00:38,461 --> 01:00:41,422
That was delicious, babe.
You outdid yourself.

669
01:00:41,548 --> 01:00:44,842
This pilgrim food for my very own WASP.

670
01:00:45,468 --> 01:00:47,178
But you must forgive me, my darling.

671
01:00:47,303 --> 01:00:49,764
I couldn't get myself
to make one of those Jell-O molds.

672
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:53,268
You're forgiven this time.

673
01:00:53,393 --> 01:00:55,853
And now, for the pice de rsistance.

674
01:00:56,145 --> 01:00:59,273
- Let me, Dad.
- You're under arrest.

675
01:01:09,075 --> 01:01:11,285
Look at this.
You got it all over your bellybutton.

676
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,037
Look at that.

677
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:17,166
Oh, God. I'm old enough
to set the house on fire.

678
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:43,359
I'm sorry, I thought your mother's name
was Cynthia.

679
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:45,694
On birthdays, we're all Sam.

680
01:01:46,028 --> 01:01:47,404
It's a little family tradition...

681
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:51,158
resulting from a particularly good LSD trip
I took in 1968.

682
01:01:54,703 --> 01:01:55,996
More wine?

683
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,376
- Would you give me a break?
- In Europe, kids drink wine.

684
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:04,797
Get your mother her present
before I call Alcoholics Anonymous.

685
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:15,140
Thanks.

686
01:02:20,813 --> 01:02:23,732
It's just what I wanted.

687
01:02:23,816 --> 01:02:26,151
- Really?
- Absolutely.

688
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,282
What is that, a butterfly?

689
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:34,660
No, it's a whale of a present.

690
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,919
- Thanks.
- I'll play it for you sometime.

691
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,381
This is from Lorna.

692
01:02:55,263 --> 01:02:56,890
That's beautiful.

693
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:59,476
Thank you, Lorna.

694
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:04,564
Mine, you get later.

695
01:03:05,106 --> 01:03:06,233
You bet.

696
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:08,568
On your feet!

697
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,153
Let me help.

698
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:13,907
I like her.

699
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:15,075
Yeah?

700
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,494
- I like her, too.
- I know.

701
01:04:13,174 --> 01:04:15,468
You sure this is the Phillips' kid?

702
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,304
They didn't switch you at the hospital,
or anything, did they?

703
01:05:16,654 --> 01:05:19,698
You know,
I can't believe how incredible they are.

704
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:25,204
Do you know what my mother would do
if I gave her a shell for her birthday?

705
01:05:25,662 --> 01:05:27,289
They're okay.

706
01:05:28,248 --> 01:05:31,043
That's you all over,
afraid to commit yourself.

707
01:05:32,002 --> 01:05:33,796
I thought it was just me.

708
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:39,843
I'm very happy with you.

709
01:05:42,512 --> 01:05:44,723
I'm very happy with you, too.

710
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:45,074
It's okay, I want to.

711
01:07:37,376 --> 01:07:39,837
- You weren't in cooking.
- You noticed.

712
01:07:40,379 --> 01:07:42,340
- Where were you?
- I cut.

713
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,427
- Why?
- I didn't want to see you.

714
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:12,244
Manfield, could I talk to you for a minute?

715
01:08:17,249 --> 01:08:19,918
You don't have to look so anxious.
If you've done something wrong...

716
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:23,047
I don't know about it. I just want
to talk to you about your college plans.

717
01:08:23,172 --> 01:08:27,134
I was thinking of taking a year off, maybe
traveling to Europe, listening to music.

718
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:30,721
I can't tell you what to do, but I think you
ought to make an application, anyway.

719
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:32,765
You can always postpone entry.

720
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:35,225
I'd like you to consider applying
to Juilliard.

721
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,852
Early admission.

722
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:44,610
I looked at your academic records.
You should have no trouble getting in.

723
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,195
Where's the rest of it, by the way?

724
01:08:46,278 --> 01:08:48,322
There's nothing in your file
from your old school.

725
01:08:50,032 --> 01:08:52,200
It was lost when we moved.

726
01:08:53,535 --> 01:08:55,037
When it comes through, I'd like to see it.

727
01:08:56,288 --> 01:08:58,290
In the meantime, you look at that.

728
01:09:03,378 --> 01:09:05,505
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

729
01:09:06,214 --> 01:09:07,466
Thank you.

730
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:12,971
Get back to me when you've looked at it.

731
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:20,496
You wouldn't talk to me.

732
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,333
Now, get up.

733
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:27,211
Go down the stairs and out the back door.

734
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:29,213
Be quiet.

735
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:40,892
I'll be right behind you.

736
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:55,281
I'm barefoot.

737
01:11:27,771 --> 01:11:28,939
Sit down.

738
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:39,450
What am I doing?

739
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:45,330
I just wanted to talk to you.

740
01:11:47,624 --> 01:11:49,918
You wouldn't listen,
the other day at school.

741
01:11:56,133 --> 01:12:00,679
I couldn't stay with you that night.
Not because I didn't want to.

742
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,816
If you want to go back, it's fine with me.

743
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,903
- You're a bully.
- No.

744
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,950
I'm a liar.

745
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:27,164
My name isn't Michael.

746
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:30,750
It's Danny.

747
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:36,006
My parents are Arthur and Annie Pope.

748
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:42,762
They're in trouble with the FBl
for blowing up a napalm lab in 1971.

749
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:44,723
There was a man who was almost killed.

750
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:46,725
A janitor,
who wasn't supposed to be there.

751
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:49,728
We put "Sam" on the birthday cakes,
on all the birthday cakes...

752
01:12:50,603 --> 01:12:53,064
because we change our names
every time we move.

753
01:12:56,025 --> 01:12:59,195
I've been doing this since I was two.

754
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,073
I don't know any other way.

755
01:13:02,782 --> 01:13:06,119
I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry.

756
01:13:09,205 --> 01:13:12,500
I wanted to explain
why I can't talk about a lot of things.

757
01:13:13,126 --> 01:13:16,713
Like college. I can't go to college.
I can't leave them.

758
01:13:20,466 --> 01:13:22,260
And I wanted to tell you...

759
01:13:23,428 --> 01:13:25,138
why I couldn't be with you.

760
01:13:26,139 --> 01:13:28,975
Not without your knowing.
I didn't want to lie to you.

761
01:13:30,977 --> 01:13:34,689
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

762
01:13:34,814 --> 01:13:37,608
It's dangerous for you,
and it's dangerous for them.

763
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:41,988
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

764
01:13:42,488 --> 01:13:46,075
You can do what you want to. You can
tell your dad anything. I don't care.

765
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:48,911
I just needed you to know.

766
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,915
I don't know what I'm doing.

767
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:57,003
And I love you.

768
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,925
I love you.

769
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,250
What do I call you?

770
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:39,378
Michael. Nothing changes.

771
01:14:40,295 --> 01:14:42,631
They really don't want you
to go to school, huh?

772
01:14:45,259 --> 01:14:47,052
We haven't talked about it.

773
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,596
- I can't ask them.
- Why not?

774
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:53,892
It would mean breaking up the family,
not seeing them again.

775
01:14:55,394 --> 01:14:57,312
They don't have anything else.

776
01:14:58,814 --> 01:15:03,819
I can't believe that they'd want you to
give up your whole life to stay with them.

777
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:06,738
Talk to them. They'll understand.

778
01:15:11,368 --> 01:15:13,537
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

779
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,082
Now you have another one.

780
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:00,250
Been to see Lorna?

781
01:16:10,301 --> 01:16:11,803
I like that one.

782
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:13,930
She's full of beans.

783
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:18,476
You really like her, don't you?

784
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:22,063
The smart ones are always the best.

785
01:16:24,315 --> 01:16:26,025
Are you sleeping with her?

786
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:29,821
- Yeah.
- Okay.

787
01:16:31,489 --> 01:16:34,242
Go ahead, hit the sack.
You got school tomorrow.

788
01:17:43,602 --> 01:17:45,854
How long have you been playing violin...

789
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:49,108
after you stopped playing seriously piano?

790
01:17:49,817 --> 01:17:51,068
About five years.

791
01:17:51,151 --> 01:17:52,945
When did you come to the States?

792
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:55,072
In 1980.

793
01:17:55,155 --> 01:17:57,241
All right. Thank you very much.

794
01:17:57,825 --> 01:18:00,828
Mr. Manfield. We're ready for you now.

795
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:34,772
Who did you say you studied with?

796
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,942
Edward Phillips.

797
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,444
- Where was this?
- Waterford.

798
01:20:41,153 --> 01:20:43,280
- New Jersey?
- That's right.

799
01:20:43,656 --> 01:20:45,783
We seem not to have
all your school records.

800
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:51,830
There was a school fire at my old school,
and the records were lost.

801
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:54,541
We only moved to New Jersey this year.

802
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,463
So you've only studied with Mr. Phillips
for a short time.

803
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,215
Yes, ma'am.

804
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,300
Who else have you worked with?

805
01:21:05,511 --> 01:21:08,138
A lot of different people.
No one important.

806
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,557
We move a lot.

807
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:14,144
You'll have to supply us
with SAT scores and...

808
01:21:15,228 --> 01:21:16,980
we'll have to have those records.

809
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,653
Mr. Manfield.

810
01:21:23,528 --> 01:21:24,529
Oh, sorry.

811
01:21:26,531 --> 01:21:29,993
You are very talented, you know.

812
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,122
Thank you, ma'am.

813
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,232
A cheese pizza for Mrs. Patterson.

814
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:46,319
I don't think Mrs. Patterson
ordered a pizza.

815
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:51,824
Is this Murray Hill 68434?

816
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,910
- Yes.
- Someone ordered it.

817
01:22:54,535 --> 01:22:55,578
Just a minute.

818
01:23:06,964 --> 01:23:09,008
What's this about a pizza?

819
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:12,470
You ordered one.

820
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:15,389
I didn't.

821
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:19,226
Will you have to pay for it?

822
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,938
No, I'll have to eat it.

823
01:23:34,408 --> 01:23:37,411
I really don't care. Hold on.
Could you knock next time?

824
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:40,289
- I'm sorry.
- Listen, I have to go. Yeah. Bye.

825
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:46,253
I was wondering if Michael
had ever mentioned anything to you...

826
01:23:46,378 --> 01:23:47,379
about his old school.

827
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:48,922
Not much. Why?

828
01:23:49,006 --> 01:23:50,841
They never sent his records.

829
01:23:52,009 --> 01:23:53,093
So?

830
01:23:53,427 --> 01:23:55,262
I called the school.
They have no record of him.

831
01:23:55,346 --> 01:23:58,515
They probably got eaten by a computer,
or something.

832
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:02,311
They don't have a computer
in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

833
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:05,522
What are you on his case for?

834
01:24:06,607 --> 01:24:09,860
- We know nothing about him.
- So, he's an axe murderer.

835
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:14,198
I mean, come on! I thought he was
the best music student you ever had.

836
01:24:14,281 --> 01:24:17,117
He is, but that doesn't explain
his missing records.

837
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:21,121
If you want to know who he is,
why don't you talk to him?

838
01:24:21,914 --> 01:24:23,582
He's a person!

839
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,461
He's not a computer printout!

840
01:24:34,426 --> 01:24:36,762
Would you please close the door?

841
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:46,021
- Mrs. Manfield?
- Yes.

842
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:47,981
- Thank you for coming.
- How do you do?

843
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:50,150
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

844
01:24:55,405 --> 01:24:57,157
I want to talk to you about Michael.

845
01:24:57,741 --> 01:25:00,827
I didn't want to meet at school,
because he doesn't know we're talking.

846
01:25:00,952 --> 01:25:02,787
But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

847
01:25:02,912 --> 01:25:05,123
I thought
maybe there was something at home.

848
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:07,584
No.

849
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:12,547
I know these things are private. I just
thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

850
01:25:12,964 --> 01:25:14,758
But there isn't anything. Really.

851
01:25:16,259 --> 01:25:18,344
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

852
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,014
Juilliard?

853
01:25:22,182 --> 01:25:23,808
You know about his plans?

854
01:25:24,434 --> 01:25:27,020
- Yeah, sure.
- And you don't object?

855
01:25:27,562 --> 01:25:28,563
No.

856
01:25:29,606 --> 01:25:32,025
They were very impressed
with his audition.

857
01:25:34,027 --> 01:25:37,155
They're prepared to take him,
just as soon as they get his records.

858
01:25:40,283 --> 01:25:42,535
He'll have to go then, won't he?

859
01:25:43,536 --> 01:25:45,580
Is there a financial problem?

860
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:48,833
We're not the Rockefellers.

861
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:51,294
He could be worried about that.

862
01:25:51,377 --> 01:25:53,004
We always manage.

863
01:25:53,212 --> 01:25:55,882
There are scholarships. He could get one.

864
01:25:56,048 --> 01:25:57,550
He's very talented.

865
01:25:57,884 --> 01:26:01,053
We may not have a lot,
but we care about our kids.

866
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:02,638
I'm sure you do.

867
01:26:03,306 --> 01:26:07,185
I was just wondering,
has he ever had a serious teacher?

868
01:26:08,185 --> 01:26:10,146
How has he gotten this far?

869
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:11,772
I don't know.

870
01:26:11,856 --> 01:26:15,443
He's picked up a little here and there.
We move around a lot. Why?

871
01:26:15,568 --> 01:26:18,571
I called Blue Hill and they have no record
of Michael Manfield.

872
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:26,245
That's because he wasn't registered
there under Manfield.

873
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:28,873
See, I was married before,
and Paul adopted him.

874
01:26:28,998 --> 01:26:31,876
But it took until just this year
to adopt his name legally.

875
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,670
He's under my old husband's name
at Blue Hill.

876
01:26:35,671 --> 01:26:38,090
He can't finish his application
without those records.

877
01:26:38,174 --> 01:26:39,508
I'll get them.

878
01:26:39,758 --> 01:26:42,678
You'll have to, because they won't
release them to anyone but a parent-

879
01:26:42,761 --> 01:26:45,180
I said, I'll get them. All right?

880
01:26:47,349 --> 01:26:49,018
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

881
01:28:59,647 --> 01:29:01,107
What's wrong, Mom?

882
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:04,152
Nothing.

883
01:29:07,405 --> 01:29:08,906
I just love you.

884
01:29:26,924 --> 01:29:28,843
I've got to pick up your father.

885
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:45,276
Do you like it? I traded the van in for it.
Thought it'd be more practical.

886
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,820
Besides, it keeps them guessing.

887
01:29:58,372 --> 01:29:59,748
What's up, Sam?

888
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,709
Don't call me that.

889
01:30:02,835 --> 01:30:03,836
Okay.

890
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:10,509
Danny's applied to college.

891
01:30:13,053 --> 01:30:14,096
Where?

892
01:30:14,388 --> 01:30:15,722
Juilliard.

893
01:30:16,849 --> 01:30:17,975
How do you know?

894
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:20,561
Phillips. He wants him to go.

895
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:25,858
Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose
out of our business?

896
01:30:25,983 --> 01:30:27,943
Because he thinks he's talented.

897
01:30:29,486 --> 01:30:30,946
Has Danny told you about any of this?

898
01:30:32,322 --> 01:30:33,323
No.

899
01:30:37,744 --> 01:30:39,287
What are we going to do?

900
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:41,164
Shit.

901
01:30:41,873 --> 01:30:44,584
Goddamn fucking shit!

902
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:46,670
Why can't he go?

903
01:30:47,003 --> 01:30:48,880
Because we'll never see him again
if he does.

904
01:30:49,005 --> 01:30:51,258
Why? We could arrange to meet him.

905
01:30:52,175 --> 01:30:53,468
Is that what you want?

906
01:30:53,593 --> 01:30:58,223
Ten minutes at an airport lounge, and the
FBl all over his ass the rest of the time?

907
01:30:59,516 --> 01:31:02,978
You want him standing in phone booths
and Laundromats like my parents...

908
01:31:03,103 --> 01:31:06,231
only connecting with us
through the network? I don't think so.

909
01:31:07,357 --> 01:31:09,651
If he goes,
we're never going to see him again...

910
01:31:10,277 --> 01:31:12,612
and that is unacceptable to me.

911
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:25,417
I never even let myself think about this.

912
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:29,087
I was so stupid.

913
01:31:31,798 --> 01:31:34,008
All I wanted
was that we would be together.

914
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:40,390
We should have left Danny
with my mother.

915
01:31:41,891 --> 01:31:44,143
- We never should have had Harry.
- Stop it.

916
01:31:44,227 --> 01:31:48,439
I can't, Arthur.
Look what we're doing to these kids.

917
01:31:49,232 --> 01:31:51,526
They've been running their whole lives
like criminals.

918
01:31:51,651 --> 01:31:52,944
And they didn't do anything!

919
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:54,487
It isn't fair.

920
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,906
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

921
01:31:57,407 --> 01:32:01,369
They've taken some bumps, but it's not
going to help anything to beat yourself up.

922
01:32:03,413 --> 01:32:05,415
Look at them, for God's sake.

923
01:32:05,498 --> 01:32:08,334
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

924
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:10,503
They're beautiful.

925
01:32:10,586 --> 01:32:12,672
And bright. Caring.

926
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,800
How badly could we have done?

927
01:32:19,428 --> 01:32:21,180
We should turn ourselves in.

928
01:32:23,099 --> 01:32:25,685
So we can sit in prison
for the next 15 years...

929
01:32:25,768 --> 01:32:28,062
and look at the kids through bars?

930
01:32:28,604 --> 01:32:32,066
You can only get through this
one day, one hour at a time.

931
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:35,361
That's what I'm doing.

932
01:32:37,113 --> 01:32:39,073
And Danny's all grown up.

933
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:44,161
We have to let him go.

934
01:32:54,046 --> 01:32:55,923
This tooth is killing me.

935
01:32:56,048 --> 01:32:59,176
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

936
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,179
I'll take a bus.

937
01:33:02,805 --> 01:33:04,932
- I always worry when you go into the city.
- Why?

938
01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:07,434
Because that's where they get everyone.

939
01:33:07,726 --> 01:33:09,186
It's been quiet.

940
01:33:10,562 --> 01:33:12,523
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

941
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:15,192
Remember what you used to say
when the kids were small?

942
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:17,694
"Don't worry
unless you don't hear anything. "

943
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,364
Be careful, all right?

944
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:33,835
I don't see anything.
And there's nothing on the x-ray.

945
01:33:33,919 --> 01:33:35,587
I'm not complaining.

946
01:33:38,257 --> 01:33:39,758
You need anything else?

947
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,430
No, thanks. We're okay.
I'm working for a GP.

948
01:33:46,264 --> 01:33:47,766
How about cash?

949
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,018
Okay.

950
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:55,774
If you'd give me some notice,
I could arrange to have more.

951
01:33:56,024 --> 01:33:58,693
No. This is great. Thanks.

952
01:34:00,362 --> 01:34:03,365
- You always make me feel so guilty.
- Why?

953
01:34:03,615 --> 01:34:05,158
You're living it.

954
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,370
Yeah, I guess I am.

955
01:34:10,372 --> 01:34:14,209
Jonah, I need you
to make a phone call for me.

956
01:34:15,126 --> 01:34:16,294
Of course.

957
01:34:24,803 --> 01:34:25,845
Madame?

958
01:34:53,414 --> 01:34:54,540
Hi, Dad.

959
01:34:58,419 --> 01:35:00,546
I asked Jonah to set this up.

960
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,512
You can call the cops if you want to.

961
01:35:16,354 --> 01:35:17,897
I'm sorry.

962
01:35:20,274 --> 01:35:22,068
This is hard for me, too.

963
01:35:24,529 --> 01:35:27,198
- Will madame have a drink?
- No, thank you.

964
01:35:34,372 --> 01:35:37,249
I wonder if you'll ever know
what it's like...

965
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:40,044
not to see your child for 14 years.

966
01:35:43,464 --> 01:35:46,258
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

967
01:35:53,641 --> 01:35:54,934
Not knowing whether that child...

968
01:35:55,893 --> 01:36:00,314
is responsible for the death
and mutilation of other human beings.

969
01:36:02,233 --> 01:36:04,693
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

970
01:36:05,236 --> 01:36:07,029
for that death and mutilation...

971
01:36:07,571 --> 01:36:11,492
because it is your child who is pulling
the triggers, setting the bombs.

972
01:36:11,575 --> 01:36:13,577
I didn't kill anybody.

973
01:36:16,246 --> 01:36:19,917
I didn't come here to defend myself
or to talk politics.

974
01:36:21,085 --> 01:36:25,839
If you don't believe by now that what I did
was an act of conscience to stop the war...

975
01:36:26,256 --> 01:36:29,343
then there's nothing I can say to you
that's going to make you understand.

976
01:36:29,426 --> 01:36:31,428
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

977
01:36:31,512 --> 01:36:33,263
He wasn't supposed to be there.

978
01:36:37,768 --> 01:36:39,228
Don't you think there have been times...

979
01:36:39,353 --> 01:36:42,231
that I would have blinded
and paralyzed myself to take that back?

980
01:36:42,522 --> 01:36:44,107
It's all Arthur's influence.

981
01:36:44,191 --> 01:36:45,859
No, Dad, it isn't.

982
01:36:46,777 --> 01:36:48,111
It was my idea.

983
01:36:48,695 --> 01:36:51,198
I'm living with the consequences
of my own choice.

984
01:36:51,281 --> 01:36:53,158
- I don't believe it.
- Well, that's your problem.

985
01:36:53,283 --> 01:36:54,826
Your mother and me...

986
01:36:56,119 --> 01:36:57,621
Do you think about us?

987
01:37:04,544 --> 01:37:07,088
- Do you really have to ask that?
- Yes.

988
01:37:12,802 --> 01:37:15,263
The last thing
I remember you saying to me...

989
01:37:16,723 --> 01:37:19,100
was that I was an imperialist pig...

990
01:37:19,392 --> 01:37:24,356
personally responsible for the war,
the spread of poverty, racism.

991
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:27,233
- I was young.
- Yes.

992
01:37:30,987 --> 01:37:32,781
You were young.

993
01:37:34,324 --> 01:37:35,617
And talented.

994
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:38,703
And beautiful.

995
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,873
And so full of love.

996
01:37:44,584 --> 01:37:47,921
My God, Annie.
Why did you throw it all away?

997
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,388
Your mother misses you terribly.
And Danny.

998
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:03,770
Will you take him, Dad?

999
01:38:06,439 --> 01:38:08,066
He wants to study music.

1000
01:38:08,941 --> 01:38:10,443
He's good.

1001
01:38:10,943 --> 01:38:12,653
They want him at Juilliard.

1002
01:38:14,781 --> 01:38:16,699
Just like they wanted you.

1003
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:22,538
Do you still have that practice board?

1004
01:38:23,789 --> 01:38:27,293
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

1005
01:38:29,128 --> 01:38:30,796
So you taught him?

1006
01:38:34,383 --> 01:38:37,386
There's some irony in this,
don't you think?

1007
01:38:39,138 --> 01:38:40,556
Here you are...

1008
01:38:41,307 --> 01:38:43,601
asking me to take Danny...

1009
01:38:44,477 --> 01:38:48,647
into a life that you ran from
like a shot out of hell.

1010
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:52,985
Is this what he wants?

1011
01:38:53,069 --> 01:38:54,570
I think so.

1012
01:38:54,987 --> 01:38:57,948
He got himself an audition
without telling me.

1013
01:39:00,743 --> 01:39:04,413
He'll need money,
and people to care for him.

1014
01:39:05,664 --> 01:39:07,875
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

1015
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:10,878
I hardly know the boy.

1016
01:39:13,005 --> 01:39:14,465
If we take him...

1017
01:39:17,343 --> 01:39:21,013
there'd be FBl agents
following us everywhere we go.

1018
01:39:22,348 --> 01:39:23,724
You'd never be able to see him.

1019
01:39:25,768 --> 01:39:27,436
We're too old for this.

1020
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:33,108
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

1021
01:39:39,865 --> 01:39:41,533
I have another son.

1022
01:39:42,284 --> 01:39:44,578
He's 10. Harry.

1023
01:39:46,622 --> 01:39:48,415
I heard about it on the news.

1024
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:52,085
I plan to turn myself in...

1025
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:56,006
when he doesn't need me anymore.
When he's old enough.

1026
01:39:56,798 --> 01:39:58,091
And Arthur?

1027
01:39:58,633 --> 01:40:00,177
I can't speak for him.

1028
01:40:04,222 --> 01:40:06,016
Please think about this.

1029
01:40:13,982 --> 01:40:15,358
I should go.

1030
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:19,446
Annie.

1031
01:40:22,908 --> 01:40:24,576
He can come to us.

1032
01:40:40,592 --> 01:40:43,303
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

1033
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:47,474
And I've thought about you both so often.

1034
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,852
I've called out to you.

1035
01:40:53,521 --> 01:40:56,816
I'm sorry
that I've caused you so much pain.

1036
01:41:01,613 --> 01:41:04,282
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

1037
01:41:09,704 --> 01:41:10,872
I love you, Dad.

1038
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:49,076
I saw my father.

1039
01:41:51,078 --> 01:41:52,246
You what?

1040
01:41:52,747 --> 01:41:54,582
I saw Donald.

1041
01:41:56,751 --> 01:41:59,754
You just walked into his office
and sat down at his desk?

1042
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:01,005
No.

1043
01:42:01,172 --> 01:42:04,758
I had lunch with him at La Petite Marmite.

1044
01:42:05,926 --> 01:42:07,094
What for?

1045
01:42:08,262 --> 01:42:10,264
To see if he'd take Danny.

1046
01:42:11,098 --> 01:42:12,766
Take Danny?

1047
01:42:13,267 --> 01:42:15,227
So he can go to college.

1048
01:42:17,104 --> 01:42:18,397
You're kidding.

1049
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:21,150
He said he would.

1050
01:42:22,026 --> 01:42:23,652
He said he would?

1051
01:42:24,862 --> 01:42:27,031
You know what could have happened?

1052
01:42:29,116 --> 01:42:31,243
Did Phillips put you up to this?

1053
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:33,746
Nobody put me up to this.

1054
01:42:35,038 --> 01:42:38,000
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

1055
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:42,296
He wants to go. He applied.
He went to an audition.

1056
01:42:42,379 --> 01:42:45,257
- He went fucking where?
- Juilliard.

1057
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:49,511
I don't believe my ears.

1058
01:42:49,636 --> 01:42:51,597
Just give him a chance.

1059
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:55,225
I'm going to call Deborah and see
if she can make him up some records.

1060
01:42:55,309 --> 01:42:56,518
Why?

1061
01:42:56,643 --> 01:42:59,313
Because Phillips called the school
I put on the registration form...

1062
01:42:59,396 --> 01:43:01,481
and they told him
there was no Michael Manfield.

1063
01:43:01,648 --> 01:43:03,608
It's going to be okay.

1064
01:43:03,817 --> 01:43:06,319
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

1065
01:43:09,823 --> 01:43:12,075
We're moving base camp, kids.

1066
01:43:13,243 --> 01:43:15,078
We have a few days, and we're gone.

1067
01:43:15,579 --> 01:43:17,080
Cover your tracks.

1068
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:18,874
You hear me?

1069
01:43:20,417 --> 01:43:22,252
You have anything you want to tell me?

1070
01:43:22,752 --> 01:43:23,837
No.

1071
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,046
Good.

1072
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:45,483
My father wants to move on.

1073
01:43:51,698 --> 01:43:52,782
Why?

1074
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:55,618
He gets a sense.

1075
01:43:58,371 --> 01:43:59,497
Just like that?

1076
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:01,749
Just like that.

1077
01:44:05,295 --> 01:44:06,421
When?

1078
01:44:07,547 --> 01:44:08,590
Anytime.

1079
01:44:09,716 --> 01:44:11,509
You'll just disappear?

1080
01:44:19,308 --> 01:44:20,768
What about us?

1081
01:44:23,896 --> 01:44:26,274
- They need me.
- I need you!

1082
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:30,111
You didn't talk to them?

1083
01:44:33,906 --> 01:44:37,326
You can't keep running from something
you had nothing to do with.

1084
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:39,829
You deserve your own chance.

1085
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:56,679
- I want to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

1086
01:44:56,762 --> 01:44:58,180
Phillips knows too much.

1087
01:44:58,264 --> 01:45:00,599
You were letting your feelings
affect your judgment.

1088
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:02,852
Besides, it's academic.

1089
01:45:15,197 --> 01:45:16,699
Nobody will talk.

1090
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,367
You don't know that.

1091
01:45:19,618 --> 01:45:22,288
They're going to try
to pick up everyone they can now.

1092
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,833
We're finished here.

1093
01:45:34,133 --> 01:45:36,677
- We can close up shop slowly, can't we?
- We'll have to.

1094
01:45:36,969 --> 01:45:39,638
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

1095
01:45:40,556 --> 01:45:42,975
Everybody goes to work and school
until further notice.

1096
01:45:43,058 --> 01:45:46,270
If there's a problem,
will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

1097
01:45:46,395 --> 01:45:49,773
There's no reason
to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

1098
01:46:10,836 --> 01:46:13,797
- Dad, can I talk to you a minute?
- Not now.

1099
01:46:20,429 --> 01:46:22,347
I was thinking about staying.

1100
01:46:22,597 --> 01:46:25,350
- Don't you have school?
- In half an hour.

1101
01:46:42,534 --> 01:46:43,618
I want to stay.

1102
01:46:45,036 --> 01:46:46,204
Stay?

1103
01:46:48,206 --> 01:46:50,333
Do you think this is a good time
to discuss this?

1104
01:46:51,626 --> 01:46:54,045
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

1105
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,840
I taught you!

1106
01:46:57,298 --> 01:46:59,759
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

1107
01:47:00,385 --> 01:47:02,637
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

1108
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,930
We're a unit!

1109
01:47:06,307 --> 01:47:08,768
I taught you all of this,
don't you remember that?

1110
01:47:10,895 --> 01:47:12,438
I don't want to hear you
talking about this...

1111
01:47:12,564 --> 01:47:14,482
in front of your mother or your brother,
do you hear me?

1112
01:47:14,566 --> 01:47:16,067
I said, do you hear me?

1113
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:20,196
Are we finished talking about this now?

1114
01:47:27,995 --> 01:47:28,996
Mrs. Taylor.

1115
01:47:30,665 --> 01:47:32,500
Just remove everything
and put on the gown.

1116
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:34,293
The doctor will see you in a few minutes.

1117
01:47:36,254 --> 01:47:39,465
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

1118
01:47:40,174 --> 01:47:42,301
Could you help me with this zipper, dear?

1119
01:47:44,762 --> 01:47:47,348
Did you hear what happened
to Elizabeth Powell last night?

1120
01:47:47,515 --> 01:47:48,516
No, I didn't.

1121
01:47:48,933 --> 01:47:51,060
The FBl came to see her.

1122
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:54,146
The car that was used
in that bank robbery...

1123
01:47:54,772 --> 01:47:56,274
where they killed those policemen...

1124
01:47:56,357 --> 01:47:58,859
it was rented with her credit card.

1125
01:47:59,527 --> 01:48:00,945
Can you believe it?

1126
01:48:01,445 --> 01:48:05,449
How could they have got hold of her card?
She never even uses it herself.

1127
01:48:05,616 --> 01:48:09,745
That's how come she didn't notice
it was gone.

1128
01:48:10,871 --> 01:48:12,832
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

1129
01:48:12,957 --> 01:48:15,167
They probably just took her name
out of the phone book...

1130
01:48:15,292 --> 01:48:16,544
and made up a false card.

1131
01:48:17,044 --> 01:48:18,796
Can you imagine the bad luck?

1132
01:48:28,305 --> 01:48:31,475
Paul Manfield, please. His wife.

1133
01:48:34,812 --> 01:48:36,355
We're in a hurry.

1134
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:40,275
Gus took plastic from one of my patients.
He used it to rent the car.

1135
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,206
Frankie? I'm going out for a smoke.

1136
01:49:11,098 --> 01:49:14,434
- Are we in a hurry, Mom?
- Yeah. We have to get Danny.

1137
01:49:20,774 --> 01:49:22,859
I hope your husband is all right.

1138
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:32,244
Okay, let's go.

1139
01:49:32,369 --> 01:49:34,496
- Mom, I'll meet you there.
- We don't have much time.

1140
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:44,381
Salinger uses imagery
in Catcher in the Rye to-

1141
01:49:45,298 --> 01:49:46,424
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1142
01:49:46,549 --> 01:49:49,219
Mr. McGuire would like
to see Lorna Phillips.

1143
01:49:49,302 --> 01:49:51,805
- Did he send a note?
- No, ma'am.

1144
01:49:52,722 --> 01:49:53,723
Ms. Phillips?

1145
01:50:10,573 --> 01:50:11,908
We're leaving.

1146
01:50:12,575 --> 01:50:14,410
You didn't ask them?

1147
01:50:16,329 --> 01:50:17,497
I did.

1148
01:50:18,331 --> 01:50:19,916
Artie fell apart.

1149
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:22,085
He didn't even make any sense.

1150
01:50:22,752 --> 01:50:26,047
Without us, he can't keep it going.

1151
01:50:27,256 --> 01:50:29,050
He needs us to hold him up.

1152
01:50:30,426 --> 01:50:32,512
All families break up.

1153
01:50:34,097 --> 01:50:37,850
Why do you have to carry the burden
of someone else's life?

1154
01:50:39,852 --> 01:50:41,437
He's my father.

1155
01:50:46,025 --> 01:50:47,485
I love you.

1156
01:50:52,448 --> 01:50:54,116
But I have to go.

1157
01:50:55,618 --> 01:50:57,828
I don't know how to say goodbye.

1158
01:51:01,624 --> 01:51:02,792
Well, don't.

1159
01:51:32,321 --> 01:51:34,323
- Where is he?
- He'll be here.

1160
01:51:34,406 --> 01:51:36,784
He went to say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1161
01:51:38,410 --> 01:51:40,245
He knows better than this.

1162
01:51:45,668 --> 01:51:48,379
This is Bob Stone, with a Z-90 newsbreak.

1163
01:51:48,504 --> 01:51:52,716
New Jersey police have reported the death
of Liberation Army member Gus Winant...

1164
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:56,095
at large after the bank robbery
yesterday afternoon.

1165
01:51:56,178 --> 01:51:58,514
He was shot resisting arrest
near Waterford...

1166
01:51:58,597 --> 01:52:01,183
where he had stolen a car,
and was attempting to flee.

1167
01:52:01,517 --> 01:52:05,187
More at 5:00.
We return you now to the ball game.

1168
01:52:24,122 --> 01:52:26,083
Get the bike out of the back.

1169
01:52:34,382 --> 01:52:36,218
Now get on it.

1170
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,930
What are you talking about, Dad-

1171
01:52:40,055 --> 01:52:43,850
Get on the bike. You're on your own, kid.

1172
01:52:46,978 --> 01:52:48,730
I want you to go to Juilliard.

1173
01:52:48,813 --> 01:52:50,815
But, Dad, I want to go with you.

1174
01:52:52,984 --> 01:52:56,154
We'll see you again. You can be sure.

1175
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:01,576
Your mother has arranged things
with your grandfather.

1176
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:02,994
Call him.

1177
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:05,455
And I think you have some friends
around here.

1178
01:53:06,498 --> 01:53:07,999
I love you, baby.

1179
01:53:11,586 --> 01:53:13,713
We all love you.

1180
01:53:14,756 --> 01:53:17,217
Now, go out there and make a difference.

1181
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:20,303
Your mother and I tried.

1182
01:53:23,348 --> 01:53:25,808
Don't let anyone tell you any different.

1183
01:53:41,532 --> 01:53:43,534
Goodbye, Danny!

1184
01:53:44,534 --> 01:53:54,534
