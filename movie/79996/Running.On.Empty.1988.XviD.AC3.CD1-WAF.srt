135

你現在聽到的是你最喜歡的老歌頻道，來自弗吉尼亞州的羅福（弗州地名）……
You're listening to your favorite oldies station in Norfolk, Virginia...

136
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:13,072
拉爾夫，你需要喂貓

137
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,861
還需要什麼別的嗎

138
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:35,285
- 不用了。兩個星期內我會再打電話的。

- No. I'll call the booth again in two weeks.

139
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,165
聽著。你母親……
Listen, your mother...

00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:42,121
她四周前去世了。癌症。

141
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,713
你父親當時在她身邊。

142
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,791
你當時有麻煩，聯繫不上你

143
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:50,887
他讓我告訴你不要擔心他，他很好
He said to tell you not to worry about him.He's okay.

144
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:52,718
我很遺憾。
Sorry.

145
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,362
好吧，誰要午飯？
Okay, who wants lunch?

146
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:45,610
我
Me.

147
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,191
金槍魚怎麼樣？

00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:50,943
好
Yecch.

149
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:55,741
我班裡有個人，要拿杜克·斯奈德（美國棒球球員）的卡和我換巴倫蘇埃拉（墨西哥棒球球員）的。
There's a kid in my class who traded me Duke Snider for Valenzuela.

150
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:57,459
嗯，所以呢？
Yeah, so?

151
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,755
所以他是個混蛋
So, he's a jerk.

152
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,879
斯奈德的卡值20美元

153
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,585
他是布魯克林道奇隊的
He's from the Brooklyn Dodgers.

154
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,674
他老了

155
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,684

158
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,940
你。你叫什麼？

159
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,363
麥克

160
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:30,204
- 你為什麼問他這個？
- 他還不習慣他的新名字。
- Why are you asking him that?
- He's not used to it yet.

161
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,664
他最好快一點習慣它
He better get used to it fast.

162
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:36,665
我叫什麼？

- 你媽媽叫什麼？
- 別問了
- What's your mother's name?
- Just stop it.

168
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:55,889
我等你說。

00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:57,523
辛西婭。

00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:58,774
你弟弟呢？
And your brother?

171
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:00,691
史蒂芬，行了吧？
Stephen, all right?

172
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,370
你他媽的出什麼毛病了？
What the hell's your problem?

173
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,283
我在市內找了些衣服。
I got some clothes in the city.

174
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,874
你可以穿二手店的這些。新的這些衣服……
You can wear the thrift shop ones.The new ones...

175
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,040
要先洗一洗
have to be washed first.

176
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,127
遵命，先生！
Yes, sir!

177
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,976
今天下午，對不起
Sorry about this afternoon.

178
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,493
我母親蘇菲去世了。
Sophie's dead.

179
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,201
什麼？
What?

180
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,833
一個月前。癌症。
A month ago. The big "C."

181
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,129
哦，寶貝
Oh, babe.

182
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,142
聯邦調查局來之後，我告訴她我們沒事
I talked to her after the feds came,to tell her we were okay.

183
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,727
她從來沒洩露我們的消息。
She never let on.

184
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,990
我都能看見她和莫裡斯站在那
I can just see her standing there with Morris.

185
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,815
兩個胖胖的老猶太人，前布共產黨……
Two fat old Jews, ex-Bolsheviks...

186
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:23,826
在洗衣房給他們紅尿布（指共產黨後代）的孩子打電話……
talking to their red-diaper baby on a phone from a Laundromat...

187
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,997
而她那時候已經快要去世……
and she's fucking dying.

188
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,541
那女人很愛我。
That lady loved me.

189
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:37,551
去年冬天，當他們安排我母親在芝加哥見我的時候
Last winter, when they arranged for her to meet me in Chicago...

190
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:40,557
她在收到通知的一個小時之內就飛了過來
she flew there on an hour's notice...

191
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,300
一個人，還下著暴風雪
alone, in a blizzard.

192
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,805
她很害怕坐飛機的
She's terrified of flying.

193
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:48,472
她下飛機的時候臉都綠了
She was green when she got off the plane.

194
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,476
我帶她到休息室聊天
I took her over to the lounge to talk...

195
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:55,982
我們坐在角落裡，我說「我希望事情容易一點」（I wish it was easier）
and we sat in a corner and I said,"I wish it was easier. "

196
00:19:56,826 --> 00:20:00,325
她說「應該說『我希望事情容易一點（You wish it were easier）』」
"You wish it were easier," she says.

197
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,989
她竟然在糾正我的語法錯誤……
She's correcting my grammar...

198
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,825
就像我是她教的小孩子一樣
like I'm one of the kids she teaches.

199
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:14,626
現在已經沒有讓我們回去的動力了。
There's nothing left to go back to now.

200
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,848
只有我們和孩子們了There's only us and the boys.

201
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,844
只剩下我們了
We're all that's left.

202
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,557
我們必須……
We must...

203
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,847
我們必須依靠彼此
We have to hang on to each other.

204
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:33,573
我能看他的檔案嗎？
May I see his records?

205
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:35,734
抱歉，我弄丟了
I'm afraid I lost his records.

206
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,866
他們把檔案給我了，我也記得裝上了
They gave them to me,and I know I packed them...

207
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:39,448
可是我就是找不到了
but I just can't find them.

208
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,370
我一直丟東西，是不是？
I'm always losing things, right?

209
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:45,502
我丈夫說，要不是擰上了，我連頭都能丟
My husband says I'd probably lose my head if it weren't screwed on.

210
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,836
但是我可以重新做一份
But I can write for a copy.

211
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:49,916
記得做一份檔案，好嗎？
Make sure to write for those records,okay?

212
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:52,216
你可以選兩節選修課。
You can have two electives.

213
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:55,423
音樂，打字，機械，電腦編程，還是家政？
Music, typing, mechanics, computer programming, or home economics?

214
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,713
音樂。
Music.

215
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,846
- 還有呢？
- 還有……
- And?
- And?

216
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,359
- 家政吧。
- 他爸爸是廚師。
- Home economics.
- His dad's a cook.

217
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:25,663
找個空座位，曼菲爾德先生。
Find an empty seat, Mr. Manfield.

218
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,668
好的，聽著，各位
All right, listen up, everyone.

219
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:12,174
再聽一遍。
Listen again, please.

220
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,224
好的，現在有誰能告訴我這兩段音樂有什麼區別？
Now, can anyone tell me the difference between these two pieces?

221
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,102
你說？
Yes?

222
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,855
一個是流行，另一個是古典
One is pop and the other is classical.

223
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:04,903
至少我知道你不是聾子
At least we know you're not deaf.

224
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,865
你覺得呢，斯伯丁先生？
How about you, Mr. Spaulding?

225
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,736
能不能給我們區分的更深一點？
Could you give us a deeper distinction?

226
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:13,990
第一個很爛……
The first one's bad...

227
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,877
第二個很好。
and the second one's good.

228
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:20,208
這是個觀點，不是事實。
That's a matter of opinion, not a fact.

229
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,466
這屋子裡一定有好幾個人不同意你的看法
I'm sure there are several people in this room who would disagree with you.

230
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,588
你覺得呢，曼菲爾德先生？
How about you, Mr. Manfield?

231
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,716
敢不敢試著說一下？
Would you care to venture a guess?

232
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,400
你沒法跟著貝多芬的音樂跳舞
You can't dance to Beethoven.

233
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,151
很好，曼菲爾德先生。你聽很多貝多芬的音樂？
That's very good, Manfield.Do you listen to much Beethoven?

234
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,617
不，沒有。
No, not really.

235
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,698
那你怎麼聽出這段是貝多芬？
How did you identify this piece?

236
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:54,873
我猜我之前聽過這段吧。
I guess I've heard some.

237
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:59,168
我確定班裡的其他人也能聽出另一個作者
I'm sure the rest of the class can identify the other composer.

238
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,382
說的很對。沒法跟著貝多芬的音樂跳舞。
You're quite correct.abcYou can't dance to Mr. Beethoven.

239
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:05,839
能告訴我為什麼嗎，曼菲爾德先生？
Can you tell me why, Mr. Manfield?

240
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,801
因為貝多芬的這段……
Because the Beethoven piece...

241
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:14,142
沒有一個固定的節奏，或者說拍子
doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo!

242
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:21,110
麥當娜的歌一直都是四四拍
Madonna is 4/4 time all the way through.

243
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:24,534
旋律會變，但是節奏一直不變
The melody changes,abcbut the rhythm is constant.

244
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,412
所以你就可以跟著它跳舞
So you can dance to it.

245
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:30,947
而四重奏，是旋律和節奏都會改變。
The quartet changesboth melodically and rhythmically.

246
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,701
我會再放一遍。聽著。
I'm going to play them again.Listen for this.

247
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,711
曼菲爾德先生
Mr. Manfield.

248
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:51,599
我們得給你找個樂器
We'll have to find an instrument for you.

249
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,806
樂器？
An instrument?

250
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,978
選音樂課的都要在樂團演奏。
Everybody who takes music is required to play in the orchestra.

251
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:00,945
你會什麼樂器嗎？
Do you play something?

252
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,197
鋼琴。
Piano.

253
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,495
彈一段。
Play something.

254
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:36,546
好的，你沒必要去樂團演奏了。
Well, there's one thing you don't have to do, and that's play in the orchestra.

255
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,093
我想聽聽你在我家的斯坦威鋼琴上彈的怎麼樣。
I'd like to hear how you sound on the Steinway I have at home.

256
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,848
出去吧
Get out of here.

257
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:58,572
- 找到工作了，爸爸？
- 找到了，就在城裡。
- Get a job, Dad?
- You betcha I did. Right in town.

258
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,499
- 我是廚師。猜是做什麼菜？
- 意大利菜？
- I'm a cook. Guess which kind?
- Italian?

259
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,790
- 猜對啦。
- 太棒了！
- You got it.
- Radical!

260
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,787
非得這麼說話麼
Do you have to say that?

261
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:11,052
- 從哪拿到這個的？
- 公共圖書館的失物招領處。
- Where'd you get this?
- Public library lost and found.

262
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,760
就在餐廳的轉角處
It's right around the corner from the restaurant.

263
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:16,179
這四月會很冷，我覺得你用得到
April can be cold up here.I thought you might needthese.

264
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:18,847
別讓你這雙拿球棒的手凍裂了。
Keep those slugger hands from cracking.

265
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,596
- 進球隊了麼？
- 嗯
- Did you make the team?
- Yeah.

266
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,846
- 太棒了
- 我有什麼？
- Great.
- What about me?

267
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,559
對不起，孩子。東西都沒有你的號。週末我去電影院試試
Sorry, kid. Nothing in your size. Have to try a movie theater on the weekend.

268
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:29,144
這提醒了我，週六得去砍些柴火
Which reminds me, we have to chop some firewood on Saturday.

269
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,196
哦，爸爸，我明天做這個。明天我不上學。
Oh, Dad, I'll do it tomorrow.I'm not going to school.

270
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:33,400
- 為什麼？
- 他們在拍班級合照
- How come?
- They're taking class pictures.

271
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:34,567
好。
Right.

272
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,372
- 那學校怎麼樣？
- 還不錯
- How is that school?
- Not bad.

273
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:42,458
- 老師知道點你不知道的東西？
- 嗯，他們還不錯。
- Teachers know anything you don't?
- Yeah, they're okay.

274
00:27:42,546 --> 00:27:44,289
你註冊的時候遇到麻煩了嗎？
Did you have any trouble with the registration?

275
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:46,504
今天放學的時候我去見了輔導員。
I had to see the guidance counselor at the end of the day.

276
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:47,754
然後呢？
And?

277
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:50,879
他想知道我要申請哪個大學
He wanted to know what colleges I was applying to.

278
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,091
你告訴他什麼了？
What did you tell him?

279
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,174
呃，我說我還沒決定。
Well, I said I hadn't decided yet.

280
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:58,056
好。就和他們隨便說點什麼，然後忘了吧。
Good. Just tell them something, and forget about it.

281
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:00,185
不然他們會一直偷聽你。
Otherwise they'll keep bugging you.

282
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:03,606
- 你怎麼樣，小東西？
- 我不要胡椒
- How about you, small stuff?
- I don't want peppers.

283
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:13,192
上帝保佑
Bless you.

284
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,412
我們班有個人真的很瘋狂
There's a kid in my class who's really crazy.

285
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,499
你的精神又沒正常到哪去
You're not exactly the poster child for mental health.

286
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:25,162
他記得火車時刻表
He knows train schedules.

287
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,086
你從來不需要知道。你可以在手裡有一份，然後就都知道了。
You never know.It might have come in handy.

288
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:29,751
真的，爸爸。整個國家的他都知道。
Really, Dad. All over the country.

289
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:33,555
他知道火車什麼時候從奧馬哈到佐治亞州的亞特蘭大
He knows what time trains leave from Omaha to Atlanta, Georgia.

290
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:34,716
像這樣的東西
Stuff like that.

291
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:37,349
得認識認識這孩子。你拿著這別針幹什麼呢？
Get to know this kid.What are you doing with that safety pin?

292
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,933
什麼別針？
What safety pin?

293
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,444
- 我找到工作了。
- 真的？
- I got a job.
- Really?

294
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:47,406
告訴我們，親愛的。
Tell us, my dear.

295
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,528
你要怎麼奉獻這個虛假的資本主義經濟？
How are you going to contribute to this false, capitalist economy?

296
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,828
我要做一個米爾頓·克斯維爾醫生的接待員。
I'm going to be a receptionist for a Dr. Milton Cosswell.

297
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:55,948
- 是嗎？
- 對。
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

298
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,077
郵局有個招聘的告示
There was a sign up at the post office.

299
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,079
他不介意付我現金
He doesn't mind paying me in cash.

300
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:02,422
他甚至都沒問為什麼。
He didn't even ask why.

301
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,343
應該是對他避稅還是什麼的有好處吧。
It's probably good for his taxes, or something.

302
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:08,638
不管怎麼樣，有工作意味著如果我們需要，就可以拿點東西來用
Anyway, it means I can pick up supplies, if we need them.

303
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:12,094
他看起來是個好人
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

304
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,351
謝謝媽媽
Mom, thanks.

305
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,109
聽著不錯。看起來我們都得到想要的東西了
Sounds good. Looks like we all got what we wanted.

306
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:53,664
有人在家嗎？
Hello, is anyone home?

307
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,550
有人嗎？
Hello?

308
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,021
你是誰？
Who are you?

309
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,022
我是住這的。那你是誰？
I live here. Who are you?

310
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,940
- 菲利普斯先生是你父親？
- 是。
- Is Mr. Phillips your father?
- Yes.

311
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,161
穿粉色衣服的這是你……
And is this you in the pink-

312
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,491
哦，別想它了。
I've destroyed the negative.

313
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,368
現在你知道我是這的人了，該說說你了
So now we've determined that I belong here. Let's talk about you.

314
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,292
你父親說我可以彈他的鋼琴，而且門是開著的
Your father said I could use the piano. And the door was open.

315
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,871
- 我們有門鈴的
- 我按門鈴了
- We do have a bell.
- I rang the bell.

316
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:30,801
沒人應，我就進來了，對不起。
No one answered, so I came in. I'm sorry.

317
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,677
你在我父親的學校？
You go to the school?

318
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,009
是
Yeah.

319
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:37,348
- 我沒見過你。
- 那是因為我剛來
- I haven't seen you there.
- That's because I just started.

320
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,059
所以你今天怎麼沒去上學？
So how come you're not there?

321
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,774
我昨晚發燒了，我媽讓我呆在家裡
I had a fever last night.My mom made me stay home.

322
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:46,441
- 那你為什麼不呆在家裡？
- 我今天好多了，還很無聊
- Why didn't you?
- I felt better today. And I was bored.

323
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:49,563
你真奇怪。我今天翹課了。
You're strange. I cut.

324
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,700
我可不想和這些非人類一塊拍照。
I didn't feel like having my picture taken with those subhumans.

325
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,780
你很好，你知道
You're very good, you know.

326
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,573
我還可以
I'm okay.

327
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,784
你叫什麼？
What's your name?

328
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,325
- 麥克。
- 我叫羅娜
- Michael.
- I'm Lorna.

329
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,333
我還是走吧
I'd better be going.

330
00:34:03,422 --> 00:34:05,628
- 你從哪來？
- 奧克蘭。
- Where are you from?

331
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,510
- 你生在加州？
- 不，紐約
- You born in California?- No, New York.

332
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,882
真的？
Really?

333
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:13,304
我想去紐約上學，但我媽媽怕我被搶劫
I want to go to school in New York, but my mother's afraid I'll get mugged.

334
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,844
你家經常搬？
Your family move around a lot?

335
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:17,436
不，不是。你彈鋼琴麼？
No, not really. You play?

336
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,472
天哪，不。我可受不了練琴。
God, no. I couldn't stand to practice.

337
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,016
我哥哥是演奏家
My older brother is the virtuoso.

338
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,860
他上耶魯，他做什麼都對。你要去哪個大學？
He's at Yale. He does everything right.Where are you going?

339
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,288
哦，那個啊。我還沒怎麼想過。
Oh, that.I haven't thought about that much.

340
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,372
你還沒怎麼想過？下個學期可就要申請了。
You haven't though about it much? You're going to have to apply next semester.

341
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,577
是麼？
Yeah?

342
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,083
你什麼意思，「是麼」？
What do you mean, "Yeah?"

343
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,922
你看，我真的……真的得走了。
Look, I really... I gotta go.

344
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,051
你很有資格。
You're certifiable.

345
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,054
不用謝。
You're welcome.

346
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:04,436
曼菲爾德先生，我想和你說句話。
Mr. Manfield, I'd like a word with you.

347
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,745
我知道你昨天去了我家。
I understand you had occasion to visit my house yesterday.

348
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,323
我去看你的鋼琴了
I went to look at your piano.

349
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,704
我知道你不只是看看而已。
I understand you did more than look at it.

350
00:35:16,627 --> 00:35:18,952
- 你家裡有鋼琴嗎？
- 沒有，先生
- Do you have a piano at home?
- No, sir.

351
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:21,501
那你怎麼練習？
How do you practice?

352
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:23,545
我不能常練。
I can't much.

353
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,093
你是個很有才華的音樂家，曼菲爾德……
You're a talented musician, Manfield...

354
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:29,553
但你沒有像罪犯一樣（進別人家）的權利。
but that doesn't give you theright to act like a criminal.

355
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:30,970
清楚了嗎？
Is that clear?

356
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:33,551
是的，先生。
Yes, sir.

357
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,182
曼菲爾德？
Manfield?

358
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,148
我們會給你找個鋼琴。
We'll find you a piano.

359
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:52,615
讓我看看，姑娘們。
Now let me see, girls.

360
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,584
謝謝，去隊尾吧。
Thank you. Just go to the back of the line.

361
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:04,424
你很有資格啊。
You are certifiable.

362
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:08,224
這是怎麼回事？開什麼玩笑？你上廚藝課？
What is this? Some sort of smart-ass joke? You're taking cooking?

363
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,637
我想學做菜。
I want to learn how to cook.

364
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:13,594
是啊，對。你有強烈的慾望想學怎麼做Apple Brown Betty（一種用蘋果和麵包屑製成的甜點）。
Yeah, right. You have a burning desire to learn how to make Apple Brown Betty.

365
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,857
你要是這麼想，那你在這幹什麼？
What are you doing here,if you think so highly of it?

366
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,901
他們不讓我學機械……
They wouldn't let me take auto mechanics...

367
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:21,443
我也沒時間把這事告到最高法院。
and I didn't have time to take the issue to the Supreme Court.

368
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:25,067
既然剩下了菲利普斯和曼菲爾德
Now that leaves Phillips and Manfield.

369
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,861
你們可以用最後一張台嗎？
Please, would you take the last booth?

370
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,117
今天的菜譜……
Today's menu...

371
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:35,582
是金槍魚核桃砂鍋
is tuna-walnut casserole.

372
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,915
這大概也算是機械吧
This may be auto mechanics after all.

373
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,125
拿著四杯量的量杯。
Take your four-cup measuring bowl.

374
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,925
你知道，我父親覺得你是切片麵包之外最好的東西
You know, my father thinks you're the best thing since sliced bread.

375
00:36:44,015 --> 00:36:45,924
他可不是這麼對我說的
That's not what he told me.

376
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:47,803
一罐金槍魚
A can of tuna.

377
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,013
聽著，別擔心。別讓他嚇著你。
Listen, don't worry.Don't let him scare you.

378
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,228
如果他覺得你可以演奏，你就可以為所欲為了。
You can do anything if he thinks you can play music.

379
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,059
半杯核桃
Half a cup of walnuts.

380
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:58,269
週六有室內樂演奏會
We're having a chamber music concert Saturday.

381
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,778
無聊的要死，你還得穿的像去葬禮一樣……
And they're boring as hell, you have to dress for a funeral...

382
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:02,361
但是你應該會喜歡。想來嗎？
but you'd probably like it.abcYou want to come?

383
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,444
兩根芹菜
Two stalks of celery.

384
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,289
- 好，我考慮考慮。芹菜。
- 芹菜。
- Yeah, I've got to think about it. Celery.
- Celery.

385
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:09,698
在這。
Here.

386
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:14,541
他被那些資產階級的垃圾引誘了
He's getting seduced by all this bourgeois crap.

387
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,633
- 去他的室內樂
- 那是音樂啊，看在上帝的份上
- Fucking chamber music.
- It's music, for God's sake.

388
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,720
頹廢的，白皮膚的，特權階級的垃圾
Decadent, white-skinned, privileged crap.

389
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:24,556
一大堆人打著領帶穿著連褲襪坐著扶手椅，呆在一塊
Lot of people sitting around in ties and pantyhose in wing chairs...

390
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,635
- 像在你母親家
- 像在我母親家。
- like at your mother's house.
- Like at my mother's house.

391
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:28,057
他不能去。
He's not going.

392
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:30,561
- 誰說的？
- 我說的！
- Says who?
- Says me!

393
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,983
- 我不信。
- 看我的口型：他不能去！
- I don't believe you.
- Read my lips: He's not going.

394
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,478
你什麼時候成了文化部長？
Since when did you become the minister of culture?

395
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:38,482
如果是搖滾演唱會你就讓他去了。
You'd let him go if it was a rock 'n' roll concert.

396
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:40,733
- 對了！我會的。對。
- 難以置信。
- That's right! You bet I would. Yes.
- Unbelievable.

397
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:42,820
你神經錯亂了嗎？
Are you out of your mind?

398
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,781
我不會讓他去的，因為不安全
I'm not letting him go because it's not safe.

399
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,458
他又不至於暴露在整個沃特福德面前
He doesn't have to be on display for the entire community of Waterford.

400
00:37:52,924 --> 00:37:55,082
而且就因為這不是搖滾演唱會
And because it's not rock and roll.

401
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,257
你以為你很可愛，爸爸，但你就是垃圾。
You think you're cute, Dad,but you're full of shit.

402
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:02,931
- 不要對我這樣講話。
- 為什麼？
- Don't talk to me like that.
- Why?

403
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:05,427
我們不應該質疑權威麼？你就是那麼教我的！
Aren't we supposed to question authority? You taught me that!

404
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,602
你以為你是誰？巴頓將軍？
Who do you think you are? General Patton?

405
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,975
為什麼上學對我來說還比去音樂會危險了？
Why is it any more dangerous for me to go to school than it is to go to the concert?

406
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,652
因為在學校還有600個孩子
Because there are 600 other kids at the school.

407
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,486
讓我歇會吧
Give me a break.

408
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,494
你不可以去。
You're not going.

409
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,333
曼菲爾德先生！我們有這樣的享受應該感謝什麼？
Mr. Manfield! To what do we owe this pleasure?

410
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,004
羅娜邀請的我。
Lorna invited me.

411
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:53,848
她通常沒這麼好的審美。
She usually doesn't show such good judgment.

412
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:57,515
我很高興。我想讓你見一些人。
I'm delighted. There's some people I want you to meet.

413
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,260
山姆，這是麥克·曼菲爾德，我和你說過的那個男孩
Sam, this is Michael Manfield,the boy I was telling you about.

414
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,387
- 很高興認識你。
- 你好
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

415
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,807
也許我們可以讓你給我們彈點什麼
Perhaps we can convince you to play something for us.

416
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,977
我什麼都沒準備
I have nothing prepared.

417
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,071
有一天我聽見你在彈勃拉姆斯，真是美
I heard you working on some Brahms the other day. It was perfectly lovely.

418
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,948
第二次幕間休息之後你可以彈一彈
You can play it after the second intermission.

419
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,782
我很樂意，但是我真的要去朋友家接我弟弟
I'd like to, but I really have to go pick up my brother at a friend's house.

420
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:16,829
你可以在走之前彈。
You can play before you have to go.

421
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:17,947
聽著，爸爸，抱歉
Listen, Dad, would you excuse me?

422
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,240
我想帶麥克吃點東西
I'd like to get Michael something to eat.

423
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:21,707
- 希望早點聽到你演奏
- 真是好東西。
- Hope to hear you soon.
- It was really good stuff.

424
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,057
為什麼你不想為他們演奏？
How come you didn't want to play for them?

425
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,182
如果是我自己，我不會考慮。但是你會喜歡的。
Personally, I wouldn't consider it,but you're supposed to love this stuff.

426
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:43,724
沒關係，你不用解釋。莫扎特也是個瘋子。
It's all right. You don't have to explain.Mozart was crazy, too.

427
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,694
- 想上去去我的房間麼？
- 好。
- Want to go up to my room?
- Okay.

428
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,734
好啦。把牛奶喝完。
All right. Finish your milk.

429
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:14,346
抱歉
Excuse me.

430
00:41:16,898 --> 00:41:18,725
吉他就是我的生命。
Guitar is my life.

431
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,402
你很讓人迷惑，你知道
You're very confusing, you know.

432
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,572
誰？我？為什麼？
Who, me? Why?

433
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,827
因為有的時候你那麼直接……
'Cause sometimes you can be so straight...

434
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:38,244
但有的時候，轉過身去你又是那樣的
and then other times, you turn around and you're like that.

435
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:47,172
- 總是說著「是，先生」或者「不是，先生」
- 我很禮貌的
-It's always, "Yes, sir" and "No, sir. "
- I'm polite.

436
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:49,638
- 禮貌很假。
- 不是假。
- Polite is phony.
- It's not phony.

437
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:54,681
- 可以避免衝突。
- 你現在就在做這個麼？
- It avoids confrontation.
- Is that what you're doing now?

438
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,765
你在避免衝突？
You're avoiding confrontation?

439
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,107
你就沒有想說「去他媽的」的時候？
Don't you ever want to say, "Cut the shit"?

440
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:02,153
羅娜！麥克和你在一起嗎？我想讓他出來演奏。
Lorna! Is Michael in there with you? I want him to play.

441
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:07,613
他走了。他去接他弟弟了
He left. He went to pick up his brother.

442
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,160
我以為這是我的房間
I thought this was my room.

443
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,242
你媽媽讓你下樓
Your mother wants you downstairs.

444
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,379
那有棵樹（可以從那出去）。
There's a tree.

445
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,271
鮑威爾太太？可以見醫生了。
Mrs. Powell? The doctor will see you now.

446
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:26,446
我把錢包落在這了嗎？
Did I leave my purse out here?

447
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:29,866
謝謝。
Thank you.

448
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:34,459
你好？
Excuse me?

449
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:36,164
你好！
Excuse me!

450
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:38,843
你有預約嗎？
Do you have an appointment?

451
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,385
沒有。
Nope.

452
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,483
格斯。
Gus!

453
00:43:58,826 --> 00:44:00,783
吃什麼，媽媽？
What's cooking, mama?

454
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:05,829
我看著你，我就能看到你站在密歇根街角……
I look at you, and I can see you standing on the corner of Michigan Avenue...

455
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:09,746
穿著墨西哥式上衣，戴著那瘋癲的銀色東西
in a Mexican blouse and those crazy silver things.

456
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:11,754
大銀耳環
Big silver earrings.

457
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,792
天哪，那是好久以前了
God, that was a long time ago.

458
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:17,590
阿瑟怎麼樣？
How's Artie?

459
00:44:18,473 --> 00:44:19,801
他挺好。
He's okay.

460
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,634
其實他好極了
He's great, actually.

461
00:44:23,645 --> 00:44:26,978
他在佛羅里達的一處有毒垃圾堆放點做了點工作
He did some work in Florida on a toxic waste dump.

462
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:30,192
在這，他組織了個個食品公司
Here, he organized a food co-op...

463
00:44:30,277 --> 00:44:32,150
他還在讓他的餐廳集團化
and he's trying to get his restaurant to unionize.

464
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:34,396
你和阿瑟怎麼樣
And how's you and Artie?

465
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:36,485
我們還好
We're okay.

466
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,158
我是說，你知道，很艱難
I mean, you know, it's hard.

467
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:42,742
我想你。
I think about you.

468
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:46,162
我想你
I think about you.

469
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,333
希望你是安全的
I hope you're safe.

470
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:54,462
你怎麼做到的？
How do you manage this?

471
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:56,090
有房子
Got a house...

472
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:57,926
兩個孩子
two kids.

473
00:44:58,934 --> 00:45:01,472
就像你過著正常人的生活
It's kind of like you're leading a regular life.

474
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:03,890
我很會撒謊
I'm a good liar.

475
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,023
但是我累了
But I'm tired.

476
00:45:10,113 --> 00:45:11,607
媽的
Shit.

477
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:19,778
哦，天
Oh, God.

478
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:28,704
嗨，大廚
Hey, chief.

479
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:31,583
你好
Hello.

480
00:45:32,762 --> 00:45:34,090
你好？
Hello?

481
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,172
這個人開了八百英里來見你
That's all you got to say to this guy that just drove...

482
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,805
你就和他說一句你好？
800 miles out of his way to see you?

483
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:41,682
你看起來好極了
You look great.

484
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,599
為什麼我會感覺這麼不安？
Then how come I feel so uneasy?

485
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:47,060
阿瑟，我們去散步吧。我有事情要告訴你
Artie, let's take a walk.I got stuff to talk to you about.

486
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:48,232
我累了
I'm tired.

487
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:51,986
去吧，保羅。和他散散步。你有12年沒見他了。
Go ahead, Paul. Take a walk with him. You haven't seen him for 12 years.

488
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,418
你他媽的是瘋了！
You're out of your fucking mind!

489
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,511
- 你欠我們的！
- 我他媽的什麼都不欠你們。
- You owe us!
- I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

490
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:14,433
你知道你那混蛋朋友想讓我幹什麼嗎？
Do you know what your asshole friend here wants me to do?

491
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:18,717
搶銀行！你相信麼？他媽的銀行！
Rob a fucking bank! Can you believe it? A fucking bank!

492
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:22,098
他還說那是「政治運動」
A "political action," he calls it.

493
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,313
自由軍佈置給我們這個任務的
We've been assigned this little job by the Liberation Army.

494
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:28,274
別人都對他們有錯誤的印象，以為他們在支持我們……
Who are under the mistaken impression that they've been supporting us...

495
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,025
我們欠他們的！
and we owe them something!

496
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,111
你想讓我的孩子做什麼？
What do they want my kids to do?

497
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:35,576
推翻他媽的總統？
Knock off the fucking president?

498
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:38,455
你想讓我看看你車裡是什麼嗎？
You want to show what you got in your car?

499
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:41,709
沒什麼。我的東西。
Nothing. It's my stuff.

500
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,253
這可不是你給我的印象。
That's not the impression you gave me.

501
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:47,041
看看吧，怎麼樣？
Let's look, shall we?

502
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,385
讓孩子們過來。我想讓他們看看這個。
Get the kids down here.I want them to see this.

503
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,429
這人還他媽是個瘋子！
guy's still a fucking maniac!

504
00:46:51,516 --> 00:46:52,547
閉嘴吧
Just stop it.

505
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:55,726
孩子們！過來！就現在！
Boys! Get down here! Now!

506
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:22,460
我想讓你們知道，我們不動槍
I want you to know guns are not what we're about.

507
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,345
現在，回屋裡去
Now, get back in the house.

508
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,149
你會改變世界的，阿瑟……
You're going to change the world, Artie...

509
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:45,238
就組織一下那幾個小食品公司？
by organizing these little food co-ops?

510
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,906
我要出去。
I'm going out.

511
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,659
你晚上可以留下……
You can stay the night...

512
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:57,914
但等我回來，我可不想看見這些槍在我孩子周圍十公里以內。
but when I get back, I don't want to see these things within 10 miles of my kids.

513
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,185
安妮，我想解釋
Annie, I'd like to explain this.

514
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:22,901
我在聽。
I'm listening.

515
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,527
你知道，我們在地下狀態已經很久了
You know, we've been under a long time.

516
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:32,537
很多不好的事情發生了。很多不好的事情還在發生。
A lot of bad shit has happened. A lot of bad shit keeps happening.

517
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,039
但是整個世界都以為
But we're dead...

518
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:43,002
我們已經死了
as far as the world is concerned.

519
00:48:43,096 --> 00:48:45,587
我們採取一個行動，報紙就埋沒一個
We pull an action and they bury it in the newspapers.

520
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,300
就好像什麼都沒發生過
It's like it didn't happen.

521
00:48:49,103 --> 00:48:51,973
只有在什麼東西或者什麼人被吹走了
The only time the pigs or the media pay attention...

522
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:55,149
那豬一樣的媒體才會引起注意
is when something or somebody gets blown away.

523
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:59,527
好。如果打不敗他們，就加入他們。
Great. If you can't beat them, join them.

524
00:49:00,365 --> 00:49:04,528
你覺得我們採取非暴力，會取得勝利麼？
Do you think we're going to win this by turning the other cheek?

525
00:49:06,372 --> 00:49:08,495
要是能這樣，你怎麼不試試在水上走？
Why don't you try walking on water?

526
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:11,916
你怎麼還不長大呢？我們贏不了的。
Why don't you try growing up? There's nothing to win.

527
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,746
戰爭一結束，它已經結束了。
It was over as soon as the war ended.

528
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:19,381
戰爭沒有結束，安妮。它永遠不會結束。
The war didn't end, Annie.The war ain't never going to end.

529
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:24,511
和政治或者我車裡的貨無關。
This has nothing to do with politics or the merchandise in my car.

530
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,557
只是阿瑟發火了
This is just Artie's pissed.

531
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:31,106
阿瑟發火了……
Artie's pissed...

532
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,608
是因為他嫉妒。
'cause Artie's jealous.

533
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,022
他嫉妒……
And Artie's jealous...

534
00:49:41,536 --> 00:49:43,244
是因為你想要我。
because you want me.

535
00:49:44,706 --> 00:49:46,366
我當然也想要你
And I sure want you.

536
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:52,539
這狀況真糟糕。
That's a bad situation.

537
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:58,095
遲早它們都會爆炸
Sooner or later, they're just going to blow up.

538
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:04,384
你知道，我為你感到遺憾
You know, I feel sorry for you.

539
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,931
真的。
I do.

540
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,597
你46歲了，還像個嬰兒
You're a 46-year-old infant.

541
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:14,771
什麼都得按著你的想法來，是不是？什麼時候都是，什麼地方都是
Everything has to be your way, doesn't it? When you want it, where you want it.

542
00:50:16,908 --> 00:50:18,699
你不是革命者
You're not a revolutionary.

543
00:50:18,785 --> 00:50:23,114
這比玩槍或者玩弄自己要求更高
That requires more than playing with guns or with yourself.

544
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,912
需要同情心，需要紀律
It requires compassion, discipline.

545
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:30,245
你在評判我麼？
Are you judging me?

546
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:39,213
女士，你在評判你自己。
You judge yourself, lady.

547
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:44,889
你過得就像那種傻乎乎的中產階級的郊區家庭主婦
You're living like some kind of silly-ass, middle-class, suburban housewife.

548
00:50:48,234 --> 00:50:49,894
你活在謊言之中……
You're living a lie...

549
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:52,895
就像你說的那樣。
just like you said.

550
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:59,903
你為什麼不把諾曼·洛克威爾一家供出來？
Why don't you take this little Norman Rockwell family and turn them in?

551
00:51:01,248 --> 00:51:03,121
聯邦調查局會很樂意抓到他們的。
The feds would be glad to get them.

552
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:05,912
這樣你就可以脫身了。
And then you could get the fuck out.

553
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:10,919
我倒希望我能。
I wish I could.

554
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:15,089
出去吧。
Now get out.

555
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:44,002
你還好麼，媽媽
Are you okay, Mom?

556
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:46,870
嗯。
Yeah.

557
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:49,128
好。
Fine.

558
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:07,689
睡覺吧。
Go to bed.

559
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,245
我不是保羅！我不是保羅！我是……
I am not Paul. I am not Paul! I am-

560
00:53:00,462 --> 00:53:03,416
- 進來，保羅。
- 我不是保羅！
- Paul, come in.
- I'm not Paul.

561
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:04,961
我是阿瑟
I'm Arthur.

562
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:07,756
別叫我「保羅」。我是阿瑟。
Don't call me "Paul. " I am Arthur.

563
00:53:08,304 --> 00:53:11,139
我是阿瑟·艾利·波普！
I am Arthur Eli Pope!

564
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:14,549
- 爸爸怎麼了？
- 他剛喝多了。
- What's the matter with Dad?
- He's just had a lot to drink.

565
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:19,603
1944年7月16日出生在紐約州的普拉茨堡！
Born in Plattsburg, New York, July 16, 1944!

566
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:22,642
美國公民……我母親……
A US citizen. My mother's...

567
00:53:23,363 --> 00:53:25,688
娘家姓是希爾伯維茨。
maiden name is Silbowitz.

568
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:29,448
我父親真名是波波夫。莫裡斯·波波夫。
My father's real name is Popov.Morris Popov.

569
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:33,456
我駕駛證號碼是4-3-5-7...
My driver's license number is 4-3-5-7...

570
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,370
1-1。
1-1.

571
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:39,206
我入伍時候的號碼是M-S-8-9...
My draft number is M-S-8-9...

572
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:42,963
- 3-5-8-4.
- 好了。
-3-5-8-4.
- It's okay.

573
00:53:43,968 --> 00:53:45,960
我叫波普。
My name is Pope.

574
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:47,210
沒事了。
It's okay.

575
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,537
你說要散步，又不是遠足。
You said walk, not hike.

576
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,877
- 你累了？
- 不是。
- Are you tired?
- No.

577
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,050
- 很美。
- 是啊。
-It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

578
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:36,390
你知道，當你約我的時候我真的很驚訝
You know, I was really surprised when you called me.

579
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:38,766
為什麼？
Why?

580
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,062
我不確定你是不是喜歡我
I wasn't sure if you liked me or not.

581
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,780
有的時候你那麼……
Sometimes you're so...

582
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:53,618
我也不確定你是不是也很喜歡我。
I'm not too sure if you like me too much, either.

583
00:54:55,172 --> 00:54:59,335
相信吧。我可不會跟著一個我不喜歡的人走上十英里
Take it on faith. I usually don't follow people I don't like for 10 miles...

584
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:00,920
一直走到樹林中間
into the middle of the woods.

585
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,505
你怎麼這麼生氣？
Why are you so angry?

586
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:05,090
那是風趣，不是生氣
That's wit, not anger.

587
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:09,054
- 你嚇到很多人。
- 除了你還有誰？
- You scare a lot of people.
- Who, besides you?

588
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:15,482
很多人嚇到我。
A lot of people scare me.

589
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:17,193
誰嚇到你？
Who scares you?

590
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:25,244
像我父母一樣和善的人
People who are nice, like my parents.

591
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:28,907
和善的人有什麼錯？
What's wrong with being nice?

592
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:31,576
這樣說吧。
Let's put it like this.

593
00:55:32,504 --> 00:55:34,911
我母親真的很好。
My mother is really nice.

594
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:38,550
她從來不做任何錯事或者刻薄的事
She never does anything wrong or mean.

595
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,467
她甚至把舊衣服給僕人
She even gives her old clothe to the maid...

596
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:45,842
但她真的不想認識她
but she doesn't really want to know her.

597
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:48,605
十年裡她連貝蒂的丈夫都沒見過
In 10 years,she's never even seen Betty's husband.

598
00:55:49,815 --> 00:55:52,306
他來接她的時候都在車裡等著
He waits in the car when he comes to pick her up.

599
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:57,397
你父親一定不像這樣
Your father's sure not like that.

600
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,614
為什麼？因為他在課上放麥當娜的歌？
Why? Because he plays Madonna in class?

601
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:02,536
他除了知道你彈琴很棒，還知道什麼？
What does he know about you, except that you're good on the piano?

602
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:06,323
他們只看到他們想看的東西，把別的都屏蔽掉
They see what they want to see,and they block out everything else...

603
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:08,824
尤其是可能不太好的東西
especially if it might not be nice.

604
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:12,128
他們好像並不很習慣你的方式
They don't seem to get in your way much.

605
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:15,584
我父母？他們的方式就是不相信我真正的樣子
My parents? It's just their way of not believing who I really am.

606
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,333
他們覺得最終我會變成
They think that eventually,I'll turn back into the little girl...

607
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,384
鋼琴上的照片裡那穿著粉色裙子的小女孩
in the pink dress that's in the picture on the piano.

608
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:25,889
那你覺得呢？
And what do you think?

609
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,307
你真的想知道？
You really want to know?

610
00:56:28,566 --> 00:56:32,398
你覺得我會去紐約學寫作
I think that I'll go to New York and learn to write...

611
00:56:32,654 --> 00:56:34,979
每個聖誕節回家
and that I'll come home every Christmas...

612
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,075
大家都對我很禮貌
and everyone will be really polite.

613
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:41,236
聽起來沒那麼壞。
That's doesn't sound so bad.

614
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:44,989
也許是，但是我還沒真正在紐約
Maybe not, but I'm not in New York yet.

615
00:56:51,424 --> 00:56:52,704
那你呢？
So what about you?

616
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:56,295
我完全不瞭解你
I don't know a thing about you.

617
00:56:56,388 --> 00:56:59,721
你可能會完好地從宙斯的腦袋裡鑽出來（指雅典娜）
You might as well have sprung full-grown out of the head of Zeus.

618
00:57:00,393 --> 00:57:02,551
那你父母呢？奧茲和哈里特？（電影《奧茲和哈里特的冒險》，奧茲和哈里特生活在數字時代）
Who are your parents? Ozzie and Harriet?

619
00:57:02,895 --> 00:57:04,555
是啊，有時候是這樣
Yeah, sometimes.

620
00:57:05,398 --> 00:57:07,723
我是不是得去見見他們，看看你為什麼這麼完美？
Do I get to meet them and see how you came out so perfect?

621
00:57:07,817 --> 00:57:09,275
我的意思是，這樣才公平
I mean, it seems only fair.

622
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:12,483
我讓你看我的，你讓我看你的
I showed you mine, you show me yours.

623
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:20,403
我猜這就結束休息了吧
I guess this is the end of the rest stop.

624
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:25,578
我說什麼來著？
What did I say?

625
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:30,331
我以為下面會好一些
I thought it would be nicer down here.

626
00:57:32,094 --> 00:57:34,763
你沒傳達太多信息
You don't transmit too much information.

627
00:57:35,598 --> 00:57:36,629
什麼？
What?

628
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:40,016
我說，你沒傳達太多信息
I said, you don't transmit too much information.

629
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,216
對不起。
Sorry.

630
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,273
你夏天要幹什麼？
What are you doing over the summer?

631
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:49,609
我在加油站找了份工作
I have a job pumping gas.

632
00:57:49,954 --> 00:57:52,787
你終於讓最高法院聽你的了，嗯？
You finally got the Supreme Court to hear your case, huh?

633
00:57:55,793 --> 00:57:57,286
你呢？
What about you?

634
00:57:58,629 --> 00:57:59,956
不知道。
I don't know.

635
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:04,457
你覺得在這更好？
You thought it'd be nicer over here?

636
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:07,666
嗯
Yeah.

637
00:58:16,979 --> 00:58:18,353
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

638
00:58:21,483 --> 00:58:24,435
找點什麼送我媽媽生日禮物
I'm looking for something for my mom's birthday.

639
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:28,028
你的意思是說，萬一有人偶爾在沙灘上丟了
You mean, in case somebody happened to leave...

640
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:29,938
一個Cuisinart（美國廚具品牌）的東西或者一個鑽石戒指？
a Cuisinart or a diamond ring lying on the beach?

641
00:58:30,324 --> 00:58:33,489
是啊，那就行。必須得是你做的，或者是你找到的東西。
Yeah, that would qualify. It has to be omething either you make or find.

642
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:36,113
- 她生日是什麼時候？
- 下周。
- When's her birthday?
- Next week.

643
00:58:58,057 --> 00:58:59,550
真美。
That's beautiful.

644
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:03,386
給你媽媽的。
It's for your mother.

645
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:07,558
你送給她。
You give it to her.

646
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,307
好
Okay.

647
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:16,899
在那一定更好。
It must be nicer over there.

648
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,317
過來，切這些。
Here, chop these.

649
00:59:31,129 --> 00:59:34,212
不對，不對，不對。看。你到一邊去。
No, no, no. Watch. Move.

650
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:36,540
拿著刀……
You hold the knife...

651
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,791
就這麼做。
and you just do that.

652
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:40,545
很乾淨。我試試
That's neat. Let me try.

653
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:45,131
不，不。我是個素食者，我可不想你把你的小手指頭切到菜裡去。
No, no. I'm a vegetarian. I don't want pieces of tiny little fingers in my stew.

654
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:46,552
這。你來攪拌。
Here. You stir.

655
00:59:49,062 --> 00:59:50,852
你在等誰嗎？
Were you expecting someone?

656
00:59:59,446 --> 01:00:00,476
嗨。
Hi.

657
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:03,400
我是羅娜。
I'm Lorna.

658
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:06,317
麥克邀請了我。
Michael invited me.

659
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,487
好吧，進來吧
Well, come in.

660
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:16,912
你朋友在這
Your friend's here.

661
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:19,452
嗨
Hi.

662
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,257
- 嗨。
- 我可以幫忙麼？
- Hi.
- Can I help?

663
01:00:24,635 --> 01:00:26,959
不用，不用，沒關係。謝謝。
No. No, it's okay. Thank you.

664
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:28,964
你切到手指了。
You cut your finger.

665
01:00:29,056 --> 01:00:30,086
是啊
Yeah.

666
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,424
這是你女朋友？
Is this your girlfriend?

667
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:34,593
嗨，我是史蒂芬。
Hi, I'm Stephen.

668
01:00:37,606 --> 01:00:40,558
真好吃，寶貝。完全超出你的水平
That was delicious, babe.You outdid yourself.

669
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,982
為我自己的安格魯-撒克遜教徒準備的朝聖食物。
This pilgrim food for my very own WASP.

670
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,312
但是你得原諒我，親愛的
But you must forgive me, my darling.

671
01:00:46,405 --> 01:00:48,894
我沒法做出這種果凍模具
I couldn't get myself to make one of those Jell-O molds.

672
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,401
這次就原諒你了
You're forgiven this time.

673
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:54,983
現在，（法語）
And now, for the pi鎗e de r閟istance.

674
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:58,412
- 我來，爸爸
- 你被逮捕了
- Let me, Dad.
- You're under arrest.

675
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:10,414
看看，你弄得肚臍那到處都是
Look at this.You got it all over your bellybutton.

676
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:12,168
看看
Look at that.

677
01:01:12,637 --> 01:01:16,300
哦天哪。我老得都能把這房子弄著火。
Oh, God. I'm old enough to set the house on fire.

678
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:42,494
抱歉，我以為你媽媽叫辛西婭。
I'm sorry, I thought your mother's name was Cynthia.

679
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,822
過生日的時候我們都叫山姆
On birthdays, we're all Sam.

680
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,534
這是我們家小小的傳統……
It's a little family tradition...

681
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:50,289
是因為我1968年那次超棒的用迷幻劑的經歷
resulting from a particularly good LSD trip I took in 1968.

682
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:55,126
再來點酒？
More wine?

683
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:59,510
- 你能讓我歇會麼？
- 在歐洲，小孩子就能喝酒。
- Would you give me a break?
- In Europe, kids drink wine.

684
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:03,924
在我給「匿名酗酒者（美國一家幫助戒酒的機構）」打電話（指喝醉）之前，把給你媽媽的禮物拿來。
Get your mother her present before I call Alcoholics Anonymous.

685
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,263
謝謝
Thanks.

686
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:22,864
這就是我想要的
It's just what I wanted.

687
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,275
- 真的？
- 千真萬確
- Really?
- Absolutely.

688
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,414
那是什麼，蝴蝶？
What is that, a butterfly?

689
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,787
不是，是個鯨魚，當做禮物了
No, it's a whale of a present.

690
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,042
- 謝謝
- 我會彈奏它的
- Thanks.- I'll play it for you sometime.

691
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,500
這是羅娜的禮物
This is from Lorna.

692
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,012
真美
That's beautiful.

693
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,597
謝謝你，羅娜
Thank you, Lorna.

694
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,684
我的禮物，等會給你
Mine, you get later.

695
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:05,357
你保證
You bet.

696
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,692
沒問題
On your feet!

697
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:09,276
我來幫忙。
Let me help.

698
01:03:11,536 --> 01:03:13,029
我喜歡她。
I like her.

699
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:14,199
嗯？
Yeah?

700
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:16,613
- 我也喜歡她。
- 我知道
- I like her, too.- I know.

701
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,586
你確定這是菲利普斯家的孩子？
You sure this is the Phillips' kid?

702
01:04:14,843 --> 01:04:17,415
你在醫院沒被掉包吧，嗯？
They didn't switch you at the hospital,or anything, did they?

703
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:18,808
你知道，我不敢想像他們有多不可理喻。
You know, I can't believe how incredible they are.

704
01:05:19,151 --> 01:05:24,310
你知道如果我給我媽媽一個貝殼當做生日禮物，她會怎麼做？
Do you know what my mother would do if I gave her a shell for her birthday?

705
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:26,397
沒關係吧
They're okay.

706
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:30,158
那就是你，害怕承認自己
That's you all over,afraid to commit yourself.

707
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:32,903
我以為這就是我
I thought it was just me.

708
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,957
和你在一起我很開心
I'm very happy with you.

709
01:05:41,588 --> 01:05:43,828
我也是
I'm very happy with you, too.

710
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,174
沒關係，我想這樣
It's okay, I want to.

711
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:38,930
- 你沒去上廚藝課
- 你注意到了。
- You weren't in cooking.
- You noticed.

712
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:41,435
- 你去哪了？
- 我翹課了
- Where were you?- I cut.

713
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:45,527
- 為什麼？
- 我不想見你。
- Why?- I didn't want to see you.

714
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:11,344
曼菲爾德，我能和你說幾句話麼
Manfield, could I talk to you for a minute?

715
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:19,020
你沒必要這麼緊張。就算你做了錯事……
You don't have to look so anxious.If you've done something wrong...

716
01:08:19,105 --> 01:08:22,140
我也不知道。我只是想知道你對大學的計劃。
I don't know about it. I just want to talk to you about your college plans.

717
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:26,229
我想休息一年，也許去歐洲旅行，聽聽音樂。
I was thinking of taking a year off, maybe traveling to Europe, listening to music.

718
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,818
我不能要求你做什麼，但是我覺得你應該申請大學
I can't tell you what to do, but I think you ought to make an application, anyway.

719
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,862
你可以推遲入學的
You can always postpone entry.

720
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:34,320
我想讓你考慮考慮申請朱利亞德（紐約一所藝術學院）
I'd like you to consider applying to Juilliard.

721
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,951
提前錄取
Early admission.

722
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:43,703
我看了你成績的檔案，被錄取應該沒問題
I looked at your academic records.You should have no trouble getting in.

723
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,283
不過，剩下的呢？
Where's the rest of it, by the way?

724
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:47,417
你的檔案裡沒有原先的學校的。
There's nothing in your file from your old school.

725
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:51,289
我們搬家的時候弄丟了。
It was lost when we moved.

726
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:54,127
找回來的時候，我想看看。
When it comes through, I'd like to see it.

727
01:08:55,387 --> 01:08:57,378
同時，你看看這個。
In the meantime, you look at that.

728
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:04,598
我會樂意給你寫推薦信的。
I'd be happy to write you a letter of recommendation.

729
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:06,556
謝謝
Thank you.

730
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:12,057
看完之後還給我
Get back to me when you've looked at it.

731
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:19,578
你不和我說話
You wouldn't talk to me.

732
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,417
現在，起床
Now, get up.

733
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,289
下樓，從後門出去
Go down the stairs and out the back door.

734
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,296
悄悄的
Be quiet.

735
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:39,972
我就在你後面。
I'll be right behind you.

736
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:54,359
我光著腳呢
I'm barefoot.

737
01:11:26,857 --> 01:11:28,018
坐下
Sit down.

738
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:38,532
我在幹嘛？
What am I doing?

739
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,409
我就是想和你說話。
I just wanted to talk to you.

740
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:48,991
你那天在學校不聽我講。
You wouldn't listen, the other day at school.

741
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:59,751
我那天晚上沒和你在一起，不是因為我不想。
I couldn't stay with you that night. Not because I didn't want to.

742
01:12:09,563 --> 01:12:11,887
如果你想回去，對我來說沒什麼。
If you want to go back, it's fine with me.

743
01:12:13,774 --> 01:12:15,979
- 你是個笨蛋。
- 不。
- You're a bully.- No.

744
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:21,028
我說了謊。
I'm a liar.

745
01:12:24,576 --> 01:12:26,234
我真名不是麥克
My name isn't Michael.

746
01:12:28,705 --> 01:12:29,818
是丹尼。
It's Danny.

747
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:35,079
我父母是阿瑟和安妮·波普
My parents are Arthur and Annie Pope.

748
01:12:37,504 --> 01:12:41,832
1971年他們因為讓汽油彈實驗室爆炸，和聯邦調查局惹上了麻煩
They're in trouble with the FBl for blowing up a napalm lab in 1971.

749
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,797
有一個人差點就死了
There was a man who was almost killed.

750
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:45,793
那是個看門人，當時不該在那的
A janitor,abcwho wasn't supposed to be there.

751
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:48,803
我們在所有生日蛋糕上都寫「山姆」
We put "Sam" on the birthday cakes, on all the birthday cakes...

752
01:12:49,682 --> 01:12:52,136
是因為每到一個地方，我們就換新名字
because we change our names every time we move.

753
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:58,269
從我兩歲起，就一直這樣了
I've been doing this since I was two.

754
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:01,140
我不知道別的辦法。
I don't know any other way.

755
01:13:01,817 --> 01:13:05,184
我只是想告訴你我很抱歉
I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry.

756
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,572
我想解釋我為什麼說不了太多事
I wanted to explain why I can't talk about a lot of things.

757
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:15,778
比如大學。我不能去上大學。我不能離開他們。
Like college. I can't go to college.I can't leave them.

758
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,325
我還想告訴你……
And I wanted to tell you...

759
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:24,209
我為什麼不能和你在一起。
why I couldn't be with you.

760
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:28,047
不能讓你不知道。我不想對你說謊。
Not without your knowing.I didn't want to lie to you.

761
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:33,757
現在我沒權利和你說這些的
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

762
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:36,680
對你，對他們，都很危險。
It's dangerous for you,and it's dangerous for them.

763
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:41,057
對不起，我只是控制不住自己
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

764
01:13:41,561 --> 01:13:45,142
你想做什麼都可以做，你可以告訴你爸爸。我不介意
You can do what you want to. You can tell your dad anything. I don't care.

765
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:47,974
我只是想要你知道
I just needed you to know.

766
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:51,976
我不知道我在做什麼
I don't know what I'm doing.

767
01:13:54,824 --> 01:13:56,067
我愛你
And I love you.

768
01:14:00,663 --> 01:14:01,990
我愛你
I love you.

769
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,310
那我要叫你什麼？
What do I call you?

770
01:14:35,402 --> 01:14:38,437
麥克。什麼都不用變
Michael. Nothing changes.

771
01:14:39,364 --> 01:14:41,688
他們真的不想讓你上大學麼？
They really don't want you to go to school, huh?

772
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:46,110
我們還沒有談
We haven't talked about it.

773
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:48,661
- 我不能問他們
- 為什麼不？
- I can't ask them.- Why not?

774
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,958
那就意味著拆散整個家庭，我再也見不到他們。
It would mean breaking up the family,not seeing them again.

775
01:14:54,419 --> 01:14:56,375
他們除了我們，什麼都沒有
They don't have anything else.

776
01:14:57,881 --> 01:15:02,874
我不能相信他們會要求你耗費自己的生命去陪著他們
I can't believe that they'd want you to give up your whole life to stay with them.

777
01:15:03,469 --> 01:15:05,793
和他們談。他們會理解的。
Talk to them. They'll understand.

778
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,590
你有很多秘密，不是麼
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

779
01:15:14,354 --> 01:15:16,144
現在你又多了一個。
Now you have another one.

780
01:15:57,809 --> 01:15:59,302
去和羅娜約會了？
Been to see Lorna?

781
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:10,855
我喜歡她。
I like that one.

782
01:16:11,322 --> 01:16:12,980
她很活潑
She's full of beans.

783
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:17,526
你真心喜歡她，不是麼
You really like her, don't you?

784
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,110
聰明的人總是最好的
The smart ones are always the best.

785
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:25,080
你和她睡了麼？
Are you sleeping with her?

786
01:16:26,794 --> 01:16:28,868
- 嗯。
- 好。
- Yeah.
- Okay.

787
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:33,298
快去，睡覺去。明天還要上學。
Go ahead, hit the sack.You got school tomorrow.

788
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:44,894
你在停止專業鋼琴之後
How long have you been playing violin...

789
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:48,155
演奏了多久小提琴？
after you stopped playing seriously piano?

790
01:17:48,826 --> 01:17:50,105
大概五年
About five years.

791
01:17:50,202 --> 01:17:51,992
什麼時候來美國的？
When did you come to the States?

792
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,109
1980年
In 1980.

793
01:17:54,206 --> 01:17:56,280
好的，非常感謝
All right. Thank you very much.

794
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,874
曼菲爾德先生，我們準備好面試你了。
Mr. Manfield. We're ready for you now.

795
01:20:31,348 --> 01:20:33,802
你說你和誰學的？
Who did you say you studied with?

796
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:36,976
愛德華·菲利普斯
Edward Phillips.

797
01:20:37,061 --> 01:20:39,467
- 在哪？
- 沃特福德。
- Where was this?- Waterford.

798
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:42,305
- 新澤西？
- 對
- New Jersey?- That's right.

799
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,807
我們好像沒有你的學校檔案
We seem not to have all your school records.

800
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:50,863
我以前的學校有，但是丟了
There was a school fire at my old school, and the records were lost.

801
01:20:51,074 --> 01:20:53,563
今年我們剛搬到新澤西
We only moved to New Jersey this year.

802
01:20:53,993 --> 01:20:58,487
所以你和菲利普斯先生只學了很短時間
So you've only studied with Mr. Phillipsfor a short time.

803
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:00,241
是的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

804
01:21:00,332 --> 01:21:02,323
你還和誰學過？
Who else have you worked with?

805
01:21:04,545 --> 01:21:07,165
很多不同的，但沒有一個這麼重要
A lot of different people.No one important.

806
01:21:07,588 --> 01:21:09,579
我們經常搬家
We move a lot.

807
01:21:09,882 --> 01:21:13,166
你必須給我們你的SAT成績，還有……
You'll have to supply us with SAT scores and...

808
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,010
我們必須要那些檔案
we'll have to have those records.

809
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:21,672
曼菲爾德先生。
Mr. Manfield.

810
01:21:22,519 --> 01:21:23,549
哦，對不起
Oh, sorry.

811
01:21:25,564 --> 01:21:29,014
你很有才華，你知道
You are very talented, you know.

812
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:33,145
謝謝，太太
Thank you, ma'am.

813
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:42,244
給帕特森太太的芝士比薩。
A cheese pizza for Mrs. Patterson.

814
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:45,336
帕特森太太沒訂比薩。
I don't think Mrs. Patterson ordered a pizza.

815
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:50,841
這是莫裡山68434號麼?
Is this Murray Hill 68434?

816
01:22:51,057 --> 01:22:52,929
- 是
- 那有人定了比薩。
- Yes.- Someone ordered it.

817
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,590
稍等。

818
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:08,025
這比薩是怎麼回事？

819
01:23:09,699 --> 01:23:11,489
你訂了一個。
You ordered one.

820
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,409
我沒有。
I didn't.

821
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:18,239
那你得付錢麼？
Will you have to pay for it?

822
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,946
不，我得吃
No, I'll have to eat it.

823
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:36,422
我真的不在乎。等等。你下次不能敲門麼？
I really don't care. Hold on.Could you knock next time?

824
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:39,296
- 對不起。
- 聽著，我得走了。嗯。拜拜
- I'm sorry.- Listen, I have to go. Yeah. Bye.

825
01:23:42,811 --> 01:23:45,265
我在想麥克有沒有和你提到……
I was wondering if Michael had ever mentioned anything to you...

826
01:23:45,356 --> 01:23:46,386
他以前的學校
about his old school.

827
01:23:46,732 --> 01:23:47,929
不多。怎麼問這個？
Not much. Why?

828
01:23:48,025 --> 01:23:49,850
都沒把他的檔案寄來。
They never sent his records.

829
01:23:51,028 --> 01:23:52,106
然後呢？
So?

830
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:54,271
我打電話給學校，說沒有他的檔案。
I called the school.They have no record of him.

831
01:23:54,364 --> 01:23:57,529
有可能是電腦刪掉了，或者什麼的。
They probably got eaten by a computer,or something.

832
01:23:58,368 --> 01:24:01,320
在肯塔基州的藍山，沒有電腦的
They don't have a computer in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

833
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,536
你研究他做什麼？
What are you on his case for?

834
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,866
- 我們對他一無所知。
- 嗯，他以前是個殺人犯
- We know nothing about him.- So, he's an axe murderer.

835
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:13,205
我說，拜託！我以為他是你教過的音樂最好的學生。
I mean, come on! I thought he was the best music student you ever had.

836
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,131
他是，但這解釋不了他檔案丟失的問題
He is, but that doesn't explain his missing records.

837
01:24:17,468 --> 01:24:20,136
如果你想知道他究竟是誰，為什麼不直接找他談？
If you want to know who he is, why don't you talk to him?

838
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,588
他是個人！
He's a person!

839
01:24:24,391 --> 01:24:26,465
他不是電腦裡的數據
He's not a computer printout!

840
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:35,765
能不能把門關上？
Would you please close the door?

841
01:24:43,992 --> 01:24:45,022
- 曼菲爾德太太？
- 是
- Mrs. Manfield?- Yes.

842
01:24:45,244 --> 01:24:46,986
- 謝謝你能來
- 您好
- Thank you for coming.- How do you do?

843
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:49,153
- 要不要來點咖啡？
- 不，謝謝
- Would you like some coffee?- No, thanks.

844
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:56,166
我想和您聊聊麥克
I want to talk to you about Michael.

845
01:24:56,712 --> 01:24:59,830
我不想在學校見，這樣他就不知道我們談過
I didn't want to meet at school,because he doesn't know we're talking.

846
01:24:59,923 --> 01:25:01,795
但是他最近很失落也很緊張
But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

847
01:25:01,883 --> 01:25:04,123
我以為可能是家裡出了點事
I thought maybe there was something at home.

848
01:25:05,553 --> 01:25:06,583
沒有
No.

849
01:25:07,472 --> 01:25:11,550
我知道這是私人事情。我只是覺得如果我知道的話，我能幫得上忙。
I know these things are private. I just thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

850
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:13,765
但是真的什麼事都沒有。
But there isn't anything. Really.

851
01:25:15,228 --> 01:25:17,349
也許他擔心朱利亞德。
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

852
01:25:18,982 --> 01:25:20,012
朱利亞德？
Juilliard?

853
01:25:21,192 --> 01:25:22,815
您知道他的計劃？
You know about his plans?

854
01:25:23,403 --> 01:25:26,023
- 是啊，當然
- 您不反對？
- Yeah, sure.- And you don't object?

855
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:27,561
不反對
No.

856
01:25:28,574 --> 01:25:31,028
他們對他的面試印象深刻
They were very impressed with his audition.

857
01:25:33,036 --> 01:25:36,154
他們打算一拿到他的檔案就錄取他
They're prepared to take him, just as soon as they get his records.

858
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,537
那時候他就得去了，是不是？
He'll have to go then, won't he?

859
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,583
是不是經濟困難？
Is there a financial problem?

860
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:47,828
我們可不像洛克菲勒家族那麼有錢。
We're not the Rockefellers.

861
01:25:48,342 --> 01:25:50,298
他可能會擔心錢的問題
He could be worried about that.

862
01:25:50,385 --> 01:25:52,008
我們還過得下去。
We always manage.

863
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,847
有獎學金的。他可以拿
There are scholarships. He could get one.

864
01:25:55,056 --> 01:25:56,549
他很有才華
He's very talented.

865
01:25:56,891 --> 01:26:00,056
我們也許不富裕，但我們關心孩子
We may not have a lot, but we care about our kids.

866
01:26:00,144 --> 01:26:01,637
我當然知道您關心
I'm sure you do.

867
01:26:02,312 --> 01:26:06,178
我只是想知道他有過專業的老師麼？
I was just wondering,has he ever had a serious teacher?

868
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:09,141
他是怎樣達到這個水平的？
How has he gotten this far?

869
01:26:09,236 --> 01:26:10,777
我不知道
I don't know.

870
01:26:10,862 --> 01:26:14,443
他在這學一點，那學一點。我們經常搬家。為什麼問這個
He's picked up a little here and there.We move around a lot. Why?

871
01:26:14,574 --> 01:26:17,573
我給藍山打了電話，沒有麥克·曼菲爾德的檔案
I called Blue Hill and they have no record of Michael Manfield.

872
01:26:22,831 --> 01:26:25,237
那是因為他在那註冊的時候沒有用曼菲爾德這個名字
That's because he wasn't registered there under Manfield.

873
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:27,870
你看，我以前結過婚，保羅收養了他
See, I was married before,and Paul adopted him.

874
01:26:27,961 --> 01:26:30,877
但是直到今年才能合法地跟他的姓
But it took until just this year to adopt his name legally.

875
01:26:30,964 --> 01:26:33,632
在藍山，他跟的是我前夫的姓
He's under my old husband's name at Blue Hill.

876
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:37,081
沒有這些檔案，他不能完成申請
He can't finish his application without those records.

877
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:38,505
我會拿到的
I'll get them.

878
01:26:38,763 --> 01:26:41,679
你必須得拿，因為他們只把檔案給家長……
You'll have to, because they won't release them to anyone but a parent-

879
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:44,170
我說了，我會拿到的。行了麼？
I said, I'll get them. All right?

880
01:26:46,352 --> 01:26:48,010
- 現在，我得走了
- 好的，當然
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Yeah, sure.

881
01:28:58,596 --> 01:29:00,089
怎麼了，媽媽？
What's wrong, Mom?

882
01:29:02,058 --> 01:29:03,136
沒什麼
Nothing.

883
01:29:06,395 --> 01:29:07,888
我愛你
I just love you.

884
01:29:25,913 --> 01:29:27,821
我要去接你爸爸
I've got to pick up your father.

885
01:29:40,467 --> 01:29:44,249
喜歡麼？我把貨車賣了，買了這個。我覺得這樣更實際一點。
Do you like it? I traded the van in for it.Thought it'd be more practical.

886
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,802
而且，這讓他們一直猜測
Besides, it keeps them guessing.

887
01:29:57,316 --> 01:29:58,725
怎麼了，山姆？
What's up, Sam?

888
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:00,684
別那麼叫我
Don't call me that.

889
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:02,808
好吧
Okay.

890
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:09,483
丹尼去申請大學了
Danny's applied to college.

891
01:30:11,996 --> 01:30:13,074
在哪？
Where?

892
01:30:13,372 --> 01:30:14,699
朱利亞德
Juilliard.

893
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:16,952
你怎麼知道的？
How do you know?

894
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:19,531
菲利普斯。他想讓他去
Phillips. He wants him to go.

895
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:24,838
他為什麼不離咱們家的事遠點？
Why doesn't he keep his goddamn nose out of our business?

896
01:30:24,924 --> 01:30:26,915
因為他覺得他很有才華。
Because he thinks he's talented.

897
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:29,926
丹尼告訴你這些了麼？
Has Danny told you about any of this?

898
01:30:31,263 --> 01:30:32,293
沒有。
No.

899
01:30:36,727 --> 01:30:38,268
我們要怎麼做？
What are we going to do?

900
01:30:38,812 --> 01:30:40,139
媽的
Shit.

901
01:30:40,814 --> 01:30:43,564
去他媽的！
Goddamn fucking shit!

902
01:30:44,316 --> 01:30:45,643
他為什麼不能去上大學？
Why can't he go?

903
01:30:45,943 --> 01:30:47,851
因為如果他去了，我們就再也見不到他了。
Because we'll never see him again if he does.

904
01:30:47,945 --> 01:30:50,232
為什麼不能？我們可以安排和他見面。
Why? We could arrange to meet him.

905
01:30:51,114 --> 01:30:52,441
你想這樣？
Is that what you want?

906
01:30:52,532 --> 01:30:57,192
在機場休息室見十分鐘，然後聯邦調查局一輩子跟在他屁股後面？
Ten minutes at an airport lounge, and the FBl all over his ass the rest of the time?

907
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:01,946
你想讓他像我父母一樣站在電話亭，洗衣房……
You want him standing in phone booths and Laundromats like my parents...

908
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,201
只能通過通信網絡和我們聯繫？我不想這樣。
only connecting with us through the network? I don't think so.

909
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:08,619
如果他去了，我們就再也見不到他了
If he goes,we're never going to see him again...

910
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,579
我不能接受。
and that is unacceptable to me.

911
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:24,391
我連想都不會想。
I never even let myself think about this.

912
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:28,053
我真傻。
I was so stupid.

913
01:31:30,733 --> 01:31:32,973
我只想讓我們在一起
All I wanted was that we would be together.

914
01:31:36,405 --> 01:31:39,357
我應該把丹尼扔給我媽媽的
We should have left Danny with my mother.

915
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:43,108
- 我們都不該有哈利
- 閉嘴。
- We never should have had Harry.- Stop it.

916
01:31:43,203 --> 01:31:47,413
我不能這樣，阿瑟。看看我們對孩子都做了些什麼。
I can't, Arthur.Look what we're doing to these kids.

917
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:50,490
他們一輩子都像罪犯一樣在逃亡。
They've been running their whole lives like criminals.

918
01:31:50,585 --> 01:31:51,912
他們什麼都沒做！
And they didn't do anything!

919
01:31:52,252 --> 01:31:53,449
這不公平
It isn't fair.

920
01:31:53,545 --> 01:31:55,869
我知道這他媽的不公平。
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

921
01:31:56,381 --> 01:32:00,329
他們經過了一些衝擊，但是你這樣逼自己於事無補
They've taken some bumps, but it's not going to help anything to beat yourself up.

922
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:04,378
看看他們，看在上帝的份上。
Look at them, for God's sake.

923
01:32:04,472 --> 01:32:07,305
看看這些孩子。他們多麼優秀
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

924
01:32:07,976 --> 01:32:09,469
他們很美
They're beautiful.

925
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,634
很聰明很體貼
And bright. Caring.

926
01:32:12,814 --> 01:32:14,770
我們能做得多壞呢？
How badly could we have done?

927
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:20,143
我們應該自首
We should turn ourselves in.

928
01:32:22,071 --> 01:32:24,643
然後接下來15年都呆在監獄裡……
So we can sit in prison for the next 15 years...

929
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:27,027
從鐵窗裡看我們的孩子們？
and look at the kids through bars?

930
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:31,026
每次還只能看一個小時
You can only get through this one day, one hour at a time.

931
01:32:32,331 --> 01:32:34,322
我就準備這麼做。
That's what I'm doing.

932
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:38,033
丹尼已經長大了。
And Danny's all grown up.

933
01:32:41,672 --> 01:32:43,129
我們該放他走了
We have to let him go.

934
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:54,883
這顆牙疼死我了
This tooth is killing me.

935
01:32:54,976 --> 01:32:58,141
我覺得補的東西掉了。該去看看喬納。
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

936
01:32:59,646 --> 01:33:01,139
我會坐公交車。
I'll take a bus.

937
01:33:01,732 --> 01:33:03,889
- 你去市內的時候我總是擔心
- 為什麼？
- I always worry when you go into the city.- Why?

938
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:06,392
因為在那他們誰都能看見
Because that's where they get everyone.

939
01:33:06,653 --> 01:33:08,146
很安靜。
It's been quiet.

940
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:11,480
有時候太安靜了
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

941
01:33:11,908 --> 01:33:14,148
你還記得孩子小時候你常說的話麼？
Remember what you used to say when the kids were small?

942
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:16,651
「別著急，除非你什麼都聽不見了。」
"Don't worry unless you don't hear anything. "

943
01:33:17,497 --> 01:33:19,322
小心點，好不好？
Be careful, all right?

944
01:33:29,841 --> 01:33:32,793
我什麼都沒看見。X光片裡也什麼都沒有。
I don't see anything. And there's nothing on the x-ray.

945
01:33:32,885 --> 01:33:34,543
我沒在抱怨。
I'm not complaining.

946
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,722
還需要什麼嗎？
You need anything else?

947
01:33:40,726 --> 01:33:44,389
不，謝謝。我們很好。我在為一個全科醫生工作。
No, thanks. We're okay. I'm working for a GP.

948
01:33:45,229 --> 01:33:46,722
現金可以嗎？
How about cash?

949
01:33:47,815 --> 01:33:48,976
可以
Okay.

950
01:33:50,734 --> 01:33:54,730
如果你提前告訴我，我可以安排更多的
If you'd give me some notice, I could arrange to have more.

951
01:33:54,988 --> 01:33:57,656
不。很好了。謝謝
No. This is great. Thanks.

952
01:33:59,326 --> 01:34:02,325
- 你總是讓我覺得這麼愧疚。
- 為什麼？
- You always make me feel so guilty. - Why?

953
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:04,120
這就是你的生活方式。
You're living it.

954
01:34:04,663 --> 01:34:07,331
是啊，我猜我是。
Yeah, I guess I am.

955
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:13,164
喬納，我需要你幫我打個電話
Jonah, I need youabcto make a phone call for me.

956
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:15,244
當然可以
Of course.

957
01:34:23,765 --> 01:34:24,795
夫人？
Madame?

958
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:53,492
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Dad.

959
01:34:57,336 --> 01:34:59,493
我讓喬納做的這個
I asked Jonah to set this up.

960
01:35:04,718 --> 01:35:06,460
如果你想，可以叫警察
You can call the cops if you want to.

961
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:16,851
對不起。
I'm sorry.

962
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:21,014
這對我也很難
This is hard for me, too.

963
01:35:23,485 --> 01:35:26,153
- 夫人要點什麼飲料？
- 不，謝謝
- Will madame have a drink?- No, thank you.

964
01:35:33,286 --> 01:35:36,202
我想知道14年不見你的孩子
I wonder if you'll ever know what it's like...

965
01:35:36,288 --> 01:35:38,991
是什麼感覺
not to see your child for 14 years.

966
01:35:42,377 --> 01:35:45,210
連他是死是活都不知道
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

967
01:35:52,553 --> 01:35:53,880
不知道這孩子是不是
Not knowing whether that child...

968
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:59,264
要對別人的死亡或者傷殘負責
is responsible for the death and mutilation of other human beings.

969
01:36:01,143 --> 01:36:03,632
要不要讓你自己
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

970
01:36:04,146 --> 01:36:05,971
為那死亡或傷殘負責任
for that death and mutilation...

971
01:36:06,524 --> 01:36:10,437
因為扣動扳機，引爆炸彈的是你的孩子
because it is your child who is pulling the triggers, setting the bombs.

972
01:36:10,527 --> 01:36:12,518
我沒殺任何人
I didn't kill anybody.

973
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,861
我不是來為自己辯護或是談政治的
I didn't come here to defend myself or to talk politics.

974
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:24,779
如果你不相信我當時那麼做是出於良心要結束戰爭
If you don't believe by now that what I did was an act of conscience to stop the war...

975
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:28,290
那我說什麼你都不會明白
then there's nothing I can say to you that's going to make you understand.

976
01:36:28,377 --> 01:36:30,368
一個人失明，還殘疾了
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

977
01:36:30,462 --> 01:36:32,204
他本不該在那的。
He wasn't supposed to be there.

978
01:36:36,718 --> 01:36:38,175
你不覺得，有些時候
Don't you think there have been times...

979
01:36:38,261 --> 01:36:41,177
我寧願讓自己失明，讓自己殘疾，來挽回這一切麼？
that I would have blinded and paralyzed myself to take that back?

980
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:43,047
那都是阿瑟的影響。
It's all Arthur's influence.

981
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:44,798
不，爸爸，不是
No, Dad, it isn't.

982
01:36:45,684 --> 01:36:47,058
是我的主意。
It was my idea.

983
01:36:47,644 --> 01:36:50,133
我活在我自己的選擇帶來的後果中
I'm living with the consequences of my own choice.

984
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,102
- 我不信。
- 那是你的問題
- I don't believe it.- Well, that's your problem.

985
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:53,766
你媽媽和我……
Your mother and me...

986
01:36:55,026 --> 01:36:56,567
你為我們考慮過麼？
Do you think about us?

987
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:06,027
- 你非得這麼問麼
- 對。
- Do you really have to ask that?- Yes.

988
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:14,196
上一次我記得你對我說
The last thing I remember you saying to me...

989
01:37:15,628 --> 01:37:18,034
我是個帝國主義的蠢豬
was that I was an imperialist pig...

990
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:23,290
一個人為了戰爭，貧窮和種族主義承擔責任
personally responsible for the war, the spread of poverty, racism.

991
01:37:24,553 --> 01:37:26,176
- 我還年輕
- 是
- I was young.- Yes.

992
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:31,715
你還年輕
You were young.

993
01:37:33,227 --> 01:37:34,554
有才華
And talented.

994
01:37:36,563 --> 01:37:37,641
美麗
And beautiful.

995
01:37:38,982 --> 01:37:40,807
那麼充滿了愛
And so full of love.

996
01:37:43,528 --> 01:37:46,860
上帝啊，安妮。你為什麼把它們都拋棄了？
My God, Annie.Why did you throw it all away?

997
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:56,326
你媽媽很想你。還有丹尼
Your mother misses you terribly. And Danny.

998
01:38:01,044 --> 01:38:02,702
你會收留他麼，爸爸
Will you take him, Dad?

999
01:38:05,381 --> 01:38:07,004
他想學音樂
He wants to study music.

1000
01:38:07,883 --> 01:38:09,376
他很好
He's good.

1001
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,590
他們想讓他去朱利亞德
They want him at Juilliard.

1002
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,629
就像他們當時想讓你一樣
Just like they wanted you.

1003
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,466
你還有那個用來練習的板？
Do you still have that practice board?

1004
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:26,228
一直到現在。丹尼就是在那上面學會彈琴。
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

1005
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:29,726
你教他的？
So you taught him?

1006
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:36,321
不覺得這有點諷刺麼？
There's some irony in this, don't you think?

1007
01:38:38,035 --> 01:38:39,492
你現在在這
Here you are...

1008
01:38:40,204 --> 01:38:42,528
求我把丹尼帶到
asking me to take Danny...

1009
01:38:43,373 --> 01:38:47,583
你曾經唯恐避之不及的人生裡
into a life that you ran from like a shot out of hell.

1010
01:38:50,213 --> 01:38:51,919
他真的想要麼？
Is this what he wants?

1011
01:38:52,006 --> 01:38:53,499
我覺得是
I think so.

1012
01:38:53,883 --> 01:38:56,882
他沒告訴我就自己去了面試
He got himself an audition without telling me.

1013
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,342
他會需要錢和照顧他的人
He'll need money, and people to care for him.

1014
01:39:04,559 --> 01:39:06,799
你不覺得你要的太多了麼？
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

1015
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:09,804
我幾乎不認識這男孩
I hardly know the boy.

1016
01:39:11,899 --> 01:39:13,392
如果我們收留了他
If we take him...

1017
01:39:16,237 --> 01:39:19,936
那我們去哪都會有聯邦調查局的人跟著
there'd be FBl agents following us everywhere we go.

1018
01:39:21,282 --> 01:39:22,656
你就再也見不到他
You'd never be able to see him.

1019
01:39:24,702 --> 01:39:26,360
我們太老了，不能這麼做了
We're too old for this.

1020
01:39:28,164 --> 01:39:32,030
嗯，我覺得我要的太多了
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

1021
01:39:38,798 --> 01:39:40,456
我還有一個兒子
I have another son.

1022
01:39:41,175 --> 01:39:43,499
他十歲。叫哈利。
He's 10. Harry.

1023
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:47,337
我在新聞上聽說了
I heard about it on the news.

1024
01:39:49,349 --> 01:39:51,007
我打算
I plan to turn myself in...

1025
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:54,931
在他再也不需要我的時候就去自首，在他足夠大的時候
when he doesn't need me anymore.When he's old enough.

1026
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,016
阿瑟呢？
And Arthur?

1027
01:39:57,524 --> 01:39:59,100
我不能為他說話
I can't speak for him.

1028
01:40:03,111 --> 01:40:04,936
請你考慮考慮
Please think about this.

1029
01:40:12,871 --> 01:40:14,280
我該走了
I should go.

1030
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:18,363
安妮。
Annie.

1031
01:40:21,796 --> 01:40:23,502
他可以來我們家
He can come to us.

1032
01:40:39,478 --> 01:40:42,228
請您告訴媽媽，我愛她
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

1033
01:40:44,149 --> 01:40:46,389
我經常想你倆
And I've thought about you both so often.

1034
01:40:47,777 --> 01:40:49,768
我把你叫出來。
I've called out to you.

1035
01:40:52,406 --> 01:40:55,738
對不起我給你們帶來這麼多痛苦
I'm sorry that I've caused you so much pain.

1036
01:41:00,497 --> 01:41:03,165
我猜我要知道這是什麼感覺了
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

1037
01:41:08,587 --> 01:41:09,784
我愛你，爸爸
I love you, Dad.

1038
01:41:46,163 --> 01:41:47,988
我去見了我父親
I saw my father.

1039
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,161
你什麼？
You what?

1040
01:41:51,668 --> 01:41:53,493
我見了唐納德
I saw Donald.

1041
01:41:55,671 --> 01:41:58,670
你就那麼走進他辦公室坐在他桌邊？
You just walked into his office and sat down at his desk?

1042
01:41:58,883 --> 01:41:59,913
沒有
No.

1043
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:03,667
我在「小鍋」和他吃了午飯
I had lunch with him at La Petite Marmite.

1044
01:42:04,805 --> 01:42:06,002
幹什麼？
What for?

1045
01:42:07,182 --> 01:42:09,173
想看看他要不要收留丹尼.
To see if he'd take Danny.

1046
01:42:10,018 --> 01:42:11,676
收留丹尼？
Take Danny?

1047
01:42:12,187 --> 01:42:14,143
這樣他就可以上大學了
So he can go to college.

1048
01:42:15,981 --> 01:42:17,308
你開玩笑吧
You're kidding.

1049
01:42:18,567 --> 01:42:20,060
他說他會的
He said he would.

1050
01:42:20,902 --> 01:42:22,560
他說他會？
He said he would?

1051
01:42:23,738 --> 01:42:25,943
你知不知道會發生什麼？
You know what could have happened?

1052
01:42:27,992 --> 01:42:30,149
菲利普斯要你這麼做的？
Did Phillips put you up to this?

1053
01:42:30,286 --> 01:42:32,657
沒人要求我這麼做
Nobody put me up to this.

1054
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:36,914
和菲利普斯無關。這是為了丹尼。
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

1055
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:41,198
他想去。他申請了，去了面試。
He wants to go. He applied.He went to an audition.

1056
01:42:41,296 --> 01:42:44,165
- 他他媽的去哪了？
- 朱利亞德
- He went fucking where?- Juilliard.

1057
01:42:46,676 --> 01:42:48,418
我不相信我的耳朵。
I don't believe my ears.

1058
01:42:48,511 --> 01:42:50,502
就給他一次機會吧。
Just give him a chance.

1059
01:42:51,055 --> 01:42:54,138
我要給黛博拉打電話，看看她能不能假造些檔案
I'm going to call Deborah and see if she can make him up some records.

1060
01:42:54,225 --> 01:42:55,422
為什麼？
Why?

1061
01:42:55,517 --> 01:42:58,185
因為菲力普斯給我填在申請表上的學校打了電話Because Phillips called the school I put on the registration form...

1062
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:00,391
然後他們告訴他沒有叫麥克·曼菲爾德的人
and they told him there was no Michael Manfield.

1063
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:02,512
會沒事的。
It's going to be okay.

1064
01:43:02,732 --> 01:43:05,221
他可以及時做好檔案的。阿瑟！
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

1065
01:43:08,737 --> 01:43:10,977
我們要搬了，孩子們
We're moving base camp, kids.

1066
01:43:12,157 --> 01:43:13,982
再呆幾天，我們就走。
We have a few days, and we're gone.

1067
01:43:14,493 --> 01:43:15,986
把蹤跡都銷毀掉。
Cover your tracks.

1068
01:43:16,453 --> 01:43:17,780
聽見沒？
You hear me?

1069
01:43:19,289 --> 01:43:21,161
你有想告訴我的事麼？
You have anything you want to tell me?

1070
01:43:21,623 --> 01:43:22,736
沒有。
No.

1071
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:23,946
好。
Good.

1072
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,385
我爸爸想要搬走。
My father wants to move on.

1073
01:43:50,567 --> 01:43:51,680
為什麼？
Why?

1074
01:43:52,819 --> 01:43:54,525
他有眼見。
He gets a sense.

1075
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:58,400
就那樣？
Just like that?

1076
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:00,651
就那樣。
Just like that.

1077
01:44:04,163 --> 01:44:05,324
什麼時候？
When?

1078
01:44:06,414 --> 01:44:07,492
隨時。
Anytime.

1079
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:10,408
你就那麼消失了？
You'll just disappear?

1080
01:44:18,175 --> 01:44:19,668
那我們怎麼辦？
What about us?

1081
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:25,175
- 他們需要我。
- 我需要你！
- They need me.- I need you!

1082
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:29,009
你沒和他們談？
You didn't talk to them?

1083
01:44:32,813 --> 01:44:36,227
你不能一直逃離你沒有責任的事
You can't keep running from something you had nothing to do with.

1084
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:38,723
你應該有你自己的機會
You deserve your own chance.

1085
01:44:53,164 --> 01:44:55,570
- 我想和你談談
- 沒什麼可談的
- I want to talk to you.- There's nothing to talk about.

1086
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:57,076
菲利普斯知道的太多了
Phillips knows too much.

1087
01:44:57,168 --> 01:44:59,492
你在讓你的情感影響你的判斷。
You were letting your feelings affect your judgment.

1088
01:44:59,754 --> 01:45:01,745
而且，這就是上學
Besides, it's academic.

1089
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:15,599
沒人會說的
Nobody will talk.

1090
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:17,263
你不知道。
You don't know that.

1091
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:21,189
他們能抓的都會抓。
They're going to try to pick up everyone they can now.

1092
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:24,721
我們在這的日子到頭了。
We're finished here.

1093
01:45:33,034 --> 01:45:35,570
- 我們可以慢慢收手的，不是麼？
- 我們必須走了
- We can close up shop slowly, can't we?- We'll have to.

1094
01:45:35,828 --> 01:45:38,496
不然就會引起注意
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

1095
01:45:39,414 --> 01:45:41,868
大家都去上班和上學，等接下來的通知
Everybody goes to work and school until further notice.

1096
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:45,161
如果有問題我們就在80號公路附近的野餐區見面
If there's a problem,will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

1097
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:48,667
還沒有理由覺得他們在追捕我們，所以冷靜
There's no reason to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

1098
01:46:09,692 --> 01:46:12,691
- 爸爸，我能和你說一會話麼？
- 現在不行。
- Dad, can I talk to you a minute?- Not now.

1099
01:46:19,325 --> 01:46:21,233
我想留下。
I was thinking about staying.

1100
01:46:21,452 --> 01:46:24,238
- 你不得去上課麼？
- 還有半個小時
- Don't you have school?- In half an hour.

1101
01:46:41,388 --> 01:46:42,501
我想留下。
I want to stay.

1102
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:45,092
留下？
Stay?

1103
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,221
你覺得現在是討論這個問題的時候麼
Do you think this is a good time to discuss this?

1104
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,926
我們現在不能說。我們遇到麻煩了。
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

1105
01:46:54,274 --> 01:46:55,731
我告訴你了！
I taught you!

1106
01:46:56,151 --> 01:46:58,640
我告訴你了！我們不能打破我們之間的聯繫
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

1107
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:01,519
一個集體的能力是由它最弱的一環決定的
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

1108
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:02,811
我們是一個集體！
We're a unit!

1109
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:07,647
這些都是我教你的，不記得了麼？
I taught you all of this,don't you remember that?

1110
01:47:09,746 --> 01:47:11,322
我不想聽你
I don't want to hear you talking about this...

1111
01:47:11,414 --> 01:47:13,370
在你媽媽或者你弟弟面前說這些，聽見沒有？
in front of your mother or your brother, do you hear me?

1112
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:14,951
我說，聽見沒有？
I said, do you hear me?

1113
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:19,083
這回說完了沒？
Are we finished talking about this now?

1114
01:47:26,844 --> 01:47:27,874
泰勒女士
Mrs. Taylor.

1115
01:47:29,514 --> 01:47:31,386
把所有東西都拿出來，穿上袍子就行

1116
01:47:31,474 --> 01:47:33,180
幾分鐘內就可以見醫生了

1117
01:47:35,102 --> 01:47:38,350
好的。我馬上就回來給你稱體重
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

1118
01:47:39,023 --> 01:47:41,180
能幫我拉拉鏈麼，親愛的？

不知道

他們用的車

1124
01:47:55,245 --> 01:47:57,734
是用她的信用卡租的
it was rented with her credit card.

1125
01:47:58,373 --> 01:47:59,830
你相信麼？
Can you believe it?

1126
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:04,329
他們怎麼能拿到她的卡？她自己都從來不用。
How could they have got hold of her card? She never even uses it herself.

1127
01:48:04,504 --> 01:48:08,630
這就是為什麼她沒注意到卡不見了
That's how come she didn't notice it was gone.

1128
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:11,708
那些人是一幫惡棍，泰勒女士
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

1129
01:48:11,802 --> 01:48:14,042
他們很有可能就是從通訊錄裡查出她的電話
They probably just took her name out of the phone book...

1130
01:48:14,137 --> 01:48:15,416
然後假造了一張卡。
and made up a false card.

1131
01:48:15,889 --> 01:48:17,679
能想像這多背運麼？

請找保羅·曼菲爾德先生。我是他妻子。

1147
01:50:15,205 --> 01:50:16,366
我談了。

他根本不講理。

沒有我們他活不下去。

他需要我們支撐著他。
