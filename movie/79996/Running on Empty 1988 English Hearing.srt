- He's not used to it yet.

I talked to her after the feds came,
to tell her we were okay.

That lady loved me.

191
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,797
Last winter, when they arranged
for her to meet me in Chicago...

192
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,680
she flew there on an hour's notice...

193
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,310
alone, in a blizzard.

194
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,712
She's terrified of flying.

195
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,270
She was green when she got off the plane.

196
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,150
I took her over to the lounge to talk...

197
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,472
and we sat in a corner and I said,
"I wish it was easier."

198
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,636
"You wish it were easier," she says.

She's correcting my grammar...

201

There's nothing left to go back to now.

207
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,591
I'm afraid I lost his records.

208
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,636
They gave them to me,
and I know I packed them...

209
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,153
but I just can't find them.

210
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,955
I'm always losing things, right?

211
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,958
My husband says I'd probably lose
my head if it weren't screwed on.

212
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,197
But I can write for a copy.

Yes?

You can't dance to Beethoven.

You're quite correct.
You can't dance to Mr. Beethoven.

Can you tell me why, Mr. Manfield?

247
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,870
Because the Beethoven piece...

248
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,233
doesn't use a constant rhythm or tempo!

I look at you, and I can see you standing
on the corner of Michigan Avenue...

476
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,552
in a Mexican blouse
and those crazy silver things.

477
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,478
Big silver earrings.

478
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,391
God, that was a long time ago.

479
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,074
How's Artie?

480
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,194
He's okay.

481
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,911
He's great, actually.

482
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,077
He did some work in Florida
on a toxic waste dump.

483
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,159
Here, he organized a food co-op...

484
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,037
and he's trying to
get his restaurant to unionize.

485
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,190
And how's you and Artie?

486
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,194
We're okay.

487
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,675
I mean, you know, it's hard.

488
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,193
I think about you.

489
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,473
I think about you.

490
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,473
I hope you're safe.

491
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,432
How do you manage this?

492
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,994
Got a house...

493
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,754
two kids.

494
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,154
It's kind of like
you're leading a regular life.

495
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,473
I'm a good liar.

496
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,478
But I'm tired.

497
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,873
Shit.

498
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,709
Oh, God.

[Door bursts open]

500
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,269
Hey, chief.

501
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,029
Hello.

502
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,434
Hello?

503
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,389
That's all you got to say to this guy
that just drove...

504
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,914
800 miles out of his way to see you?

505
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,714
You look great.

506
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,552
Then how come I feel so uneasy?

507
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,871
Artie, let's take a walk.
I got stuff to talk to you about.

508
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,995
I'm tired.

509
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,595
Go ahead, Paul. Take a walk with him.
You haven't seen him for 12 years.

510
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,352
ARTHUR: You're out of your fucking mind!

511
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,318
GUS: You owe us!
ARTHUR: I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

512
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,120
Do you know what
your asshole friend here wants me to do?

513
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,228
Rob a fucking bank! Can you believe it?
A fucking bank!

514
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,470
A "political action," he calls it.

515
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,553
We've been assigned this little job
by the Liberation Army.

516
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,393
Who are under the mistaken impression
that they've been supporting us...

517
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,072
and we owe them something!

518

What do they want my kids to do?

519
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,395
Knock off the fucking president?

520
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,156
You want to show
what you got in your car?

521
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,276
Nothing. It's my stuff.

522
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,716
That's not the impression you gave me.

523

Let's look, shall we?

524
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,638
Get the kids down here.
I want them to see this.

I want you to know
guns are not what we're about.

529
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,998
Now, get back in the house.

530
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,276
You're going to change the world, Artie...

531
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,197
by organizing these little food co-ops?

532
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,674
I'm going out.

533
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,272
You can stay the night...

534
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,353
but when I get back, I don't want to see
these things within 10 miles of my kids.

535
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,710
Annie, I'd like to explain this.

536
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,314
I'm listening.

537
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,750
You know,

A lot of bad shit has happened.
A lot of bad shit keeps happening.

But we're dead...

540
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,590
as far as the world is concerned.

541
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,069
We pull an action
and they bury it in the newspapers.

542
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,671
It's like it didn't happen.

543
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,193
The only time the pigs
or the media pay attention...

544
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,238
is when something
or somebody gets blown away.

545
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,437
Great. If you can't beat them, join them.

546
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,233
Do you think we're going to win this
by turning the other cheek?

547
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,036
Why don't you try walking on water?

548
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,317
Why don't you try growing up?
There's nothing to win.

549
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,031
It was over as soon as the war ended.

550
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,475
The war didn't end, Annie.
The war ain't never going to end.

551
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,395
This has nothing to do with politics
or the merchandise in my car.

552
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,357
This is just Artie's pissed.

Artie's pissed...

554
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,119
'cause Artie's jealous.

555
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,351
And Artie's jealous...

556
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,358
because you want me.

557
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,352
And I sure want you.

558
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,272
That's a bad situation.

559
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,600
Sooner or later,
they're just going to blow up.

560
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,631
You know, I feel sorry for you.

561
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,115
I do.

562

You're a 46-year-old infant.

563

Everything has to be your way, doesn't it?
When you want it, where you want it.

564
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,358
You're not a revolutionary.

565
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,592
That requires more than playing with guns
or with yourself.

566
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,193
It requires compassion, discipline.

567
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,430
Are you judging me?

568
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,709
Hu?

569
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,030
You judge yourself, lady.

570
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,473
You're living like some kind of silly-ass,
middle-class, suburban housewife.

571
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,272
You're living a lie...

572
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,151
just like you said.

573
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,870
Why don't you take this little
Norman Rockwell family and turn them in?

574
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,957
The feds would be glad to get them.

575
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,633
And then you could get the fuck out.

576
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,434
I wish I could.

577
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,433
Now get out.

578
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,159
Are you okay, Mom?

579
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,909
Yeah.

Let's put it like this.

She never does anything wrong or mean.

He waits in the car
when he comes to pick her up.

624

Your father's sure not like that.

625
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,277
Why? Because he plays Madonna in class?

626

What does he know about you,
except that you're good on the piano?

627

They see what they want to see,
and they block out everything else...

especially if it might not be nice.

They don't seem to get in your way much.

630

of not believing who I really am.

795
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,150
Like college. I can't go to college.
I can't leave them.

796
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,472
And I wanted to tell you...

797
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,238
why I couldn't be with you.

798
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,919
Not without your knowing.
I didn't want to lie to you.

799
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,395
Now, I have no right in telling this to you.

800
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,199
It's dangerous for you,
and it's dangerous for them.

801
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,396
I'm sorry. I just couldn't stop myself.

802

You can do what you want to. You can
tell your dad anything. I don't care.

Michael. Nothing changes.

809
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,550
They really don't want you
to go to school, huh?

810
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,792
We haven't talked about it.

811
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,238
- I can't ask them.
- Why not?

812
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,360
It would mean breaking up the family,
not seeing them again.

813
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,637
They don't have anything else.

814
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,870
I can't believe that they'd want you to
give up your whole life to stay with them.

815
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,670
Talk to them. They'll understand.

816
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,190
You have a lot of secrets, don't you?

817

I don't think Mrs. Patterson

- Yes.
- Someone ordered it.

No, I'll have to eat it.

had ever mentioned anything to you...

about his old school.

867

Not much. Why?

868
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,312
They never sent his records.

869
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,475
So?

870
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,552
I called the school.
They have no record of him.

871
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,677
They probably got eaten by a computer,
or something.

872

They don't have a computer
in Blue Hill, Kentucky.

873

What are you on his case for?

874
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,551
- We know nothing about him.
- So, he's an axe murderer.

875
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,713
I mean, come on! I thought he was
the best music student you ever had.

876
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,519
He is, but that doesn't explain
his missing records.

877
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,360
If you want to know who he is,
why don't you talk to him?

878
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,712
He's a person!

879

But he's been upset lately, and nervous.

I thought
maybe there was something at home.

No.

889
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,673
I know these things are private. I just
thought maybe I could help, if I knew.

890

But there isn't anything. Really.

891
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,236
Maybe he's worried about Juilliard.

892
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,789
Juilliard?

893
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,478
You know about his plans?

- Yeah, sure.
- And you don't object?

No.

896

They were very impressed
with his audition.

897
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,272
They're prepared to take him,
just as soon as they get his records.

898
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,435
He'll have to go then, won't he?

899
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,356
Is there a financial problem?

900

We're not the Rockefellers.

901
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,837
He could be worried about that.

902
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,478
We always manage.

903
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,200
There are scholarships. He could get one.

904
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,833
He's very talented.

01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,911
How has he gotten this far?

909
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,479
I don't know.

910
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,996
He's picked up a little here and there.
We move around a lot. Why?

I called Blue Hill and they have no record
of Michael Manfield.

Oh!

913
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,349
That's because he wasn't registered
there under Manfield.

914
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,875
See, I was married before,
and Paul adopted him.

915
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,758
But it took until just this year
to adopt his name legally.

at Blue Hill.

917

He can't finish his application
without those records.

I'll get them.

919

01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,872
only connecting with us
through the network? I don't think so.

955
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,150
If he goes,
we're never going to see him again...

956
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,990
and that is unacceptable to me.

957
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,278
I never even let myself think about this.

958
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,790
I was so stupid.

959
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,510
All I wanted
was that we would be together.

960
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,633
We should have left Danny
with my mother.

961
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,230
- We never should have had Harry.
- Stop it.

962
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,359
I can't, Arthur.
Look what we're doing to these kids.

963
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,310
They've been running their whole lives
like criminals.

964
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,674
And they didn't do anything!

965
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,149
It isn't fair.

966
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,470
I know it isn't goddamned fair.

967
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,748
They've taken some bumps, but it's not
going to help anything to beat yourself up.

968
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,631
Look at them, for God's sake.

969
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,439
Look at those kids. They're magnificent.

970
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,513
They're beautiful.

971
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,591
And bright. Caring.

972
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,597
How badly could we have done?

973
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,752
We should turn ourselves in.

974
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,068
So we can sit in prison
for the next 15 years...

975
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,355
and look at the kids through bars?

976
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,190
You can only get through this
one day, one hour at a time.

977
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,351
That's what I'm doing.

978
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,911
And Danny's all grown up.

979
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,799
We have to let him go.

980
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,071
This tooth is killing me.

981
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,197
I think I lost a filling. Better go see Jonah.

982
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,073
I'll take a bus.

983
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,710
- I always worry when you go into the city.
- Why?

984
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,111
Because that's where they get everyone.

985
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,793
It's been quiet.

986
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,991
Sometimes it gets too quiet.

987
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,550
Remember what you used to say
when the kids were small?

988
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,950
"Don't worry
unless you don't hear anything."

989
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,512
Be careful, all right?

990
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,433
I don't see anything.
And there's nothing on the x-ray.

991
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,112
I'm not complaining.

992
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,119
You need anything else?

993
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,555
No, thanks. We're okay.
I'm working for a GP.

994
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,793
How about cash?

995
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,955
Okay.

996
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:04,474
If you'd give me some notice,
I could arrange to have more.

997
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,280
No. This is great. Thanks.

998
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,758
- You always make me feel so guilty.
- Why?

999
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,479
You're living it.

1000
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,560
Yeah, I guess I am.

1001
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,155
Jonah, I need you
to make a phone call for me.

1002
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,149
Of course.

1003
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,309
Madame?

1004
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,835
Hi, Dad.

1005
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,590
I asked Jonah to set this up.

1006
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,272
You can call the cops if you want to.

1007
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,239
I'm sorry.

1008
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,232
This is hard for me, too.

1009
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,160
- Will madame have a drink?
- No, thank you.

1010
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,798
I wonder if you'll ever know
what it's like...

1011
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:44,474
not to see your child for 14 years.

1012
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,993
Dad...

1013
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,439
Not knowing whether she's living or dead.

1014
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,754
Not knowing whether that child...

1015
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,918
is responsible for the death
and mutilation of other human beings.

1016
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,109
Whether to hold yourself responsible...

1017
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,352
for that death and mutilation...

1018
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,634
because it is your child who is pulling
the triggers, setting the bombs.

1019
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,631
I didn't kill anybody.

1020
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,715
I didn't come here to defend myself
or to talk politics.

1021
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,391
If you don't believe by now that what I did
was an act of conscience to stop the war...

1022
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,758
then there's nothing I can say to you
that's going to make you understand.

1023
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,751
A man was blinded and paralyzed.

1024
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,512
He wasn't supposed to be there.

1025
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,239
Don't you think there have been times...

1026
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,118
that I would have blinded
and paralyzed myself to take that back?

1027
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:45,913
It's all Arthur's influence.

1028
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,592
No, Dad, it isn't.

1029
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,759
It was my idea.

1030
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,709
I'm living with the consequences
of my own choice.

1031
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,597
- I don't believe it.
- Well, that's your problem.

1032
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,193
Your mother and me...

1033
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,879
Do you think about us?

1034
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,954
- Do you really have to ask that?
- Yes.

1035
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,789
The last thing
I remember you saying to me...

1036
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,469
was that I was an imperialist pig...

1037
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:24,510
personally responsible for the war,
the spread of poverty, racism.

1038
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,278
- I was young.
- Yes.

1039
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,592
You were young.

1040
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,314
And talented.

1041
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,275
And beautiful.

1042
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,312
And so full of love.

1043
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,117
My God, Annie.
Why did you throw it all away?

1044
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,197
Your mother misses you terribly.
And Danny.

1045
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,312
Will you take him, Dad?

1046
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,438
He wants to study music.

1047
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,713
He's good.

1048
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,838
They want him at Juilliard.

1049
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,711
Just like they wanted you.

1050
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,309
Do you still have that practice board?

1051
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,876
So far. Danny learned to play piano on it.

1052
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,232
So you taught him?

1053
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,558
There's some irony in this,
don't you think?

1054
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,599
Here you are...

1055
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,510
asking me to take Danny...

1056
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:45,359
into a life that you ran from
like a shot out of hell.

1057
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,518
Is this what he wants?

1058
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,033
I think so.

1059
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,278
He got himself an audition
without telling me.

1060
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,475
He'll need money,
and people to care for him.

1061
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,790
Don't you think this is too much to ask?

1062
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,672
I hardly know the boy.

1063
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,113
If we take him...

1064
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,389
there'd be FBI agents
following us everywhere we go.

1065
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:18,999
You'd never be able to see him.

1066
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,552
We're too old for this.

1067
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:27,989
Yeah, I think it's too much to ask.

1068
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,072
I have another son.

1069
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,990
He's 10. Harry.

1070
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,672
I heard about it on the news.

1071
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,192
I plan to turn myself in...

1072
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,955
when he doesn't need me anymore.
When he's old enough.

1073
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,954
And Arthur?

1074
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,953
I can't speak for him.

1075
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,552
Please think about this.

1076
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,513
I should go.

1077
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,429
Annie.

1078
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,358
He can come to us.

1079
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,319
Please, tell Mom that I love her.

1080
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,310
And I've thought about you both so often.

1081
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,551
I've called out to you.

1082
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,277
I'm sorry
that I've caused you so much pain.

1083
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,400
I guess I'm about to see what it feels like.

1084
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,749
I love you, Dad.

1085
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,159
[Door closing softly]

1086
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,392
I saw my father.

1087
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,435
You what?

1088
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,672
I saw Donald.

1089
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,638
You just walked into his office
and sat down at his desk?

1090
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,829
No.

1091
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,430
I had lunch with him at <i>La Petite Marmite.</i>

1092
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,669
What for?

1093
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,711
To see if he'd take Danny.

1094
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,112
Take Danny?

1095
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,477
So he can go to college.

1096
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,514
You're kidding.

1097
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,153
He said he would.

1098
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,552
He said he would?

1099
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,796
You know what could have happened?

1100
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,830
Did Phillips put you up to this?

1101
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,235
Nobody put me up to this.

1102
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,318
It's not about Phillips. It's about Danny.

1103
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:29,428
He wants to go. He applied.
He went to an audition.

1104
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,273
- He went fucking where?
- Juilliard.

1105
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:36,352
I don't believe my ears.

1106
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,351
Just give him a chance.

1107
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,838
I'm going to call Deborah and see
if she can make him up some records.

1108
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,069
Why?

1109
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,720
Because Phillips called the school
I put on the registration form...

1110
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,836
and they told him
there was no Michael Manfield.

1111
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,871
It's going to be okay.

1112
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,469
He can get records made up in time. Artie!

1113
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,990
We're moving base camp, kids.

1114
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,872
We have a few days, and we're gone.

1115
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,793
Cover your tracks.

1116
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,514
You hear me?

1117
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,757
You have anything you want to tell me?

1118
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,269
No.

1119
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,429
Good.

1120
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,032
My father wants to move on.

1121
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,029
Why?

1122
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,758
He gets a sense.

1123
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,475
Just like that?

1124
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,633
Just like that.

1125
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,115
When?

1126
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,195
Anytime.

1127
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,992
You'll just disappear?

1128
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,873
What about us?

1129
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,155
- They need me.
- I need you!

1130
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,832
You didn't talk to them?

1131
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,756
You can't keep running from something
you had nothing to do with.

1132
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,150
You deserve your own chance.

1133
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,309
- I want to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

1134
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,753
Phillips knows too much.

1135
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,070
You were letting your feelings
affect your judgment.

1136
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,231
Besides, it's academic.

1137
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,519
ANNIE: Nobody will talk.

1138
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,115
ARTHUR: You don't know that.

1139
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,880
They're going to try
to pick up everyone they can now.

1140
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,268
We're finished here.

1141
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,674
- We can close up shop slowly, can't we?
- We'll have to.

1142
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,480
Otherwise we'll attract attention.

1143
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,715
Everybody goes to work and school
until further notice.

1144
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,872
If there's a problem,
will meet at the picnic area near Route 80.

1145
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,236
There's no reason
to think they're onto us yet, so stay calm.

1146
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,278
- Dad, can I talk to you a minute?
- Not now.

1147
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,471
I was thinking about staying.

1148
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,353
- Don't you have school?
- In half an hour.

1149
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,835
I want to stay.

1150
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,355
Stay?

1151
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,316
Do you think this is a good time
to discuss this?

1152
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,869
We can't talk now. We're in trouble here.

1153
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,559
I taught you!

1154
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,349
I taught you! We cannot break rank.

1155
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,110
A unit is only as good as its weakest link.

1156
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,349
We're a unit!

1157
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,989
I taught you all of this,
don't you remember that?

1158
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,513
I don't want to hear you
talking about this...

1159
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,477
in front of your mother or your brother,
do you hear me?

1160
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,993
I said, do you hear me?

1161
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,957
Are we finished talking about this now?

1162
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,389
Mrs. Taylor.

1163
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,757
Just remove everything
and put on the gown.

1164
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,478
The doctor will see you in a few minutes.

1165
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,437
All right. I'll be right back to weigh you.

1166
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:17,150
- Could you help me with this zipper, dear?
- Sure.

1167
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,994
Did you hear what happened
to Elizabeth Powell last night?

1168
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,109
No, I didn't.

1169
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,550
The FBI came to see her.

1170
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,510
The car that was used
in that bank robbery...

1171
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,559
where they killed those policemen...

1172
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:33,029
it was rented with her credit card.

1173
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:35,039
Can you believe it?

1174
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,354
How could they have got hold of her card?
She never even uses it herself.

1175
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,479
That's how come she didn't notice
it was gone.

1176
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,431
Those people are crooks, Mrs. Taylor.

1177
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,670
They probably just took her name
out of the phone book...

1178
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,988
and made up a false card.

1179
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,158
Can you imagine the bad luck?

1180
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,317
Paul Manfield, please. His wife.

1181
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,999
We're in a hurry.

1182
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:12,749
Gus took plastic from one of my patients.
He used it to rent the car.

1183
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,113
Frankie? I'm going out for a smoke.

1184
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,517
- Are we in a hurry, Mom?
- Yeah. We have to get Danny.

1185
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,591
I hope your husband is all right.

1186
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:54,749
Thank you.

1187
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,594
Okay, let's go.

1188
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:04,750
- Mom, I'll meet you there.
- We don't have much time.

1189
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,354
Meet you there.

1190
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,239
Salinger uses imagery
in <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> to...

1191
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,195
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1192
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,874
Mr. McGuire would like
to see Lorna Phillips.

1193
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,349
- Did he send a note?
- No, ma'am.

1194
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,189
Ms. Phillips?

1195
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,634
We're leaving.

1196
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,032
You didn't ask them?

1197
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,995
I did.

1198
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,313
Artie fell apart.

1199
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,392
He didn't even make any sense.

1200
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,197
Without us, he can't keep it going.

1201
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,072
He needs us to hold him up.

1202
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,391
All families break up.

1203
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,515
Why do you have to carry the burden
of someone else's life?

1204
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,953
He's my father.

1205
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,759
I love you.

1206
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,112
But I have to go.

1207
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,676
I don't know how to say goodbye.

1208
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,435
Well, don't.

1209
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,676
- Where is he?
- He'll be here.

1210
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,035
He went to say goodbye to his girlfriend.

1211
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,357
He knows better than this.

Get the bike out of the back.

1219
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,037
Now get on it.

1220
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:02,594
What are you talking about, Dad...

1221
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:06,355
Get on the bike. You're on your own, kid.

1222
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,032
I want you to go to Juilliard.

1223

But, Dad, I want to go with you.

1224

We'll see you again. You can be sure.

1225
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,351
Your mother has arranged things
with your grandfather.

1226
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,714
Call him.

1227
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,071
And I think you have some friends
