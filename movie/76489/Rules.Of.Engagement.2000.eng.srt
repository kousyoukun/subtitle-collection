2
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,860
Ca Lu, half a click that way,
two-nine-zero.

3
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,320
- I say we go right up the middle.
- Negative.

4
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,370
One round flank up the hill, the
other one right through the swamp.

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,170
Heads, you get the hill.
Tails, you get the swamp.

6
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,170
Flip the motherfucker.

7
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,380
- See you in Ca Lu.
- All right.

8
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,660
Delta Two, what's your SITREP?
Over.

9
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,830
What do you got,
Gibson?

10
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,120
Nothing, sir.
Delta One, Delta Two, SITREP. Over.

11
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,420
Two-one, contact!
Contact way out!

12
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,100
Cease fire! Cease fire!

13
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,560
Go, go, go.
Let's get 'em!

14
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,560
Come outta there!

15
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,940
Put your hands on your head!
Get on your knees now!

16
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,070
Come on!
Down, down.

17
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,780
Come on out of there!
Now!

18
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,120
How many you slopes are out here?
Huh? What's your unit? What's in it?

19
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,120
Tuan, get over here!
Talk to these motherfuckers!

20
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,000
Find out how many of them are here!

21
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,590
Where are they? What's in it?
Talk to me, goddamn it!

22
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,140
Aah!

23
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,450
Two, this is One Actual.
Where are you?

24
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,090
Uuh!

25
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,560
Other side of the tree line.
I'm in the water unable to withdraw.

26
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,650
Unable to withdraw! I'm calling
in a fire mission on this position!

27
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,070
- Hurry up and drop that arty!
- They're all over!

28
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,750
Go left! Get out there!

29
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,040
Tell this man to get on that radio
and pull his men off Hodges.

30
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,540
Tell him to break contact
and move his men north of Ca Lu!

31
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,920
Tell him I ain't playin'!
Pull his men off Hodges now!

32
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,430
I ain't bullshittin'
with you.

33
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,430
Either you call your men off
Hodges,

34
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,140
or this motherfucker's
dead and you're next.

35
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,600
Last warnin '!

36
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,150
Uuh!

37
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,700
Call your men
off Hodges now!

38
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,200
If he does, he can go.
He's got my word on that.

39
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,370
If you don't,
I'll kill you where you stand.

40
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,720
Two, this is
One Actual. You still with me?

41
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,230
Crank off a pop-up
if you're still alive.

42
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,130
You got a reprieve, you hear me?
You don't get to die today.

43
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,540
"You got your "Hail Mary".

44
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,020
Hey! It's the colonel
with his cover on!

45
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,370
All right!
Make way, make way!

46
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,950
- I guess the drinks are on me.
- All right!

47
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,960
At ease!
Listen up.

48
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,260
the reason we're all here,
Colonel Hayes Hodges.

50
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,730
He's calling it a career after
32 years of distinguished service.

51
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,400
All right, all right.

52
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,410
Colonel, we got you a gift
and a surprise,

53
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,870
so don't act like
you're not coming up here.

54
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,370
Speech! Speech! Speech!

55
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Speech! Speech!
Speech!

56
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,260
Hey, my man!

57
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,190
Good to see you.

58
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,820
You damn well better be. I came
halfway 'round the world for this.

59
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,330
Hey, get up here.

60
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,250
Speech!

61
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,630
The sword, Colonel.
You know the story, Hayes.

62
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,510
Marine Lieutenant Presley O'Banion
defeated the Barbary pirates...

63
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,810
on the shores ofTripoli
in 1805.

64
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,980
Out of gratitude, the pasha
gave him the Mameluke sword.

65
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,560
Marine officers have
carried one ever since.

66
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,940
It's the symbol
ofa warrior,

67
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,940
and you are a warrior.

68
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,610
The best I ever served with.

69
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,450
This man's been riding a desk
for the past 28 years,

70
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,040
but not because he wanted to.

71
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,870
He knows how to fight.
It's in his blood. Ah-ooh!

72
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,010
What are you
gonna do now, Colonel?

73
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,010
Well, uh... Well.

74
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,100
Heh! No more wars to fight,
no more trials to lose.

75
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,270
So I expect I'll do
some teaching at V.M.I.

76
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,440
I will recon the local restaurants
in a concerted effort...

77
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
to find out what civilians eat.

78
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,440
Of course, I intend to continue
serving my country...

79
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,650
by honorably depleting
the trout streams...

80
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,660
of the Southern United States
with my fly rod!

81
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,500
That's about it.

82
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,380
Let's get outta here.

83
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,380
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I missed you too.

84
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,720
How's the kid,
the smart Hodges?

85
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,890
You know, he studies more than
any two people. I never see him.

86
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,190
- You gotta fix that.
- Yeah.

87
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,730
- Got my orders.
- Oh, yeah? What?

88
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,190
Got command of the 24th
Marine Expeditionary Unit.

89
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,410
- Special Operations capable.
- Congrats. Huh! Congrats.

90
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,410
- Yeah.
- Outstanding.

91
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,160
All I gotta do is lash
'em together, take 'em to sea.

92
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,870
That's, uh... outstanding.

93
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,090
You ain't missin' nothin', Hodge.
It's a whole new ball game.

94
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,130
No friends, no enemies,
no front, no rear.

95
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,510
No victories, no defeats,
no Mama, no Papa.

96
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,680
- Yeah.
- We're orphans out there.

97
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,930
It's funny, you know?

98
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,640
One guy walks out through a swamp,
he gets to come home to a desk.

99
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,060
Another guy drives up a hill
and he gets to still be doin' it,

100
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,190
all over the flip
ofa goddamn coin.

101
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,190
You know, that's...

102
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,570
It's funny.

103
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,030
You gave good service
to the corps, Hodge.

104
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,040
To think otherwise
would be just plain crazy.

105
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,210
- You'd have gotten your command.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

106
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,330
What's up, John?

107
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,790
Terry, we've been ordered
to the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden.

108
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,540
This comes straight down Second
Division through General Perry.

109
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,540
The American Embassy in Yemen
is surrounded...

110
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,130
by a crowd of demonstrators.

111
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,590
The crowd isn't hostile,
but it's large enough...

112
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,840
to spook their government
into pulling their security forces.

113
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,220
Twenty-fourth Marine Expeditionary
Unit's gonna provide extra security.

114
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,220
We're gonna baby-sit, Colonel.
Just show our presence.

115
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,060
Remember, though, if it turns
hot, we're looking at an evac.

116
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,480
We got an ambassador and his family
there. Let me run you through this.

117
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,480
Here's your
potential L.Z.S.

118
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,610
Marines at the embassy advise we can
gain entrance through the back way.

119
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,280
Here's some stairs where you
can deploy your men to the roof.

120
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,450
These are your
over-watch positions.

121
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,700
I'll take them in
myself quietly.

122
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,120
One platoon, TRAP team,
put everyone else on Ready Five.

123
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
My thoughts exactly,
Colonel.

124
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,830
What's wrong, Mommy?

125
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,290
The people are upset
about some things, darling.

126
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,420
- Are they mad at Daddy?
- No, they're not mad at your daddy.

127
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,420
Why are they yelling?

128
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,850
They're trying to get attention
so that people will listen to them.

129
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,170
Sir, state security analysts
are asking for an assessment.

130
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,170
Assessment? We're getting the hell
out of here. That's the assessment.

131
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,760
The Sixth Fleet marines
are in the air, sir.

132
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,340
If they think I'm gonna
tough this one out, they're crazy.

133
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,180
Tell Mrs. Mourain to start packing.
We're going home.

134
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,470
Shall I indicate
we're ready to evacuate?

135
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,850
Ask them where the hell
are those helicopters!

136
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,730
The ambassador wants to know
where the choppers are.

137
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,980
You heard me.
Where the hell are the choppers?

138
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,460
Lock and load!
Lock and load!

139
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,880
Lock and load!
Lock and load!

140
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,080
We're gonna
take a betterlookbefore we go in.

141
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,840
Wagon Wheel, this is Red Man.
I'm over the embassy.

142
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,850
This ain 't no baby-sit.
It's ugly down there.

143
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,810
Red Man, Wagon Wheel.

144
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,770
Roger that.
Let's go for the evac.

145
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,850
Put it on deck.
We're going in the north side.

146
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,380
There! Go!

147
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,970
- Captain Lee!
- Yes, sir!

148
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,140
Nobody comes over those walls
or through those gates. Nobody!

149
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,970
One Alpha, secure all entries.
Tango and Bravo, on the walls!

150
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,100
- Move, move, move!
- Last man! Last man!

151
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,980
Pull back! Pull back!

152
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,860
Take cover!

153
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,500
You speak English?
- Yes!

154
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,130
Where's the ambassador?
He's topside! Go topside!

155
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,300
Take that corner!
Take that side! Move!

156
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,810
Aah!

157
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,400
Move, move, move!
Go, go!

158
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,280
Bravo Two, left!
Move, move, move!

159
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,240
Incoming sniper fire!
Stay down! Stay down!

160
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,410
Two blue, clear!

161
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,460
- Who's Mrs. Mourain?
- I'm Mrs. Mourain.

162
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,790
- Where's the ambassador?
- He's in there. Are we leaving?

163
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,460
The helos are outside, ma'am,
but that's up to the ambassador.

164
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,800
Stay away from
the windows, please.

165
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,300
Duck! Ow!

166
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,470
Aah! Colonel! Please!

167
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,180
My God! Are the helicopters here?
What kept you people so long?

168
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,350
We're ready to evacuate, unless you
want to stay and run the embassy.

169
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,520
I want to go right... now!
We called hours ago!

170
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,690
All right, sir, come to me.
Stay calm and come to me.

171
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,240
- Stay calm. Come to me. Stay low.
- We're like targets!

172
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,910
- We're sitting targets!
- Follow Sergeant Mac. Go!

173
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,670
Come on! Down there!
Down there! Right there!

174
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,050
Right there!
Down there! Down there!

175
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,990
Go ahead, ma'am!

176
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,950
Go ahead!
Go ahead, ma'am, go ahead!

177
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,710
Come on, son. Come on!

178
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,090
- What's your name, son? Justin?
-Justin.

179
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,960
Come on, Justin! Come on!

180
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,550
- Justin, what's that you got there?
- A flashlight.

181
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,430
We're gonna ride in a helicopter.
Wanna bring that with you?

182
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,260
- Huh? Come on. Come on!
- Mommy!

183
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,060
Let's go, ma'am, go!
Go, go, go!

184
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,020
All TRAP Unit six,
stay low, stay low!

185
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,110
We got crap coming over the walls
and sniper fire at 100 meters. Over.

186
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,570
Stay low! Sit tight,
sit tight, sit tight!

187
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,300
Colonel, we got three marines hit!
One is K.I.A.

188
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,960
One Alpha says they're gonna
try to breach the front gate!

189
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,300
- Tell them to wait out!
- Roger that!

190
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,230
Put the missus on board
first. Get in there, Mr. Ambassador.

191
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,570
I'll personally recommend you...
Where's the belt?

192
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,070
- I'll personally recommend...
- Hold it!

193
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,120
Where are you going? What? Colonel!
Colonel, we can't wait here!

194
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,370
Come on! Let's get out!
Come on!

195
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,250
Let's go! Christ!

196
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,300
We're leaving
in just a few seconds.

197
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,180
Let's go! Why are we sitting here?
Why are we sitting here?

198
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,600
- Sir, please! Look at me. Stay calm.
- Let's go!

199
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,090
She's free, sir!
Go!

200
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,470
Hope you know how
to fold this, sir.

201
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,850
Thank you, Colonel.
I'll never forget this.

202
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,730
Sir.

203
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,740
Go!

204
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,870
Krasevitch is hit!

205
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,630
Corpsman! Corpsman!
Shit!

206
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,460
Goddamn it!

207
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,470
Fuck!

208
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,270
Six, Red Man.

209
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,270
Engage hostile targets
as they appear.

210
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,810
Deadly force is authorized.
How copy? Over.

211
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,480
Red Man, Trans Six Actual.
Negative, negative!

212
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,280
Be advised, I have women
and children in my line of fire.

213
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,150
I got snipers in the buildings
at 400 meters. How copy? Over.

214
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,320
What is it about this order
you don't understand, Captain Lee?

215
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,330
Sir, are you ordering me
to fire into the crowd? Over.

216
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,040
Yes, goddamn it!
Waste the motherfuckers!

217
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,040
Six out.
Engage! Engage!

218
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,550
Open fire!

219
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,900
Cease fire!

220
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,070
Cease fire!

221
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,240
Cease fire!

222
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,080
Stay down! There may still be
snipers out there.

223
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,240
Cease fire!

224
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,080
- Cease fire, goddamn it!
- Everybody stay down!

225
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,790
There may still be snipers
out there. Stay down!

226
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,800
Get down!

227
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,360
- Sergeant Mac.
- Sir?

228
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,730
Contact all stations.
Mission complete.

229
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,070
Launch medevacs.
Dead and wounded out first.

230
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,070
Aye, Colonel.

231
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,790
All stations, this is RedMan.
Mission complete.

232
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,580
Move all medevacs to L.Z.
Howcopy? Over.

233
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,730
The FBI. investigation shows...

234
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,190
that all the bullet holes
in the embassy wall...

235
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,270
came from directly across
the way, from the snipers.

236
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,480
Any weapons or ammo found
among the dead or wounded?

237
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,200
No, sir. Nothing.
However, intelligence suggests...

238
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,700
this could have been
a terrorist operation.

239
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,700
Any proof?

240
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,040
This is a tape from
the embassy security system.

241
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,580
- Want me to thread it up?
- No. I don't want to watch videos.

242
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,040
I don't want to hear about
ammo casings in some building,

243
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,550
'cause here I got
83 dead people...

244
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,470
unarmed...
women, children, old men.

245
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,680
Another hundred or so
critically wounded.

246
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,140
Here I got an international
crisis of mega fucking proportions!

247
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,140
Bill, you know there have been
regular reports...

248
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,430
of a terrorist
plot against this embassy.

249
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,810
This was a regularly scheduled
protest. It was every week.

250
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,270
It was the usual bullshit about
American presence in the gulf.

251
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Have you looked at these?
I mean, I'm just assuming you have,

252
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,160
since they're on the front page
of every newspaper in the world.

253
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,040
It's not that the rest of the
world wants to hold us responsible,

254
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,040
we are responsible!

255
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,790
We can't even have
the appearance of a cover-up.

256
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,880
That does not excuse us
from our duty, Mr. Sokal.

257
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,930
We sent Colonel Childers in there,
and the mission went to shit.

258
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,470
We can't go after the man
who carried out his orders...

259
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,890
and ignore the people
who issued those orders.

260
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,890
Childers ordered the slaughter...

261
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,310
of innocent women and children.
Get that straight right now.

262
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,730
I'll tell you
what we ought to get straight.

263
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,650
We lost three
United States Marines.

264
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,400
They lost 83!

265
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,530
Now, are we gonna go to war
with Yemen over it?

266
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,360
We're covering our ass all over
the Middle East right now, General.

267
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,990
Because of your man's
hot headed miscalculation,

268
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,290
we are in danger of losing embassies
in Saudi, Jordan and Egypt.

269
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,080
We're in danger
of losing our presence...

270
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,000
with every moderate
in the region.

271
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,340
Now they're gonna scream
"cover up".

272
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,670
The screaming will get so loud we'll
be sending Marines back over there,

273
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,090
and the body count of American
dead is gonna be higher than three.

274
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,640
I see where you're going
with this, Mr. Sokal.

275
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,980
Will you be needing me
anymore today?

276
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
No.

277
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,820
No, that's fine, General.
Thankyou.

278
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,990
Good day to you, sir.

279
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,540
Where do you think
you're going with that?

280
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,630
- You don't want to look at it.
- Nobody's lookin' at it.

281
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,130
Why should the United States
be held responsible...

282
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,060
for the actions of one man?

283
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,520
What if the crowd
had weapons?

284
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,100
What if this shows
they did fire first?

285
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,310
He could have fired over
their heads, this moron!

286
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,020
Didn't he know where he was?
The Middle East!

287
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,780
He could have isolated
on the snipers.

288
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,360
He could have
avoided confrontation.

289
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,740
He could have done
50 fuckin' things!

290
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,120
Instead, he destroyed a fragile
trust, put his own men in danger...

291
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,700
Fuck this guy!
Forget this tape.

292
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,710
I don't want to watch it.
I don't want to testify about it.

293
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,040
I don't want it to exist.

294
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,310
Good morning, sir.

295
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,480
Good morning, sir.

296
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,190
Aye, aye, sir.

297
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,700
As soon as it's time.

298
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,160
General, Colonel Childers
reporting as ordered, sir.

299
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,290
- Give us a minute, Skip.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,630
Colonel, it's my duty to inform
you that you've been charged with...

301
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,510
You know the drill.

302
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,980
This is the Article 32
investigation.

303
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,100
You're facing
a general court-martial...

304
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,980
and charged with violation
ofat least three articles...

305
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,610
everything from "breach of peace"
to "conduct unbecoming".

306
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:43,570
But the bottom line... 83 counts,
violation of Article 118, murder.

307
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,570
You issued an illegal order
to have your marines...

308
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,870
fire into a group
of innocent civilians.

309
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,330
Murder, sir?

310
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm the convening authority, so I've
gotta get this B.S. out of the way.

311
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,380
Sign here, initial here.

312
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,850
You're not a flight risk, so there
won't be any pretrial confinement.

313
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,400
This court-martial convenes
in eight days...

314
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,450
by direct order of
the national command authority.

315
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,870
Do you want me to call
Bob Bennett or one of those guys,

316
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,370
or do you want to go
with base legal?

317
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,380
Terry, goddamn it,
we've been friends for20years.

318
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,380
You want to tell me exactly
what the hell happened out there?

319
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,180
I lost marines. The crowd
was hostile. They fired on us.

320
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,770
They fired first, sir.

321
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,730
I want you to know
I did everything in the world...

322
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,650
to keep this from happening.

323
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,440
It's just out
of my hands now.

324
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,330
Thanks a lot.

325
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,040
When's the last time you
actually caught something here?

326
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,170
Two years.

327
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,180
- I really need your help.
- I'll help. Anything you need.

328
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,600
You want me to take the stand?
I'll be a character witness.

329
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,890
No, you don't understand
what I'm asking.

330
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,980
I want you
to be my lawyer.

331
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,490
I'm a good enough lawyer to know
you need a better lawyer than me.

332
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,450
'Sides that, I'm short.

333
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,950
Two-nine plus one wake-up,
and I'm gone.

334
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,160
You need one of those
Washington cats.

335
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,330
I don't want some Starbucks
drinker who's never seen combat.

336
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,630
- I need somebody who's been shot at.
- Yeah, I've been shot at.

337
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,880
That's what I am...
a shot-up marine.

338
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,590
As a matter of fact,
that's all the hell I am.

339
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,300
No, wait a minute.
I'm also a weak lawyer.

340
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,510
I'm a very weak lawyer...

341
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,230
and the government is gonna come
at you with everything they've got.

342
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,570
Major, Bill Sokal. It's a pleasure
to meet you. Come on in.

343
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,580
Let me introduce you.

344
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,580
Gentlemen, this
is Major Mark Biggs.

345
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,790
He'll be prosecuting
the Childers court-martial.

346
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,250
The marines put the major
through Stanford Law,

347
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,790
and he owes them a couple of years
before he takes over the world.

348
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,800
You know General Lowry.

349
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,970
I'd like you to meet the general
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

350
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,930
General West, and the secretary
of Defense, Mr. Wyatt.

351
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,930
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

352
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,770
What I gather from our esteemed NSC
advisor and secretary of state...

353
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,020
is that we've got a trial
in two weeks.

354
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,400
- Seems awfully damned fast.
- Everyone in this room will agree...

355
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,190
it's in the national interest that
this trial be moved along quickly.

356
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,070
The Article 32 investigation
was complete and comprehensive.

357
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,860
It all seems to point
in one direction.

358
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,320
Has he got a lawyer yet?

359
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,330
He's requested a military
attorney, Colonel Hayes Hodges.

360
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,120
Second Marine Division, Lejeune.

361
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,910
Any relation to
General H. Lawrence Hodges?

362
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,120
His son.

363
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,830
Larry Hodges was one of this country's
most distinguished officers.

364
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,090
What do we know about
Colonel Hayes Hodges?

365
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,550
He's a guy who got
blown apart in Vietnam,

366
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,340
then went to Georgetown Law
and became a cynic.

367
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,340
Is that about right, Major?

368
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,510
He was 67th in his class
at Georgetown, sir.

369
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,430
He doesn't take too many cases,
doesn't win too many.

370
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,270
He apparently went through an ugly
divorce, had a drinking problem,

371
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,900
retiring in two weeks.
- Can we guarantee we get this guy?

372
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,530
Sir, if I may
say something?

373
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,740
I am not a hired gun.

374
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,280
I accepted this assignment...

375
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,700
'cause I believe in the merits
ofthe government's case.

376
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,950
I am not gonna stack the deck
against this guy.

377
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,870
I will try this case
on good evidence only.

378
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,250
I'm glad to hear it.

379
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,490
Hold your fire.

380
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,790
Set that weapon down over here.

381
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,750
We need
a couple of canteens up here.

382
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,430
Party incoming!
- You can go.

383
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,520
You can go, goddamn it!
Go on! Dee dee!

384
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,020
Get the fuck out of here
before I change my mind!

385
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,530
Looks like you're going back
to the world, baby.

386
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,780
- Doc!
- Twenty meters out. Left!

387
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,200
- Right there.
- Anybody else?

388
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,520
I got you now!

389
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,020
- Hey, buddy!
- Hi, Mom.

390
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,020
He looks fabulous.

391
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,980
- Happy anniversary, Mom.
- Oh, thank you. So good to see you.

392
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,480
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

393
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,530
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

394
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,160
- How's it feel to be retired?
- Um, crazy.

395
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,820
Good. Oh, you look great.

396
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,280
- Thank you.
- Well, come see Dad...

397
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,580
- There he is.
...and all the family.

398
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,160
Hello, sir.

399
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,670
- Glad you could make it.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,590
Good to see you, Hayes.
- How are you doing?

401
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,050
Hey, kid. Hey, you.
Remember me?

402
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,970
- The old guy who looks like you.
- Do I know you?

403
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,520
- Yeah.
- Your voice sounds really familiar.

404
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,150
Here's a clue. I was married
to your mom for about five minutes.

405
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,320
- Really? You sure? 'Cause I don't...
- Yeah.

406
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,910
- Well, is he guilty?
- Sir?

407
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,450
Your friend
Colonel Childers.

408
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,750
- Guilty of what, sir?
- Come on, Hayes.

409
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,460
You served with him. Is he the rabid
dog we've all been hearing about?

410
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,290
I don't think
I should comment, sir.

411
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:55,420
Come on, Dad. This is family.
You can lighten up a little.

412
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,420
You know what we said
at the naval academy.

413
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,430
Even if you thought
you weren't responsible,

414
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,930
it went wrong
and you were there.

415
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,760
Since when have you
not had a comment?

416
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,600
Since Childers asked me
to defend him.

417
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,480
No. Oh, Hayes.

418
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,940
- What?
- Excuse me.

419
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,310
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

420
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,570
Why would you do that?
Huh!

421
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,400
- Because he asked me, and I owe him.
- That's great.

422
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,950
That represents everything
that's wrong with the military.

423
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,950
Wisdom from the one person
in this family...

424
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,200
who has not elected
to serve his country.

425
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,210
Childers must have snapped.
It happens in combat.

426
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,330
I've seen it.
I'm sure you have too.

427
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,340
Thank you for reminding me...

428
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,210
why we have the presumption
of innocence in America.

429
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,170
What are you, Abraham
Lincoln? You can't hide behind that.

430
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,140
The guy murdered innocent women
and children.

431
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,260
- You hear that on television?
- And newspapers.

432
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,890
- It's all over the place.
- It's Mom and Dad's anniversary.

433
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,480
Don't take this case, son.

434
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,320
This man has trashed
the reputation of the Corps.

435
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,410
He's put us back 20 years.

436
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,910
Is this how you want
to be remembered?

437
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,660
I don't see how I can
turn him down. He saved my life.

438
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,670
Well, I understand that
as well as anyone.

439
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:20,670
But you don't repay him by
falling senselessly on a grenade.

440
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,760
The way I see it,
this man should find himself...

441
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,970
the best laywer in the country.
- Somebody better than me?

442
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,600
The guy's
a real marine, Dad.

443
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,400
I mean, if they
can do this to him...

444
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,770
just hang him out to dry...
they can do it to anybody.

445
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Forget that he's my friend.
They can do it to anybody.

446
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,450
That means your medals
and your citations...

447
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,450
won't mean jack shit
when they come afte ryou.

448
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,290
At least two of his own guys
are gonna testify...

449
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:00,130
that he didn't have
to open fire, sir.

450
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,130
Nobody reports seeing any
weapons among the demonstrators.

451
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,390
- His psych eval was a disaster.
- What about embassy footage?

452
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,890
Cameras, film, videotape,
home movies, shit like that?

453
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,060
No, I've subpoenaed everything.
The embassy got hit pretty good.

454
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,520
Most of it was destroyed.

455
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,280
Terry, you know Tom Chandler.
He's gonna help us prepare your case.

456
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,030
Colonel Childers, good to see
you again, sir. Um, all right.

457
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,000
First, we've subpoenaed all
the Article 32 investigator's notes,

458
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,000
the State Department's
notes on Yemen.

459
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,540
Major Biggs has already had
your head checked by their doctor.

460
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,420
I've got you an appointment
with ours.

461
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,550
- No.
- What?

462
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,590
No more multiple choice
questions about self-esteem.

463
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,340
We got the combat fitness reports.
He can forget the psych eval here.

464
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,100
That's a mistake, Colonel.

465
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,890
Listen, when I turned 18
I joined the Marine Corps.

466
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,930
I asked to be in the infantry.

467
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,440
- I asked to go to Vietnam.
- Terry.

468
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,730
I live for the privilege
of commanding troops.

469
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,320
I think it's the greatest honor
an American can have.

470
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,030
You know how many birthdays
and Christmases I missed,

471
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,030
spent rotting in jungles
or in the desert,

472
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,030
just so you could play
war at ROTC?

473
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,540
Childers! You gotta keep
your shit together here, man.

474
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,040
Your court-martial board
is gonna be made up of people...

475
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,540
who might've spent one day in
Grenada, maybe two days in Kuwait.

476
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,040
They're gonna be beach boys who've
never been anywhere near combat.

477
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,750
They're gonna be people
like Tom Chandler...

478
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,550
sitting right here in front of you.

479
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,680
That's who you're
making your case to.

480
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,680
We don't have anybody
to back up your case.

481
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,770
That's because
all my witnesses are dead.

482
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,850
- Okay. So what happened?
- He lost it. He snapped.

483
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,730
That's good.
We can snap him on the stand.

484
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,440
This doesn't happen in a vacuum.

485
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,940
Let's get a complete history
of Colonel Childers.

486
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,570
Talk to every marine
he ever served with.

487
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,570
My guess is
this has happened before.

488
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,830
We have to be careful here.

489
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,160
This guy is
the warrior's warrior.

490
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,790
A Navy Cross, two Silver Stars
for composure in battle.

491
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,880
He has no wife, no kids,
just the Corps.

492
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,300
He was our best.
That's why he was sent.

493
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,550
He's not on trial for the
good service he gave the country,

494
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,100
but for what he did
on the wallin Yemen, period.

495
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,060
Major, nobody wants to say it,

496
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,140
but it occurs to me we're trying
to set an example here.

497
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,060
So let's set it and show
the world we mean business.

498
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:26,570
The first charge supports the death
penalty, and I say we go for it.

499
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,440
No more death.

500
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,200
I'll see that he never gets another
command and I'll put him in jail,

501
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,870
but I will not seek death for a man
who served his country honorably.

502
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:37,240
I don't want it
brought up again.

503
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,500
We gotta show
Childers' state of mind.

504
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,580
We gotta prove he went out
with intent to kill,

505
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,920
and that is not going to be easy.

506
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,590
Whether a man is charged
with murder or hailed as a hero...

507
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,340
is sometimes a very thin line.

508
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,550
Our case is this. Childers receives
orders that a regularly scheduled,

509
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,270
I awful protest outside
our embassy in Yemen is unruly.

510
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,230
He is to secure
or evacuate the premises.

511
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,020
There has been no violence
prior to his arrival.

512
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,560
Once there, Ambassador Mourain...

513
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,280
does not feel the situation
warrants evacuation.

514
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,690
- Childers ignores him.
- There was sniper fire.

515
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,820
They draw fire from snipers
across the street.

516
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,410
Childers retaliates into an unarmed
crowd in front of the embassy.

517
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:21,460
A crowd of women and children.
He shot the wrong people.

518
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,500
All right, here's what this means.

519
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,130
Murder... Obviously, he could get
up to the death penalty.

520
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,760
Conduct unbecoming an officer.

521
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,590
Max is dismissal
with a dishonorable discharge,

522
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,470
for feature of all pay and allowances
and confinement for one year.

523
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,600
What about breach
of peace? What is that?

524
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,720
Breaching the peace is minor.

525
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,020
That means participating in an act
of violent or turbulent nature...

526
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,270
that deprives the community of the
peace and tranquility it deserves.

527
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,570
It's sort of the military equivalent
of the civilian misdemeanor.

528
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,070
No big deal.

529
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,530
There he is!
You goddamn baby killer!

530
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,530
Baby killer!

531
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,960
You're disgusting!

532
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,250
I'm not answering any questions,
all right? Get out of here. Go away.

533
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,630
You fucking baby killer!

534
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,010
Fuck  you!

535
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,890
Who the fuck are you
to spit on this uniform? Huh?

536
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,200
You ever play blackjack, Colonel?

537
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,530
Not really.

538
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,160
There are no intangibles.
It's all odds, sir.

539
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,210
You know them, you'll beat
the guy next to you.

540
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,670
You know what cards have been
played, you'll beat the house.

541
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,720
Sometimes you just can't win
no matter what you do.

542
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,220
I saw your man on television
knockin' some zit-faced kid around.

543
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,430
You have to understand the kind of
pressure Childers has been under.

544
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,390
A man with that kind of service...
No, no thanks.

545
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,610
This was a rescue mission
that went bad. Nothing more.

546
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,110
You're aware, Colonel,
we could ask for the death penalty.

547
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,610
You're not serious.

548
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,280
Oh, I'm very serious.
In fact, it's been suggested.

549
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,740
What do you think would happen
ifa Yemeni killed 83 Americans?

550
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,620
He'd have a trial
that would last for one day,

551
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,950
and they'd take off his head.

552
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,950
Have a seat, Colonel.

553
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,290
Please.

554
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,960
So here it is.
You plead him out. Guilty.

555
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,760
He throws himself at the mercy.

556
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,640
- We'll help him out at sentencing.
- How much help?

557
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,220
I'm not about to promise you
anything, but I'd say...

558
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,310
in the neighborhood of ten
to fifteen, out in seven.

559
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,520
Major,

560
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,600
do you know what the life expectancy
was for a second lieutenant...

561
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,900
dropped into a combat zone
in Vietnam in 1968?

562
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,440
I don't have time
for 20 questions, sir.

563
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,150
Then what's all this shit about
the odds of winning at blackjack?

564
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,080
You got time.
Take a guess.

565
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,410
My guess is your man's going down
'cause he deserves to go down.

566
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,840
I got a question for you, Colonel.
What happened at Ca Lu?

567
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,340
The battle of Ca Lu,
Vietnam.

568
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,720
You were there with Childers.
Something happened. What was it?

569
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,550
Fuck you is what happened
at Ca Lu, Biggs.

570
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,560
Two weeks.

571
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,060
Life expectancy of
a second lieutenant...

572
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,650
in combat in Vietnam
was two weeks.

573
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,110
Sir, I need more time
to prepare this case.

574
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,400
I need your permission
to go to Yemen...

575
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,070
It's all here, Hodge. We did an
exhaustive Article 32 investigation.

576
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,700
This thing happened
3,000 miles away. I need more time.

577
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,450
Colonel, it's all here.

578
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,700
We had it brought from Yemen,
and it's not unusual to convene...

579
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,700
a court-martial
on short notice.

580
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,370
There could be witnesses, something
the investigators overlooked, sir.

581
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,420
Don't you think Colonel Childers
is entitled all consideration?

582
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,380
Colonel Hodges, I don't care
ifyougo to China.

583
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,380
We have our marching orders,
and this court-martial...

584
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,340
will convene
at 0900 a week Monday.

585
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:05,510
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

586
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,640
One! Two!

587
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,820
...contact the sergeant?
- He's off-base, sir.

588
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
Terry?

589
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,600
Terry?

590
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,360
Childers?

591
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,950
Ohh.

592
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,950
Oh, shit.

593
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,290
It's okay.

594
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,290
It's okay.

595
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,670
- I wasn't...
- No, no. I know.

596
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,970
It's okay. It's all right.
I know. Believe me, I know.

597
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,310
Can I leave you alone
with that thing in the house?

598
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,350
Yeah. I ain't goin' six
on you, Hodge.

599
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,350
I'm goin' to Yemen.

600
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,730
If I have to stick your ass
in a hospital till I get back,

601
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,860
that is what I will do.
- You don't have to do that.

602
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,030
Got your word on that?

603
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,070
Oh, shit.

604
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,780
They take my uniform away,
they may as well shoot me.

605
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:53,040
You can live with it, bud.
Believe me.

606
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,500
I'm not gonna shit you.
They offered us a deal.

607
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,800
You plead guilty, it's
ten to fifteen. You're out in seven.

608
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,720
- What do you think?
- I think they're out to crucify you.

609
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,350
For a whole lot of reasons,
I say we take it and call it a day.

610
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,650
I did what they
asked me to do, Hodge.

611
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,110
I lost marines over there.

612
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:38,000
If I'm guilty of this,

613
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,050
I'm guilty of everything I've done
in combat for the last 30 years.

614
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,680
I don't know.

615
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,640
Colonel Hodges?
Captain Hustings.

616
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,560
I'm not in uniform and I'm not
saluting because of the snipers.

617
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,270
Please know that I'm saluting
on the inside.

618
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,770
I've got some Kevlar back there
with your name on it.

619
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,610
We're not the most popular team
in town right now, sir.

620
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,440
Hustings, are you a wiseass?

621
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,410
My mother prefers to
think of me as glib, sir.

622
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,490
Very well then. You will most glibly
belay all bullshit and drive on.

623
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,080
Roger that, sir.

624
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,100
I've lined up some people who were
at the scene, as you requested, sir.

625
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,440
- We can start tomorrow.
- Good.

626
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,530
- All right. Here we are.
- Oh. 07:00.

627
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,530
Roger that, sir.

628
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,930
The old embassy was
a fifth century palace.

629
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,090
Got pretty shot up.

630
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,970
We're moving the newone
to a bunker outside the city...

631
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:02,060
behind about a mile
of barbed wire, sir.

632
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,530
- You want me to come with you, sir?
- Negative.

633
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,530
Stay with the vehicle.
Meet me at the hotel.

634
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,490
Yes, sir.

635
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,480
Armed American marines,
they were shooting at his people.

636
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,980
They were just trying
to defend themselves.

637
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:04,110
Is he saying
the marines shot first?

638
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:12,160
Why were your police officers
ordered to abandon the embassy...

639
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,200
on the day of the riot?

640
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,300
It was a peaceful demonstration.
There was no reason to stay.

641
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,180
After the killing, were
any weapons found in the crowd?

642
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:42,150
No. They picked up everything
that was left. No weapons.

643
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,470
Hey!

644
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,640
No, look. Now, wait.
Wait a minute.

645
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,900
Wait a minute, fellas.

646
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,740
Hey. Hey!

647
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,850
Hi. What's your name?

648
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,850
Do you speak English?

649
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,850
You're a very pretty girl.

650
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,480
Katchi!

651
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,270
Is that your name? "Katchi"?

652
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,690
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

653
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:36,070
I was wondering
what happened to her?

654
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,160
She lost her leg.
Who are you?

655
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,910
I'm a lawyer with the United States
Marine Corps. What happened?

656
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,210
- A marine lawyer?
- Yeah.

657
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,460
Follow me, please.

658
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:21,030
There are hospitals like this
all over the city.

659
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,210
Most of the people here
will die.

660
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,010
Sir? Do you want
something to drink?

661
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,740
Give me another one!

662
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,830
Open the goddamn door!

663
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,260
What's wrong with you?

664
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,680
Get yourself a new lawyer,
you son of a bitch. You lied to me.

665
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,010
I could not find
one goddamn witness.

666
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,850
I couldn't find
one goddamn shred of evidence!

667
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:51,100
Not for our side
anyway!

668
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,400
You clearly opened up
on those people. What were they?

669
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,190
Rag heads, camel jockeys
or fucking gooks?

670
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,320
- You through?
- Yeah.

671
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,410
Get up.

672
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,870
Come on. Get up. Come on.

673
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,290
Look at you.
You went all the way to Yemen.

674
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,540
All you proved is
you're still a drunk.

675
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,380
You know what your problem is? You
never measured up to your old man.

676
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,130
But I can't help you with that.

677
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,580
Stop this shit
before somebody gets hurt.

678
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,900
I lost every one
of my men at Ca Lu.

679
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,740
And I'll tell you
the first thing I felt.

680
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:13,080
Joy.

681
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,960
Elation.
Gladto be alive.

682
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,420
I was glad it wasn't me, and
I fucking hate myself for that.

683
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:32,350
That wasn't your fault.

684
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,100
We're in deep shit, bud.

685
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,310
Yeah.

686
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,570
It's fourth and 40, Hodge.

687
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,110
I need a Hail Mary.

688
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,870
How?

689
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,600
Send him in.

690
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:37,450
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page here.

691
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,250
- Off the record.
- Of course, Bill.

692
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:45,040
Now, you didn't see any weapons
in that crowd, did you?

693
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,750
Well...

694
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,300
There was some shooting,
but I...

695
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,140
couldn't be sure exactly
where it was coming from.

696
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,640
Now, see, that's
gonna be a problem,

697
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,140
because we can't get on the stand
and waffle about the charges.

698
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,150
Waffle, Bill?

699
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:06,820
In your mind, Childers
was responsible, wasn't he?

700
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,650
I wasn't exactly there.
I had already evacuated.

701
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,740
You have to remember
he saved my life and my family.

702
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,160
This all happened after...

703
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,570
Does that mean the United States...

704
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,910
is gonna have to take the fall
for what he did?

705
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:20,660
I don't understand.

706
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,830
The investigating team didn't
find any weapons in the crowd.

707
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,210
That's because they weren't
there until the following day.

708
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,750
The Yemeni government
cleaned up the scene,

709
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,470
but unfortunately that's
not something we can prove.

710
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,220
Nor can I testify about it.
It all happened afterward.

711
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,970
Yeah, but you can testify
about Childers' frame of mind,

712
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:39,680
his behavior
while you were there.

713
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:44,310
He saved my life.

714
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,060
Surely this will all come down
to what the tape shows.

715
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,440
The tape's inconclusive.

716
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:55,030
Hodges subpoenaed it,
of course, but, uh...

717
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,410
it was a faulty recording.

718
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:02,120
- I see.
- Do you?

719
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,670
If Childers isn't held
totally responsible,

720
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:09,630
then the United States
will be.

721
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:12,420
And just guess...

722
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,680
where the finger...

723
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,930
is eventually gonna point.

724
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,600
- Me?
- Where else?

725
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,350
You should've known
this was gonna erupt.

726
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,400
And if you didn't,
you were asleep at the wheel.

727
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,190
Either way, your conduct
was inexcusable.

728
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,030
Now, do you want to face a
congressional inquiry over this,

729
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,160
put your career at risk?

730
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,490
Think about it.

731
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,910
Thank you, Bill.

732
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,940
All rise.

733
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,950
Be seated.

734
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,460
Look closely
at this picture.

735
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,630
Why did a well-trained
fighting unit...

736
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:18,050
have to slaughter unarmed
men, women and children...

737
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:20,430
when their orders
were simply to protect...

738
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,680
and if necessary,
evacuate the embassy?

739
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,220
The answer is,
they didn't.

740
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:31,060
They were ordered to open fire,
and that order came from one man...

741
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,360
Colonel Terry Childers,

742
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,230
who stands trial
here today,

743
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,110
a day of sadness,

744
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:42,320
a day when America has
to accept responsibility...

745
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,740
for its failures and its
mistakes as well as its glories.

746
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:53,580
We will show you that the accused,
through his mind-set and actions,

747
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,040
ignored the rules
of engagement...

748
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:58,800
and went far beyond
the scope of his authority...

749
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,970
to intentionally order
the murder...

750
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:04,550
of 83 innocent people.

751
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:17,360
I was the last one to enter the
courtroom this morning. I was late.

752
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,570
I was late because
I was in the head.

753
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:24,570
And I was in the head
because... I was throwing up.

754
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:29,080
And I was throwing up
because I don't know if I'm...

755
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,920
able to handle this job.

756
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:42,470
I believe that Colonel Childers
is innocent of these charges.

757
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:45,300
I just don't know if I have what
it takes to make his case for him.

758
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,930
I'm simply not on the same page
as Major Briggs, uh...

759
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:53,140
Major Biggs here,
as a lawyer.

760
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:56,480
We all know that.

761
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,980
So why did I take
this job?

762
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:07,870
I took this case because
Terry Childers told me...

763
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:12,250
I would have done the same thing
he did if I'd been in his shoes.

764
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,670
I took the case because I know Terry
Childers. His word is his bond.

765
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:19,920
He told me he did
what he had to do.

766
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,050
Now, I hope
I don't let him down.

767
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:30,180
We sent Terry Childers out
on a very tough mission.

768
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,770
And when it went bad,

769
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:36,650
and he did everything he could
to save the lives of his marines,

770
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:40,020
save the lives
of the embassy people,

771
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,030
you turn around now and want
to blame the whole mess on him,

772
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,780
send him to prison possibly
for the rest of his life.

773
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:53,620
That's not fair.

774
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,080
It's not right.

775
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:01,710
It is what made me sick
this morning.

776
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,710
It was a large crowd.

777
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,840
There was a lot of commotion.
The noise was very unsettling.

778
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,140
But it was
a peaceful crowd.

779
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,850
That is, until Colonel Childers
arrived and prevented me...

780
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:15,310
from pursuing
further avenues of diplomacy.

781
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,810
Did Colonel Childers
force you to leave the embassy?

782
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,900
Yes. He charged in.

783
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:23,190
He... started
pushing us around.

784
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,450
He physically restrained me
from doing my job.

785
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,530
What was his state
of mind at this time?

786
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,280
He was in a fury.

787
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,490
He was disrespectful
to me and my family.

788
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,160
Oh, that's bullshit.

789
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,120
It was almost, how should I say,
a murderous rage.

790
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,120
Do you remember what he said?

791
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,210
I remember he said
something like...

792
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,840
diplomacy is bullshit
at this point...

793
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,550
"and that ""nobody fucks
with the American flag""."

794
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:50,050
- Those were his words.
- Thank you, Ambassador.

795
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,050
No further questions.

796
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,720
Do you believe...

797
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,600
that an American embassy
on foreign soil...

798
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,480
is sovereign
United States territory?

799
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,480
As a general principle, yes.

800
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,270
Do you believe Americans
have a right...

801
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,940
to defend that territory
if it's attacked?

802
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,940
If it is, in fact,
attacked.

803
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:09,110
Would you have expected
Colonel Childers to surrender...

804
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
to the attacking crowd
or to fight them?

805
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,570
I would have expected neither.

806
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,240
The colonel should have let me
address the crowd,

807
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,540
then he could have withdrawn
his marines.

808
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,710
Would you have expected him
to hold his fire as he withdrew,

809
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:22,080
even if he were taking casualties?
- To the extent possible.

810
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,250
So your order would have been,

811
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,090
Hold your fire to the extent
possible, Marines.

812
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:27,630
And to the extent not possible,
fire away.

813
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,090
Ambassador.

814
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,930
This photograph
is exhibit "C".

815
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:43,190
- What is that?
- It's a security camera.

816
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,650
Is it mounted
on the roof of the embassy...

817
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,730
and pointed down to where
the crowd had gathered?

818
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,030
- I would suppose so.
- Yes or no, please.

819
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,030
Yes.

820
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,910
- Is it in operation 24 hours a day?
- I suppose so.

821
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,910
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

822
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:59,370
Do you suppose there is a taping
system attached to this camera?

823
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:01,000
- Your Honor.
- Colonel.

824
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,500
- Yes.
- Where's the tape?

825
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:05,460
It is my understanding
that if there were tapes,

826
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,460
undamaged tapes, they'd have been
sent to the State Department.

827
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,590
Undamaged tapes?

828
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,970
Well, there was
destruction and looting...

829
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:15,470
after the killing.

830
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:19,640
As you withdrew, did you remember
to take the American flag with you?

831
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,860
Did you remember to take
the American flag, sir?

832
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,820
- Of course.
- Where is that flag now?

833
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,870
I brought it home and returned
it to the State Department.

834
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:37,700
It was shot to shreds,
wasn't it?

835
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,660
By the snipers, yes.

836
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,710
Yeah?

837
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:56,180
Right! Go right!

838
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:59,560
Goal!

839
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,690
At ease, son.

840
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,820
Let me see. Which one
of you people is named Justin?

841
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,780
- Let me take a guess. How about you?
- No.

842
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,280
Then I'll have to make
another guess. I'll take, uh... you.

843
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,790
How'd you know?
Are you in the marines?

844
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:24,210
Yes, sir, lam.

845
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,920
Go on in the house, kids.
There are sandwiches in the kitchen.

846
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,050
Mrs. Mourain, I'm sorry
to bother you at home.

847
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:32,760
- I'm Colonel...
-I know who you are, Colonel Hodges.

848
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,760
- Is that your boy?
- Yes.

849
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,890
Can I talk to you
a few minutes?

850
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,930
I don't think
that's appropriate.

851
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,930
I don't believe your husband
is telling the truth...

852
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:46,140
about what Colonel Childers did
in Yemen.

853
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,690
Kids, go on in the house.
There are sandwiches on the table.

854
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,190
Let's go! Come on!

855
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:02,290
You should take that up
with my husband, shouldn't you?

856
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,540
Colonel Childers risked his life
so you could be here, ma'am,

857
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,080
watching these kids play
out these windows.

858
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,130
Does that bother you?

859
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,220
I feel terrible about what
happened to Colonel Childers.

860
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,550
Can you tell me that he
manhandled your family?

861
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,220
Or that he prevented
your husband from doing his job?

862
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:26,520
Ma'am?
Can you tell me that?

863
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,560
No.

864
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,610
As far as I'm concerned,
he behaved quite honorably.

865
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,610
Will you testify to that?

866
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:43,660
- My husband's a good man.
- So is Colonel Childers.

867
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,290
I've been married for ten years.

868
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:49,630
You're asking me to throw that
away in an afternoon.

869
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:53,000
Your husband and you
and your son...

870
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:56,340
owe your lives
to Colonel Terry Childers.

871
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:01,260
We all have our priorities,
Colonel.

872
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:05,100
I can subpoena you, ma'am.

873
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:09,020
Please don't.

874
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,020
Don't put me up there.
I'm a very credible witness.

875
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:16,030
Now, if you'll excuse me.

876
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:19,360
You won't tell the truth
if I put you on the stand?

877
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:22,870
I don't know
what the truth is.

878
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:25,990
Colonel Childers is on trial for
what he did outside the embassy.

879
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,370
I wasn't there.
Were you?

880
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,960
Captain Lee, you were in command
of the TRAP team...

881
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,760
and the second ranking officer
under Colonel Childers in Yemen?

882
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,430
- Yes, sir.
-And you were on the roof...

883
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:43,180
of the embassy, were you not?
- Yes, I was.

884
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,260
Colonel Childers ordered you
to open fire...

885
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:48,180
immediately after Sergeant
Richard Krasevitch was shot.

886
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:50,440
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

887
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,440
But Sergeant Krasevitch was not
shot by the demonstrators, was he?

888
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,940
Objection. How could we know
the exact firing position...

889
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,900
of the bullet that killed
Sergeant Krasevitch?

890
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:59,530
Sustained. Counsel
refrain from leading the witness.

891
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,660
Did you at any time...

892
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:05,160
receive gunfire from within
the demonstration itself?

893
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:10,120
Captain?

894
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,580
I can't remember any fire
from the demonstrators,

895
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,340
to my knowledge that is, sir.

896
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:18,340
You killed the wrong people,
didn't you?

897
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,090
You should've been firing
at the snipers across the way.

898
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,510
- Isn't that correct?
- I can't answer...

899
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,050
- Objection. Calls for speculation.
- Sustained.

900
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,720
You shot at people who
were demonstrating peacefully,

901
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,470
who were not using
deadly force.

902
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,810
Your Honor, that's not
in evidence here.

903
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:35,150
Sustained. Major, I'm not going
to warn you again.

904
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:40,240
Captain, what were the words
Colonel Childers used...

905
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,610
when he ordered you to fire
on the demonstrators?

906
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,700
I don't remember
the exact words, sir.

907
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:48,240
He ordered me
to open fire.

908
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,960
When you obeyed Colonel
Childers' order to open fire,

909
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,960
did you believe it
to be a lawful order?

910
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,080
Yes, sir.

911
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:58,130
Otherwise it would have been your
duty to disobey. Is that right?

912
01:25:58,170 --> 01:25:59,250
Yes, sir.

913
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,840
When your men opened fire
on the attackers in the crowd,

914
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,680
did the snipers in the buildings
across the way cease their firing?

915
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,720
Absolutely, sir.
It went completely quiet.

916
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,890
It would seem, then,

917
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,430
that the two groups were
actually one working together.

918
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,310
Objection. Counselis drawing
a conclusion for the witness.

919
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:15,060
Sustained.

920
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:16,610
Were you in a position
to observe Colonel Childers...

921
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:17,900
when everyone was evacuated?

922
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:18,900
Yes, I was.

923
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,940
What was the last thing
you saw him do?

924
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,150
- He went to the flagpole.
- Then what'd he do?

925
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,280
He took down
the American flag.

926
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:28,910
Was he personally
under heavy fire at that time?

927
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:32,910
- Yes, sir.
- No more questions.

928
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,080
Captain, prior to receiving orders
from the accused to open fire,

929
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,920
where was the point of greatest
concern for the safety of your men,

930
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,340
the crowd below or the snipers
in the buildings across the way?

931
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,970
- I'm not really sure.
- You're not sure?

932
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,970
Well, I guess...

933
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:51,390
Don't guess.
I'll repeat the question.

934
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:54,770
Was the point of greatest concern
the crowd below...

935
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:57,270
or the snipers
across the way?

936
01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:01,230
I would have to say
the snipers.

937
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,190
Did you feel an immediate mortal
danger from the crowd as a whole?

938
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,240
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

939
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,370
- No, sir.
- Let me help you.

940
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,200
Were you more worried...

941
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:16,750
you'd be killed by these people
or by these people?

942
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:19,380
I wasn't thinking about that.
Have you ever been under fire?

943
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,210
You didn't see the crowd firing, but
you did take fire from the snipers.

944
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,220
Is that correct?

945
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,640
Yes.

946
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,770
Our clinic is not too far
from the embassy.

947
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:40,400
So I was one of the first
to arrive there.

948
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,820
Did you see any weapons
on the bodies of the dead?

949
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,530
No.

950
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,530
Did you remove any weapons from
the people you were treating?

951
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:49,700
No.

952
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:53,080
Not a single weapon
anywhere among the victims?

953
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,080
No, no weapons.

954
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,210
In your opinion, is Yemen
a training ground for terrorists?

955
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,050
Not at all.

956
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:06,050
We met in Yemen.

957
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,970
You encouraged me to tour
your clinic in order to witness...

958
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,220
the suffering caused by
Colonel Childers' orders.

959
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:13,600
- Do you remember that?
- Yes.

960
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,440
I found an audiocassette
on the floor of your clinic.

961
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:21,150
It's marked exhibit "R".

962
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:23,400
Do you remember that?

963
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,570
- Yes.
- I found another one...

964
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,660
inside the embassy.

965
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,290
In fact, I found several others.
They're all marked exhibit "R".

966
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,120
Will you translate the writing on
the outside of that cassette?

967
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:46,880
Declaration
of Islamic Jihad...

968
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,380
"Against United States".

969
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:52,260
These audiocassettes are used
for the purposes of religious...

970
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,600
and political propaganda due to
the high illiteracy rate in Yemen.

971
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,850
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

972
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,270
Will you translate
the words you hear...

973
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:02,270
on this audiocassette
for the court, please?

974
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:16,370
Dr Ahmar?

975
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:20,460
We call on every Muslim
who believes in God...

976
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:23,170
and hopes for reward...

977
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:26,000
"to obey God's command".

978
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:36,810
Dr Ahmar, does it say
what God's command is?

979
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,180
To kill Americans...

980
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,350
and plunder...

981
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,860
"their possessions
wherever he finds them".

982
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:51,950
- Go on, please.

983
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:56,200
To kill Americans...

984
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,620
and their allies,

985
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:03,710
both civil
and military,

986
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:08,130
is duty of every Muslim...

987
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,630
"who is able".

988
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:15,430
To kill Americans is a duty.

989
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,310
- Is that what it says?
- Yes.

990
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,770
Do you recognize
the speaker's voice?

991
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:30,280
No.

992
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,240
Dr Ahmar, in your opinion,
is this propaganda...

993
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,280
representative
of that demonstration?

994
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:41,120
No. I'm not a member
of Islamic Jihad!

995
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,210
The crowd
was singing songs.

996
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,040
I heard them from my clinic.

997
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,630
What was your reaction when you
learned that Colonel Childers...

998
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,380
had been selected
to lead this mission?

999
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,470
I was very pleased. The colonel
had a distinguished record.

1000
01:30:56,550 --> 01:31:00,310
- He's a nationally renowned war...
- How did you define his mission?

1001
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:02,310
We wanted to increase security,
but frankly,

1002
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:06,140
if things got threatening,
we wanted an evacuation.

1003
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:08,650
So you weren't looking
for confrontation?

1004
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:11,570
No, that's what we wished
to avoid at all costs.

1005
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:13,690
What was your reaction
to what happened?

1006
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:16,570
I was stunned,

1007
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:18,570
appalled.

1008
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,370
Wasn't the severity of the problem
at the embassy understated?

1009
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,620
Absolutely not.

1010
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,540
We operated on the information
we had at the time.

1011
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:31,550
I have here a State Department
report from Yemen.

1012
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,590
It's exhibit "M".

1013
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:36,760
Will you read the underlined
sections for the court, please?

1014
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,090
Certainly.

1015
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:44,100
'January25.
Grenade thrown at police car.

1016
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:49,860
January 27. Sixteen Western tourists
abducted by fundamentalist group".

1017
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:54,400
- Go on, please.
- "February 6."

1018
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,950
- A bomb explodes in a car...
- You got today's Post?

1019
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,950
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Give it to me.

1020
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:02,450
Stun grenade thrown at newspaper
kiosk near a police station.

1021
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,950
March 13.
A military officer...

1022
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,290
is seriously wounded by
Yemen's first... donkey bomb.

1023
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:12,840
Explosives were apparently
concealed under the saddle.

1024
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,210
Thank you.

1025
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:20,590
I have another State Department
document, dated 17 November.

1026
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,010
It's from the ambassador
to you.

1027
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,020
Will you read this
for the court, please?

1028
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:34,070
Dear Bill. Please, we must revisit
our previous conversation...

1029
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:36,690
in that the security measures we
have taken are still inadequate...

1030
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,700
"for the protection
ofour mission to Yemen".

1031
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,450
You have to understand that
when I received this letter...

1032
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:45,410
Thank you. Now, there are...
Well, are there... cameras...

1033
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:49,120
mounted on the roof of the embassy?
- Uh, yes.

1034
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,120
Are they designed
to observe and record...

1035
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,210
activities in the public spaces
outside the embassy?

1036
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:56,380
- Yes.
- Where are the tapes?

1037
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,260
Uh, it's my understanding
the embassy was looted.

1038
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:02,180
Maybe the cameras
were destroyed.

1039
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:09,480
This is a photograph.
It is exhibit "D" for the court.

1040
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,980
It's a picture of a camera
on the embassy roof.

1041
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,020
Does it appear
to be damaged?

1042
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:16,690
No.

1043
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,400
- Where are the tapes?
- I don't know.

1044
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:22,200
Don't you think
the United States owes it...

1045
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,870
to Colonel Childers
for 30 years of service...

1046
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:27,200
to find that tape
and produce it here?

1047
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,120
Objection. We don't know
anything about any tapes.

1048
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,170
- This is pure speculation.
- Sustained.

1049
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,260
This is a shipping manifest.
It's exhibit "O".

1050
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,800
It is a list of items removed from
the embassy during the evacuation...

1051
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,470
and shipped
to the State Department.

1052
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:45,720
Will you read
line six, please?

1053
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,730
Videotape from security
camera, VHS, one.

1054
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,270
You too busy to look at those
tapes or you just didn't care?

1055
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:54,310
Objection. He's badgering
the national security advisor.

1056
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:56,650
Sustained. Counsel,
please proceed carefully.

1057
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:59,150
- Where are those tapes?
- Objection! Asked and answered.

1058
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:02,570
Oh. Yes, right. Right.
Don't you think it's funny...

1059
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:05,410
that a tape that could exonerate
my client is missing?

1060
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,080
I don't think it's funny at all.

1061
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,620
Withholding evidence
is a very serious crime.

1062
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:13,420
- Objection.
- Sustained. Counsel, rephrase.

1063
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:16,130
Withholding evidence to frame
a United States Marine...

1064
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:18,420
is no less evil than charging
my client with murder.

1065
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,760
Where are those tapes?

1066
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,920
Colonel, I turned over all
materials in my possession...

1067
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,970
to Major Biggs.

1068
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:26,930
If those tapes showed a happy
crowd of peaceful demonstrators,

1069
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:28,890
we'd be looking at 'em.

1070
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:30,640
Objection, Your Honor.
This is contempt.

1071
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,980
Colonel,
this is your last warning.

1072
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,980
It was a new security system.

1073
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,150
The cameras were pointed down
at the crowd.

1074
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:39,610
Tapes were recorded, and those tapes
were sent to the State Department.

1075
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:41,320
Why are those tapes not here?

1076
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,450
Objection, Your Honor.
I've seen no such tapes.

1077
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,200
No further questions.

1078
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:53,210
There are no tapes showing
the crowd firing weapons?

1079
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:55,170
None that I'm aware of.

1080
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:58,130
And the government has turned
over all of its evidence?

1081
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:59,420
Of course.

1082
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,460
Colonel Hodges has gone
to some length...

1083
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:05,760
to have you read security reports
illustrating violence in Yemen.

1084
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,680
- Yes, he has.
- Here is today's Washington Post.

1085
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,180
Will you read these headlines
that I've underlined...

1086
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,100
from today's Metro section?

1087
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,810
Agent, kidnapper killed in
rescue of businessman's son.

1088
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,690
Bomb threat evacuates
Museum of Natural History.

1089
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:24,150
Officer chases truckdriver,
fires 38 times.

1090
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,200
Husband shoots wife,
himselfin street.

1091
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,410
Mr. Sokal, does this random,
unfortunate news mean we should...

1092
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:35,710
allow Colonel Childers and his
troops loose in Washington, D.C.?

1093
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,330
Don't answer that.
Thankyou, Mr. Sokal.

1094
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,710
Present arms!

1095
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:46,590
Order arms!

1096
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:23,050
Take deep breaths, sir! You're
almost out of here. Stay calm.

1097
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:26,340
I hope you know
how to fold it, sir.

1098
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,050
Thank you, Colonel.
I'll never forget this.

1099
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,490
Krasevitch is hit!

1100
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,280
Corpsman!

1101
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,240
Corpsman! Shit!

1102
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,370
Goddamn it!

1103
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:23,650
Engage hostile targets
as they appear!

1104
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:27,280
Waste the motherfuckers!

1105
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,080
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

1106
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,120
Cease fire!

1107
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,130
Order arms!

1108
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,880
I was proud of my marines.

1109
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,800
They showed
remarkable discipline.

1110
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,800
Why didn't you fire
at the snipers in the buildings...

1111
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,140
instead of at the crowd below?

1112
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,640
Because I believed we were
in greater danger from the crowd.

1113
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,020
- Was that crowd firing at you?
- Yes.

1114
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,190
The demonstrators in front of
the building were firing at you...

1115
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,070
in addition to the snipers?
- Yes.

1116
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:09,610
Why didn't anybody else
see that crowd firing?

1117
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:11,860
My men were
under cover on the roof,

1118
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:14,320
except for Krasevitch
who was on an observation post.

1119
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,620
And why isn't he here testifying
on your behalf today?

1120
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:23,290
Because he was killed in action.
He died in my arms.

1121
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,590
So you were the only man left in
a position to observe that crowd?

1122
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:30,090
Yes.

1123
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:32,590
Where else have you been
in combat, Colonel?

1124
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,510
Vietnam, Beirut,

1125
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:37,890
Panama, Persian Gulf.

1126
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:40,430
Can you identify that blue and
white ribbon on your uniform?It's the Navy Cross.

1127
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:46,100
Do you remember the citation
that accompanied that medal?

1128
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,900
For conspicuous gallantry in
the face of great personal danger,

1129
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,900
reflecting great credit
upon himself,

1130
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:53,150
"the United States Marine Corps
and the Naval Service".

1131
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,530
Your witness.

1132
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,450
Colonel,

1133
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:05,000
you gunned down
more than 80 people.

1134
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:10,380
You wounded
another hundred or so.

1135
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:15,130
Could this have been motivated
by a desire for retaliation?

1136
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:17,180
I was protecting my men.

1137
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:20,390
Sergeant Richard Krasevitch was
shot only a few feet away from you.

1138
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:23,480
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1139
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,730
And right after Sergeant
Krasevitch died,

1140
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:27,730
you ordered open fire
on the crowd?

1141
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:30,730
- Is that also correct?
- I was taking fire.

1142
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:33,240
There were weapons
in that crowd.

1143
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,400
Well, you wouldn't shoot
unarmed people, would you?

1144
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,530
No, I would not.

1145
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:40,120
Even in the heat of battle, you
wouldn't shoot an unarmed person?

1146
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:45,000
No.

1147
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,130
This is exhibit "F".

1148
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:59,390
Will you please read
the following to the panel?

1149
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:04,560
Rules of engagement governing
ground conflict in urban areas.

1150
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:07,900
One. If possible,
the enemy will be warned first,

1151
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:09,900
then asked to surrender.

1152
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:12,980
Colonel, did you warn
the enemy?

1153
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:15,570
We arrived in helicopters.
We were standing on that roof armed.

1154
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:19,280
Did you warn them, either with shots
into the air or by a loudspeaker?

1155
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,120
Did you ask them
to surrender?

1156
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,660
No.

1157
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:27,710
I'm sorry, no, you did not
warn the crowd?

1158
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:30,580
Yes. No, I did not
warn the crowd.

1159
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:33,840
Continue, Colonel.
You seem to know them by heart.

1160
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,670
Deadly force
is the last resort.

1161
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:40,640
- Go on.
- Three.

1162
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:43,140
When possible, try to arrange
for the evacuation of civilians...

1163
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,310
prior to any U.S. attack.

1164
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,640
Did you do that, try
to evacuate the innocent people...

1165
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:49,520
before you slaughtered them?

1166
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,480
Objection. That is inflammatory.
- Rephrase, Major.

1167
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,860
Did you try, following Section C
ofthe rules of engagement...

1168
01:40:55,940 --> 01:41:01,240
for ground conflict in urban areas,
to evacuate innocent civilians?

1169
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,030
- No.
- No.

1170
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:13,210
Yeah, yeah.

1171
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:16,880
I just have
one more thing, Colonel.

1172
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:21,340
Did you have to repeat
your orders to Captain Lee?

1173
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,640
- I'm sorry?
- You ordered Captain Lee...

1174
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:25,810
to engage hostile targets,
and he advised you...

1175
01:41:25,850 --> 01:41:27,810
that there were women and children
in the line of fire.

1176
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:29,850
- Is that correct?
- He couldn't see...

1177
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:33,860
Yes or no, Colonel? Didhe
follow your first set of orders?

1178
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:37,940
I don't remember.

1179
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:40,990
Captain Lee is on record
as saying he hesitated...

1180
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:43,700
and mentioned the snipers
in the buildings.

1181
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:47,830
- Is his testimony accurate?
- I don't remember.

1182
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:50,120
Let me get this straight.

1183
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,420
You evacuate
the ambassador.

1184
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,500
You go back to the roof.
Two of your marines are K.I.A.

1185
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:58,920
A third,
Sergeant Krasevitch, dies.

1186
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,380
"You give your captain
an order which he doesn't follow;"

1187
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:04,090
in fact, he questions.

1188
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,260
And then you said what?

1189
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:10,100
I don't remember.

1190
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,640
You don't remember
what you said next?

1191
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:14,100
It was combat,
not some training exercise.

1192
01:42:14,150 --> 01:42:15,440
A moment later,
your men were shooting.

1193
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,320
What did you say
to make that happen?

1194
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,320
I don't know.

1195
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:21,110
You must have said something.
Captain Lee reversed himself.

1196
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:24,280
- What did you say?
- I don't know the exact words.

1197
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,530
- Let me help you.
- Your Honor.

1198
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,620
You said, "Waste the motherfuckers,"
didn't you?

1199
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,200
- No, no, no.
- You didn't say it?

1200
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:32,250
- It all happened so fast...
- You're under oath, Colonel!

1201
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:36,130
Let me refresh
your memory.

1202
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:38,960
This is exhibit "ry" a tape
recording made aboard...

1203
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:42,930
the U.S.S. Wake Island of all radio
communications received that day,

1204
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:45,590
including your exact words.

1205
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,890
Your Honor, with your permission
I would like to play this tape.

1206
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:49,850
If you got it on tape,
then that's what I said!

1207
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:52,480
They were killing my marines,
so, yeah, I said it!

1208
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,520
Waste the motherfuckers!

1209
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,650
- Are these "the motherfuckers"?
- Objection.

1210
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:58,940
- Overruled.
- Yes!

1211
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:01,490
- These?
- Objection!

1212
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:03,450
Yes!

1213
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,450
- These?
- Objection!

1214
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:05,990
- Overruled.
- Yes.

1215
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,740
Are these "the motherfuckers"...

1216
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:09,580
that you ordered to be wasted?
- Your Honor.

1217
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:11,500
- Major.
- Yes!

1218
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:15,330
The crowd in front of the embassy
had no weapons, did they, Colonel?

1219
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,080
Objection. We found
no snipers' weapons either.

1220
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:19,170
Yes, they had weapons!

1221
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:21,170
You think there's
a script for fighting a war...

1222
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,420
without pissing somebody off?

1223
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,420
Follow the rules,
and nobody gets hurt?

1224
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:26,970
Yes, innocent people probably died.

1225
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,970
Innocent people always die.

1226
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:31,970
But I did not exceed
my orders!

1227
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:34,060
There are rules, and marines
are sworn to uphold them.

1228
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:37,650
I was not going to stand by
and see another marine die...

1229
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:39,940
just to live
by those fucking rules!

1230
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:42,990
Colonel!

1231
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,780
Your Honor,
I request a recess.

1232
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:51,620
Major.

1233
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:56,830
The government is finished with
Colonel Childers, Your Honor.

1234
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,880
All right, Colonel,
you have your recess.

1235
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:08,930
Why didn't you tell me
what you said?

1236
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:11,430
- I didn't remember.
- "Waste the motherfuckers".

1237
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:13,850
That's brilliant.
You didn't think that was important?

1238
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,350
Why didn't you know
about the goddamn recording?

1239
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:18,350
- You're supposed to know...
- I had a week to prepare this case.

1240
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,520
I didn't realize
what a fuck up I'm defending.

1241
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,940
- Well, now you know.
- Goddamn.

1242
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,750
- This is going to take us both down.
- How's that work?

1243
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,210
You gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison too?

1244
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,100
I'm sorry.

1245
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:01,690
- I really screwed up in there, huh?
- Yeah, you really did.

1246
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:04,190
Whew!

1247
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:07,400
- So what happens now?
- Shit, I don't know.

1248
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,570
I don't know.

1249
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,410
Your Honor, the government
calls Colonel Bin Le Cao...

1250
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:17,580
as a rebuttal witness.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1251
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:19,750
What are the grounds for
this rebuttal witness to be allowed?

1252
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:22,380
Will counsel please
approach the bench.

1253
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:31,590
- Who is Colonel Bin Le Cao?
- A North Vietnamese Colonel...

1254
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,760
who fought against Colonel Childers
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1255
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:36,970
What he has to say directly refutes
statements made by Colonel Childers.

1256
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:39,520
- When was the battle of Ca Lu?
- 1968.

1257
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,270
This is uncharged misconduct. It is
not allowable under military law.

1258
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,730
How do you know this witness
is going to charge misconduct?

1259
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:46,780
I'm assuming...

1260
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:48,740
He knows because he was
at the battle of Ca Lu.

1261
01:45:48,820 --> 01:45:50,740
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

1262
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,660
On what grounds are you
calling your witness?

1263
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:55,950
Colonel Hodges made Colonel
Childers' combat experience...

1264
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:57,450
part of his defense.

1265
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:59,450
Furthermore,
Colonel Childers testified...

1266
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,460
that he never shoots unarmed people.

1267
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:05,540
My witness has an important
perspective on that statement.

1268
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:10,970
I'm gonna allow
the witness.

1269
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,730
Do you swear or affirm...

1270
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:27,270
that the evidence you shal I give
in this case...

1271
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,860
shall be the truth,
the whole truth...

1272
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:30,860
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1273
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:33,530
Yes, I do.

1274
01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:35,120
Will you please state
your name for the court?

1275
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:39,870
- My name is Bin Le Cao.
- In 1968, you were a colonel...

1276
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:42,920
with the North Vietnamese army,
B3 regiment, involved in a fight...

1277
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,710
with American marines at Ca Lu
in the Quang Tri province?

1278
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,210
Yes, I was.

1279
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:50,380
Will you tell the court
about that battle?

1280
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:53,590
We were aware that
small units of Americans...

1281
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:56,760
ryere ryeryr
my company of men.

1282
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:00,180
We found ourselves
behind your forces.

1283
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,890
This was lucky for us
because we were out numbered.

1284
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,230
Do you recognize
this man?

1285
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,740
Yes.

1286
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,240
Did he capture you and your
radio operator that day?Yes.

1287
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:21,250
Did he remove your weapons
and place you under armed guard?

1288
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,250
Yes.

1289
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:24,210
Did you consider yourself
a prisoner of war?

1290
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:26,920
Yes.

1291
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,130
Did he execute
your radio operator?

1292
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,260
Yes.

1293
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,180
You personally saw him shoot
a fellow prisoner of war?

1294
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:38,550
Yes.

1295
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,060
Where did he shoot him?

1296
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,180
In the head.

1297
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:45,520
Thank you.
No further questions.

1298
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:54,030
Were your men annihilating
that platoon of marines?

1299
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:56,030
Yes.

1300
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:59,070
Did Colonel Childers force you
to call your men off?

1301
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,200
Yes.

1302
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:03,250
Do you believe his actions
were calculated to save...

1303
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:07,250
the lives of American marines?
- Yes.

1304
01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:09,790
Would you have done the same
thing Colonel Childers did...

1305
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,800
if the situation
had been reversed?

1306
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:21,220
Colonel Cao, would you have shot...

1307
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:23,770
a captive American radio operator
in the head if you thought...

1308
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:28,520
it would persuade Colonel Childers
to spare the lives of your own men?

1309
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:34,690
Yes.

1310
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:40,450
No more questions.

1311
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:42,990
This court is in recess
until tomorrow at 09:00.

1312
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,000
#NAZWA?

1313
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:57,340
- General, good to see you.
- Perry, good to see you too.

1314
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:00,090
I want you to meet
my grandson.

1315
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,470
Hi. Nice to meet
you, sir.

1316
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,560
Thanks.

1317
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:11,020
Colonel Terry Childers
is a decorated war hero,

1318
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:13,860
a trusted leader
of American marines,

1319
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:17,280
and I wish that was
all there was to it.

1320
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,700
Unfortunately, there are
83 dead Yemeni citizens,

1321
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:23,910
many of them
women and children.

1322
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:27,960
Colonel Hodges would have you
believe that this crowd was armed.

1323
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,370
He would also have you believe
that there is a videotape...

1324
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,790
proving this to be true.

1325
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:39,720
There is no tape
exonerating Colonel Childers.

1326
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:43,470
There is no evidence
exonerating Colonel Childers!

1327
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:55,400
Is Colonel Childers a man capable of
killing defenseless, unarmed people?

1328
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:59,740
Is he capable of ordering
the execution...

1329
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,160
of innocent
men and women?

1330
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:08,330
Is he capable of executing
P.O.W.s with his own hand?

1331
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:11,250
Unfortunately,
we have shown that he is.

1332
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,790
You have heard the sad testimony
of Colonel Cao...

1333
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:17,130
who witnessed Colonel Childers'
barbarism firsthand.

1334
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:22,130
You've even heard
Colonel Childers' own admission...

1335
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:26,600
that his desire was to "waste"
them, regardless of who they were.

1336
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:34,350
Now, we are faced
with the difficult prospect...

1337
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:36,730
of convicting
one of our own.

1338
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:39,780
None of us wants to do this,
but you've heard the facts,

1339
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:42,110
and it is unavoidable.

1340
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:46,120
Colonel Terry Childers ordered
the senseless slaughter...

1341
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,040
of a peaceful crowd!

1342
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:53,250
Now, as marines,

1343
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:57,250
we do not get the luxury
of covering up our mistakes.

1344
01:50:57,380 --> 01:51:00,130
We must air them,

1345
01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:03,800
there by ensuring
that they never happen again.

1346
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,640
Thank you.

1347
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:15,730
That's sovereign
United States territory...

1348
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:18,730
as much as if it were
in Ohio or Maryland.

1349
01:51:18,770 --> 01:51:21,280
Colonel Childers didn't
volunteer to go over there.

1350
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:24,400
He was ordered to go there because
he was the best man for the job.

1351
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:26,450
We armed him.
We trained him.

1352
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:29,160
We sent him over there to risk
his life to save other Americans.

1353
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:32,660
And then ask him
not to return fire?

1354
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:36,420
There are over 300 bullet holes
in this building.

1355
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:41,170
Colonel Childers didn't open fire.
He returned fire.

1356
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:45,180
And he waited until after three
of his marines were dead...

1357
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,550
and another lay
mortally wounded.

1358
01:51:47,590 --> 01:51:50,100
He waited until he was
personally under heavy fire.

1359
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:54,230
He waited until he saw
that crowd holding weapons.

1360
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:57,850
Only then did he order
his men to return fire.

1361
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,820
Under the rules of engagement,
a civilian pointing a weapon...

1362
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:01,780
is no longer a civilian,

1363
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:04,490
and the use of deadly force
is authorized...

1364
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:08,030
in order to save lives.

1365
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:10,580
It's not murder.

1366
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:13,700
It's combat.

1367
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,170
Colonel Childers is
the only man alive...

1368
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:19,590
who was in a position
to see that crowd.

1369
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:22,210
But the camera on the embassy
roof had the same point of view.

1370
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:24,090
The government
would have you believe...

1371
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:26,220
there's no tape
from that camera.

1372
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:29,760
I have shown you that that tape was
delivered to the State Department.

1373
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:32,260
Do you believe that tape
got up and walked out...

1374
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:34,770
of the State Department
on its own?

1375
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:39,100
By not producing that tape,
the national security advisor,

1376
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:43,150
Mr. Sokal, has brought dishonor
into this court.

1377
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,900
Without that tape, I cannot show
you that the crowd fired first...

1378
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:49,160
and that Colonel Childers
is innocent.

1379
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,120
But without that tape,
they cannot prove...

1380
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,290
beyond a reasonable doubt
that he's guilty!

1381
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:00,000
Here's my case.

1382
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,670
He's all I've got.
Thirty-two years of service,

1383
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:05,090
thirty-two years of heroism
as a United States Marine.

1384
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:08,050
Regardless of
what you decide here,

1385
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:10,390
Colonel Childers' career
as a marine is over.

1386
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:12,430
He will never again
command men in combat.

1387
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:15,810
The ambassador and his family
are alive today because of him.

1388
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:17,940
And I know how
the ambassador feels,

1389
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:20,310
because Colonel Childers
saved my life too.

1390
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:22,310
I'm alive today because of him.

1391
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:25,360
My son is sitting in
this courtroom because of him.

1392
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,900
I'm alive today,
and I have a son,

1393
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:30,910
because of the heroism
of Colonel Childers.

1394
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:34,990
To ask this man to risk his life
for his country,

1395
01:53:37,410 --> 01:53:41,460
to ask this man to watch
his marines die in his arms...

1396
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:44,090
and call it murder
when he's defending himself,

1397
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:47,420
call it murder for firing back
when fired upon...

1398
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:50,090
To call it murder for saving
the lives of his countrymen...

1399
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:54,100
under the most extreme
of circumstances, that's, uh...

1400
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:58,770
My fellow Marines,
that's hanging him out to dry.

1401
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:03,770
It's worse than leaving him
woundedon a battlefield.

1402
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:06,610
That is something
you do not do...

1403
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:09,740
if you are
a United States Marine.

1404
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:15,370
And it is something that I pray
to God you won't do here either.

1405
01:54:39,730 --> 01:54:42,190
- What'd you think?
- You're pretty good.

1406
01:54:42,270 --> 01:54:44,650
Yeah. Yeah.

1407
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,650
Dad, you were awesome.

1408
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:48,650
Thanks, son.

1409
01:54:48,730 --> 01:54:51,490
I'm very glad that I don't
have to sit on that panel, son.

1410
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:53,490
You made it
awful tough on them.

1411
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:59,450
- 15,000 to 25,000...
- Excuse me.

1412
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,960
I said no interruptions.

1413
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:09,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Sokal.
It's very important.

1414
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:16,430
Send him in.

1415
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,310
Can we pick this up
after lunch, gentlemen?

1416
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,310
Absolutely.

1417
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,370
Close the door.

1418
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:48,750
What is it, Colonel?

1419
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:53,090
No matter what happens
to Terry Childers tomorrow,

1420
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:54,470
I'm not going to leave
thisjob until I find out...

1421
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:58,800
what happened to that tape.
- Good.

1422
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:01,010
Think it'll ever turn up?

1423
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,270
No.

1424
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:05,940
I don't either.

1425
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:10,070
Well, then there's nothing more
for us to talk about, is there?

1426
01:56:10,150 --> 01:56:13,570
You ever had a pissed-off
marine on your ass?

1427
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:16,410
Is that a threat?

1428
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:18,870
Oh, yes, sir.

1429
01:56:58,070 --> 01:57:01,120
All rise.

1430
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:08,290
Has the panel
reached a verdict?

1431
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:10,670
We have, sir.

1432
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:26,810
Colonel Terry L. Childers, this
court-martial finds as follows.

1433
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:29,650
On the charge
of breach of peace,

1434
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:32,230
the court finds
the defendantguilty.

1435
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:35,150
On the charge of conduct
unbecoming an officer,

1436
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:39,150
the court finds
the defendant not guilty.

1437
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,200
On the charge of murder,

1438
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:45,450
the court finds
the defendant not guilty.

1439
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:47,330
This court-martial
is adjourned.

1440
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:50,540
Sentencing will be conducted
at a time to be determined.

1441
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,750
Thank you.

1442
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:12,060
- I need one more favor.
- Yeah.

1443
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,400
Teach me how to fly-fish.

1444
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:16,110
You are well aware that I know
shit about fly-fishing.

1445
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:21,240
Oh.

1446
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:31,580
Colonel.

1447
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,090
You realize in light of
Colonel Cao's testimony,

1448
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:39,720
we'll be pushing for charges
on the Ca Lu incident.

1449
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,050
That was 30 years ago.

1450
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:43,470
You're going to have
a hard time finding witnesses.

1451
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:45,550
I thought maybe
you'd be willing to testify.

1452
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,010
I'll make you a deal.

1453
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:51,600
If you can tell me right now
what the life expectancy was...

1454
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:56,060
for a second lieutenant dropped
into a hot L.Z. in Vietnam in 1968,

1455
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:59,070
I'll tell you everything
I remember about Ca Lu.

1456
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:02,110
- One week.
- Negative.

1457
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,450
Sixteen minutes, Major.

1458
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:08,370
Sixteen fucking minutes.

1459
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:10,410
And that's all I remember.

1460
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,960
Sir.
