1
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,415
Satler.

2
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,417
Reiss.

3
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:50,627
Maloney.

4
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,423
Murphy.
Where the hell's Murphy?

5
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:09,020
-Hey, Jafo! Go find Murphy.
-Yes, sir.

6
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,992
Sir, Lieutenant Kress
wants you on the pad.

7
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,872
Sir?

8
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,875
Lose something?

9
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:33,378
No. You're wanted on the pad.

10
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,055
-Mind if l ask what you're doing?
-No.

11
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:46,349
I don't mind at all.

12
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:55,400
Murph, feeling any pressure?

13
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:59,195
Yeah, about 1 5 pounds per
square inch at sea level.

14
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,155
Where's Montoya?

15
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:05,034
Don't you check the duty board?
He's on days.

16
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,577
I forgot.

17
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:10,373
You're flying with
that new guy, Lymangood.

18
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:14,502
-The what?
-Me. Lymangood.

19
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:17,630
Outstanding.

20
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,760
Captain Maloney and Officer Reiss,
report to Operations.

21
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,312
If it was me, l'd ground him.

22
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:34,939
He'll be all right.

23
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,318
Personally, I wouldn't fly with him
for a bull that pissed Jack Daniels.

24
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:41,612
Is that right?

25
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,973
-All set?
-Yeah. Yes, sir.

26
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,600
-You sure now?
-Yeah.

27
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:24,072
Airship-1 2 rolling out at 1 959 hours.

28
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:27,325
No, make that 2000 hours.
Murphy and Lymangood.

29
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:28,993
Where the hell's Montoya?

30
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:33,122
They say he put in for days after
that wingding that Murphy threw.

31
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,708
No shit. Let me call Departure.

32
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,960
L.A. Departure Control,
Air-1 2 out at...

33
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,756
...22000. VFR 5000 will be
coming to you 1 .25.

34
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,592
Traffic advisory.

35
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,347
Lymangood. Lymangood...

36
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,474
...what brings you to Air Support?

37
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,892
Oh, l don't know.

38
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:57,313
I just put in for observer.
I kind of liked the idea of it.

39
00:03:57,764 --> 00:04:01,943
No guns. No kicking in doors.
You know, just quiet.

40
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:04,612
Oh, yeah.

41
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:09,325
All these people! What do you
suppose they're all doing down there?

42
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:14,288
According to the latest statistics,
1 ,000,775,000 of them...

43
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:16,707
...are getting it on.

44
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,669
That many, huh?

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,463
The rest are waiting
for Laverne and Shirley.

46
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:25,675
Well, let's see what we can see here.

47
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,470
I got a black guy in a beanie.

48
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:32,390
Looks like he's selling
dope out of a van.

49
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:35,518
-ls that a red beanie?
-Yeah, that's him.

50
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,687
This is primo, man.
You want it?

51
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:41,774
He's ours. Undercover Buy Program.

52
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,776
Right, right.

53
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,281
-You were at the briefing?
-Yes, sir. Guess I just forgot.

54
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,908
You're gonna fit right in.

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,411
Air-1 2, we have
a 21 1 in progress...

56
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,830
...at Burbank and Vineland.

57
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,875
Male Negro,
orange shirt and cowboy hat.

58
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,127
He's armed and has a hostage.

59
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,379
Well, call it in.

60
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,258
Air-1 2 to Central. Proceeding to
the 21 1 at Burbank and Vineland.

61
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,761
Let's get out of here, man!

62
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:13,931
Bitch!

63
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:21,063
You dumb idiot!

64
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,117
Air-1 2 to ground,
your guy's heading for the junkyard.

65
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:40,291
Orange shirt and a cowboy hat, huh?
Whatever happened to inconspicuous?

66
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,129
Hit him! Hit him with the light.

67
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:47,882
I got him.

68
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:54,513
-Jesus Christ!
-Welcome to Air Support.

69
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,572
-Call an ambulance.
-Right.

70
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:20,790
Look at that guy.

71
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,126
Ground units! A man with
a gun is behind that dumpster.

72
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,670
No, the other way!

73
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,797
We're going down.
We gotta dust him.

74
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:46,440
Hit the ground, son. Hit it!

75
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,862
Code 4. They got it knocked.

76
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,011
Sir, what was that business
with the watch?

77
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,224
Back in the Ready Room,
with the watch?

78
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,435
Sort of a test.

79
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,854
If you think you're going
over the edge...

80
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:27,148
...you lose your sense of time.

81
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,860
With your eyes shut, you can't
tell 25 seconds from 5.

82
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,362
I get it, sir. Yes, sir.

83
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:36,574
Stop calling me "sir."
You sound like David Copperfield.

84
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,534
Yes, sir. I mean, okay, sir.

85
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:41,412
Check that ride at 1 0:00.

86
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:44,415
-Which one?
-Underneath the tree.

87
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,542
How do you see that shit?

88
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:51,922
-See it?
-Yep.

89
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,177
-lt's got no plates on it.
-Well, call it in.

90
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,179
Abandoned vehicle.

91
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:03,225
Air-1 2 to Central. Reporting
an abandoned vehicle. lt's a--

92
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,894
Come on, what kind of car?

93
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:07,396
It's a light tan Chevy.

94
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,608
It's got no front plates.
It's got no plates at all.

95
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:15,321
It's near the top of the hill
on Linden Road.

96
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,990
Very good.

97
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,450
Oh, thanks.

98
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:44,308
What time have you got?
You got about 1 0:30?

99
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,977
Been talking to Montoya, haven't you?

100
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,314
Well, he did mention
something about Encino.

101
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,983
I suppose you deserve
full initiation.

102
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:55,653
You might as well
have your picture taken.

103
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:22,763
Montoya thinks she's
some kind of movie actress.

104
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:27,184
Just my damn luck if they
had her working overtime tonight.

105
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,520
Those bastards.

106
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,606
Slave drivers.
That's what they are.

107
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:35,901
They don't care how hard
they work you, as long--

108
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,446
Oh, my God! There she is.

109
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:47,913
She's fantastic! Do you think
she knows we're out here?

110
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,332
All she has to do is look
out the window.

111
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,585
1 0:30, right on the dot!

112
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:58,883
If there's one quality that l admire
in a person, it's punctuality.

113
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,304
And flexibility.

114
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:07,933
If a person says that they're
gonna be at a certain place--

115
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:09,518
Oh, God!

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,441
How does she do that?
How does she do that?

117
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,485
Beats the hell out of me.

118
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't push on the pedals!

119
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,201
Would you look at her tan?

120
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,334
It's so even!

121
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,713
Oh, my God!

122
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,473
-What do you want?
-Get the briefcase!

123
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,517
I think she doesn't know.

124
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,192
Somebody does.

125
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:44,697
All units in the vicinity handle a rape
in progress. 8792 Linden Road.

126
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:46,615
Damn it to hell. I knew it!

127
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,325
Identify and handle, code 3.

128
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:01,630
Oh, shit! Come on, let's go, man!

129
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:04,967
Around the back.

130
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,429
Hold it! Freeze!

131
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,572
He's bought it.
Get on the other guy.

132
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,579
No, let them go!
Please, let them go!

133
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,124
-Over there.
-l got him.

134
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,873
Sir, you okay? Sir?

135
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,417
Fine.

136
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,131
Get an ambulance.

137
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,427
Air-1 2 requesting an ambulance
at 3920 Linden Road.

138
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,430
-How's the woman?
-She looks bad.

139
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:36,850
Oh, hell! lt's gone.

140
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:39,895
The Chevy. The junker.
The Chevy.

141
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:42,690
It's gone.

142
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:52,908
For God's sake!

143
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:59,581
Air-1 2, wind 1 50 degrees at 22,
clear to land.

144
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:04,420
Air-14, 1 1 50 degrees at 1 2,
clear for takeoff.

145
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,173
The old man wants to see
both of you. Right now!

146
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,848
-l like your haircut.
-l like yours too.

147
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,407
You know, one of the really
fun things about this job...

148
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,119
...is reading the complaints
of the public.

149
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,706
For example, tonight here
we have a fella...

150
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:44,835
...that didn't appreciate us
disturbing his sleep.

151
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:50,883
I just hope l'm not called on
by the chief to explain...

152
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:55,804
...why two of my people were
hovering over Encino at 1 0:30...

153
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,099
...while Commissioner McNeely
was getting beaten...

154
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,561
...in her own front yard
in fashionable Brentwood.

155
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:06,315
McNeely? That's her?

156
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:09,276
Of the mayor's Task Force
on Urban Violence.

157
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,362
A touch of irony, if you
like that sort of thing.

158
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,324
-How is she?
-She was shot, Frank.

159
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,869
She's in lntensive Care.
Shot by one of the rapists.

160
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,330
One of the rapists?

161
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:24,917
Assault. Attempted rape.
That's what they're calling it.

162
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,335
There wasn't any rape.

163
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:29,296
Case is closed.
There's two toes tagged in the morgue.

164
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:33,425
That abandoned car we called in?
The Chevy. That was a stakeout.

165
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,805
No stakeout. A make-out.
Kids who couldn't afford a motel.

166
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:41,266
Kids go to Mulholland.
That's not the pattern.

167
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:44,645
Forget patterns, Frank.
And get the hell off my desk, will you?

168
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,772
Get off!

169
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,777
All right.

170
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,822
It doesn't bother you
that car has no plates?

171
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,199
That it wasn't there
when we came back?

172
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,117
That rapists don't travel in pairs?

173
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:03,914
What bothers me is, some son of
a bitch may ask what you were doing...

174
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,125
...five miles out of your patrol area!

175
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,294
When I talk to you,
I'll look at you.

176
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:12,840
It was my fault. I talked
Murphy into taking us there.

177
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:16,802
You're supposed to be stupid, son.
Don't abuse the privilege.

178
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:20,764
You think I haven't heard about
that silly twit out in Encino?

179
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:26,103
I had 20 years in this outfit when
you were sitting in front of the TV...

180
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,982
...watching Bugs Bunny,
gnawing on your Fudgsicle.

181
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:37,906
Remember, Officer Murphy, there are
people who don't like police officers.

182
00:16:38,357 --> 00:16:42,744
They do not like the idea of
helicopters flying over their homes...

183
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,663
...peeking in their windows.

184
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:47,541
You know what they'll do?
They'll burn you...

185
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,461
...me, your idiotic friend here,
and my whole damn division.

186
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,338
I don't want my division burnt!

187
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,966
So here's the way it's coming down
with you guys!

188
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,970
-You're grounded. Both of you!
-Grounded?

189
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,141
I gotta figure out where to hide you
until this crap blows over.

190
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,476
Get out of here, Lymangood.

191
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,937
I mean, dismissed.

192
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:14,985
Stick around, Frank.

193
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,786
The review board wants to have you
up for psychiatric re-evaluation.

194
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,371
Oh, come on!

195
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,458
What do you expect after your
wig-out last month?

196
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:36,089
But there's a bright side
to this. And a moral.

197
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,800
Morals are good for you.
I love morals.

198
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:43,847
And the moral of this story is:
If you are walking on eggs, don't hop.

199
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:47,434
That's it.

200
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:01,907
Don't hop!

201
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,452
Hello. Listen, it's me.

202
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:33,248
I don't know whether a post card from
Laguna means we're speaking again...

203
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,877
...but call me when you get in, okay?

204
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:41,798
Even if you're not speaking, call me.
Please? Okay, huh? Please, huh?

205
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,972
Hello. I'm back.

206
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:51,600
Is there no getting
rid of this chick?

207
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:57,481
The reason I'm pressing is that
I've got a really big favor l need.

208
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,150
I'm desperate! Desperate!

209
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,820
No matter what time it is, call me.

210
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:06,406
Please. Bye.

211
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,141
Freeze!

212
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:34,684
For chrissake, Murphy!

213
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,773
You wanna get yourself killed?

214
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:43,860
You bozo! How many burglars come
in the front door with a key?

215
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:47,364
-You scared the shit out of me.
-l'm sorry.

216
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:48,949
Came to make friends.

217
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,287
Here's your key.

218
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,001
Well, l guess that makes
that official.

219
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,381
Where's my blender? I need it.

220
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,175
At 3:00 a.m.?

221
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:10,637
You have this problem.
You don't return phone calls.

222
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,347
In the kitchen.

223
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,017
Hold him for me.

224
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,813
This kid must be deaf.

225
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:24,526
-You coming?
-Where?

226
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:27,404
The Shocks' anniversary party.
You remember.

227
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:31,700
Annie's been open for a year now.
We're gonna have guacamole...

228
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:34,244
...and margaritas...

229
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,705
...and chili rellenos--

230
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,710
Fat chance, huh?

231
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,672
That must've been some leave
you had in Laguna.

232
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:49,009
What did you do? Spend all your
time on the pistol range?

233
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,386
Here it is!

234
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:56,099
What's this?

235
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,358
This is beautiful. Really!

236
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,113
-Could I please borrow this--?
-No.

237
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:11,406
I'll wash it.

238
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:14,868
It already belongs to you.
I bought it for your birthday.

239
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,621
-Really?
-l thought l gave you that damn thing.

240
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:20,916
Never mind. This is beautiful.
I love it!

241
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,755
Frank, l miss you.

242
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,715
I don't eat. I don't seem to sleep.

243
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,176
Maybe you ought to trade me
in on a surfer.

244
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:36,139
Well, l tried that once,
but it didn't work.

245
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:39,267
Come to think of it, neither did he.

246
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:41,311
Good night, Murphy.

247
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:45,941
Good night, you little faker.

248
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:48,652
Watch your legs.

249
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,697
Frank...

250
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,410
...we gotta get serious.

251
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,165
Now, l know you have a lot
of problems right now...

252
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:05,126
...and l'd really like to help you.

253
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:07,879
"You can run, but you can't hide."

254
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:12,425
-Joe Louis. That's very good.
-That's what I mean!

255
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:17,264
Frank, l'm gonna have to get tough
on you. Are you ready for that?

256
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:19,516
I'm ready.

257
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:50,297
Five, four, three, two, one....

258
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:52,173
Cue Mario, take one.

259
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:57,053
The top story is still the assault
and attempted rape of Diana McNeely...

260
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,848
...of the mayor's
Task Force on Urban Violence.

261
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,183
McNeely's still on
the critical list.

262
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:05,186
We spoke to Chief Jensen
about the latest news.

263
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:08,148
We have nothing
on the two assailants.

264
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,817
They were without identification...

265
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:14,696
...probably Latin American and almost
certainly illegal aliens.

266
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:17,907
Our fingerprint teams are going
over their car...

267
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,244
...which was stolen from
a Santa Monica parking lot.

268
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:24,789
It is unclear what impact
this incident will have...

269
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:29,377
...on the minority community, and
the increasing racial tensions that--

270
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:31,796
We've just received word...

271
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:36,051
...that Alf Hewitt is standing by
St. Joseph's for a live report.

272
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:39,304
Commissioner Diana McNeely
died at 8:47 a.m...

273
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:42,974
...from a gunshot wound
which penetrated her neck...

274
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:46,353
...and lodged beneath
the third cervical vertebrae.

275
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:48,188
She never regained
consciousness...

276
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,316
...and if she had lived,
would've been paralysed.

277
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:54,611
This is Alf Hewitt,
from St. Joseph's Hospital.

278
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:20,822
I've been trying to reach you. Why
don't you answer your beeper?

279
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:25,785
I just want to tell you that next time
I'm suspended, so's my fucking beeper!

280
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:29,247
-Feel better?
-Yeah, a little.

281
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:33,460
Get down here. We just came
up with a mince pie under each arm.

282
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:45,597
You're back on flying status.

283
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,933
You're assigned a special detail.

284
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,356
This is Mr. Icelan.
Mr. Fletcher of Washington.

285
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:56,774
This is Frank Murphy.

286
00:26:57,226 --> 00:27:01,613
We're glad we found you. We're due
at the weapons testing range at--

287
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,574
-What do they call that place?
-Pinkville.

288
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:08,411
Everything I'm about to tell
you is highly classified.

289
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:13,124
Don't discuss it with anybody. We're
testing a new helicopter prototype.

290
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,668
We've got our own pilot...

291
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,963
...but your city's been chosen
as the testing area...

292
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:22,467
...and your mayor is anxious that
his people participate.

293
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,469
Ours is not to reason why...

294
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:28,556
...ours is but to submit
to the vagaries of local politicians.

295
00:27:48,444 --> 00:27:49,744
Smoke? Frank, is it?

296
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,080
No. Yes.

297
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,542
No: smoke. Yes: Frank.

298
00:27:59,913 --> 00:28:04,050
I understand you flew in Nam, Frank.

299
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,677
That's right.

300
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,972
-Two tours, was it?
-One and a half.

301
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:10,974
Why the foreshortened tour?

302
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,018
You know what they say about
a second chest wound.

303
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,729
It's nature's way of telling you
it's time to go home.

304
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,064
Yeah, right. Right.

305
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:20,066
You gonna tell us
about this special detail?

306
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:24,028
A lot of people are looking
forward to the Olympics out here.

307
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:28,825
For a few short weeks, the attention
of the world will be on this town.

308
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:30,952
Every nutcase and terrorist...

309
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:35,164
...and crazy with a pipe bomb and
a cause is drooling about it.

310
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,584
That's what this detail's all about.

311
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:40,295
The potential for catastrophe.

312
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,506
We don't want any Munich
massacres out here, Frank.

313
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,801
Are you talking about
crowd control from the air?

314
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:49,262
Give that man a cigar.

315
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,307
That's been tried.
It didn't work out so hot.

316
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,475
-Where was that?
-Vietnam.

317
00:28:57,888 --> 00:28:59,689
We added a few new wrinkles.

318
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:03,443
-Such as?
-You'll see, Frank. You'll see.

319
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:28,301
This thing has antiterrorist
capabilities. You saying it's armed?

320
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:31,679
That I am. That it is.

321
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:34,098
That sounds like it now.

322
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,226
It's illegal to arm
police helicopters.

323
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:40,229
That would depend on the
circumstances, wouldn't it?

324
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:42,649
A lot of people ain't gonna like this.

325
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,568
What do you call this,
an "airbuster"?

326
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,072
The Special. But somebody hung
a nickname on it.

327
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:52,450
-What?
-Somebody hung a nickname on it.

328
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,535
Blue Thunder.

329
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:28,945
Okay, gentlemen, you wanna
take your seats? Here she comes.

330
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:34,575
She don't look normal...

331
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:38,955
...she don't fly normal,
because she ain't normal.

332
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,176
This whole ship is heavily armored...

333
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:56,347
...with Nordoc NATO armor
one inch thick.

334
00:30:56,757 --> 00:31:01,561
This ship is equipped with a forward
mounted 20 mm electric cannon.

335
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:04,647
Its six barrels are capable...

336
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:10,153
...of firing 4000 rounds
of ammunition per minute.

337
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,657
And that, gentlemen, is one hell of
a shit storm in anybody's language.

338
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,368
Now, let's take a look...

339
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:20,246
...and watch the lady strut her stuff.

340
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:30,840
The red dummies are terrorists, white
are civilians. Innocent bystanders.

341
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:37,013
The object is for our pilot
to knock out...

342
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:39,640
...the red dummies and the black cars.

343
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,560
He shouldn't touch any of the others.

344
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:47,148
In a riot situation, we just
want to get the bad guys...

345
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,150
...and protect the innocents.

346
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,713
Oh, my God!

347
00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:17,178
That kind of firepower would be
used in our worst-case scenario...

348
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:18,930
...like armed insurrection.

349
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,766
It's comforting to know
you got it on tap.

350
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:23,851
Gentlemen, let me have your attention.

351
00:32:24,302 --> 00:32:26,062
Notice the selectivity of the firing.

352
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:29,774
This is not a strafing run
where you tear up a whole street.

353
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:33,945
This little lady picks her targets
carefully. Now you watch.

354
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:09,981
Look at that. All the red
dummies are blown to hell.

355
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:11,482
And a few white ones.

356
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:16,404
One civilian dead for every 1 0
terrorists. An acceptable ratio.

357
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,240
Unless you're one of the civilians.

358
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:24,537
All right. Last pass, gentlemen.
Anybody wanna bet on the school bus?

359
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,352
We haven't told our pilot
everything about the bus.

360
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:52,106
Let's see if he can pick up
on what's wrong with it.

361
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,008
Damn it! Bloody gun!

362
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,779
Now, if you come down below,
we'll take a closer look...

363
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,783
...and l'll be glad to answer
any questions you may have.

364
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,099
Terrific shooting, colonel.
It was beautiful.

365
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,892
Beautiful, was it?

366
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:12,895
Goddamn it! l had another stoppage.

367
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,902
I nearly killed you
on that second pass.

368
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:22,780
If it happens again,
I'll have their balls.

369
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,241
There's somebody l want you to meet.

370
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,368
Well, what do you know!

371
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:29,495
Friend of yours?

372
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:34,709
An old war buddy. The bastard tried
to have me court-martialled once.

373
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,127
Sorry l brought it up.

374
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:37,586
Look who it isn't.

375
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:40,840
Colonel, this is Captain
Braddock of Astro Division.

376
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:44,635
And Frank Murphy. He'll do
the actual testing over the city.

377
00:35:46,421 --> 00:35:47,471
Finally made colonel?

378
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:50,182
If you're nice, nice things
happen to you.

379
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:52,601
I'll try to remember that.

380
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:56,897
Step this way for any questions.

381
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,861
How did we draw him?

382
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,238
He and his observer
were assigned to us.

383
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:08,075
-l didn't realize you were acquainted.
-Only too well, l'm afraid.

384
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:11,996
I'd have had him up on charges
if he hadn't caught some shrapnel.

385
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:14,999
He's totally unsuitable
for our purpose.

386
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,834
I'll call Mr. Holmes tonight.

387
00:36:17,285 --> 00:36:19,545
Don't bother him.
I think we can handle it.

388
00:36:19,996 --> 00:36:24,133
--30 million candlepower
night sun with an infrared filter.

389
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:27,553
Over here is your TV camera,
with 1 00-to-1 zoom lens.

390
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:32,683
-We could've used this in Nam.
-We could've used something.

391
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:34,935
Do you think you can fly it?

392
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:37,855
You flew it, didn't you?

393
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:42,109
I'll check you out myself.

394
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,362
Be on the pad, 12 sharp.

395
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:47,239
Twelve sharp.

396
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,576
Catch you later.

397
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,496
Stand back from there.

398
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,707
Irritating little cocksucker,
isn't he?

399
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:09,136
-Hey. Tequila breath!
-My man in the sky.

400
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:13,265
-How do you like day shifts?
-My bride's happier. But me?

401
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:17,103
-What's happening?
-l gotta go take a flight check.

402
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:19,355
What do you make of this?

403
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,940
What it is?

404
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:23,859
I found it where
Diana McNeely was killed.

405
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:26,862
I think it's about
that urban violence stuff.

406
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,948
Can you translate this?
It's in Spanish.

407
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,867
I gotta log in, but l'll
get back to you later.

408
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:33,577
Keep it under your hat.

409
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:35,955
Right under the hat.
Look at this!

410
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:38,415
I gotta get dressed.
I'll see you in a second.

411
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,459
Hey, how you doing?
Thanks for the hat.

412
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:42,920
-How's it going?
-What's this "JAFO" shit?

413
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,508
Look up. Look down.
Look left. Look right.

414
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,468
-Don't worry.
-What's JAFO?

415
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,348
You know what Montoya told me?

416
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:57,768
He told me you looped one
of those things. A helicopter.

417
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:00,146
He's putting me on, right?

418
00:38:00,597 --> 00:38:01,480
No, he wasn't.

419
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,566
You actually looped a chopper?

420
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:05,651
-That's right.
-When?

421
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:08,571
When I was young and stupid.

422
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:25,504
You're telling me it was
a complete 360? Right over the top?

423
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:28,507
-A full loop.
-l thought that was impossible.

424
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,594
It is.
It's aerodynamically impossible.

425
00:38:32,003 --> 00:38:34,805
Anyone who tells you any
different is a damn liar.

426
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,476
Now, you take the Ranger
and l'll be in my bird.

427
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:42,980
We'll have a little game.
Follow my leader.

428
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:45,441
Follow my leader.

429
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:50,362
Catch you later.

430
00:38:57,779 --> 00:38:59,997
Murphy, this is Cochrane.

431
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:04,293
Join formation with me, echelon
right. And keep it tight.

432
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:05,586
Roger that, colonel.

433
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,090
Wanna show me that loop, Murphy?

434
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,302
Negatory.

435
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:17,640
I thought so.
Okay, slide over to my left.

436
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,822
Come on, keep it tight.

437
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:35,449
Christ!

438
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,452
Any closer, we start eating blades.

439
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,580
We're following his leader.

440
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,382
Now push it over and pick up speed.

441
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,059
Follow me through
a high-speed climbing turn.

442
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,995
Level out at 500 feet.

443
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,421
All right, Mr. Murphy.
You take the lead.

444
00:40:31,456 --> 00:40:32,256
Roger that.

445
00:40:52,894 --> 00:40:53,986
Damn! Damn it! Shit!

446
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,821
We got a runaway!

447
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:57,948
Jeez! What was that?

448
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,288
Grab your ankles
and kiss your ass goodbye.

449
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:05,748
-We're going down.
-Shit!

450
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:11,295
Mayday! Mayday!

451
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:12,921
We're going down.

452
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:17,301
Willowbrook and Alameda.
Request ambulance, fire.

453
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,598
Shut the fuel off.
Shut the fuel off!

454
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:25,100
What? Fuel?

455
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:36,445
Heads up!

456
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,614
Jesus! Where'd that bus come from?

457
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:41,116
Steady. We're gonna
make a house call.

458
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:58,300
Central, this is Blue Thunder.

459
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:03,305
It seems that we have a ship down,
somewhere in the Watts area.

460
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:11,313
Are you all right?

461
00:42:12,807 --> 00:42:14,650
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

462
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,443
Get the hell off me!

463
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:34,878
I hope you broke your fucking neck!

464
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:38,632
You could've killed half of my crew!

465
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:42,636
You knocked down the whole damn
shack! Get the hell out of here!

466
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,725
-Listen, Dick. Thanks a lot.
-Be careful.

467
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:50,727
-Take care.
-See you.

468
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:05,159
Rather a near thing today.
I heard your turbine failed.

469
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,577
Or was it your flying?

470
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:08,829
Back off, asshole.

471
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:13,041
What's that l hear? Threats?

472
00:43:13,534 --> 00:43:16,795
Well, what a change.
We are acting brave nowadays.

473
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:20,841
Are you threatening me, Murphy?

474
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,845
No, I'm telling you. Back off.

475
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:26,889
Catch you later.

476
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:59,129
-Can l see your watch?
-Sure.

477
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:02,049
You know where it is, don't you?

478
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,176
Are you losing weight?

479
00:44:04,627 --> 00:44:07,262
Getting older too. l think you
have to turn up here.

480
00:44:07,672 --> 00:44:08,931
Getting enough sleep?

481
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,392
Are we having two different
conversations or l am going nuts?

482
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:16,146
The train ride. The train ride.
I'll find it.

483
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:19,608
-lf you don't run out of gas first.
-What?

484
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:23,362
When that needle points to empty,
it means you're out of gas.

485
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:25,614
That's broken.
We got plenty.

486
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,159
Mommy! You missed the train ride.

487
00:44:30,486 --> 00:44:31,662
Hang on.

488
00:44:34,657 --> 00:44:37,292
-Are you crazy?
-This a one-way street!

489
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:39,503
I won't tell if you won't tell!

490
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:44,466
Jeez, look out!

491
00:44:52,884 --> 00:44:55,143
I'll tell you one thing,
it's awfully hard to read.

492
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:57,563
-Yeah, I know.
-lt's part of a letter.

493
00:44:58,014 --> 00:45:02,442
It says something about strangers
in the barrio making trouble.

494
00:45:02,894 --> 00:45:05,821
I don't know. Something
like that. Here's a word...

495
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:08,824
...that isn't in Spanish:
"Thor."

496
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,535
T-H-O-R.

497
00:45:11,986 --> 00:45:14,413
-Thor? No.
-Mean anything?

498
00:45:16,324 --> 00:45:19,835
Strangers in the barrio
making trouble.

499
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:24,423
I don't know.

500
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:29,761
Maybe I've been in this too long, but
I think something bad's coming down.

501
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:33,807
Most of the official family
of Los Angeles, led by the mayor...

502
00:45:34,217 --> 00:45:37,311
...and the City Council, gathered
with family members...

503
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,731
...and members of the black community
at McNeely's funeral...

504
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:44,026
...who was tragically murdered
several days ago.

505
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:45,277
Food's up!

506
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:48,196
McNeely, who chaired
the Commission on Urban Violence...

507
00:45:48,648 --> 00:45:51,783
...was an outspoken critic of
police department policies.

508
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:55,412
The chief was in evidence as were
many of his aides.

509
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:59,082
As temperatures stay high
and tempers continue to fray...

510
00:45:59,534 --> 00:46:02,085
...fires continue in
the Watts area...

511
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:06,131
...the City of lndustry, Pacoima
and East Los Angeles.

512
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:09,468
You want ketchup on your sandwich?

513
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:15,515
Now where did he go?

514
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:17,392
Hey, Frank.

515
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,312
Frank, did you say you wanted--?

516
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,776
Frank?

517
00:46:27,395 --> 00:46:29,279
Frank, are you okay?

518
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:43,251
Frank.

519
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:48,048
Is this something kinky?

520
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:56,723
Goddamn your black Irish heart...

521
00:46:57,133 --> 00:46:59,935
...Frances McNeil Murphy,
if you've left!

522
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:10,422
These are your television monitors.
You have three.

523
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:13,675
The one in the center ties into
all your computer banks.

524
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,761
The switches:

525
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:17,554
Night vision.

526
00:48:18,005 --> 00:48:20,390
Infrared filter. Target system.

527
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,852
Whisper mode
so you can travel silent.

528
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:28,398
Audio, which controls your
outside mikes which are here.

529
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:29,858
What's the sensitivity?

530
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:32,569
You can hear a mouse fart
at 2000 feet.

531
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:38,325
Now, gentlemen. This is your
Harrison fire control helmet.

532
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:41,077
This baby is the heart of your system.

533
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:43,997
Let's take a look
and see how she works.

534
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:48,418
Watch this.

535
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:55,175
It superimposes the gun cues
on the real world.

536
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:58,178
Wherever you look, the guns follow.

537
00:48:59,755 --> 00:49:01,723
You can zero in on
any target you want...

538
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:05,185
...just by putting the green
tracer line on your target.

539
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:11,525
-You wanna give it a shot?
-Yeah.

540
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:20,283
What's that, 3/4-inch video?

541
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:22,077
You know something about it?

542
00:49:22,528 --> 00:49:25,497
-That was my rate in the Navy.
-What ship?

543
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:28,875
-Midway.
-No shit. l was on the Forrestal.

544
00:49:29,326 --> 00:49:31,711
It's a hell of a setup.
Let me show you.

545
00:49:32,163 --> 00:49:34,881
It goes in a locked memory bank
here in the belly.

546
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,218
Each reel is code-numbered.

547
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:45,016
This little bug erases the tape on
a signal from Central Command.

548
00:49:45,468 --> 00:49:47,978
The tape's gotta be inside
the case to erase.

549
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:51,439
It only erases in the case?
That's great.

550
00:49:51,891 --> 00:49:55,151
Adjust for your eye until the red
dot rides on your tracer line.

551
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:59,531
Then press the cannon button and zap!
Where you look is where you hit.

552
00:49:59,982 --> 00:50:02,450
Sunshine! Just blew your
gizzard away.

553
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:07,205
What's all this shit l hear
about you threatening Cochrane?

554
00:50:08,741 --> 00:50:10,333
Thank you, sergeant.

555
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:13,670
What?

556
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:17,299
In the police garage.
After your crack-up.

557
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,301
Feeling a little hostility?

558
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,386
I told him to back off, that's all.

559
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:23,471
That's all? Well, it's enough.

560
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:28,518
They don't care if you kill yourself.
They got $5 million in this aircraft.

561
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:30,812
They don't want to see it totaled.

562
00:50:31,263 --> 00:50:32,480
Some kind of bullshit.

563
00:50:35,184 --> 00:50:36,443
Hey.

564
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:39,946
If you want my opinion...

565
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:43,491
...l think the feds are after your ass.
Better watch it.

566
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:47,454
Okay, thanks.

567
00:50:50,157 --> 00:50:53,710
Hey, Matusek? How do you control
the oscillation of the quartz?

568
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,298
It's the difference between the output
of the generator signals. See?

569
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:01,009
Hey, Jafo. This isn't
any night school.

570
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,511
We got a test flight
to make out there.

571
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:08,308
-Good night.
-Good night, kid. Take it easy.

572
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,820
-Big Brother, on or off?
-What's Big Brother?

573
00:51:21,272 --> 00:51:23,740
The cabin mike.
It records everything we say.

574
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:25,867
I think we can lose that.

575
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:28,328
I got the fuse right here.

576
00:51:29,446 --> 00:51:31,456
Get your hat off those
circuit breakers.

577
00:51:31,907 --> 00:51:34,542
Tell me what JAFO is.
I'm putting the fuse here.

578
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:37,170
You'll find out. Just be patient.

579
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:40,090
Night vision. Checked, okay.

580
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,717
Target systems checked, okay.

581
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,513
Let's see what's on HBO tonight, okay?
Check.

582
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:50,850
Blue Thunder to tower,
requests permission for takeoff.

583
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:55,689
Blue Thunder, Tower unable to issue
departure clearance at this time.

584
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,275
This isn't a very good idea.
He hasn't even got clearance.

585
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:01,736
It's just an orientation flight.

586
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:05,657
Holmes is arriving tonight.
Let him take care of it.

587
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:07,784
-What do you want?
-Clear him.

588
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:11,705
Blue Thunder, Tower.
Wind 330 degrees at 1 5.

589
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:13,581
Clear for takeoff.

590
00:52:19,455 --> 00:52:21,965
Roger, Tower.
Blue Thunder off at 2030.

591
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:26,511
Be coming to you.
Traffic advisories.

592
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:29,222
Let's hope he knows what he's doing.

593
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:48,116
How does she fly?

594
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,493
It's nose-heavier than the ayatollah.

595
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:54,247
-You're crazy. This stuff's great.
-Great, huh?

596
00:52:56,033 --> 00:52:59,961
-Okay, let's see what this turkey's got.
-Let's go!

597
00:53:30,526 --> 00:53:31,367
Hey. Hey.

598
00:53:31,735 --> 00:53:34,496
-Orbit right. Orbit right.
-What?

599
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:37,123
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

600
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:38,583
You gotta hear this.

601
00:53:38,993 --> 00:53:42,879
I wondered if you knew where a guy
could get something good to eat.

602
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,549
It depends on what a guy's
hungry for. Know what I mean?

603
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:48,384
I'm going to video.

604
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:51,429
A little sushi would be nice.

605
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,933
-Sushi?
-Remember the last time we did this?

606
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:59,145
-Try the zoom.
-Zoom, right.

607
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,314
Seventy-five?

608
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:04,442
Are we talking about American money?

609
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,402
We certainly are.

610
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:08,029
Come on, lady. You know--

611
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:13,326
Look at this. Hot Chihuahua!

612
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:15,829
Honey, that's a little steep.

613
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,123
I want it! I want it!

614
00:54:18,574 --> 00:54:21,167
Let's lose this asshole.
He's breaking my heart.

615
00:54:21,618 --> 00:54:23,336
Come on. We gotta go to work.

616
00:54:24,788 --> 00:54:26,297
Bye-bye.

617
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:36,766
I dig this police work.

618
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:38,935
Yeah. You're breathing heavy.

619
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:42,730
All right, here goes the whisper mode.

620
00:54:43,182 --> 00:54:44,315
Whisper mode.

621
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,234
That's a check.

622
00:54:51,273 --> 00:54:52,198
Hey, that's smooth!

623
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:54,367
Forest Lawn.

624
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:02,208
Hey. Check this place over here
at 3:30.

625
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:04,544
Is that a state cycle in the driveway?

626
00:55:05,412 --> 00:55:07,755
-That's highway patrol.
-Can you make the licence?

627
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:10,216
-Can you bring it around?
-Yeah.

628
00:55:20,427 --> 00:55:22,770
That's 221 Bravo 6.

629
00:55:23,222 --> 00:55:27,734
I know that cycle.
Jack Moran. Double Dork.

630
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:29,777
Double Dork?

631
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:31,279
Try that thermograph.

632
00:55:31,688 --> 00:55:33,781
Thermograph.
Cutting in thermograph.

633
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:35,450
Coming in.

634
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:38,995
The motor looks hot.

635
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:41,706
It hasn't been there too long.

636
00:55:42,324 --> 00:55:45,668
-Want me to see if the owner's home?
-Sure. Can we do it?

637
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,005
That guy, Matusek,
he cleared me this morning.

638
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:51,716
This sucker'll do everything
but cook your breakfast.

639
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:57,388
H-23.

640
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,807
Let's see, the house is right here.

641
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:02,644
-She's there!
-How does the computer know?

642
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:05,188
They clear it with their
security patrol...

643
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:07,815
...and then they zap it right to us.

644
00:56:14,523 --> 00:56:16,157
Let the good times roll!

645
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,748
No. No.

646
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:26,251
Not yet. Not yet.

647
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,419
I'm not ready!

648
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:35,802
Stupid putz!

649
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:38,972
Sounds like old Double Dork
is missing a step or two.

650
00:56:39,548 --> 00:56:41,808
-We recorded all this?
-lt's all on tape.

651
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:44,102
Locked in the memory bank
in the belly.

652
00:56:44,553 --> 00:56:48,273
I think old Double Dork's
entitled to a quickie. Don't you?

653
00:56:48,682 --> 00:56:49,899
Absolutely.

654
00:56:50,476 --> 00:56:51,943
Can you erase that tape?

655
00:56:52,352 --> 00:56:54,570
The memory bank's locked,
but I can get in.

656
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,155
Good.

657
00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:04,497
This mother hears through walls,
fires 4000 rounds a minute...

658
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:07,625
...and peeks down dresses at
1 000 feet. Jesus Christ!

659
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:12,255
This terminal here is hooked
into every data bank that there is.

660
00:57:12,664 --> 00:57:14,716
A dozen of these and you
could run the country.

661
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,844
Watch this.
I feed it my name, right?

662
00:57:23,717 --> 00:57:25,977
They got your whole life in here.

663
00:57:26,845 --> 00:57:28,271
Hit mine.

664
00:57:29,723 --> 00:57:31,274
Murphy...

665
00:57:31,683 --> 00:57:33,526
...Frankie.

666
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,789
File under repair?

667
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:49,500
Did you break your file?
That's weird.

668
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,502
Special Base to Blue Thunder.

669
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:53,046
Blue Thunder.

670
00:57:53,497 --> 00:57:56,632
-lt's a wrap tonight. Come on home.
-1 0-4.

671
00:57:57,042 --> 00:57:58,926
Right, I'd better get going.

672
00:57:59,753 --> 00:58:01,846
You'd better go too, Mr. Fletcher.

673
00:58:03,048 --> 00:58:05,600
I'll come along there when he's in.

674
00:58:05,968 --> 00:58:07,352
Yeah, right.

675
00:58:16,937 --> 00:58:20,114
Blue Thunder, wind 270 degrees at 1 2.

676
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:22,408
Blue Thunder to base,
final approach.

677
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:27,246
Altimeter, two-niner-niner-five.
Cleared to land.

678
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:46,974
Does Cochrane drive a gray Corvette?

679
00:58:47,342 --> 00:58:48,142
Yeah. Why?

680
00:58:48,594 --> 00:58:51,229
Check 9:00.
He's in some kind of hurry.

681
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:54,107
Oh, yeah.

682
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:00,738
Listen. Check Cochrane out.

683
00:59:01,189 --> 00:59:03,866
-On the computer?
-Yeah. I'm gonna tag along.

684
00:59:14,911 --> 00:59:16,337
Blue Thunder, this is Tower.

685
00:59:16,788 --> 00:59:18,506
Do you copy?
Is there a problem?

686
00:59:18,915 --> 00:59:21,926
That's Cochrane, F.E., U.S. Army.

687
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:25,179
F.E. What's F.E. stand for?

688
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:27,140
"Fuck Everybody."

689
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:28,474
Gnarly!

690
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:31,686
We're almost there.

691
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:34,856
This is Tower. Do you copy?

692
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:38,609
Base, you're coming in garbled.
Can't read you.

693
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:39,777
I got Washington.

694
00:59:43,065 --> 00:59:43,948
Go for it.

695
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:47,785
Cannot read you, Special Base.
Still garbled.

696
00:59:48,195 --> 00:59:50,288
Blue Thunder, come in.
Do you read me?

697
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:54,250
Breaking up, Special Base.
Can't read you. Still garbled.

698
00:59:57,663 --> 00:59:58,754
Here it comes.

699
01:00:05,921 --> 01:00:08,681
"Project Thor." Wait.
Find out what that is.

700
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:11,017
Request information:

701
01:00:12,761 --> 01:00:15,980
Thor Project.

702
01:00:24,773 --> 01:00:26,616
I got it. Here it comes.

703
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:31,579
"Tactical Helicopter
Offensive Response."

704
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,417
Offensive Response?

705
01:00:37,536 --> 01:00:38,794
What does that mean?

706
01:00:39,413 --> 01:00:43,090
Washington's jerking us around.
They've got bigger plans for this.

707
01:00:47,671 --> 01:00:50,723
-Blue Thunder, you will acknowledge.
-Oh, shit!

708
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:54,310
Blue Thunder to Special Base--

709
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:57,021
Oh, shit!

710
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:16,582
-He's going in there.
-Yeah.

711
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:17,792
Where are we?

712
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,752
-Federal Building.
-Really?

713
01:01:20,787 --> 01:01:22,171
Wanna find out what's going on?

714
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:24,507
Certainly.
Here goes the whisper mode.

715
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:39,814
You get anything?

716
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:43,150
I just had a good shot of
some guys emptying trash.

717
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,402
Can't use it.

718
01:01:44,853 --> 01:01:47,321
Goddamn it to hell!
What's going on out there?

719
01:01:47,731 --> 01:01:50,449
I'm holding you responsible
for that man's behavior.

720
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:53,953
Dr. Haycock strongly recommended
he be grounded.

721
01:01:54,446 --> 01:01:56,247
For your information, Mr. lcelan...

722
01:01:56,656 --> 01:01:59,792
...there are no paranoid
schizophrenics on duty here.

723
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:02,295
He checks his sanity with
his wristwatch!

724
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:05,423
What do you check yours with?
A dipstick?

725
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,010
I don't have to take crap from you.

726
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:10,428
He's finished as of now.

727
01:02:10,879 --> 01:02:13,431
If there's a scratch
on that aircraft, so are you.

728
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:15,891
All right, try the thermograph.

729
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:22,481
I told you it was cool.

730
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:24,567
Lovely, lovely!

731
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:31,115
-Park here.
-l'll bring it around.

732
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:32,491
I got something!

733
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:41,334
-lt locked!
-Yeah. Hold it, hold it.

734
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,381
l still fail to understand.

735
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:51,677
The Astro Division is autonomous.
The man was assigned to us.

736
01:02:52,087 --> 01:02:53,846
-McNeely complicated it.
-Fletcher!

737
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:58,392
I can't say you people have
covered yourselves with glory so far.

738
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:02,980
If she hadn't started shouting,
we wouldn't have had to rough her up.

739
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:04,732
Rough her up?

740
01:03:06,476 --> 01:03:08,611
Is that a euphemism
for "assassination"?

741
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,989
She had street informants,
and she'd made the connection...

742
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:15,201
...between our project
and the trouble in the streets.

743
01:03:15,652 --> 01:03:17,828
She was going public, on the record.

744
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,747
Who are these other guys?

745
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,166
-They can't hear me.
-Shut up anyway!

746
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:25,795
-This pilot--
-Murphy. Frank Murphy.

747
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:28,839
ls that under control?
I don't want attention.

748
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:31,384
Blue Thunder might be perceived
as a threat.

749
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:34,303
-Drop the hammer on him.
-What do you think?

750
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:38,265
I think, Mr. Holmes,
that I should take him out.

751
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:40,101
You mean kill him?

752
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:43,062
-When?
-As soon as possible.

753
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:45,064
Jesus Christ, Frank!

754
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,650
The boy loves me!
You got this on tape?

755
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:49,944
-l got every word of it.
-Good.

756
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:52,196
Give him all the help he needs.

757
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:54,407
This conversation never took place.

758
01:03:54,816 --> 01:03:56,450
If it gets back to me, I'll deny it.

759
01:04:01,948 --> 01:04:03,457
Oh, shit!

760
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:11,173
We're in deep shit!
Let's get the hell out!

761
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:29,525
Tower, we have 330 degrees and 1 5.

762
01:04:29,976 --> 01:04:32,903
Altimeter still 3000.
Clear to land?

763
01:04:34,105 --> 01:04:36,574
Air-1 2 traffic, 1 :00
two miles north-eastbound.

764
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:38,951
lt's a Cessna 1 82 at 5000 VFR.

765
01:04:39,402 --> 01:04:42,705
Blue Thunder down at 21 30.

766
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,417
Captain wants to see you
in the office right away.

767
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:50,588
-l'll get the tape's keycard.
-Be careful.

768
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:57,219
Yes, sir. I will.

769
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,015
Well, sir, he's--
He's not that--

770
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:04,351
Very well, sir.

771
01:05:05,095 --> 01:05:06,020
I will.

772
01:05:07,806 --> 01:05:09,482
All right, sir. l will.

773
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:11,233
Yes, thank you.

774
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:16,322
-Did you have a nice flight?
-l enjoyed it.

775
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:18,908
I hope so. lt's
your last for a while.

776
01:05:19,317 --> 01:05:21,494
-Now listen, Jack--
-No, you listen.

777
01:05:21,903 --> 01:05:23,162
That's how it is from now on:

778
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:25,331
Me captain, you cop.
Me talk, you listen.

779
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:28,876
If l don't have an ass
when l get out of this chair...

780
01:05:29,285 --> 01:05:31,295
...it's because
the old man chewed it off.

781
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:44,391
You're beautiful when you're angry,
but let's talk privately.

782
01:05:44,843 --> 01:05:47,311
We don't have any secrets
from Mr. Icelan.

783
01:05:47,887 --> 01:05:50,856
You're off the program, Frank.
You and your buddy Lymangood.

784
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:53,567
I'll be lucky if I'm not
in Pacoima tomorrow...

785
01:05:53,977 --> 01:05:55,236
...driving a black-and-white.

786
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,032
Captain Braddock speaking.

787
01:06:00,692 --> 01:06:02,159
Yes, sir.
He's here, colonel.

788
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,080
Icelan.

789
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,752
Guys, don't forget
to check under the hood.

790
01:06:12,203 --> 01:06:14,004
Just gonna get my cuff links.

791
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:28,561
Who are you conning
with that phony radio bullshit?

792
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:32,898
For chrissakes, that went out 3 days
after Marconi invented it!

793
01:06:38,271 --> 01:06:39,864
Captain Braddock speaking.

794
01:06:42,442 --> 01:06:43,409
Yes, sir.

795
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,829
Yes, sir.
It's taken care of.

796
01:07:05,507 --> 01:07:06,891
Who unlocked the memory bank?

797
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,934
That tall numb-nuts cop.

798
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:12,187
-Lymangood?
-You got it.

799
01:07:13,014 --> 01:07:13,814
Son of a bitch!

800
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:49,975
Hey!

801
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,482
Get his gun!

802
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:08,535
Take it easy.

803
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:11,830
Pay attention. Pay attention!

804
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:15,084
-We don't wanna hurt you.
-We want the tape.

805
01:08:16,202 --> 01:08:17,252
Let's be reasonable.

806
01:08:17,704 --> 01:08:19,922
You'll tell us what we wanna know
sooner or later.

807
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:22,633
And l think you'd rather it be sooner.

808
01:08:23,793 --> 01:08:27,262
Because first, we're gonna
break your fingers...

809
01:08:27,672 --> 01:08:30,975
...then your arm,
then maybe your knees.

810
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,770
Now, l know you don't believe me...

811
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,939
...so l'm gonna show you.

812
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:48,659
Now, can it be sooner?

813
01:08:50,486 --> 01:08:51,328
The tape.

814
01:08:52,363 --> 01:08:53,747
It's in your car?

815
01:08:56,326 --> 01:08:57,501
Check the car.

816
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:17,479
You wanna tell us where it is?

817
01:09:22,518 --> 01:09:26,488
You wanna write it down?
Thattaboy!

818
01:11:42,075 --> 01:11:45,002
All units, detain
and hold for questioning...

819
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:46,628
...Officer Frank Murphy...

820
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:49,381
...in connection with the death
of Officer Lymangood.

821
01:11:49,832 --> 01:11:52,676
Possibly driving
a black '79 Trans Am...

822
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:55,637
...California license,
909 King-Edward-Boy.

823
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:58,307
I want to get a confirmation on that.

824
01:11:58,716 --> 01:12:00,392
This is Air-1 2 to Central.

825
01:12:00,843 --> 01:12:03,228
Can we get a confirmation
on that dispatch?

826
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,941
Black '79 Trans Am. California
license 909 King-Edward-Boy.

827
01:12:08,393 --> 01:12:11,445
Officer Frank Murphy.
Detain and hold for questioning...

828
01:12:11,854 --> 01:12:15,199
...in connection with the death
of Officer Richard Lymangood.

829
01:12:38,172 --> 01:12:39,806
So far, so good.

830
01:12:40,216 --> 01:12:43,977
Check out Big Brother's tape
in Blue Thunder to learn more.

831
01:12:46,305 --> 01:12:50,067
I just heard about Lymangood.
I'm really sorry.

832
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:52,527
Call me if you want to talk.

833
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:35,737
-Here's your tea, colonel.
-Thank you.

834
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:38,115
Why don't we just blank the tape?

835
01:13:38,566 --> 01:13:41,118
That's what it's
designed for, right?

836
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:45,122
They tell me Lymangood changed
the code numbers.

837
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:48,834
To go through every possible
combination would take forever.

838
01:13:53,414 --> 01:13:55,507
The trouble is,
we don't have forever.

839
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:24,077
Hey, boss. How's it going?

840
01:14:24,487 --> 01:14:26,204
Listen, l got the tape...

841
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:29,416
...but it's not safe
to take it home.

842
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:33,170
So I'm gonna--
There's this drive-in that I go to...

843
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:36,423
...at Riverside and Victory,
on the corner.

844
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:39,968
There's a dumpster in the back,
behind the concession stand.

845
01:14:40,419 --> 01:14:43,472
And I'm pretty sure
they don't empty it until Monday.

846
01:14:43,923 --> 01:14:46,808
So that's where l'm gonna
stash the tape, okay?

847
01:14:47,927 --> 01:14:52,230
This is getting kind of fun, huh?
Cops and robbers, for real!

848
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,107
Well....

849
01:14:54,934 --> 01:14:57,569
Good luck if you should decide
to accept this mission.

850
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:00,155
This is Lymangood.

851
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,951
I forgot to tell you.
l found out what "JAFO" is:

852
01:15:05,361 --> 01:15:08,705
"Just Another Fucking Observer."

853
01:15:11,617 --> 01:15:14,753
You're not supposed to be in there.
Get the fuck out!

854
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,217
You talking to me, asshole?

855
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:57,462
Damn. Murphy!

856
01:16:11,969 --> 01:16:13,812
This is Special Base.
Come in.

857
01:16:20,436 --> 01:16:21,278
Shit!

858
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:25,657
Los Angeles mobile.

859
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:28,076
Mobile, listen. Get me KBLA-TV.

860
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:30,287
That number's in your directory.

861
01:16:30,738 --> 01:16:33,373
Don't give me static.
This is a police emergency.

862
01:16:33,783 --> 01:16:34,708
Get me KBLA now!

863
01:16:36,952 --> 01:16:39,045
Good afternoon, KBLA-TV.

864
01:16:39,497 --> 01:16:42,132
I want to speak to Mario Machado
or Alf Hewitt.

865
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:45,135
They're out in the field.
Wanna leave a message?

866
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:47,762
Tell them
Officer Frank Murphy is calling.

867
01:16:48,214 --> 01:16:50,474
I'm sending them a package.
Do you read me?

868
01:16:50,883 --> 01:16:52,184
That's Frank Astro?

869
01:16:52,635 --> 01:16:55,061
No, Frank Murphy. Astro Division...

870
01:16:55,513 --> 01:16:57,772
...police emergency.
Got it, sweetheart?

871
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:01,485
-Yeah, I got it.
-Okay. Mobile? Mobile?

872
01:17:01,894 --> 01:17:04,529
-Los Angeles mobile.
-Listen, I need another number.

873
01:17:08,442 --> 01:17:10,494
-Hello?
-Kate, it's Frank.

874
01:17:10,903 --> 01:17:12,704
Where are you?
I've been worried sick.

875
01:17:13,114 --> 01:17:16,166
I'm okay. Do me a favor
and pick up a package for me.

876
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:19,669
It's in a drive-in at the corner
of Victory and Riverside.

877
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:22,589
lt's near the concession stand,
in a dumpster.

878
01:17:22,998 --> 01:17:25,550
-And then what?
-Take it to KBLA-TV.

879
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:27,677
To Mario Machado or Alf Hewitt.

880
01:17:28,087 --> 01:17:30,931
-Don't stop for anything or anybody.
-Got it.

881
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:33,266
-Okay. Thank you, baby.
-Bye.

882
01:17:41,559 --> 01:17:42,359
Where is he now?

883
01:17:42,768 --> 01:17:45,362
Over the Hollywood
and Ventura Freeway interchange.

884
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:48,448
Get the mayor's office on the phone.

885
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:50,992
We're gonna get the Air Force,
and now!

886
01:17:51,444 --> 01:17:55,956
He called Channel 8 first.
The second call was to his girlfriend.

887
01:17:56,365 --> 01:18:00,585
Forget about the police. Get our own
cars to her place and that TV station!

888
01:18:01,036 --> 01:18:02,837
The bastard wants to go public!

889
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,173
-We'll stop that.
-We'd better!

890
01:19:27,873 --> 01:19:29,341
Come on, move out!

891
01:19:32,044 --> 01:19:32,969
Move, move!

892
01:20:27,725 --> 01:20:30,151
-Damn it, l can't see nothing!
-There she goes!

893
01:21:36,877 --> 01:21:42,515
Air-7 to Special One.

894
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,104
No shit, pendejo!

895
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:50,148
Set that thing down, man.

896
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,067
We got two choppers full
of SWAT guys.

897
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:59,616
It's getting real cozy up here.

898
01:22:00,234 --> 01:22:02,410
Return to base
or we're gonna open fire.

899
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:08,416
Come on, will you, Murphy?

900
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:13,046
All right, knock him down.

901
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,471
Okay, amigo, how's
your auto-rotation technique?

902
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:26,726
Son of a bitch!

903
01:22:39,732 --> 01:22:40,698
Damn it! Hang on!

904
01:22:45,029 --> 01:22:46,204
Sorry about that, my friend.

905
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,175
Not again!

906
01:22:59,585 --> 01:23:02,720
All right, chaps.
How'd you like to follow my leader?

907
01:24:32,052 --> 01:24:33,102
-Pull up now!
-Pull up!

908
01:25:21,476 --> 01:25:23,236
Okay, lady! Pull over!

909
01:25:34,823 --> 01:25:36,040
Is there a problem, officer?

910
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:38,126
A den mother in a Vega, right?

911
01:25:38,577 --> 01:25:42,672
Now play it very cool. l need
your license and your registration.

912
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:43,881
Sure.

913
01:25:49,963 --> 01:25:52,515
-l think l left them--
-Get out of the car.

914
01:27:01,451 --> 01:27:06,255
Channel 8 is bringing you live
coverage of a helicopter hijacking.

915
01:27:06,832 --> 01:27:10,593
Stay inside your homes.
There's a sniper over Los Angeles.

916
01:27:11,044 --> 01:27:13,971
We've already lost one police car
and two helicopters.

917
01:27:14,423 --> 01:27:16,224
Well, what now, gentlemen?

918
01:27:16,675 --> 01:27:18,684
I don't plan on losing
more helicopters.

919
01:27:19,136 --> 01:27:21,354
May I introduce Colonel Coe
of the Air Force?

920
01:27:21,722 --> 01:27:22,688
-Colonel.
Mr. Mayor.

921
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:25,441
A couple of F-1 6s are standing by
at March Field.

922
01:27:25,892 --> 01:27:27,568
-F-1 6s?
-We can take him out now.

923
01:27:28,228 --> 01:27:32,532
-All you've got to do is say the word.
-The F-1 6 is armed with rockets.

924
01:27:32,983 --> 01:27:35,952
The potential destruction
of innocent life is unimaginable.

925
01:27:36,403 --> 01:27:38,788
The F-1 6 is armed
with heat-seeking missiles.

926
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:41,415
We can surgically remove him.
Like a tumor.

927
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:43,584
We're not talking about a tumor.

928
01:27:51,376 --> 01:27:53,177
You gotta make a right there!

929
01:27:57,632 --> 01:27:59,225
No, Kate.

930
01:28:14,608 --> 01:28:16,742
You're really riding with the angels,
sweetheart.

931
01:28:45,806 --> 01:28:47,899
Thattagirl.
Good work!

932
01:29:03,532 --> 01:29:08,336
Ray lcelan at Astro says they've
scrambled two F-1 6s out of March.

933
01:29:08,787 --> 01:29:11,047
-What about the tape?
-No sign of it.

934
01:29:11,498 --> 01:29:14,508
But he called KBLA.
Fletcher's there to intercept.

935
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,011
I'll take care
of you one at a time.

936
01:29:17,462 --> 01:29:20,431
We'll have more help down here.
Just be calm.

937
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:25,478
Sir! Sir! l've got to give this tape
to Mr. Machado or Abe Hewitt.

938
01:29:25,929 --> 01:29:29,440
-They're very busy right now.
-Yes, but this is from Frank Murphy.

939
01:29:29,891 --> 01:29:33,819
There's a crazy man in a helicopter.
I'll tell somebody you're here.

940
01:29:34,271 --> 01:29:36,906
The most dangerous thing
is a man afraid for his job.

941
01:29:37,357 --> 01:29:40,660
I'm Dick Fisher.
I'll get that to Mario if you'd like.

942
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:43,371
No, I have to give this to
Mr. Mocher or--

943
01:29:43,822 --> 01:29:44,872
Machado.

944
01:29:45,323 --> 01:29:48,584
I'm his producer. l'd be delighted
to bring it up to him.

945
01:29:49,453 --> 01:29:50,336
I don't think so.

946
01:29:50,787 --> 01:29:53,297
Can't we erase it?
Isn't that what the bug's for?

947
01:29:53,748 --> 01:29:55,591
We don't know the code number.

948
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:58,803
Then erase them all.

949
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:03,641
-Why don't you give it to me--?
-Frank said to give it to Mr. Hewitt--

950
01:30:04,092 --> 01:30:07,478
I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady
with the tape from Frank Murphy?

951
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:09,480
Your producer said that Mr.--

952
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:13,943
Who? I never saw this guy before
in my life. Come on, let's go.

953
01:30:14,394 --> 01:30:16,529
Not so fast.
That's government property.

954
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,448
-Get your hands off me!
-Stop him!

955
01:30:20,692 --> 01:30:22,493
Get this bastard off me!

956
01:30:23,862 --> 01:30:25,746
Son of a bitch!
I'll blow your head off!

957
01:30:27,908 --> 01:30:29,917
Go, go, go! l got the tape!

958
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,739
March Control,
this is Little Brother One.

959
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:04,368
We have your target bearing 1 21
at 1 3 miles.

960
01:31:04,819 --> 01:31:06,662
Request clearance to engage.
Over.

961
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,000
Roger, Little Brother.
This is March Control.

962
01:31:11,451 --> 01:31:13,544
Affirmative.
Engage and destroy.

963
01:31:14,329 --> 01:31:16,422
I repeat:
Engage and destroy.

964
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:31,187
There he is.
He's all yours, cookie.

965
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:35,876
Holy shit!

966
01:32:49,299 --> 01:32:50,182
What?

967
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:53,727
Well, l'll be damned.

968
01:32:55,263 --> 01:32:59,400
One of your missiles just took out
a barbeque shack down in Little Tokyo.

969
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:02,987
-Francis, isn't that Ray's district?
-Yes, it is.

970
01:33:03,438 --> 01:33:04,405
You have his number?

971
01:33:04,814 --> 01:33:07,741
Call him, or they'll call him
and he'll call us....

972
01:33:08,193 --> 01:33:09,618
I'm on my way!

973
01:33:49,609 --> 01:33:51,327
There he is, right there!

974
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:56,957
All right, everybody,
this is an emergency!

975
01:33:57,409 --> 01:34:00,002
-All right, clear the area.
-Clear the area!

976
01:34:06,418 --> 01:34:07,801
Well, what do you know!

977
01:34:08,503 --> 01:34:09,512
He froze.

978
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:13,516
Okay, he's all mine now, Cookie.

979
01:34:43,621 --> 01:34:44,964
Oh, my God!

980
01:35:09,105 --> 01:35:10,573
l'm hit, cookie!
I'm hit!

981
01:35:11,024 --> 01:35:12,408
He blew my goddamn wing off!

982
01:35:13,276 --> 01:35:14,326
Mayday! Mayday!

983
01:35:14,778 --> 01:35:17,371
This is Little Brother One.
I'm ejecting!

984
01:35:54,317 --> 01:35:57,828
We just lost an F-1 6 and the top
of the Arco Tower. Now what?

985
01:35:58,279 --> 01:35:59,872
That's it. Call it off.

986
01:36:00,281 --> 01:36:04,376
May I remind you there is a crazy man
up there with six 20 mm cannons?

987
01:36:04,786 --> 01:36:05,878
I said, call it off.

988
01:36:06,746 --> 01:36:08,589
Request permission for takeoff.

989
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,009
Colonel, hold your position.
Operation canceled.

990
01:36:12,502 --> 01:36:16,138
Repeat: Hold your position.
Do not take off.

991
01:37:51,601 --> 01:37:52,401
Back to base.

992
01:38:04,572 --> 01:38:07,875
Rough her up? Is that a
euphemism for "assassination"?

993
01:38:08,326 --> 01:38:13,255
She had street informants, and she'd
connected our project to the trouble--

994
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,674
Jesus, Lollie,
you ought to hear this stuff.

995
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:17,968
They sound like cops and feds.

996
01:38:18,419 --> 01:38:22,306
They're stirring up the barrio
to prove what that chopper can do.

997
01:38:23,716 --> 01:38:26,393
Tell Mario to go easy
on that "mad-sniper" stuff.

998
01:38:26,803 --> 01:38:30,063
That cop may be the hottest
ticket since Horatius at the bridge.

999
01:39:40,418 --> 01:39:42,010
All right, let's try this.

1000
01:40:39,018 --> 01:40:40,694
All right, where are you?

1001
01:41:15,972 --> 01:41:17,356
Oh, damn it!

1002
01:42:00,433 --> 01:42:04,528
All right, Murphy. It's about time you
put your money where your mouth is.

1003
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:16,331
One, two...

1004
01:42:16,741 --> 01:42:17,582
...three!

1005
01:42:34,175 --> 01:42:36,351
Come on, you tub of shit!

1006
01:42:47,521 --> 01:42:48,822
That's impossible!

1007
01:43:06,749 --> 01:43:07,549
Catch you later.

1008
01:43:59,552 --> 01:44:02,854
Okay. And now it's your turn.

1009
01:44:56,776 --> 01:45:01,705
The $5 million prototype was destroyed
when Officer Murphy, out of gas...

1010
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:06,626
...set the helicopter down on the
tracks in front of a freight train.

1011
01:45:07,078 --> 01:45:10,172
That was the end of the helicopter,
but not of this story.

1012
01:45:10,623 --> 01:45:14,426
On the strength of a tape that
Murphy delivered to this reporter...

1013
01:45:14,877 --> 01:45:19,347
...the mayor's reopened the
investigation of McNeely's death...

1014
01:45:19,799 --> 01:45:24,603
...which might also be connected
with the death of Officer Lymangood.

1015
01:45:25,054 --> 01:45:27,230
Half a dozen local police officers...

1016
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:31,318
...and several officials of the
State and Justice departments...

1017
01:45:31,769 --> 01:45:33,486
...have been detained for questioning.

1018
01:45:33,896 --> 01:45:34,988
Coming up, weather...

1019
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:39,117
...and a preview of a bullet train
soon to be seen in the Southland.
