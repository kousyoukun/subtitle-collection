1
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,810
GIVE ME YOUR HAND

2
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,569
- Did we get lost?
- No, I know where we are.

3
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,439
I've got a hole in my shoe.

4
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,149
Do you want to go there or not?

5
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,610
Wait for me!
You're walking too fast!

6
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
It was your idea.

7
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,379
Do you think I like leaving
Dad alone with all the work?

8
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,279
It's from Spain.

9
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,720
''The car is in the auto shop."

10
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,310
"The bottle is standing on the table.''

11
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,370
Hello! Who are you?

12
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,790
My name's Antoine.
And yours?

13
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,300
I'm Quentin.

14
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,439
I'm going to Pasa'Ia,
in the north of Spain. And you?

15
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,060
I go up your ass.

16
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,330
My tum's hurting.

17
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,570
l'm sick.

18
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,019
- No, thanks.
- Quick, I'm burning my fingers.

19
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,860
- Thank you.
- Thanks, ClÃ©mentine.

20
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,419
Next time you forget my name,
it's gonna cost you.

21
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
She's giving us a lift!

22
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,879
Get in the rear, moron!

23
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,659
you can't ... Put the cookies back
where you got them! Dammit!

24
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,690
- You're staying here!
- Let me go or else ... !

25
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,309
You're nuts! Asshole!

26
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Wait! I'm coming with you.

27
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,519
Cool,there's even a mattress here.

28
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,049
Thank you very much.

29
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,470
Take care!
Maybe we'll meet again someday.

30
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,610
- We'll take a shortcut through the woods.
- Through the woods?

31
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,580
Very funny. You don't even know
where we are.

32
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,429
Can I come with you?

33
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,919
You won't notice I'm there.

34
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,549
And I stole lots of cookies
at the gas station.

35
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,009
Where are you headed for?

36
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,370
To Spain.

37
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,159
To our mom's funeral.

38
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,379
We never got to know her.

39
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,159
I'll look for a place where I can sleep
before it gets dark.

40
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,710
When I started working at the gas station,
I had a boyfriend

41
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,000
but he broke up with me.

42
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,169
Always having to pay road charges
when he wanted to see me pissed him off.

43
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,809
- I wouldn't have minded that.
- You have even less money!

44
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,580
I've gotta pee.

45
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,480
And then my brother ...
You wouldn't have gotten lost pretty quickly.

46
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,330
Would you like to see our drawings?

47
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,600
l couldn't find up.

48
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,440
But no fear,
he'll be back.

49
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,210
What it's like to be a twins?

50
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,120
- Are you exactly the same in everything?
- You think my brother's cute, don't you?

51
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,490
For you, I'd get the moon and the stars.

52
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,539
I bet that line's pretty successful
in a club, isn't it?

53
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,759
I want to share everything with you.

54
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,450
We could start with the cookies.

55
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,099
What?
-Shush! Quiet!

56
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,430
- What's up?
- There's a wild boar over there.

57
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,480
It's looking at us.

58
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,829
- It's attacking us!
- Where? I don't see anything. - Here!

59
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,410
Idiot!

60
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:36,720
Stop it!

61
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,440
That's not me,
that's the wild boar.

62
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,809
And your brother?

63
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,650
Where are you going?

64
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,619
No, that's the last one.

65
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,829
Travelling with your brother,
that must be nice.

66
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,730
This is better.

67
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,240
When I call, you'll have to
bring me the boxes.

68
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,859
Have we got any water left?

69
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,789
We should've stolen his car!

70
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,490
l'm thirsty!

71
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,210
And I'm hungry!

72
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,319
We should take a train.

73
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,509
With what money?

74
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,869
Well, maybe we could work
for one or two days.

75
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,160
You wanna work?

76
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,690
I'm so fed up with your stupid ideas!

77
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,089
Do whatever you want to.
I'll go on walking.

78
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,490
You're a free person!

79
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,569
Piss off, man!

80
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,579
When it came to saying good-bye
to dad, you're weren't that cocky.

81
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,099
Ok, piss off!

82
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,230
No, I don't need anyone.

83
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,779
And besides, I don't have
a place where you could sleep.

84
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,000
We could share a bed.

85
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,779
He's working just as hard
as I am.

86
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,240
Pears and a golden globe,
two children in a garden

87
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,450
Pear, where is Mommy?

88
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,630
I don't know.

89
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,680
Come, give me your hand.

90
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,319
Where are we going?
I don't know.

91
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,009
Come!

92
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,789
Dad's got a strong voice.
If we'll be able to talk like him?

93
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,180
I don't know.

94
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,150
Come, give me your hand.

95
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,420
Peach, grandma, she's laughing a lot.

96
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,450
Do you think she's happy?

97
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,369
I don't know.
Come, give me your hand.

98
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,289
Hey, bro!

99
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,549
Let's switch places.
It's easier on the trailer.

100
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,410
- Go to your brother.
- I'm fine, thanks.

101
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,089
On my first week, I was on the trailer
the whole time cause my hands were hurting.

102
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,250
Do you really don't want to?

103
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,250
- Don't you smoke?
- Not today.

104
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,119
You think this really sucks, don't you?

105
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,079
It's hard for me too.

106
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,059
Every summer the same shit.

107
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,179
A month without my girlfriend,
you know ...

108
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,590
It's weird, you and your brother
are totally different.

109
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,179
Yeah. Antoine's the one
who has friends.

110
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,199
Do you want to be left alone?

111
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,280
I'd like to draw you.

112
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,449
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.

113
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,130
- You go first.
- That's ok. I'l wait here.

114
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,250
- What are you doing?
- We gotta go or we'll miss the funeral.

115
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,659
But we don't have enough money
yet for two tickets.

116
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,730
- Where are you going?
- Gotta pee.

117
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,079
Are you looking for a place to sleep?

118
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,230
Nope.

119
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,539
But if you're interested in my brother ...

120
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,210
No problem.

121
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,190
100 euros.

122
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,119
Give me the money. He's waiting for you.
All you have to do, is go in there.

123
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,139
Your brother is expensive.

124
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,289
For that money,
I could have you both.

125
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,550
Nothing doing.

126
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,739
He's the one
who's into that kinda thing.

127
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,170
What are you doing?

128
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,510
Come with me!

129
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,989
Come on!

130
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:07,400
I see, you like playing hard-to-get.

131
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:14,329
Fuck, I paid for this!

132
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,690
Please let me go!

133
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,510
l gave your brother 100 Euros!

134
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,349
Did I talk in my sleep?

135
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,489
A bit.

136
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,900
I do that pretty often.

137
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,070
It's worse with my brother.

138
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,210
He walks in his sleep.

139
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,920
This one time, he went down
the stairs to the bakery.

140
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,449
He stop in front of the big oven.

141
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,679
He went closer and closer to the fire.

142
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,059
I didn't do anything.

143
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,139
Didn't say anything, I just looked on.

144
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:22,960
Then my father turned around

145
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,820
and slapped him in the face
to wake him up.

146
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,519
I was lucky he didn't see me.
He was really mad.

147
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,530
I don't know
why I didn't call out.

148
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,789
l ...

149
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,739
... was all alone.

150
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,719
So I ...

151
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,960
... made up a sister.

152
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,260
A little sister.

153
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:10,050
l did...

154
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,730
We did...

155
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,869
... lots of things together.

156
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,940
We loved each other.

157
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,650
But...

158
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:30,449
... she wasn't real.

159
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,579
Quentin!

160
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:49,760
Hi, buddy.

161
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,809
Where are you headed?

162
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:58,150

Stay calm.

178
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,559

You've gotta go home now.
