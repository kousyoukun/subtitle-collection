like him, did it?

- Let's get him!

Shine it right in the face.

(Strutter) It's a kid!

93
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,545
Og, Fidgit, check the door.

94

All clear.

95

Strutter, the light.

96
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,558
Just tell us how we get out of here,
keep quiet and you won't get hurt.

97
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,428
Wh-Why don't you get out
the way you came?

98
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,147
Don't try and be smart
with me, you little creep.

99
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,515
Yeah.

100
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,394
If you want to play it smart,
I'll introduce you to Vermin.

101

He eats anything, you know.

I'm just trying to help.

- I don't know anything.

104

You know,
and you're not going to tell us.

105

and Vermin's getting hungry.

- What?

108
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,373
- The way out.
- It's never done that before.

Oh, no! Not like that!

Wait for me to give
the order, all right?

113

Ready? One...

115

Stop! Stop!
You never start on one.

116
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,155
Who ever heard of anybody
starting anything on one?

117
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,401
- What is it then, two or three?
- Three.

118

Return what you
have stolen from me!

123

Return! Return the map!

124
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,570
It will bring you great danger!

125
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,239

- Where are we?
- I'm stuck!

131
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,139
Quick! The barn!

132
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,143
Get under here.
Hold him, Strutter.

134
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,570
Shut up!

135

All clear. Wally?

136
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,325
Yeah.

- Yeah.

138
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,910
- Move it. Go.
- Okay.

139

- Fidgit?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:02,379
Where are we?
What happened to my bedroom?

141
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,424
Who was that man?

142
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,470
That was no man.
That was the Supreme Being.

143
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,218
You mean God?

144
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,595
We don't know Him that well.
We only work for Him.

145
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,099
Shut up! Now, are we all here?

146
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,977
- What?
- Og, are you here?

Vermin, will you stop eating!

It's too dangerous to stay here.
He's probably still after us.

151
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,411
So we better keep moving.
Hey, where are you going?

152

157
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,120
Farmers!

158
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,629
(Man shouts)
Look what you've done, boy.

159
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,225
Sorry. What town is that?

160
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,267
Castiglione, or what
Napoleon's left of it.

161
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,063
- Napoleon?
- Yes. It's his city now.

162
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,435
Come on, boy. You come with us.

163
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,028
No, thanks.

164
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,444
Come with us
if you know what's good for you.

165
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,493
You're going the wrong way.

166
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,497
Napoleon?

167
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,245
- Get down!
- You nearly got us caught!

168
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,169
You silly fool.
You could've ruined everything.

169
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,510
- Do you know where we are?
- Shut up. Of course I do.

170
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,550
1796. Battle of Castiglione.

171
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,264
See?

172
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,884
Are you sure we're not
in somebody's bedroom?

173
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,933
Look, do you want to be
leader of this gang?

174
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:21,184
- We agreed no leader.
- Right. So shut up and do as I say.

175
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,186
Now, we've got to get
into the city.

176
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,735
We can't.
The roads are too dangerous.

177
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,326
I've got an idea.
We can use the river.

178
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,195
Come on!

179
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,332
(Explosion)

180
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,671

(Horse neighing)

184
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,270
What are we going to do here?

185
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,239
- A robbery.
- Shhh.

186
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,405
- A robbery?
- Of course.

187
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,495
We're international
criminals. We do robberies.

188
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,534
(Randall) Shut up back there.

189
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,045
(Townspeople screaming)

190
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,523
Aim! Fire!

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,272
(Explosions continue)

192
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,488
Take aim! Fire!

193
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,574
(Man laughing)

194
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,452
(Laughing continues)

195
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,248
(indistinct noises)

196
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,679
That's him.

197
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,549
You're not gonna rob him?

198
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,177
Yeah. Every single
penny he's got.

199
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,647
- But that's Napoleon.
- And he's rich.

200
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,357
(Laughing continues)

201
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,360
Monsieur Commander...

202
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,110
I think that the mayor of
Castiglione and his Council...

203
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,703
would like very much
to surrender now, please.

204
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,324
Look at that!
Look at the little fellow!

205
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,417
(Napoleon laughing)

206
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,210
With the city, we have the whole area
of western Lombardy at our feet.

207
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,424
Oh, go away!

208
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,135
I never should've married you!

209
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,595
- (Whimpering)
- Oh, stop it!

210
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,058
(Laughing) Yes! Yes!

211
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,430
Mon Commander,
they are very keen to surrender.

212
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,476
They have been here eight hours.

213
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,943
Don't stand so close
to me, Neguy!

214
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,109
I've told you about that before.

215
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,448
You on one side
and him on the other...

216
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,534
It's like being on the bottom
of a bloody well!

217
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,700
Just because
you think I'm small.

218
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,539
No, Commander, you are
not small at all.

219
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:27,081
No, not by any means.
Five-foot-one is not small.

220
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,547
Yeah, five-foot-one
and Conqueror of Italy.

221
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,463
- Not bad, huh?
- Very, very good.

222
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,461
(Puppets chattering, gunshoo.

223
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,556
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What just happened?

224
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,301
Where'd they... l just...

(Puppeteer gasps)

227
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,188
Bravo!

228
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,620
(Napoleon) More! I want more!

229
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,536
- I... Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Encore!

230
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:11,414
I wonder if you would like
to see some of our other items.

231
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,509
We have Zuzu and Benny.

232

<i>I</i> (Fanfare)

233
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,797
Fun on a unicycle.

234

No?

235
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,685
How about the Great Rumbozo?

236
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:34,607
He sing and lift heavy things.

237
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,526
No. How about, uh...

238
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,402
Come on.

239

This I think you'll like.

240
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,206
It's very funny.

241
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,373
The Three idiots...

242
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,620
uh, from Latvia.

243
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:58,469
It's a very funny act.
They swallow brushes.

244
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,213
No, no! They're all freaks!

245
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,511
Not one of them
under five-foot-six.

246
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,554
What kind of theatre
are you running, huh?

247
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,552
I'm sorry, sir, but...

248
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,100
No, no. More of the funny show,

249
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,566
the little puppets
hitting each other.

250

You know, I come

because I thought they
were all small, you know?

I heard they was
really tiny guys.

You, Lucien, the rest of you.

Alexander the Great, whose empire
stretched from India to Hungary...

One inch shorter than me.

the only man with any guts

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,218
Strutter, wake up. Wake up.

318
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,553
According to this map,
there's a time hole outside.

319
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,343
- See if you can find it.
- Right.

320
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,183
The rest of you,
the hole disappears at 12:00, right?

321
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,260
So let's get moving.

322
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,722
Vermin, Fidgit, the tapestry.

323
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,519
Hey, that's 16th century!
It's nice, isn't it?

324
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,518
Get it!

325
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,820
<i>Okay-</i>

326
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,652
(Shouting)

327
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,075
We're rich! We're rich!

328
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,744
Ten-hut!

329
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,695
(Snoring)

330
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,499
(Laughing)

331
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,460
- Come on. We've got 30 seconds left.
- You found the time hole?

332
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,580
- Yes.
- Let's go.

333
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,333
(Snoring continues)

334
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,721
- (Laughing)
- Come on, Kevin.

335
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,808
(Chattering continues)

336
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,389
(Clock chiming)

337
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,729
Ten-hut!

338
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,776
About turn!

339
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,289
(Clock chiming)

340
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,427
<i>'</i> (Guam) Stop! " Go! '"

341
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,682
Thieves! After them!

342
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,731
- Follow them!
- (All shouting)

343
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,584
(Groaning)

344
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,388
Oh, Sir Vincent,
you came for me!

345
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,554
Oh, Good Mistress Pansy,
I could not have ridden faster.

346
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,474
Four horses have I exhausted
this day from Nottingham.

347
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:33,190
Oh, the way you leapt to my chamber,
so full of... manliness.

348
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,026
I could scarce restrain
the rushing of my feet.

349
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,739
These 12 long years have been
like chains that bound me.

350
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,484
Oh. And the personal problem?

351
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,324
- Much, much better.
- Ohhh.

352
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,620
And now we will ride full tilt to Dover,
and there embark for France.

353
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,335
Oh, you don't have
to wear the special...

354
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,376
No, no, I don't have to wear
the special... anymore.

355
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,626
Oh, Pansy.
No more worries now, Pansy.

356
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,877
- Oh.
- Oh.

357
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,472
- No. No.
- (Whistling noise)

358
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,594
(Shouting, muttering)

359
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,265
(Pansy screaming)

360
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,728
(Horses neighing)

361
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:15,225
(Shouting continues)

362
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,156
- Hey!
- (Screaming)

363
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,569
(Laughing)

364
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,288
(Laughing continues)

365
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,578
- Quick! Quick!
- (Randall) We did it!

366
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,230
- Your problem, Vincent.
- Forget the problem. Get me the money.

367
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:39,128
- We did it! We did it!
- (All laughing)

368
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,752
I told you. You stick with me,
and you won't go far wrong.

369
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,097
Sometimes I almost
believe you, Randall.

370
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,683
- Hey, where are we?
- Where are we?

371
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,723
Why, it's obvious. We're, um...

372
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,687
(Pansy) Vincent, don't
worry about a thing.

373
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,022
(Vincent) I'm not worrying.

374
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,143
- Exactly...
- In the Middle Ages.

375
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,490
Hmm... in the Middle Ages.

376
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,782
Five hundred years before the man
we just robbed was even born.

377
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,781
- Fantastic!
- Try that one in a court of law.

378
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,204
Vermin, that is not
meant to be eaten.

379
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,623
You never know
until you've eaten it.

380
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,167
Is it always like this
when you've done a raid?

381
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,631
I don't know.
We've never done one before.

382
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,173
But I thought you were
international criminals.

383
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,346
Going to be. Going to be.

384
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,845
Yeah, going to be.
Aren't we? Going to be?

385
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,393
Especially now
that we've got you, Kevin.

386
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:40,234
Hang on. He's just a kid.
He's not one of us.

387
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,273
He knows an awful lot.

388
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,398
Yeah, and he's bigger
than any of us.

389
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,777
- Do you really want to join us?
- Can we really go anywhere?

390
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,370
You name it. If it's down here.

391
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,536
(Laughing, cheering)

392
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,333
I don't understand.
What's so special about that map?

393
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,126
This map used to belong
to the Supreme Being.

394
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,627
- You stole it?
- No. Well, sort of.

395
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,754
He used to be our employer.
He made all the big stuff,

396
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,507
like good and evil,
men and women, night and day.

397
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,635
And when He did trees and shrubs,
we helped make all this.

398
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,603
Whew, that's not bad.

399
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,475
Yeah, and did we get
a thimbleful of credit for it?

400
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,899
No, all we got was the sack,
just for creating the Pink Bunkadoo.

401
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,195
- Pink Bunkadoo?
- Yeah. Beautiful tree that was.

402
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,194
- Og designed it, didn't you? Yeah.
- (Muttering)

403
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,574
Six-hundred feet high,
bright red and smelled terrible.

404
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:40,579
As a disciplinary measure, we were
sent down to the repairs department.

405
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,547
- (Chattering continues)
- What?

406
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:48,260
You see, to be quite frank, the fabric
of the universe is far from perfect.

407
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,256
It was a bit of a botched job.
We only had seven days to make it.

408
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:56,431
And that's where this comes in.
This is the only map of all the holes.

409
00:30:56,563 --> 00:31:00,397
Well, why repair them?
Why not use them to get stinkin' rich?

410
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,641
Yeah, stinkin' rich!

411
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,567
- (Laughs)
- Lads, here's to stinkin' rich!

412
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,440
Stinkin' rich. Stinkin' rich.

413
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,409
- And to Kevin!
- Yeah, Kevin!

414
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,326
- Here's to Kevin!
- Stinkin' Kevin!

415
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,369
Hey, hold it there.

416
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,335
- (Chattering)
- Smile.

417
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,581
- Hey, the map.
- Yeah, the map. Don't forget the map.

418
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,254
(Kevin) Hey, come on! Smile!

419
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,760
(Pansy) Help! Robbers!

420
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,759
- Hey, that's us!
- Someone's in trouble. Come on!

421
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,262
(Randall) Grab the loot.

422
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,605
(Pansy continues screaming)

423
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,478
- (Robbers shouting)
- It's a bit tight.

424
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,572
(Robbers laughing)

425
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,193
- Now, those are our sort of people.
- Yeah!

426
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,663
(Shouting, laughing continue)

427
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,204
Vincent! Oh! Oh, dear!

428
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,543
- (Pansy) Help!
- Come on.

429
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,039
Oh, Vincent, someone's coming.

430
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,506
- (Whimpering)
- Help! Help I say!

431
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,423
Oh, at last. Oh, I say!

432
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:15,389
I say, my fiancé and I would appreciate
a bit of assistance.

433
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,555
- Oh, no! The problem, Pansy!
- Oh! Oh!

434
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,429
- It's started again! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, don't worry, darling.

435
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,476
- I say!
- I must have fruit!

436
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,895
(Wolf howling)

437
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,282
- Where are we?
- We've lost them.

438
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,777
Come on. Don't be so wet.

439
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,700
(All yelling)

440
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,745
- (Muttering)
- (Kevin) Hey!

441
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,417
What do we do now, Randall?

442
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:58,057
Just leave this to me, Wally.
We've just got to treat them right.

443
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,223
What do you want,
you tatty-faced old scumbag?

444
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,187
- What's your business, gob face?
- We're robbers!

445
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,182
- Villainous robbers?
- The worst.

446
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,229
- Stop at nothing?
- Nothing at all.

447
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,069
- Steal a cup outta a beggar's hands?
- Rather.

448
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,281
- The teeth from blind old ladies?
- Of course.

449
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,527
- Toys from children?
- Whenever we can.

450
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,745
(Both growling)

451
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,667
Right. Let 'em down!

452
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,415
They always crack in the end.

453
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,669
(Grunting, groaning)

454
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,886
Wow.

455
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,849
Listen, I've got a few ideas
for, uh, a linkup...

456
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,220
between your gang and our gang,

457
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,438
but I only want
to talk to the boss.

458
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,352
The boss?

459
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,852
- The boss?
- That's right.

460
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,530
They serious?

461
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,442
Ohhh.

462
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,320
(Men shouting, cheering)

463
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,289
(Bones crunching)

464
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,418
All right! Do it!

465
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,756
(Laughs) Anyone else wanna go?

466
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,300
Come on, you weasels.

467
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,795
What's this?

468
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,549
Lose yourself, leprechaun.
(Laughing)

469
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,222
(Spitballs clinking)

470
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,345
Move yourself, lad.

471
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,394
(Chattering, laughter)

472
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,400
(Ding)

473
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,708
- That's disgusting!
- Wait here! I'll get him!

474
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,454
(Flies buzzing)

475
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,464
Hello. L-I'm Hood.

476
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,467
- It's Robin Hood.
- Yeah.

477
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,681
- (Shouts)
- Say good morning, you scum.

478
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,773
Good morning, scum.

479
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,519
- Good morning. You're all robbers, then?
- The best, Mr. Hood.

480
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,943
Jolly good.
And you're a robber, are you?

481
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,493
Jolly good.

482
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,695
And do you enjoy robbing, then?

483
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,289
Well, it helps
pay the rent, sir.

484
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,500
(Laughing)

485
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,376
Jolly good.

486
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,499
And you're a robber too?
How long have you been a robber?

487
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,219
- Four-foot-one.
- Good Lord!

488
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,338
- Jolly good. Four-foot-one?
- Yes.

489
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,263
Well, th-th-th-that is
a long time, isn't it?

490
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,183
Well now, I hear you've made
a pretty good haul.

491
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,306
Well, see for yourself, sir.

492
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,023
Gosh! I say!

493
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,443
Crikey! I mean,
I've been in robbing for years,

494
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,784
but I've never seen
anything like this.

495
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,246
Crumbs! And you acquired
all of this by yourselves?

496
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,331
Well, it was a good day,
Mr. Hood.

497
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,666
- Jolly good day!
- It's nice, isn't it?

498
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,583
Rather! Well, I mean,
what can I say? Thank you.

499
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,672
Thank you all
very, very much indeed.

500
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,338
Oh, don't ment... What?

501
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,632
Well, I mean,
it's frightfully kind of you.

502
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,597
The poor are going to be
absolutely thrilled.

503
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,137
- Have you met them?
- Who? The poor?

504
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,182
Oh, you must meet them.
I just know you'll like them.

505
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,681
Of course, they haven't
got two pennies to rub together.

506
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:38,277
- But that's because they're poor.
- (All laughing)

507
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:48,071
Uh, Marion, would you be so kind
as to ask the poor to come in, please?

508
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,413
- No problem.
- Thank you so much.

509
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,534
- Right. Come on, you lot.
- Let's just see what we've got.

510
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,662
This is going to be
so much help in our work.

511
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,257
No, you don't understand.
All this stuff is ours. We stole it.

512
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:04,470
Oh, yes, I know, and believe you me the
poor are going to be not just thrilled,

513
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,430
but also considerably less poor,
aren't they, Redgrave?

514
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,473
- (Gibberish)
- You see? What did he say?

515
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,596
He said, "Yeah, what with Christmas
coming up and all." - Ah, jolly good.

516
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:19,602
Yes, well, there we are.
Congratulations. Well done.

517
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,355
(Laughter)

518
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,482
There we are. Well done.
Congratulations.

519
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,236
(Laughing, cheering)

520
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,581
Is that... Is that
absolutely necessary?

521
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,167
- (Gibberish)
- What did he say?

522
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,538
- He says, yeah, he's afraid it is.
- Ah, fine. Fine.

523
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,664
There we are, madam.
Congratulations.

524
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,757
- Congratulations. Jolly good.
- Thank you.

525
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,629
(Laughing continues)

526
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,429
incidentally, would any of you like
to stay on and help us with our work?

527
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,676
There's still so much wealth
to redistribute.

528
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,519
Oh, I'd like to stay.

529
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,309
Jolly good. What's your name?

530
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:01,356
- Uh, Ke...
- Ke... What a jolly nice name.

531
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,025
- Let me go.
- Well, never mind.

532
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,650
- Cheerio. Thank you very much.
- (Kevin struggling)

533
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,653
Thank you very much.

534
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,907
Thank you very, very,
very, very much.

535
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,790
Awful people.

536
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,841
This can't wait! - I'll never get
a chance to meet Robin Hood again.

537
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,635
- Any chance of a rescue?
- Stop moaning!

538
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,676
He's obviously a dangerous man.
Unbalanced, if you ask me.

539
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,425
Giving away what isn't even his!

540
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,892
That's what Robin Hood
always did. Even I know that.

541
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,685
- Oh, of course. You know it all.
- He was one of my heroes.

542
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,560
Heroes! Heroes!
What do they know about a day's work?

543
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,608
- Leave him alone, Randall!
- Well, it makes me sick.

544
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,072
Anyone Who's always right
makes me sick.

545
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,444
- That's why you get on with yourself!
- Watch it!

546
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,865
Big mouth!

547
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,954
Horseflesh wouldn't have
got us into this.

548
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:58,451
- Horseflesh is dead.
- Then give me the map. I'm taking over!

549
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,453
Get off me! Get...
(Arguing continues)

550
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,547
(Thunderclap)

551
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,094
So... these are
the sort of people...

552
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,813
the Supreme Being
allows to steal His map?

553
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,693
Look at them.
Stunted little proles.

554
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,779
I wouldn't even trust them
to wipe their own noses.

555
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:33,243
Oh, no, sir. It's much
too difficult for them.

556
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,409
What sort of supreme being
created such riffraff?

557
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,659
Is it not the workings
of a complete incompetent?

558
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,957
But He created you, Evil One.

559
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,457
What did you say?

560
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,430
Well, He created you,
so He can't be totally...

561
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,894
Never talk to me
like that again!

562
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,568
No one created me! I am Evil!

563
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:10,189
Evil existed long before good.

564
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:14,364
I made myself.
I cannot be unmade.

565
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,738
I am all-powerful!

566
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,366
Yeah.

567
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:27,377
But why, if that's the case,

568
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,842
are you unable to escape
from this fortress?

569
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,686
That's a good question.

570
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,681
Why have I let the Supreme Being
keep me here...

571
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,684
in the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?

572
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,733
- Because you...
- Oh, shut up. I'm speaking rhetorically.

573
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,315
- Of course.
- I let Him keep me here...

574
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,863
in order to lull Him
into a false sense of security.

575
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,657
Ah, clever, clever.

576
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,374
When I have the map,
I will be free...

577
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:05,790
and the world will be different
because I have understanding.

578
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,916
- Uh, understanding of what, master?
- Of digital watches.

579
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:14,045
Soon I shall have understanding of video
cassette recorders and car telephones.

580
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,715
And when I have understanding of them,
I shall have understanding of computers.

581
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:22,310
And when I have understanding of
computers, I shall be the Supreme Being.

582
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,180
God isn't interested
in technology.

583
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,526
He knows nothing of the potential of the
micro-chip or the silicon revolution.

584
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,272
Look how He spends His time.
Forty-three species of parrots!

585
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,241
- Nipples for men!
- Slugs.

586
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,657
Slugs! He created slugs.

587
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,532
They can't hear. They can't speak.
They can't operate machinery.

588
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,706
Are we not in the hands
of a lunatic?

589
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,875
Sir... look!

590
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:53,251
If I were creating a world, I wouldn't mess
about with butterflies and daffodils.

591
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:56,799
I would have started
with lasers, 8:00 day one.

592
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,343
- (Assistant gasps)
- Sorry.

593
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,561
I just can't wait for a new tech...
techno... technological dawn.

594
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,272
Sir... look!

595
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,686
What is it, Benson?

596
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,652
The map, sir. The map!
They've brought it with them!

597
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,650
- What?
- I saw the map, master, just now.

598
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,528
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, master.

599
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:26,454
Down there!
The little one has it.

600
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,497
The little one?

601
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:33,123
This is our chance.
This is what we've been waiting for!

602
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,502
- It will set us free.
- Shut up!

603
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:41,382
If you're wrong, Benson,
my revenge will be slow and unpleasant.

604
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:45,761
I will turn you inside out
over a very long period of time.

605
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,356
Oh, thank you, master.
Thank you.

606
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,569
Now we must bait the hook,
see if they bite...

607
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,983
and pull them in.

608
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:02,194
Stand by for mind control.

609
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,322
What about Babylon?

610
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,576
- Who?
- It's a city of legendary wealth.

611
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,418
Ahh.

612
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,413
(Voice echoing)
I've got a better idea.

613
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,256
Who said that?

614
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,298
I've got an idea
forming in my head.

615
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,218
You haven't had an idea
for thousands of years.

616
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,766
There is a place where we could find
the greatest thing man could want,

617
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:32,733
the goal of everybody's
hopes and dreams.

618
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,478
What the hell
are you talking about?

619
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,824
The most fabulous
object in the world.

620
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,694
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah.

621
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,618
They're hooked,
the greedy little fish.

622
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,786
(Kevin) Why do you always
have to go after money?

623
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,204
Who's this?

624
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,828
I don't know, master.
I haven't seen him before.

625
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,331
He's stronger than the rest.
Who is he?

626
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,208
- I don't know.
- I'm losing them.

627
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,462
Something's going on down there.
We've lost them!

628
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,508
Randall, look, over there!

629
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,508
- We'd better move!
- (Randall) Don't rush me.

630
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,476
The forest! It's on fire!

631
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,517
It's raining, pudding head!

632
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,107
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

633
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,725
- It's Him!
- It's Him!

634
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,695
Return the map.

635
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,905
- Make for the hole!
- Where is it?

636
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,491
It's over there. Quick! Come on!

637
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,611
- Stop! Return!
- Hurry up!

638
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:31,241
Return what you
have stolen from me.

639
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,709
Return the map!

640
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,297
There are two holes, Randall.
Which one? Which one?

641
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,883
Go, Kevin! Just get away!

642
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:44,801
Go! Not that one!

643
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:04,449
(Grunting, groaning)

644
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,866
(Growling, groaning)

645
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,719
(Groaning continues)

646
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,132
(Horse neighs)

647
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,805
(Growls, groaning)

648
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,021
(Gasping)

649
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,064
(Grunts)

650
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,827
(Growling continues)

651
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,427
(Growling continues)

652
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,549
(Kevin screaming)

653
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,854
(Kevin gasps, coughs)

654
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:20,351
(Shrieking)

655
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,978
(Kevin screams)

656
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,163
Where did you come from? Huh?

657
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,412
I'm not quite sure.

658
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,755
Who sent you? The gods?

659
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,922
Was it Zeus? Apollo?

660
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,965
Athena?

661
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,055
(Panting, sighing)

662
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,444
Well, you're certainly a chatty
little fellow, aren't you?

663
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,907
I don't believe it!

664
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,527
You don't believe what?

665
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,825
I don't believe
the way you killed him.

666
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:19,497
Yes. But it
has to be done sometimes.

667
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,461
No. I mean it was
such a good shot.

668
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,298
I bet you've killed
lots of people.

669
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,420
Well, the gods must
have given you a name.

670
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,888
Oh, yeah. Kevin.

671
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,384
Kevin?

672
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,762
Well, Kevin, here, it's yours.

673
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,765
- What?
- You don't want it?

674
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,643
Oh, yes, please.
You mean I can really have it?

675
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,737
Well, on condition that you
carry it back to the city for me.

676
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,358
Oh, great. But no,
I can't really.

677
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,452
I must wait. You see,
I'm with friends.

678
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,741
You see, if I lose them,
I may never be able to get back.

679
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,665
- (Horse whinnies)
- Get back? To where?

680
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,505
I'm not really sure.

681
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,920
Here, you better take this.
You'll need it. It's water.

682
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,593
There's enough there for your friends,
too, if they ever turn up.

683
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,683
(Horse whinnies)

684
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,600
Oh, and by the way, thank you.

685
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,571
No. Please.
I'd like to come, really.

686
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,066
No, no, please.
I'd like to come.

687
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,369
(Men grunting)

688
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,580
Better? No.

689
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,075
<i>I</i> (Whistles a tune)

690
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,913
(Blows horn)

691
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,669
(Blows horn)

692
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,471
(Horn)

693
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,886
(Horse neighs)

694
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,738
(Children shouting)

695
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:19,655
(Crowd cheering)

696
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:08,795
You saved my life. Remember?

697
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,174
The enemy of the people is dead!

698
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,713
(Cheering)

699
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,887
Hail King Agamemnon!

700
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:38,613
(Kevin) There's a man being
cut in half here.

701
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:42,408
It must have been a brilliant battle.
Choo! Choo!

702
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,875
All three are to receive
summary executions today.

703
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,415
If the queen wishes to see me,
I'll be in the courts all afternoon.

704
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:59,467
Remind the queen that
I still rule this city.

705
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,341
I wish I'd been
in the Trojan Wars.

706
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,889
Will you teach me
how to sword fight?

707
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,559
Come here. I'll teach you
something much more useful.

708
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,371
- Where is it?
- There.

709
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,087
That one.

710
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,839
Kings aren't supposed
to do things like that.

711
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,011
(Camera shutter clicking)

712
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:50,184
(Clicking continues)

713
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,645
(Crowd chattering)

714
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:16,506
You know, I never, ever
want to go back.

715
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,798
Don't you want to see
all your friends again?

716
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,795
No, thanks.

717
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:27,721
To be in your own home, to be
with your own father and mother?

718
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,512
No.

719
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,765
Very well, then.

720
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,643
- I can stay?
- We'll decide that tomorrow.

721
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,524
(Rooster crows)

722
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,751
(Kevin gasps)

723
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,779
(Horse whinnying)

724
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,782
(Cymbals clash)

725
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:05,485
I have decreed that this boy
shall remain here with us in our city.

726
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,906
Furthermore, he shall
from this day fonNard be my own son...

727
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,370
and heir to the throne
of Mycenae.

728
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,786
(Crowd murmuring)

729
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,580
Let the banquet begin.

730
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,750
(Gong chimes)

731
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,649
(Drum roll)

732
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,949
(Monkey chittering)

733
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:00,601
(Laughing, murmuring)

734
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,604
(Randall)
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

735
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,857
a masterly miracle of modern
magic before your very eyes.

736
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,985
Abracadee, abracadoo!

737
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,863
- (Laughter)
- You're doing a great job.

738
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,286
If we can borrow this
for a moment, sir.

739
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,786
(Randall) Please give generously
as my assistants pass amongst you.

740
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,538
Thank you very much.
That's very kind.

741
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:29,713
(Chattering continues)

742
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,837
Come on. Come on.

743
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,517
Now all we need is a volunteer. Yes,
young man, you'll do fine. - No! Please!

744
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,560
(Kevin) No! Leave me!

745
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,227
Come on! Come on!

746
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,320
- No way!
- May I? The crown?

747
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,407
Don't! Help me!

748
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,199
Kevin, let's get out of here!

749
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,992
No! Please, no!

750
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,990
Thank you.

751
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,539
- No! Please!
- Watch this!

752
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,958
We make a great team, don't we?

753
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,957
Now!

754
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,338
(Music stops)

755
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,683
(Cheering, applause)

756
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,495
(Steam whistle blows)

757
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,836
- Alone, at last.
- Isn't it glorious?

758
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,423
Yes. I love the ocean.

759
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,383
God, how I, how I love her.

760
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:57,597
- She's so, so damn...
- Wet?

761
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,508
Wet. Yes. Yes.

762
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,933
So damn... damn... wet.

763
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,941
Pansy. Pansy, look at me.

764
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,812
- Yes, Vincent?
- Do you love me?

765
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:18,068
Of course, I love you. - You don't mind
the, the thing on the end of my nose?

766
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,661
- Oh, you mean your... No, darling.
- Yes, my...

767
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,156
(Chuckling) Don't be silly.

768
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,248
Could you share a house

769
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,039
with a chap who has a thing like this
on the end of his nose?

770
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:33,091
Of course, my love.
Everyone has something odd about them.

771
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,884
- Why, I've got an enormous...
- Pansy!

772
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,380
Pansy, I'm so glad
you feel the way you do.

773
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,974
Because now I can ask you
what I've always wanted to ask you.

774
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,639
Oh, ask me.

775
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,557
Ask me!

776
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,934
Pansy, will you...

777
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,529
Will you...

778
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,318
(Yelling)

779
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,783
(Gulls wailing)

780
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,573
- Where the hell are we?
- (Yelling, chattering)

781
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,822
Someone hit me! Oh!

782
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,746
- Pansy! Pansy!
- (Screaming)

783
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,712
- (Screaming continues)
- Give me that!

784
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,923
You've ruined everything!
Pansy! Pansy, I can explain!

785
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,841
It's only the thing on my nose and the
hairpiece! Everything else is fine!

786
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,964
- (Chattering)
- <i>I</i> (Classical)

787
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,640
Fidgit, you're not supposed
to eat that.

788
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:30,731
- You're supposed to drink it.
- I like that. It's very nice.

789
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,770
Oh.

790
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:36,604
Six more plates
of caviar, please.

791
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,572
Anyone else want any?

792
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,943
No, none for me, thank you.
I'll stick with the quail's eyeballs.

793
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,411
The caviar makes me throw up,
you know.

794
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,827
- (Man) Waiter.
- Sorry, Randall. Sorry.

795
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:52,419
Cheer up, Kevin. Kings aren't
the only ones with money, you know.

796
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,788
The money wasn't important
to him.

797
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,508
He didn't have anything
to spend it on, did he?

798
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:01,800
Stuck out in Greece... lowest
standard of living in Europe.

799
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:06,847
- You make me sick!
- (All hooting, laughing)

800
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:13,057
(Chattering)

801
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:16,652
What?
Things are looking better all the time.

802
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,523
- I've got something to say to you.
- Go away!

803
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:24,618
- (Chattering continues)
- It's about the map.

804
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:28,364
The map?
I don't understand you, Randall.

805
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,582
You've got something
really brilliant like that,

806
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,372
- and you're just wasting it.
- (Scoffs)

807
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,122
I wouldn't call this exactly...
wasting it.

808
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,467
Why couldn't you leave me
where I was happy?

809
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,803
Because when you hear
what I've got planned,

810
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:46,515
- you're gonna be a lot happier.
- (Glass clinks, water splashes)

811
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,978
I was havin' a close look at the map
last night. Do you know what I found?

812
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:55,270
Og was right.
The most fabulous object in the world.

813
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,188
It does exist.

814
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,442
Look.

815
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:05,990
The time of legends... - The time of
legends! There's no such thing.

816
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,704
But there is.
You just gotta believe in it.

817
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,039
Othewvise, Horseflesh
wouldn't have put it on the map.

818
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,378
"In the middle of the time of legends
is a fortress of ultimate darkness,"

819
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,624
and inside the fortress
of ultimate darkness,

820
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,797
"the most fabulous object
in the world."

821
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,545
Give it up, Randall.

822
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,888
- (Chattering continues)
- Look.

823
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,850
- You and me... we got a lot in common.
- (Coughs)

824
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,515
- Not like that lot.
- (Laughing)

825
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,809
We like a risk.

826
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,433
- We like adventure.
- (Coughing continues)

827
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,856
Well, this is it.

828
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:42,855
This is the big one.

829
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,608
No namby-pamby time holes here.

830
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,409
We risk all. We win everything.

831
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,872
Waiter, more champagne.

832
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,459
Yes, sir.

833
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,794
And plenty of ice.

834
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,629
(Crashing)

835
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,511
(Yelling, screaming)

836
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,600
(Yelling, screaming continue)

837
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,563
(Wally) Hello!

838
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,857
I want to go home!
I can't stand it!

839
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,855
You'll get us all killed,
Randall!

840
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,857
Stop whimpering, Fidgit!

841
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,860
How could I know we were gonna
run slap-bang into an iceberg?

842
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,988
It didn't say "Get off before
the iceberg" on the ticket.

843
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,960
Now... Now is the time...

844
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:43,458
to star... to start our quest for the...
for the most fabulous object, Randall.

845
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,836
- Og's right! I've got the map.
- No!

846
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,430
- Let's go!
- What?

847
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:54,677
Randall, we are in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean!

848
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,852
It doesn't matter where we are.
You just gotta believe in it!

849
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,520
Yüuure Crazy'

850
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,519
- We must try!
- No, don't!

851
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:05,862
- Abandon plank!
- No!

852
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:10,531
I can't swim! I can't swim!

853
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,744
(Fidgit) Help! Help!

854
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,875
- Don't worry, Fidgit! I'm coming!
- Help!

855
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:21,587
<i>'</i> (Laughing) - Help!

856
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,709
- Now we have them!
- Oh, well done. Well done, master.

857
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:29,257
(Yelling, whimpering)

858
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:37,561
Suddenly, I feel...
very, very good.

859
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,896
- I'm sorry, master.
- It'll pass. It'll pass.

860
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,768
- Shall I bring them in, master?
- Yes, Benson.

861
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,237
- Bring them into the time of legends.

01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,597
Hey! Hey, I can swim!

865
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,690
Look.

866
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,735
Look!

Morning, dear.

(Growling)

871
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,124

- Ooh!

872
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,721
- (Dwarves, Kevin screaming) Help!
- Who's that?

873
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:58,467
- What, dear?
- Thought I heard a noise.

874
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:02,813
No. It's your nerves, dear.

875
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,732
Here we are, darling.

876
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,397
(Groaning)

877
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,362
Come on.

878
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:16,702
- (Grunting)
- And the ointment for the leg.

879
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,288
I grew too fast
when I was young.

880
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:23,580
- That was the problem.
- You've been overdoing it a bit, dear.

881
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,420
You try being beastly and terrifying
when you... (Gasping)

882
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:32,339
you can only get one hour's sleep
a night because your back hurts,

883
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,054
and you daren't cough
in case you pull a muscle.

884
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,765
But you are horrible, dear.

885
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,850
You're just sayin' that.

886
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,768
(Giggling) And gargle.

887
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,393
- (Groaning)
- Come on, now. There's a good fellow.

888

(Roaring, gargling)

890
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,534
- What's that?
- I don't know.

891
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,489
- (Gasping, panting)
- Wait for me!

892
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,994
Look at these bloody spots.

893
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,542
That's diet, that is.

894
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:14,259
- You'll outgrow them, dear.
- Look at all this bloody fish!

895
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,846
(Grunting) There used to be
a time when you could be sure...

896
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,807
of catchin' old boots, cans,

897
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,846
hat racks, boxes.

898
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,937
Now it's prawns
all the bloody time!

899
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:30,650
Anti-pollution! Wife!

900
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,439
What d'you want, dear?
Do you want the foot powder?

901
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:39,068
No! Come out here and help me!

902
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,662
- Quick!
- Dear.

903
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:48,665
- What's in there?
- I don't know, but it's not prawns.

904
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,787
- (Grunting, groaning)
- Here.

905
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,507
Here, dear.
Leave that to me, please.

906
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,002
- Yeah.
- (Yells)

907
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:04,392
Aren't they lovely?
We can have them for breakfast.

908
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,603
Ah, you mean eat their boots?

909
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,440
No, dear.
I mean, eat all of them.

910
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,479
Every little bit.

911
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:15,730
That means the big pot
and the large skewers.

912
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,028
- (Whimpering, grunting)
- What shall I do, dear?

913
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,490
Terrify them.

914
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,785
Oh, but what about me back?

915
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,534
Well, you don't have
to jump around.

916
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,037
Just shout horribly...

917
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:34,585
and leer at them.

918
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,051
You know, the way you used to.

919
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,887
- (Giggling)
- Right.

920
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,598
Right. (Laughing)

921
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:48,220
Oh, I'm so happy
'cause I'm bus-bus-bus-busy.

01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,016
Right. (Clears throat)

Let's see. What have we here?

928
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,239
Some tasty little morsels, eh?

- I know a cure for bad backs.

940
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,658
Bad back? Me? An ogre?

I can cough!

How're we doing now, Randall?

980
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,535
Just fine.

981
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,751
We're on the right course.

982
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,418

nothing can go wrong.

I think there's something
that you should know.

Pull these boards out!

1009
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,003
- You might sink the ship!
- Oh, shut up!

1010
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,466
- Here's a hammer!

- Come on. Let's go. Run! Run!
- Quick!

1039
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:34,454
The Fortress of Ultimate Darkness
is somewhere over there, I promise you!

1040
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,457
Oh, you're joking, Randall.
There's nothing over there!

- Look! We're so close!

We'll all die out here!

- Come on. It's just a bit further...

1046

What is it?

1047
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:04,819
I don't know, but it hurts.

1048
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,746
It's some kind
of invisible barrier.

1049
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:12,959
Oh! So that's what
an invisible barrier looks like.

1050
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,374
It's what this line must be.

1051
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,372
And just on the other side,

1052
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,091
the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness.

You're mad, Randall!

Your brain's gone.
Do you know that?

1056
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,394
I promise you, this is it!

1057

- Yeah.

1060

There's only one way to go now.

- Listen to me!
- Get out of the way!

1065
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,583
You'll never get back
without me.

1066
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,878
Do you wanna bet?

1067
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,341
- Wally, give that back.
- Get out of the way, Randall.

1068
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,386
You give that back,
or I'll take your head off.

Randall! Don't do it!

1099
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,729
- (Applause continues)
- (Chattering continues)

1100
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,772
(Kevin) Come back!

1101
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,114
- It's a trap!
- Fabulous.

1102
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,495
Fabulous.

1103
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,085
Here they are. Congratulations.

1104
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:28,753
But before they collect their prize, let's
just have a look at what made it possible...

1105
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,880
for them to be here
with us tonight.

1106
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,969
The map, please.

1107
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,973
(Gasping)

1108
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:41,185
- (Thunderbolt)
- (Laughing)

1109
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,054
(All screaming)

1110
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,978
(Shouting)

1111
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:50,695
- Let us out!
- (Laughing continues)

1112
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,822
(Wally) Let us out! Come back!

1113
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,868
I have the map! I have the map!

1114
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,583
And the day after tomorrow,

1115
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,793
- the world!
- (Thunderbolt)

1116
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,913
Oh, no!

1117
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,916
- (Screams)
- (Shrieking)

1118
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,086
(Squeaking)

1119
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:23,595
- (Squeaking continues)
- (Crunches)

1120
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:26,768
Rat, anybody?
Might be the last meal you get.

1121
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,817
No. Leave off!

1122
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:36,695
- That's it, then.
- It's all over.

1123
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:39,569
We could've stayed at home
making trees.

1124
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:43,915
- Oh, shut up.
- How could we have been so stupid?

1125
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,076
I don't know.

1126
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,136
(Gasps)

1127
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:06,474
Hey! Look, look!
Quick! Come on! Look!

1128
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,723
Look at this. Quickly!

1129
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:11,021
- Look!
- Good one of Wally.

1130
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,985
No! Look!

1131
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,945
It's the map!

1132
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,111
I can see it's the map.
What use is that to us now?

1133
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,110
Look, closer.
The time of legends, see?

1134
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,204
See the Fortress
of Ultimate Darkness?

1135
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,874
- That's a hole?
- Exactly!

1136
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:30,335
- It could lead almost anywhere.
- Everywhere!

1137
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:31,579
What?

1138
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,298
We just found
the biggest hole in the universe,

1139
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,667
and it's practically below
our feet!

1140
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,965
Kevin, you're a genius!

1141
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:42,761
- Come on, you lot! Shift!
- We'll never get out of here!

1142
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,808
Wanna bet?

1143
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,931
No!

1144
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,480
That's right, Og. Show 'em we can do
something right for a change.

1145
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:00,199
That's it.

1146
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,624
Let's have that.

1147
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,912
Give us some more.

1148
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:54,545
That's enough, Wally!

1149
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,539
Okay, Strutter.

1150
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,808
- Have you got the rope?
- Hold on!

1151
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,978
(Grunting) Right.

1152
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,693
Hold tight! Keep straight!

1153
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,813
- Watch your feet. Watch your feet.
- Easy.

1154
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,000
(Grunting) Hold it.

1155
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:42,127
Steady. Watch it. Watch it.

1156
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:45,095
Hold your fingers.

1157
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,549
(Muttering)

1158
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,807
He's going!

1159
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:04,736
- It's coming.
- Go now.

1160
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,656
Ready? And...

1161
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,065
(Wally) Again! Again!

1162
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,103
(Cheering)

1163
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,567
- Ready, Wally!
- Okay, Strutter.

1164
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:52,996
Here we go! Geronimo!

1165
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,163
Yeah!

1166
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,080
Okay! Go, Strutter!

1167
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,797
(Cheering)

1168
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,015
- (Randall) Strutter!
- Hey! We've made it!

1169
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,680
Okay, Wally.

1170
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,804
(Grunting)

1171
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:23,064
Take up the slack.

1172
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:31,694
- Quick, Wally.
- (All chattering)

1173
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,115
" Go! <i>'</i> (Whimpering)"

1174
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,963
(Whimpering continues) Come on!

1175
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,173
Go, Vermin!

1176
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:48,340
- Go, Fidgit!
- I don't wanna go! I don't wanna go!

1177
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:54,721
<i>['</i> I'm 90ing] " Go!"

1178
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,977
- (Chattering)
- Come on!

1179
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,019
- Wally!
- Come on, Wally!

1180
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:05,144
Right, lads! Watch this!

1181
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,237
(Grunts)

1182
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,704
(Laughing) _ (Rope creaking)

1183
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,869
(Yelling)

1184
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,994
Wally! ' (Crashing)

1185
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,676
Pull the rope.

1186
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:37,893
There he is! (Laughs)

1187
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,932
- Wally!
- Wally!

1188
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,025
Pull him up! That's it!

1189
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:48,271
(Cheering, chattering)

1190
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,568
- Well, we've done it.
- Yeah, we've done it.

1191
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,533
- Now all we need is the map.
- What? (Laughing)

1192
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,155
We don't need the map. We know where
the time hole is. Let's get out of here.

1193
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,658
- Mm Evmlllü mm me map, IIIH.
- Ollhn, damn mht yes..

1194
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:02,956
Last thing we want to do
is see him again. Come on.

1195
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:06,171
But you can't leave it with him,
or he'll destroy the world!

1196
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,841
Oh, Robert, Benson,

1197
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:16,136
I feel the power of evil
coursing through my veins,

1198
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:20,557
filling every corner of my being
with the desire to do wrong.

1199
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:24,148
- I feel so bad, Benson.
- Good! Good!

1200
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:28,736
Yes, it is good, for this is the worst
kind of badness that I'm feeling.

1201
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:32,653
- Kill me, master! Kill me!
- Not now, Benson. We have work to do.

1202
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,197
No less a work than the overthrowing
of creation itself.

1203
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:40,744
We will remake man
in our image, not His.

1204
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,827
We will turn mountains into sea,

1205
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:48,126
and the skies into rivers,
and fjords into deserts.

1206
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:51,171
- Come on! Come on!
- And deserts into quagmires.

1207
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,091
The boy's insane.
We can't go in there.

1208
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,133
Shh!

1209
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:58,132
Oh!

1210
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,680
- Let me see!
- And icebergs into fire!

1211
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:04,976
And the fire into a mighty rushing wind
which will cover the face of the earth...

1212
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,942
and wipe clean the scourge of woolly
thinking once and for all.

1213
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,028
We can make beans into peas!

1214
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,274
Oh, Benson.

1215
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:19,995
Dear Benson, you are so mercifully free
of the ravages of intelligence.

1216
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:24,833
- You say... such nice things, master.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

1217
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:32,003
Now, Benson, I shall have to turn you
into a dog for a while.

1218
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,092
Thank you, master.

1219
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,255
(Grunting)

1220
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:41,304
Stay, Benson. Guard the map.

1221
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:46,142
Robert, we must plan
a new world together.

1222
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,140
This time
we'll start it properly.

1223
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,142
Tell me about computers.

1224
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:54,567
Uh, a computer
is an automatic electronic apparatus...

1225
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:57,157
for making calculations.

1226
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:03,038
(Robert)
Or controlling operations...

1227
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,157
- (Creaking)
- That are expressible...

1228
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,081
in numerical or logical terms.

1229
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:11,706
(Evil)
And fast breeder reactors?

1230
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:14,754
(Robert)
Ah, fast breeder reactors...

1231
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:18,629
use a fast fission process...

1232
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:22,008
for the generation
of fissile isotopes.

1233
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:24,100
(Growling)

1234
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:27,938
(Growling continues)

1235
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:31,900
- Be quiet, Benson!
- (Growling, whimpering)

1236
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:34,645
Show me more, Robert.

1237
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:36,988
Show me...

1238
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:41,702
Show me...
subscriber trunk dialling.

1239
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,117
I must know everything.

1240
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:48,994
(Whimpering)

1241
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,630
(Whimpering, barking)

1242
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:12,687
Come on! Throw!

1243
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,309
Throw it!

1244
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,076
(Scuffling)

1245
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,286
Stop!

1246
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,210
Come on! Oh, no!

1247
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:39,300
- (Squealing)
- Let's get out of here!

1248
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:41,340
- (Grunting)
- Come on!

1249
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:44,966
Stop them by every means
in my power!

1250
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:49,140
- (Thunderclaps)
- (Shrieking)

1251
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:00,189
(Shrieking continues)

1252
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,827
It's coming this way!
Run for it!

1253
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:17,251
I'm coming! I'm coming!

1254
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:35,894
We're trapped.

1255
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:39,273
- We've got to separate.

01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:35,025
Do be careful.

1415
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:36,989
You weren't watching.

1416
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:40,655
Don't lose any of that stuff.
That's concentrated evil.

1417
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,997
One drop of that could turn
you all into hermit crabs.

1418
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,957
I'm sorry, sir.

1419
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:49,874
I, I was just wondering
if there's, um,

1420
01:47:50,005 --> 01:47:53,873
any chance we might
have our old jobs back, sir.

1421
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,968
Oh, you certainly were
appallingly bad robbers.

1422
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,337
Yes, sir.

1423
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:03,091
I really should do something
very extrovert and vengeful with you.

1424
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,013
Honestly, I'm too tired.

1425
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:08,979
But I think I'll just transfer you
to the undergrowth department...

1426
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,941
yes, bracken, small shrubs...
that sort of thing...

1427
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:17,109
with a 19% cut in salary
backdated to the beginning of time.

1428
01:48:17,241 --> 01:48:19,232
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1429
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:23,032
Well, I am the nice one.

1430
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,780
Is it all ready? Right!

1431
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:29,159
Come on, then. Back to creation.

1432
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,457
- I mustn't waste any more time.
- Bye, Kevin.

1433
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:37,049
They'll think I've lost control
again and put it all down to evolution.

1434
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,043
- Come on.
- Sir?

1435
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:42,217
Yes? - What about my friend, sir?
Can he come with us?

1436
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:45,971
No, of course not.
This isn't a school outing.

1437
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:47,889
But, sir, he deserves something.

1438
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:51,606
- I mean, without him...
- Oh, don't go on about it.

1439
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:54,852
- He's got to stay here to carry on the fight.
- Fidgit!

1440
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:57,149
(Randall) Come on. Fidgit!

1441
01:48:57,281 --> 01:49:00,615
Hey! You can't go!

1442
01:49:00,743 --> 01:49:03,735
- Hey, you can't leave me!
- Fidgit!

1443
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,532
- Fidgit, come on!
- Wait, please!

1444
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:09,032
- Come on, Fidgit!
- Hey! Stop!

1445
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:12,706
Hey! Hey! Don't leave me!

1446
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:16,001
Hey! Help! Stop!

1447
01:49:16,133 --> 01:49:19,797
(Coughing)
Don't go! Help! Don't leave me!

1448
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:23,091
Hey! Don't go! Stop!

1449
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:26,841
- Don't leave me! Please! Wait!
- (Siren wailing)

1450
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,968
(Coughing)
Don't leave me! Please!

1451
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:32,180
(Siren stops)

1452
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,600
(Crashing)

1453
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,026
Come on! Come on!

1454
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,152
(Fireman) Let's go!

1455
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:53,576
- (Coughing)
- (Sirens wailing)

1456
01:49:53,712 --> 01:49:57,125
- Let go! I've got to save it!
- Don't be a fool, Diane!

1457
01:49:57,257 --> 01:50:00,045
- I'm going in for the toaster!
- No! No!

1458
01:50:00,177 --> 01:50:03,215
- Oh, Trevor!
- Me super deluxe steamer!

1459
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,463
(Diane) Om.

1460
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,636
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1461
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,975
I think so. (Coughing)

1462
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,142
You're a very lucky boy.

1463
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:16,641
Honestly, Trevor.
If you'd been half a man,

1464
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:19,064
you'd have gone in there
after the blender.

1465
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,408
(Siren fading)

1466
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,241
- This is what started it.
- Eh?

1467
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,377
Left the Sunday joint
cookin' all night, didn't we?

1468
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:39,630
Sunday joint? It's Thursday.

1469
01:50:39,758 --> 01:50:41,419
I never touched it!

1470
01:50:41,552 --> 01:50:44,715
(Diane) Well, someone put it on.

1471
01:50:44,847 --> 01:50:46,713
Well, there was no meat
in there last night.

1472
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:49,181
Oh! Well, what do you
call this then?

1473
01:50:54,148 --> 01:50:56,014
Mum! Dad!

1474
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,016
It's Evil!

1475
01:50:58,152 --> 01:51:00,860
Don't touch it!

01:51:29,725 --> 01:51:31,682
