00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:25,554
I need to talk to my son.

715
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,953
Get him out of there.

716
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,402
Damn, man.

717
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:49,143
You really ought
to start taking your pills.

718
00:48:49,187 --> 00:48:51,015
[chuckles]

719
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,931
Baby, I ain't taking no pills.

720
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:56,977
Nah, man.

721
00:48:57,021 --> 00:49:00,415
Them pills make me feel
like a vegetable.

722
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:03,288
I'd rather feel the pain.

723
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:05,551
You know, the pain...

724
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:09,163
makes me feel alive.

725
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,774
I'm-a go out in pain.

726
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,602
All right, man.

727
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,489
Man, what the fuck
is this, homie?

728
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,710
I need to talk to you, Ricky.

729
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:36,930
I'm not talking
to you, nigga.Hey!

730
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,801
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

731
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,281
Man, it's between
me and my pops, nigga.

732
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,674
Don't tell me shit.Yeah, if you can

733
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:43,806
shut your mouth,
you might learn something.

734
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,505
From this nigga here?What and you're smarter?

735
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:48,681
I'm definitely not dumber
than this clown.

736
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:50,204
[chuckles]

737
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:52,772
Yeah, you're so smart,
you ended up in here.

738
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,252
Shit, he in here, too.

739
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:57,037
Yeah, and he was
a fucking asshole then, too.

740
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:59,953
But at least now,
he's got experience on his side.

741
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,085
Amen.

742
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:03,043
Now, sit down.

743
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:05,524
Uh-uh.

744
00:50:07,656 --> 00:50:10,529
Listen, I'm about half the size

745
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,183
of 90% of the inmates here.

746
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:14,881
But I guarantee you,

747
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,710
I am the last person
you want to piss off.

748
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,582
Ricky, you need
to shut up.

749
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,499
Can I have a minute alone
with my son, please?

750
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:26,240
I'll be right outside.

751
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,075
When are you gonna get
the point, my nigger?

752
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,208
I don't fuck with you.
You don't mean shit to me.

753
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,297
I know that.

754
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,038
I know I ain't shit.

755
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:42,691
I know I don't mean shit to you.

756
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,215
I got the point.

757
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:48,219
So why you keep trying
to talk to me then, man?

758
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:50,917
'Cause I ain't gonna be
here much longer, that's why.

759
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,225
What, you getting transferred
or something?

760
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:55,791
[chuckles]

761
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:58,794
Yeah, yeah, I'm going
to get transferred.

762
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,753
Shit, good. That'll mean
I don't have to deal

763
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,495
with your motherfucking ass
no more.

764
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,453
Where are they
sending you to anyway?

765
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,892
I got brain cancer.

766
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,070
What?

767
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,723
I got brain cancer.

768
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,514
Fuck!

769
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:25,604
Why you telling me this, man?

770
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:27,823
Huh? What, you want
some sympathy from me

771
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,086
or something, homey?

772
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:32,437
No, no. No, me nigga.

773
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,180
Nigga, I don't want no sympathy.

774
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,573
We father and son.

775
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:41,185
My last days on this planet

776
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:44,666
I thought we could have
a regular-ass conversation.

777
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,411
And I said all that shit

778
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:52,500
about you being dead
to me and all that.

779
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:54,198
No, that shit is cool.

780
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,156
That shit is real cool.

781
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,766
I wasdead to you.

782
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,726
I wasn't therefor you.

783
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:02,858
I was dead to myself.

784
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:05,209
I was dead to my family.

785
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,688
You right.

786
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:09,213
I deserved that.

787
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:13,478
God works in mysterious ways.

788
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:17,873
I was a cancer to my family,
so God blessed me with cancer.

789
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:22,051
That's how
God works, son.

790
00:52:22,095 --> 00:52:26,665
You're going to get back
what you give out.

791
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,452
Now what you going to do?

792
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,637
Look, brothers,

793
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:47,599
God will forgive you
for anything,

794
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:52,430
if you repent from your heart.

795
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:55,476
You got to do the shit
from your heart.

796
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,175
You banged
from your heart.

797
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,873
You got to repent
from your heart.

798
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:07,227
Now, man--
he won't forgive you for shit.

799
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,229
Now, that's how man is.

800
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:12,232
You make one mistake
on this fucking planet

801
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,843
and man's going
to lock you up for life.

802
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,715
You feel me?

803
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:18,107
Yeah.Yeah.

804
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,544
Yeah.

805
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,722
Son...

806
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:27,595
you know I ain't going to say
I know what love is

807
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:32,644
'cause I don't know
if I ever loved anybody,

808
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,951
but, uh...

809
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:39,216
I feel something
in my heart for you.

810
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,739
I ain't no bitch nigga.

811
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:42,654
I ain't going to say I love you.

812
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:45,396
I'm just going to say I feel
something in my heart for you.

813
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:47,746
You feel me?
Yeah, Pops.

814
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,230
[coughs]

815
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:57,930
Cain.

816
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:01,760
Here's the book
you asked me about.

817
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:06,243
Cain, you all right in there?

818
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:25,305
Willie.
Yeah?

819
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:29,091
Can you play
something warm today?

820
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:31,137
Yeah, sure, man.

821
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:34,749
Sure.

822
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,448
[Cain coughing]

823
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:40,146
Spoke to your
baby's mama.

824
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:43,323
They let you
out the hole?

825
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:48,720
Yeah, warden gave me
my one hour out here with you.

826
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:51,288
But I had to bring
along company.

827
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:53,420
That's all right.

828
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:58,860
It hurt bad?

829
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:01,994
Yeah.

830
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,691
It takes a little while.

831
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:06,912
Then the pain goes away.

832
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:10,176
What they say?
Like, how much longer?

833
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:17,575
Long enough.

834
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:20,273
Look, son...

835
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,536
I want you
to promise me something.

836
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,323
You do
your time here,

837
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:29,500
and you promise me
you won't come back.

838
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:33,373
And you help someone
not come here.

839
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,028
Fuck up the cycle.

840
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:42,339
Brother Cain...

841
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,384
I need to holler to ya
for a tick.

842
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,647
So holler.

843
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:52,044
So I see you all
getting along now.

844
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:54,916
That favor-- I need to collect.

845
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,961
What favor?

846
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,005
I ain't talking to you,
nigga boy.

847
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:58,964
Watch your conduct, nigga.

848
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,097
So it's like that?

849
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,839
Yeah, it's like that.
What the fuck you want?

850
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,015
My favor.

851
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,974
Speak on it.

852
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:13,587
I need some help
getting some shit in here.

853
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:16,329
What kind of shit?

854
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,897
Same old shit.

855
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,986
Man, I'm in the hole
23 hours a day.

856
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:23,249
How am I going to get
your shit in here?

857
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:25,817
Ain't my problem.

858
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,384
When you asked me for help,

859
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:29,821
I didn't ask,
"How am I going to do that?"

860
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,953
I just got it done.

861
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:33,215
I got this shit, homey.

862
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,956

Cain, you must

880
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:18,799
You've got to be in
an enormous amount of pain.

881
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,279
I ain't taking no pills.

882
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:22,150
I know it makes you
feel out of it,

883
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,412
but you have to take them.

884
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:24,936
Shut up!

just for the pain.

886

Don't raise your fucking
hands at me, motherfucker.

00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,536
Blood of Jesus.

893
00:59:01,712 --> 00:59:04,410
Blood of Jesus.

894
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:08,109
The blood of Jesus.
The blood of Jesus.

895
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:12,636
The blood of Jesus.

896
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:15,639
The blood
of Jesus.

897
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,771
The blood of Jesus.

898
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:19,468
What's up, Pop?

899
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:21,775
What's up, son?

900
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:24,169
What your doctor say?

901
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:26,127
It don't matter.

902
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:30,392
The Lord will never give you
more than you can handle.

903
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:32,960
You remember that.

904
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:38,705
The life that I'm living
is the life I was giving,

905
00:59:38,749 --> 00:59:42,666
in Jesus' name, amen.

906
00:59:42,709 --> 00:59:48,628
You know, son, this...
this is a blessing in disguise.

907
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:52,676
This is God's way of allowing
me to connect with my son.

908
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,939
Build a relationship.

909
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,729
I can dig it.

910
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:04,688
Pray with me?

911
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:07,212
Yeah, we could pray.

912
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:14,480
Your hand.

913
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:18,963
Lord Jesus, I thank you

914
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:21,530
for allowing me this time

915
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:26,057
on this planet
to bond with my son,

916
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,667
in Jesus'... [gasps]

917
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:29,843
Pop! Pop!

918
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:30,975
Guard!

919
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,813
ZELTZER:
He's heavily sedated.

920
01:00:42,856 --> 01:00:44,684
How long you think
this shit could last?

921
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:45,990
Can never tell.

922
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:47,992
Now, if... when he comes to,

923
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:50,298
needs to continue
to take his meds.

924
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,693
All right.

925
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:04,051
So, they tell me
you the motherfucker in here.

926
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:05,749
And you are?

927
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:08,229
The motherfucker on the outside.

928
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,016
Which means nothing
to the motherfucker in here.

929
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,322
What if me and my boys
on the outside

930
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:15,976
could triple your profit?

931
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,283
While I'm gonna carve a
little something off the top

932
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,589
nice for myself, but
just a little something,

933
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,114
'cause I ain't trying to be
the motherfucker in here.

934
01:01:23,157 --> 01:01:25,986
I just figured you'll remember
and look out for a motherfucker

935
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,380
that can make something
like that happen for you.

936
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:32,123
My motherfucker.

937
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,703
Was a good session
today, man.

938
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,748
Think we're really
getting to the kids.

939
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,708
You know, the life
of crime, man,

940
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:54,667
ain't what it's all
cracked up to be.

941
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,365
Land you in a place like
this motherfucking hellhole.

942
01:01:59,411 --> 01:02:01,413
Joe, psst.

943
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:03,458
Psst.

944
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:06,853
I need a favor.

945
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,595
Get this to my soldier, Derek.

946
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:31,399
Cain looking for you.

947
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,662
Cain is in the hole.

948
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:35,273
He talked to the warden

949
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:38,232
about letting use of
that Pipeline program.

950
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,408
So, now, homey,
you can have a meeting.

951
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:43,107
Yeah.

952
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:56,294
Brother Cain.

953
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:58,339
Hmm?

954
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,822
What's good?

955
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,737
I'm gonna move on someone.

956
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,305
Now, it ain't got nothing to do
with your shit.

957
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:09,220
Who we talking about?

958
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:11,004
And why?

959
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:13,267
JD Parker.

960
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:15,443
Now, I ain't going
into no details,

961
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:17,837
but nobody fucks
with my son.

962
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,708
I'm doing business with JD.

963
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,841
Not anymore.

964
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,843
Is that right?

965
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:26,541
So, my word don't
mean shit now?

966
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:28,674
[chuckling]

967
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:32,939
Your word ain't never
meant shit to me.

968
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:36,290
That's why I had you
come here alone.

969
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,990
I figured I was going to have
to pull your card.

970
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:42,166
So, don't come in here,
motherfucker,

971
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:43,515
acting like I didn't protect

972
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:45,430
your little punk ass
back in the day.

973
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,084
You remember that?

974
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:51,479
Mm-hmm.

975
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:55,744
You're running shit
'cause I allow it.

976
01:03:55,788 --> 01:04:00,401
Now, JD-- he a dead man.

977
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:03,622
And don't
get it twisted.

978
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,451
Don't ever think
a nigga like me

979
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:10,020
got to ask permission
from a nigga like you

980
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,848
for anything.

981
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:27,559
It's time for y'all
to put some work in.

982
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:28,734
That's what's up.

983
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:31,041
Cain, his motherfucking son,
and Derek--

984
01:04:31,084 --> 01:04:32,477
I want all dealt with.

985
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:34,958
Damn, big homey.

986
01:04:35,001 --> 01:04:36,960
Cain is like a legend
up in here.

987
01:04:37,003 --> 01:04:38,352
You about to be
history, nigga,

988
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:40,398
cheering that
motherfucker on.

989
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:42,443
Get the fuck out of here.

990
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:45,011
Bitch ass.

991
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,057
You understand?

992
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,149
Now, I told you, nigga,
you pay attention

993
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,715
to what the fuck I'm doing
in this bitch.

994
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,716
You understand me?

995
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,109
I do, man.

996
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:57,850
DEREK:
Make me look stupid
up in this place.

997
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,852
You better get the word out.

998
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,202
I will. Just let me know.

999
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:04,378
No, I'll tell you when.

1000
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:06,815
Go on. Get lost right now.

1001
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:09,993
So, how my deal
work out for you?

1002
01:05:10,036 --> 01:05:11,995
Better than expected.

1003
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:13,735
I got your 25%.

1004
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:15,172
Have a seat.

1005
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:20,525
You know what?
Let's make it 20.

1006
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:22,222
Consider it a gift

1007
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,138
for giving me the opportunity
to do business with you.

1008
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:30,274
So, here's the deal.

1009
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:32,580
Here's what I'm going to do.

1010
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:36,889
I'm going to let you
have Ricky.

1011
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:41,981
But Cain's crazy ass
is going to come out after you.

1012
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,984
Don't worry about that.

1013
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:47,204
Got to do this right.

1014
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,206
You know what I'm saying?

1015
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:50,685
Cain's got
some followers in here,

1016
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:52,774
and war is bad for business.

1017
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:55,168
So I'll set up when and where.

1018
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:57,170
You take care of Ricky,

1019
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,694
I'll take care of Cain's
gorilla-looking ass,

1020
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:02,349
and you and I will continue
to make this money together.

1021
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,656
Now, that's what's up.

1022
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:10,618
Cain, I need the truth.

1023
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,493
Everybody's being really
hush-hush about this thing,

1024
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:17,538
and I know it's coming.

1025
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,673
I hear them drums in my head.

1026
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:31,074
See, I live in the jungle,
and I hear drums.

1027
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,076
Them drums talk to me.

1028
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,774
Storm's coming, baby,

1029
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:39,212
but there ain't nothing
you can do about it. Nothing.

1030
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:45,610
I'm the one
who's got the most to lose.

1031
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:48,004
It's my son we're talking about.

1032
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,919
We... we're talking
about my son.

1033
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:55,011
I know you
like the back of my hand.

1034
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:57,665
And I know that there is nothing

1035
01:06:57,709 --> 01:06:59,972
that you wouldn't do
for your son,

1036
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,670
including sacrificing
yourself.

1037
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:07,240
You can't do that.

1038
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:10,852
But, now, you...
you-you could separate them.

1039
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:12,941
This is a prison, Cain.

1040
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,727
Some of the most feared
criminals run amok here.

1041
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,120
We can't do that.

1042
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:20,471
And that JD kid...
[chuckles]

1043
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:23,691
he's an assassin.

1044
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:25,737
I can see it in his eyes.

1045
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,653
You know
what that means.

1046
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:31,003
I got to kill JD.

1047
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,310
No, no.
Yeah.

1048
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:34,833
That's not going to happen.

1049
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:36,487
That's not going to happen
in this prison.

1050
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:38,228
And that's exactly the kind
of behavior

1051
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:41,318
that's going to put you
right back in the hole.

1052
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,190
Now, do you want that to be
what I have to do?

1053
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,497
You want to go back there?

1054
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,283
I'm trying to be very,
very patient with you, Cain.

1055
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:52,329
Can I leave?

1056
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:14,612
[scraping]

1057
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:35,676
[scraping]

1058
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,548
"Do not hide your face from me,

1059
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:40,855
"or I will be like those
who go down to the pit.

1060
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:43,206
"Let the morning bring me word

1061
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:46,078
of your un... unf...
unfailing love."

1062
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:49,777
[door opens and closes]

1063
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,779
So, who is this?

1064
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:54,217
JD is his name.

1065
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:57,089
So, there's no other way
we can get this quashed?

1066
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,179
Not with my son's life
on the line.

1067
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:02,181
What's up with you?

1068
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,704
