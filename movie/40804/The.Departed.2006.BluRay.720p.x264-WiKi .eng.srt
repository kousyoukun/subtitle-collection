1
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,956
I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.

2
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:52,770
I want my environment
to be a product of me.

3
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,238
Years ago, we had the Church.

4
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:03,039
That was only a way
of saying we had each other.

5
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,579
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:09,948
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:13,520
The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.

8
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:14,920
True guineas.

9
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,619
They took over their piece of the city.

10
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:24,195
Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...

11
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,499
...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.

12
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,974
That's what the niggers don't realize.

13
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:36,410
If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:

14
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,709
No one gives it to you.

15
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,784
You have to take it.

16
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:06,007
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:08,669
Wort happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:15,115
Carmers developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:17,380
You should be proud.

20
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:32,760
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,888
You Johnny Sullivars kid?

22
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:56,056
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,593
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,326
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:08,064
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,933
You do good in school?

27
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,081
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,843
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:24,952
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:34,724
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,596
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,396
Good.

33
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:42,096
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,040
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,204
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,510
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,983
- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.

38
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,714
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,383
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,722
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,489
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,530
You have to take it.

43
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,969
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,603
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,470
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:22,410
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:26,582
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:37,086
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:42,498
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,967
When you decide to be something,
you can be it.

51
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,403
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:54,102
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,043
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,776
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,918
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,891
That's my boy.

57
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:13,193
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:16,061
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,328
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:23,133
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,175
When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...

62
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:29,508
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,807
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,419
- Tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...

65
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:38,147
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:48,222
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:56,068
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,032
Pencils.

70
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,078
Begin.

71
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,816
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,030
Forget it.

73
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,827
Your father was a janitor,
his sors only a cop.

74
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:30,106
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:32,070
They are.

76
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:35,805
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:41,419
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,419
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:45,613
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,157
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,886
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:54,328
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,999
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,264
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,206
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:10,747
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,850
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,112
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:30,327
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:34,268
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,207
School's out.

92
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,920
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,711
You earned it.

94
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,949
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:57,650
All right.

96
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,353
This is not the regular police...

97
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:01,431
...this is the state police.
- And fire!

98
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,726
Your training will illustrate the difference.

99
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,598
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,136
What's the difference?

101
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,706
- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!

102
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,936
- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

103
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:17,275
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,194
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:34,855
...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,903
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,572
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,736
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,943
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,484
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,887
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,690
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,601
You can sit.

115
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,280
So...

116
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:28,217
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,184
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,052
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:37,718
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,822
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,524
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,727
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,304
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:51,408
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,037
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:58,739
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,556
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:10,023
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,926
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,032
That's right.

131
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,595
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,001
Closed casket?

133
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,439
That's right.

134
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:28,980
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,275
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,850
- You had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,791
I got a question.

138
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,018
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,432
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:02,841
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:07,818
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,949
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:15,251
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,089
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:22,999
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,264
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,270
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,272
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,812
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:40,007
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:43,518
...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,451
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:52,794
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,525
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:59,795
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:04,237
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,468
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,374
...by enanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,311
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,645
And we will do it.

161
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,277
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,751
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,984
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,091
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,723
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,427
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:35,300
She's straight out of Going My Way.

168
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,566
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:41,701
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,610
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,944
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,246
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,185
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,654
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,795
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,430
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,066
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:07,102
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:10,173
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,639
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:16,679
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:19,078
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,184
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,618
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,759
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,418
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,360
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,425
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,834
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,975
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,635
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:53,876
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:58,378
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:01,184
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,651
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,996
We have a question.

197
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,834
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,305
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:22,139
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:24,941
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,914
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,350
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,613
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,757
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,290
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,896
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,031
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,728
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,737
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,740
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,505
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,341
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:58,516 --> 00:14:59,608
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,516
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,621
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:13,290
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:22,305
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:25,408
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,978
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,981
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:38,145
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:41,557
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,753
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,626
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,499
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:58,438
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,582
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,614
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:17,219
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,023
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,429
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,560
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,141
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:35,874
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,878
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:41,384
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,052
No.

238
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:46,650
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:48,849
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:53,721
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:56,196
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,830
Sure.

243
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:04,138
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,833
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:10,208
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,578
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:16,549
Amen.

248
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:39,975
So what do I do?

249
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,111
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,375
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,884
Tax-free.

252
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:54,790
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:58,690
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:58,863 --> 00:17:59,921
Given your nature.

255
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:03,100
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,792
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,665
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,166
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,701
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,746
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,874
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,385
Do it again.

263
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,218
For me.

264
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:05,462
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,531
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:12,032
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:14,865
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,720
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:36,826
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:39,986
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,331
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,766
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,168
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,703
So you know.

275
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:55,710
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:58,682
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,978
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:04,782
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,350
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,087
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:15,264
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:19,695
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,032
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,531
I got, like...

285
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,168
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:32,111
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,945
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,816
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,355
You know what you...

290
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,858
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,125
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,202
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:54,998
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,711
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:06,046
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:10,011
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,749
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:18,453
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:22,099
R is for Ricans
P is for pigs

300
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,360
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,505
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:32,107
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:35,734
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:37,346
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:41,245
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,410
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,419
...concerned.

308
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:51,461
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,995
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,929
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,569
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,464
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,131
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,277
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,945
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,206
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,546
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,918
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,023
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:29,665
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:36,468
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,534
Do you know me?

323
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,573
No. No.

324
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,947
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:48,108
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,276
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,718
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,552
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,752
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:04,125
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:09,231
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,366
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,375
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,841
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:21,109
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:26,018
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,449
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,427
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,897
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:48,173
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,743
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,585
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:05,726
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,564
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:10,666
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,427
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,833
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,235
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:22,578
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:25,579
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,684
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:31,117
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,552
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,558
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,626
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,128
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,859
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:47,299
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:50,304
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,305
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:55,309
These pieces of plastic are won'th
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,039
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:01,150
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:03,377
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,920
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,251
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,983
Southie projects.

369
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,823
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:16,023
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,929
...which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:21,162
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,535
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:29,437
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,046
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:32,682
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,375
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:38,021
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,589
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:44,194
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,092
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:50,864
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,730
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,235
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,306
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,101
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,573
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,647
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,882
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:13,785
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,791
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,122
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:22,288
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:25,299
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:27,301
Allegedly.

396
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,467
Allegedly.

397
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,108
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,244
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,470
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:41,775
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:45,816
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,926
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:53,530
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,499
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,511
You making a house call?

406
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,141
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,811
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:22,652
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:26,421
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:30,431
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,262
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:35,894
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,166
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,435
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:43,739
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,211
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:48,249
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,911
- Whers the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,853
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasrt insulting you.

420
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,687
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,659
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:05,928
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,333
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:11,531
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,199
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,817
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,823
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:33,121
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,425
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,897
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,898
Cut him here.

432
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:43,139
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,402
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:51,241
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:54,942
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,088
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:00,746
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:03,950
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,356
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,965
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:12,591
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,228
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,240
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,844
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,879
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,278
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,681
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,947
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,647
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,884
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,585
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,603
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,537
Fuck!

454
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,874
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,154
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,492
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:19,727
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:28,377
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,103
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,838
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:32,015 --> 00:30:35,416
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:42,921
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,028
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,561
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:57,670
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:57,841 --> 00:30:59,706
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:02,505
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,213
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:07,782
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,283
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:13,850
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,423
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,757
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,563
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:28,199
Don't you?

476
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,840
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,442
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,169
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:40,612
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:43,917
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:47,250
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:47,424 --> 00:31:49,415
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,754
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:55,090
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,432
Fair enough.

486
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:03,300
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,502
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,940
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:11,840
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,844
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,112
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:21,223
My word against yours.

493
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:25,319
- Then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,530
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:32,726
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:37,805
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,841
Schuyler.

498
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,823
Do you know who I am?

499
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,588
No.

500
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:10,937
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,609
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,184
No.

503
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:33,763
Come with me.

504
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:42,567
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:49,237
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:53,281
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:02,189
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,520
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,428
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:11,192
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:14,394
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,971
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,208
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,575
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,249
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,718
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,619
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:37,660
Shoes.

519
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:45,791
I knew your father.

520
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:52,102
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:55,945
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:59,773
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,680
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,685
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,515
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:13,159
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,730
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:19,335
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:21,368
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:22,800
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,497
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:28,007
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:38,345
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,421
He's clean.

535
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,856
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:48,828
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:53,959
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:58,437
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,542
I just can't know.

540
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:06,210
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:10,611
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:14,123
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,124
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,964
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:26,261
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,464
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,437
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,843
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:41,475
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:46,381
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:50,022
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:55,531
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,135
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:05,541
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,769
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,309
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,642
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,911
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:20,415
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:22,285
Well, these days...

561
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,584
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:27,096
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:32,257
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,904
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:43,145
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:45,975
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,614
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:54,681
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,956
She wasrt.

570
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,128
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,260
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,463
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,369
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,635
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:39,026
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:42,899
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,837
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,476
Thanks.

579
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:53,974
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,947
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,381
All right, see you then.

582
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,588
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,593
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:18,834
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:20,738
...and he'll say so.

586
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,210
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:27,577
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,910
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,854
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,326
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:48,561
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:58,713
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,876
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:07,549
Lennon said:

595
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,986
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,563
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,166
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,601
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,379
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:36,217
Too bad.

601
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,718
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:42,613
Now what?

603
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,094
Choir practice.

604
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,461
Choir practice...

605
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,737
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:56,873 --> 00:41:00,639
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:02,471
...and make something out of it.

608
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,112
For instance...

609
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:10,017
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:14,016
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,680
French.

613
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,327
Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.

614
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:20,190
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,329
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:26,469
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:28,866
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:30,973
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,809
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,683
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,548
We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...

622
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:50,989
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,561
- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.

624
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,028
- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.

625
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:59,066
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:02,170
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,738
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,172
Anybody says anything about
anything like that...

629
00:42:07,343 --> 00:42:08,332
...you let us know.

630
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:14,510
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:17,181
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,344
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,818
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,323
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:28,692
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,696
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,902
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,065
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,505
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,703
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:48,948
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,280
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:55,390
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:58,686
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:02,262
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:04,957
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,068
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:15,002
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:16,202
Hey.

650
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,478
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:26,383
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,184
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,156
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:33,227
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:33,396 --> 00:43:36,695
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,494
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:41,762
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:44,463
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:47,768
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:50,811
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,212
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:57,111
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:57,287 --> 00:43:58,481
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:00,782
...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,050
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:06,059
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasrt for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:07,491
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,894
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,500
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,728
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:17,168
Queenars compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,671
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,469
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,878
Bottom line...

675
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:26,140
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:29,183
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:33,253
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,721
Do we have direct access
to Queenars undercovers?

679
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:38,486
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:40,094
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,390
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:46,695
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,361
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,438
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,270
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:58,380
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:00,175
Good.

688
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:03,549
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:06,517
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:26,041
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:28,940
You know...

692
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,579
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:34,808
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:37,248
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,218
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,620
And he could do it...

697
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:47,094
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:56,464
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,131
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,607
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,306
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:10,248
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:14,849
And I think about this.

704
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:23,459
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:27,168
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:29,361
School?

707
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:34,104
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:34,277 --> 00:46:36,370
...school is out.

709
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:39,877
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:42,946
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:47,122
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,952
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:52,352
Little boys...

714
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:56,959
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,967
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:07,374
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:11,570
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,052
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,621
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,585
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,454
Pay them.

722
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:29,823
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,767
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:42,308
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:44,412
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,140
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:49,978
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:52,780
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didrt know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:53,523 --> 00:47:54,922
Beeper number.

730
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,923
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,293
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:08,003
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,297
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,900
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:16,135
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:17,574
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:20,409
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,911
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:26,543
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,714
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:31,553
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:36,257
I beeped you.

743
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:39,559
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:43,136
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,775
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:50,242
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:58,478
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:05,090
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:05,328 --> 00:49:08,855
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,390
So make the call.

751
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,497
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:24,573
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:45,858
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:47,969
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

755
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:52,440
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:56,707
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:58,642
Bye.

758
00:49:58,848 --> 00:50:02,045
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,396
Thank you.

760
00:50:21,704 --> 00:50:23,137
So who are you?

761
00:50:23,305 --> 00:50:26,741
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:28,570
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:32,077
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,944
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,210
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:40,753
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,732
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:01,336
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:11,510
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:19,027
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:20,787
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,836
Do you lie?

773
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:35,733
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:37,606
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:41,081
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,343
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:44,679
You lie.

778
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:47,512
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,749
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:55,352
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,792
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:06,402
Did you?

783
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,202
No.

784
00:52:10,513 --> 00:52:12,276
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:15,042
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:19,150
How I feel.

787
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:21,221
How I feel.

788
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:43,806
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:52,019
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:53,985
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:57,493 --> 00:52:58,824
You sit there...

792
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:01,224
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,192
A mass murderer.

794
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:06,562
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:09,365
And your hand...

796
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,439
...steady.

797
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:19,144
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:21,510
...does not shake.

799
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:23,808
Ever.

800
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:34,788
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:39,257
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:41,636
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:46,605
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:48,936
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:52,308
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:55,712
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:56,585 --> 00:53:58,246
Should I?

808
00:53:58,554 --> 00:54:01,887
So do they all come in here...

809
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:04,287
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,762
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:11,127
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,427
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:15,436
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:17,902
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:20,541
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,610
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:23,779 --> 00:54:26,805
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,779
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,125
I looked at your file.

820
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:41,821
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:43,521
Yeah.

822
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,824
So what was it like for you in jail?

823
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:50,467
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:52,470
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:54,274
No.

826
00:54:56,478 --> 00:55:00,938
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:04,517
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:07,588
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:10,122
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,884
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,189
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:18,492
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,033
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:24,764
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,965
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,905
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:31,512
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,911
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:38,679
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:40,981
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasrt a joke.

841
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:43,386
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,929
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:53,000
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,862
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:56,038 --> 00:55:59,337
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:01,066
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:03,609
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:07,576
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,877
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:13,351
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:13,522 --> 00:56:15,217
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:18,326
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:18,494 --> 00:56:22,191
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:24,059
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:25,996
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:28,534
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:29,932
You know that.

858
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,105
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:35,707
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,305
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:42,612
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:44,781
No bullshit.

863
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,483
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:52,917
You serious?

865
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:54,892
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,461
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:57:01,637 --> 00:57:03,298
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,338
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,306
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:11,776
We are this close:

871
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:15,578
All right?

872
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:18,614
What do you expect coming in here?

873
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:21,585
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:24,682
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,757
...what do you want?

876
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:28,595
You want the truth?

877
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:32,457
Valium.

878
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,929
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:39,506
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:43,372
...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:47,879
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,642
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:51,342
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,216
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,220
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:56,391 --> 00:58:00,020
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, l...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:58:00,195 --> 00:58:02,789
...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:07,095
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:07,269 --> 00:58:08,258
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:12,498
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,407
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:23,185 --> 00:58:24,982
Two pills?

893
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:28,015
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,351
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:30,526 --> 00:58:33,518
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:33,695 --> 00:58:36,095
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:40,702
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,697
Fuck.

899
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:55,076
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,047
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:59,119
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:04,385
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,427
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,022
What's this?

905
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,333
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:16,061
Yeah?

907
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:17,865
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,931
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,270
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:27,176
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:30,978
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:32,415
Thank you.

913
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,215
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:38,382
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:42,121
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:51,838
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:53,372
Come on in.

918
00:59:54,476 --> 00:59:58,469
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:00,239
Yes, those.

920
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:04,146
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,844
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:09,286
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:09,491 --> 01:00:13,052
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:15,093
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:18,324
Sullivars team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,865
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:24,370
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:26,734
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:30,867
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:34,648
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:34,816 --> 01:00:37,341
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,283
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,787
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,983
This lead came from
Queenars undercover guy.

935
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,722
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:56,963
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:57,139 --> 01:00:59,300
Yeah, something big came up at work.

938
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:01,965
- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.

939
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,711
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:08,380
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,711
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:17,022
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:19,689
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:21,726
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,521
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,168
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,099
Thank you.

948
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:35,276
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:38,607
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,510
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:44,618
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,413
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:54,123
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:56,793
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,729
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:06,037
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:09,244 --> 01:02:10,404
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:47,844
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:52,817
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:54,817
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:57,021
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:06,066
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:08,136 --> 01:03:10,195
All right, turn off your cell phones.

964
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:13,364
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:36,131 --> 01:03:39,157
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,234
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:44,133
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:44,306 --> 01:03:47,366
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:56,743
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:57,152 --> 01:04:00,781
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:17,028
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:17,472 --> 01:04:20,339
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:20,742 --> 01:04:24,439
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:28,014
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:30,079
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:39,894
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:42,689
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:42,864 --> 01:04:46,163
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:49,126
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:49,304 --> 01:04:51,499
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:07,556 --> 01:05:12,425
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:12,594 --> 01:05:14,755
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

983
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,458
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:17,632 --> 01:05:20,032
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:21,668
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,396
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:26,473
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:29,610
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,655
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:50,696
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,355
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:55,631
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,266
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,934
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,412
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:11,848
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:20,428
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:20,996 --> 01:06:22,725
...is one guy...

999
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:25,090
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:27,564
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:27,869 --> 01:06:29,166
...pays him.

1002
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:34,966
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:37,807
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:48,347
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:07,464
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:11,236
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:16,476
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamers cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:23,991
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,061
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:35,998
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,569
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:42,933
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:46,376
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:46,548 --> 01:07:49,813
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,346
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,750
I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.

1017
01:07:54,923 --> 01:07:57,915
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:58,093 --> 01:08:00,118
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:02,923
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:05,931
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:07,568
- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.

1022
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:10,796
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:14,135
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:18,336
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didrt-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:22,040
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:26,677
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,323
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:31,356
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:34,586
- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.

1030
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:37,857
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:47,035
- Changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,608
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,803
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:57,082
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:57,919 --> 01:09:00,547
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:06,455
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:08,152
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:12,799
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,332
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:18,199
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:20,832
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:21,476 --> 01:09:23,467
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:26,342
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:28,846
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:32,980
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:39,489
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:47,866
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:51,563
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,832
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,348
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,941
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:05,919
Yeah.

1053
01:10:07,355 --> 01:10:08,947
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:09,357 --> 01:10:10,585
Sure.

1055
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:15,856
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,191
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,133
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,462
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:24,229
We might have company.

1060
01:10:24,405 --> 01:10:26,396
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:30,542
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:34,409
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:35,771
Yeah?

1064
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:39,006
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:39,174 --> 01:10:42,701
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,847
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:48,617 --> 01:10:51,085
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,380
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:56,251
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:57,892
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,287
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:02,657
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,362
Mayor Sullivars office.

1074
01:11:06,535 --> 01:11:09,333
Put Colin on the phone right now.

1075
01:11:09,805 --> 01:11:11,102
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:11,273 --> 01:11:12,797
What?

1077
01:11:13,275 --> 01:11:15,402
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:15,577 --> 01:11:19,570
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:22,911
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,118
Something for work.

1081
01:11:26,288 --> 01:11:30,156
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:32,623
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:35,423
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:35,597 --> 01:11:37,292
- Yeah.
- She moved in.

1085
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:41,197
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,201
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:43,372 --> 01:11:46,773
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:46,942 --> 01:11:50,673
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:53,382 --> 01:11:54,747
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,544
So earn it.

1091
01:11:57,419 --> 01:11:59,478
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:01,555
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:04,257
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:07,224
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:08,488
Have you seen anything?

1096
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:12,259
I got no access to Queenars undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:13,628
- Doing my best.
- Your best?

1098
01:12:13,802 --> 01:12:16,669
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:16,839 --> 01:12:18,397
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:18,574 --> 01:12:22,442
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:26,069
...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.

1102
01:12:26,248 --> 01:12:28,182
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:32,514
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,953
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,322
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:44,023
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,996
If you can get me that information...

1108
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:48,602
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,965
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,869
I'll get you the records and whatnot.

1111
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,204
But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...

1112
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:59,677
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:59,848 --> 01:13:02,339
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:11,524
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:20,190
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:23,167
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:26,000
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:26,175 --> 01:13:30,168
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasrt around.

1119
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:32,472
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:32,648 --> 01:13:36,550
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:36,718 --> 01:13:38,709
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:41,854
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:45,482
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:45,928 --> 01:13:48,624
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:50,359
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:50,532 --> 01:13:53,695
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:57,202
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:01,740
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:05,073
Wouldrt you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:09,206
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:14,352
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:16,548
...or your life.

1133
01:14:17,526 --> 01:14:20,518
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:21,163 --> 01:14:22,892
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,345
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:26,982 --> 01:14:29,143
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:29,318 --> 01:14:31,081
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,215
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:38,019
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:40,429
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,463
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:48,295
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:52,840
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:01,872
Frankie.

1145
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:04,285
Frankie!

1146
01:15:05,154 --> 01:15:07,247
Your mother forgives me.

1147
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,892
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:14,063 --> 01:15:16,088
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:19,098
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:23,671
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:26,330
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,303
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,641
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:33,816 --> 01:15:35,750
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:38,909
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:42,854
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,286
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:49,363
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,188
Fuck!

1160
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:54,666
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:54,837 --> 01:15:58,796
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:58,974 --> 01:16:01,465
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:04,540
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:07,807
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:10,975
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:20,724
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:20,896 --> 01:16:23,228
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:28,198
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:32,670
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:35,208
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:39,609
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:40,783 --> 01:16:43,411
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:47,122 --> 01:16:50,489
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:55,564 --> 01:16:57,259
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:57,566 --> 01:17:00,694
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:04,237
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:04,406 --> 01:17:05,896
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:06,075 --> 01:17:09,670
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:11,472
Come on.

1180
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:48,244
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:55,689
There it is.

1182
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:58,816
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:15,776
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:19,944
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:23,641
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,912
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:26,088 --> 01:18:29,285
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:33,394
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:33,562 --> 01:18:35,393
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:38,961
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:52,473
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:55,985 --> 01:18:58,351
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,182
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:04,158
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:11,122
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,461
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:14,897
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:16,367
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:17,139 --> 01:19:19,130
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:19,475 --> 01:19:20,806
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:21,176 --> 01:19:23,701
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:23,879 --> 01:19:25,244
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:25,414 --> 01:19:29,578
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:50,929
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:55,034
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:03,815
Look...

1207
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:05,749
...if this is inappropriate, l...
- No.

1208
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:08,549
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:11,393 --> 01:20:13,361
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:16,290
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:27,135
That's me.

1212
01:20:30,212 --> 01:20:31,702
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:41,483
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:41,857 --> 01:20:43,256
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:43,425 --> 01:20:46,087
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:49,662
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:52,096
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:54,861
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:58,705
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:14,751
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:21,623
Is it real?

1222
01:21:25,534 --> 01:21:27,263
I think so.

1223
01:21:33,175 --> 01:21:35,040
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:36,768
No.

1225
01:21:37,746 --> 01:21:39,509
I like that.

1226
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,014
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:58,552
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:01,890
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:06,296
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:06,468 --> 01:23:10,632
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:10,806 --> 01:23:14,071
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:14,243 --> 01:23:17,576
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:17,746 --> 01:23:19,213
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:20,482 --> 01:23:22,347
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:22,517 --> 01:23:24,951
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:27,887
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:30,183
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,260
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:33,428 --> 01:23:36,090
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:36,265 --> 01:23:40,326
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:41,136 --> 01:23:43,570
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,736
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:34,823 --> 01:24:38,486
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:40,662 --> 01:24:42,857
Yeah...

1245
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,800
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:51,673 --> 01:24:54,699
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:57,777
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:57,946 --> 01:25:02,007
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:25:02,384 --> 01:25:04,079
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,580
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:09,656
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:12,988
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:13,595 --> 01:25:15,256
I own the place.

1254
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:20,160
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:21,503 --> 01:25:25,234
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:27,408
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:27,576 --> 01:25:29,874
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:33,606
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:33,782 --> 01:25:35,374
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:35,984 --> 01:25:38,384
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:42,750
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:42,924 --> 01:25:44,983
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,597
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:49,765 --> 01:25:51,596
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:51,767 --> 01:25:54,167
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:54,336 --> 01:25:56,998
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:57,172 --> 01:25:59,402
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:59,574 --> 01:26:01,166
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:06,314 --> 01:26:09,112
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:09,284 --> 01:26:10,945
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,714
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,420
Okay.

1273
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:26,132
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:30,328
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:30,505 --> 01:26:34,737
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:35,677 --> 01:26:38,168
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:38,346 --> 01:26:43,511
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:46,119
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:46,655 --> 01:26:49,021
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:50,258 --> 01:26:54,820
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:54,996 --> 01:26:56,657
Right?

1282
01:26:56,832 --> 01:26:59,460
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:59,634 --> 01:27:04,264
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:12,337
Christ.

1285
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:17,008
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:17,786 --> 01:27:22,450
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:07,202 --> 01:28:08,669
Shit!

1288
01:28:47,576 --> 01:28:49,009
Fuck.

1289
01:30:07,155 --> 01:30:08,645
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:08,823 --> 01:30:10,984
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:15,163 --> 01:30:17,028
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:18,893
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:42,023 --> 01:30:44,184
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:50,832 --> 01:30:52,060
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:53,134 --> 01:30:54,726
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:58,332
No.

1297
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:00,565
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:03,675
It depends.

1299
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,509
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:13,246
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:15,450
Cop.

1302
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:20,890
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:21,062 --> 01:31:23,223
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:27,461
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:31,804
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:32,841 --> 01:31:34,775
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:36,077 --> 01:31:38,136
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:39,514 --> 01:31:41,448
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:42,617 --> 01:31:45,984
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:47,849
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:50,423
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:54,662 --> 01:32:00,032
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:32:00,769 --> 01:32:03,203
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:05,969
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:06,141 --> 01:32:08,234
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:11,978
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:15,810
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:17,886 --> 01:32:21,049
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:22,557 --> 01:32:24,582
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:25,326 --> 01:32:27,658
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:28,196 --> 01:32:30,892
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:36,160
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:36,337 --> 01:32:37,668
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:39,307 --> 01:32:41,207
...I quit.

1325
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:46,213
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:49,316
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:04,124
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:06,267 --> 01:33:10,294
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:11,172 --> 01:33:13,470
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:13,641 --> 01:33:15,973
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:16,144 --> 01:33:18,442
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:18,613 --> 01:33:22,208
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:22,383 --> 01:33:24,510
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:28,816
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:32,255
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:33,728 --> 01:33:35,559
But I like it.

1337
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:39,495
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:42,500
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,970
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,541
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:53,704
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:56,780
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:03,489
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:06,921
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:07,095 --> 01:34:10,030
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:12,996
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:13,167 --> 01:34:15,567
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:17,671
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:17,839 --> 01:34:21,138
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:21,309 --> 01:34:22,708
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:23,811 --> 01:34:26,143
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:27,048 --> 01:34:28,572
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:32,277
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:34,546
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:34,722 --> 01:34:39,216
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:44,232 --> 01:34:45,756
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:45,934 --> 01:34:48,334
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:48,503 --> 01:34:51,472
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:51,639 --> 01:34:54,608
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:58,303
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:03,641
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:04,585 --> 01:35:07,748
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:09,023 --> 01:35:12,459
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:14,963 --> 01:35:16,988
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:20,702 --> 01:35:23,364
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:25,028
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:29,401
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:29,577 --> 01:35:31,841
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:32,847 --> 01:35:37,784
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:38,286 --> 01:35:39,719
Yeah.

1371
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:43,023
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:47,287
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:49,797 --> 01:35:52,664
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:54,699
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:55,203 --> 01:35:59,105
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:36:01,342 --> 01:36:03,674
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:36:04,645 --> 01:36:07,478
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:07,648 --> 01:36:10,811
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:20,222
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:21,062 --> 01:36:23,326
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,258
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:27,435 --> 01:36:30,097
...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:30,271 --> 01:36:31,260
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:34,242 --> 01:36:36,574
Eat something.

1385
01:36:45,219 --> 01:36:46,208
Problem?

1386
01:36:46,387 --> 01:36:49,914
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:52,423
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:52,593 --> 01:36:54,720
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:54,896 --> 01:36:58,423
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:58,599 --> 01:37:02,160
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:37:02,336 --> 01:37:03,325
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:03,738 --> 01:37:06,730
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:09,240
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:09,577 --> 01:37:12,910
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:16,275
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:20,812
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:22,557 --> 01:37:25,458
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:27,795 --> 01:37:31,060
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:31,232 --> 01:37:33,996
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:34,168 --> 01:37:35,396
No.

1401
01:37:37,872 --> 01:37:40,773
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:45,239
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:45,413 --> 01:37:47,278
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,416
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,688
You're gonna be looking at my people...

1406
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:06,128
...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.

1407
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:11,101
Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.

1408
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,531
Let me get you a coffee.

1409
01:38:17,478 --> 01:38:20,709
If I wasrt
with the Massachusetts State Police...

1410
01:38:21,349 --> 01:38:24,284
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:24,886 --> 01:38:27,047
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:28,356 --> 01:38:30,256
If I wasrt a trooper.

1413
01:38:34,562 --> 01:38:37,395
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:40,362
Another city.

1415
01:38:40,601 --> 01:38:42,933
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:44,438 --> 01:38:47,566
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:48,109 --> 01:38:51,374
I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.

1418
01:38:53,714 --> 01:38:55,511
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:55,683 --> 01:39:00,143
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:05,789
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:18,403
It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.

1422
01:39:36,657 --> 01:39:39,421
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:39,594 --> 01:39:42,620
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:42,797 --> 01:39:46,062
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:46,234 --> 01:39:47,223
Yeah.

1426
01:39:47,401 --> 01:39:51,098
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:51,739 --> 01:39:54,572
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:40:00,514 --> 01:40:02,482
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:40:05,052 --> 01:40:07,782
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:09,557 --> 01:40:11,889
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:12,059 --> 01:40:14,357
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:25,873 --> 01:40:29,900
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:31,646 --> 01:40:36,276
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:40,648
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:41,422 --> 01:40:43,982
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:47,085
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:47,261 --> 01:40:49,559
...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:53,593
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:54,068 --> 01:40:55,399
What?

1440
01:40:55,569 --> 01:40:57,696
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:02,470
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-Iooking women are cops.

1442
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:07,039
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:07,214 --> 01:41:09,148
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:19,050
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:19,226 --> 01:41:22,423
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:22,596 --> 01:41:25,895
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:26,067 --> 01:41:27,500
- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.

1448
01:41:27,668 --> 01:41:30,034
- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.

1449
01:41:30,204 --> 01:41:33,662
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:33,841 --> 01:41:37,607
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,107
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:41,282 --> 01:41:43,045
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:55,563 --> 01:41:57,929
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:58,099 --> 01:41:59,623
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:04,203
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:05,239 --> 01:42:06,934
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:09,777 --> 01:42:13,713
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:13,881 --> 01:42:15,781
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:19,113
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:19,286 --> 01:42:23,052
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:25,215
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:25,393 --> 01:42:28,920
- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...

1463
01:42:29,096 --> 01:42:31,826
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:34,297
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:37,638 --> 01:42:40,505
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:16,977 --> 01:43:18,205
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:18,379 --> 01:43:20,347
Look down the car.

1468
01:43:21,749 --> 01:43:24,217
- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.

1469
01:43:24,385 --> 01:43:26,250
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:26,754 --> 01:43:28,153
No.

1471
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:32,623
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:33,961 --> 01:43:37,590
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:37,765 --> 01:43:40,029
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:19,167
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,865
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:26,046 --> 01:44:27,673
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:32,253 --> 01:44:34,915
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:36,423 --> 01:44:39,722
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:40,561 --> 01:44:42,051
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:43,355
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:43,531 --> 01:44:46,056
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:55,074
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:58,678
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:02,373
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:04,882
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:11,725 --> 01:45:14,694
I think we got him. I think Queenars
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:16,557
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:19,528
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,965
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:24,038 --> 01:45:25,096
Yeah?

1491
01:45:25,272 --> 01:45:27,968
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:30,474
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:30,644 --> 01:45:32,077
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:36,116 --> 01:45:37,276
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

1495
01:45:37,451 --> 01:45:39,749
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,211
Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:

1497
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:44,983
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:45,159 --> 01:45:46,592
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:47,127 --> 01:45:48,355
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:48,529 --> 01:45:50,121
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:50,297 --> 01:45:51,730
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:54,629
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:55,603 --> 01:45:57,127
Come on!

1504
01:46:03,777 --> 01:46:06,245
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:07,348 --> 01:46:10,181
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenars
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:11,085 --> 01:46:13,519
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:16,986
Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.

1508
01:46:21,929 --> 01:46:24,762
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:28,836 --> 01:46:30,633
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:30,804 --> 01:46:32,635
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:32,806 --> 01:46:35,832
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:56,020
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:56,196 --> 01:46:59,222
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,493
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:03,694
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,012
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,386
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:30,197 --> 01:47:32,256
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:35,335 --> 01:47:36,324
Fuck.

1520
01:47:36,503 --> 01:47:38,403
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:38,572 --> 01:47:41,268
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:49,983 --> 01:47:51,883
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:52,052 --> 01:47:54,816
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:55,422 --> 01:47:56,912
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:58,888
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:59,059 --> 01:48:00,424
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:48:00,594 --> 01:48:02,255
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:48:02,429 --> 01:48:03,953
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:07,066
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:07,234 --> 01:48:09,293
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:11,597
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:11,772 --> 01:48:13,137
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:13,307 --> 01:48:14,797
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:14,975 --> 01:48:16,738
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:24,818 --> 01:48:26,445
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:27,955 --> 01:48:30,890
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:31,058 --> 01:48:32,685
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:41,328
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:41,502 --> 01:48:44,903
An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!

1540
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:47,097
Send some back...

1541
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:07,621
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:07,795 --> 01:49:09,626
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:09,797 --> 01:49:11,958
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:12,132 --> 01:49:14,862
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:15,035 --> 01:49:17,435
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:18,338 --> 01:49:19,999
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:20,174 --> 01:49:21,664
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:21,842 --> 01:49:23,207
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:23,377 --> 01:49:26,540
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:26,713 --> 01:49:28,874
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:29,049 --> 01:49:31,279
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:31,451 --> 01:49:34,852
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:35,022 --> 01:49:36,114
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,851
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:40,027 --> 01:49:41,619
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:41,795 --> 01:49:44,821
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:44,998 --> 01:49:47,125
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:47,301 --> 01:49:50,099
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:53,137
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:53,307 --> 01:49:56,242
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:58,776
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:58,946 --> 01:50:02,347
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:50:02,516 --> 01:50:03,983
Good.

1564
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:07,411
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:09,356 --> 01:50:11,187
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:11,358 --> 01:50:13,485
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:16,597 --> 01:50:18,326
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,560
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:22,736 --> 01:50:26,934
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you werert at fucking home.

1570
01:50:27,107 --> 01:50:28,574
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:29,176 --> 01:50:32,077
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:32,246 --> 01:50:34,237
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:34,414 --> 01:50:37,440
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:37,618 --> 01:50:39,677
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:46,059 --> 01:50:47,583
Yeah?

1576
01:50:49,796 --> 01:50:51,787
Yeah?

1577
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:54,427
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:56,236 --> 01:50:57,931
What's that?

1579
01:50:58,939 --> 01:51:02,397
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:05,879 --> 01:51:07,244
Yeah?

1581
01:51:08,282 --> 01:51:12,082
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:13,987 --> 01:51:16,217
When I called you...

1583
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,620
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:22,592
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:22,763 --> 01:51:26,597
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:27,067 --> 01:51:28,967
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:30,237 --> 01:51:32,797
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:34,074 --> 01:51:35,405
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:58,298 --> 01:52:01,699
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:52:01,868 --> 01:52:03,665
He's dead.

1591
01:52:03,837 --> 01:52:05,464
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:08,437
- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.

1593
01:52:08,608 --> 01:52:10,633
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:10,811 --> 01:52:12,278
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:12,446 --> 01:52:15,643
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:18,478
- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

1597
01:52:18,652 --> 01:52:20,119
He put in his papers, Frank.

1598
01:52:20,287 --> 01:52:24,348
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:24,524 --> 01:52:25,957
That Irish pissant...

1600
01:52:26,126 --> 01:52:29,789
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:29,963 --> 01:52:32,022
Let's give him a whiff.

1602
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:35,862
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:37,537 --> 01:52:39,198
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:39,373 --> 01:52:41,568
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:42,175 --> 01:52:43,574
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:44,077 --> 01:52:47,342
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:47,814 --> 01:52:49,805
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:49,983 --> 01:52:52,417
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,418
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:53:03,330 --> 01:53:06,197
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:09,403 --> 01:53:11,166
I know.

1612
01:53:37,564 --> 01:53:41,466
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:46,606 --> 01:53:48,506
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:54,981 --> 01:53:56,710
Yeah...

1615
01:54:01,288 --> 01:54:02,915
...I know.

1616
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:13,041
Yeah.

1617
01:56:13,853 --> 01:56:17,084
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:17,524 --> 01:56:19,082
Who are you?

1619
01:56:19,326 --> 01:56:21,590
So it is you.

1620
01:56:22,796 --> 01:56:25,788
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,827
Who are you?

1622
01:56:29,736 --> 01:56:31,761
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:31,938 --> 01:56:33,701
I'm taking over Queenars unit.

1624
01:56:34,407 --> 01:56:36,432
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,941
Staff Sergeant Dignam...

1626
01:56:38,111 --> 01:56:41,308
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:41,481 --> 01:56:43,676
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:44,317 --> 01:56:47,081
I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.

1629
01:56:48,054 --> 01:56:50,955
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:52,425 --> 01:56:53,414
We'll meet...

1631
01:57:32,599 --> 01:57:34,897
Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...

1632
01:57:35,068 --> 01:57:37,036
...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...

1633
01:57:37,203 --> 01:57:40,195
...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...

1634
01:57:40,373 --> 01:57:42,864
...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...

1635
01:57:43,043 --> 01:57:46,012
...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.

1636
01:57:46,179 --> 01:57:47,737
As for who did this or why...

1637
01:57:47,914 --> 01:57:50,314
...that's something police
are working on right now.

1638
01:57:50,483 --> 01:57:53,941
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:54,187 --> 01:57:57,645
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:57,824 --> 01:57:59,758
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:59,926 --> 01:58:02,554
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:58:02,729 --> 01:58:04,890
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:05,065 --> 01:58:07,192
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:07,367 --> 01:58:09,597
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:09,969 --> 01:58:11,266
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:11,938 --> 01:58:14,600
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:14,774 --> 01:58:19,302
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,874
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:24,776
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:24,951 --> 01:58:29,911
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:33,025
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:37,359
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:39,623
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,561
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:43,403 --> 01:58:46,304
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:50,243 --> 01:58:52,006
Proceed.

1657
01:59:14,467 --> 01:59:15,934
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:16,102 --> 01:59:18,866
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:22,599
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:22,776 --> 01:59:23,902
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:24,077 --> 01:59:27,171
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:27,347 --> 01:59:29,577
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:34,521 --> 01:59:36,079
All right.

1664
01:59:42,395 --> 01:59:45,592
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:45,765 --> 01:59:48,563
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:04,884 --> 02:00:08,217
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:08,388 --> 02:00:10,754
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:10,924 --> 02:00:13,586
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:13,793 --> 02:00:15,158
- Undercover?
- Queenars guy.

1670
02:00:15,328 --> 02:00:17,990
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:18,164 --> 02:00:21,099
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:21,301 --> 02:00:23,769
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:23,937 --> 02:00:26,098
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:26,272 --> 02:00:28,706
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:31,867
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:52,232 --> 02:00:54,291
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:54,467 --> 02:00:57,061
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:21,361 --> 02:01:22,885
Load it.

1679
02:01:30,904 --> 02:01:33,202
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:34,474 --> 02:01:36,442
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:36,609 --> 02:01:39,669
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:42,882 --> 02:01:44,679
Load.

1683
02:01:52,258 --> 02:01:54,089
Go, go!

1684
02:01:56,529 --> 02:01:58,087
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:02:00,166 --> 02:02:02,293
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:02:02,468 --> 02:02:05,926
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:14,948 --> 02:02:17,382
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:23,389 --> 02:02:25,949
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:29,395 --> 02:02:31,056
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:34,467 --> 02:02:36,731
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:36,903 --> 02:02:38,996
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:43,835
Get down!

1693
02:02:46,846 --> 02:02:48,404
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:07,133 --> 02:03:08,600
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:48,041 --> 02:03:51,807
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:53,212 --> 02:03:55,806
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:55,982 --> 02:03:58,177
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:59,652 --> 02:04:01,347
Grow up.

1699
02:04:02,055 --> 02:04:04,990
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:05,158 --> 02:04:06,648
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:08,594 --> 02:04:12,963
I never gave up anybody
who wasrt going down anyway.

1702
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,434
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:18,037 --> 02:04:19,527
Frank.

1704
02:04:19,839 --> 02:04:22,740
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:22,909 --> 02:04:24,900
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:26,612 --> 02:04:29,137
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:29,315 --> 02:04:32,148
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:32,885 --> 02:04:35,649
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:36,556 --> 02:04:39,923
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:40,893 --> 02:04:45,227
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:07,253 --> 02:05:09,687
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:31,277 --> 02:05:32,869
Frank?

1713
02:05:33,045 --> 02:05:34,535
Yeah?

1714
02:05:36,282 --> 02:05:37,510
Who's this?

1715
02:05:39,418 --> 02:05:41,045
Gwen?

1716
02:05:42,188 --> 02:05:44,281
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:45,358 --> 02:05:47,155
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:49,996 --> 02:05:52,396
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:06:00,773 --> 02:06:02,400
I got him!

1720
02:06:02,575 --> 02:06:05,009
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:09,148 --> 02:06:11,639
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:12,418 --> 02:06:13,976
No, it's...

1723
02:06:15,388 --> 02:06:16,980
For you.

1724
02:06:18,057 --> 02:06:21,117
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:27,861
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:28,067 --> 02:06:30,501
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:33,468
Caller ID on Queenars phone.

1728
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,805
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:35,975 --> 02:06:38,842
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:47,946
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,782
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:50,957 --> 02:06:52,515
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:55,823
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:55,995 --> 02:06:57,895
Long time.

1735
02:06:58,064 --> 02:06:59,895
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:07:00,299 --> 02:07:05,236
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:08,074 --> 02:07:11,407
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:11,577 --> 02:07:13,272
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:14,213 --> 02:07:16,579
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:18,618 --> 02:07:20,415
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:20,586 --> 02:07:23,384
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:23,556 --> 02:07:25,547
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:25,725 --> 02:07:28,626
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:28,794 --> 02:07:32,389
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:32,665 --> 02:07:35,634
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:39,760
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:42,408 --> 02:07:44,706
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:44,877 --> 02:07:46,606
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:47,346 --> 02:07:50,110
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:52,718 --> 02:07:55,949
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:56,389 --> 02:07:59,085
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:59,258 --> 02:08:02,421
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:08:02,595 --> 02:08:06,429
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:09,193
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:09,368 --> 02:08:11,928
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:12,104 --> 02:08:14,265
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:16,840
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:17,009 --> 02:08:18,408
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:19,011 --> 02:08:23,471
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:25,651 --> 02:08:26,675
It's my name.

1761
02:08:27,486 --> 02:08:29,852
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:30,022 --> 02:08:33,287
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:33,859 --> 02:08:35,793
It's your name.

1764
02:08:37,897 --> 02:08:39,296
All right.

1765
02:08:39,465 --> 02:08:42,161
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:42,335 --> 02:08:44,565
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:44,737 --> 02:08:47,001
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:47,173 --> 02:08:50,939
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:28,104
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:59,071 --> 02:11:00,834
I know.

1771
02:11:02,374 --> 02:11:04,865
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:05,144 --> 02:11:06,736
I'm not.

1773
02:11:08,948 --> 02:11:12,213
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:12,384 --> 02:11:14,818
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:14,987 --> 02:11:16,579
For me.

1776
02:11:18,858 --> 02:11:20,450
Okay?

1777
02:11:24,063 --> 02:11:28,363
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:28,534 --> 02:11:32,493
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:32,671 --> 02:11:35,231
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:36,842 --> 02:11:38,434
Please.

1781
02:11:41,981 --> 02:11:44,381
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:47,246
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:47,419 --> 02:11:50,684
L... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:52,124 --> 02:11:54,285
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:55,060 --> 02:11:57,790
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:58,397 --> 02:12:00,365
You know, I have...

1787
02:12:00,533 --> 02:12:02,967
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:12:03,135 --> 02:12:05,330
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:09,031
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:38,804 --> 02:12:40,738
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:42,107 --> 02:12:46,305
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:47,246 --> 02:12:50,477
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:59,325 --> 02:13:01,987
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:13:03,028 --> 02:13:04,495
Really?

1795
02:13:05,164 --> 02:13:06,688
Yeah.

1796
02:13:06,865 --> 02:13:10,426
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:10,603 --> 02:13:12,798
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:16,075 --> 02:13:17,940
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:20,908
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:22,414 --> 02:13:24,405
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:14,967 --> 02:14:16,958
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1802
02:14:17,136 --> 02:14:21,334
...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1803
02:14:21,507 --> 02:14:25,170
...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.

1804
02:14:25,344 --> 02:14:28,177
Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?

1805
02:14:28,347 --> 02:14:33,649
Would l...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?

1806
02:14:33,819 --> 02:14:37,016
Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.

1807
02:14:37,189 --> 02:14:39,555
You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.

1808
02:14:39,725 --> 02:14:43,126
Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.

1809
02:14:43,295 --> 02:14:47,163
Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1810
02:14:50,836 --> 02:14:52,394
What?

1811
02:14:56,008 --> 02:14:57,498
What?

1812
02:14:59,812 --> 02:15:02,110
- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.

1813
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:06,240
- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.

1814
02:15:06,418 --> 02:15:07,749
- You seen anything?
- Frank.

1815
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,515
I got no access to Queenars undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1816
02:15:11,690 --> 02:15:16,252
- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.

1817
02:15:16,428 --> 02:15:19,363
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:24,536 --> 02:15:26,561
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:26,739 --> 02:15:31,301
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:31,477 --> 02:15:32,967
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:33,145 --> 02:15:34,908
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:37,071
Costello trusted me more than anyone.

1823
02:15:37,750 --> 02:15:40,947
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:41,453 --> 02:15:44,047
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:44,223 --> 02:15:46,248
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:46,558 --> 02:15:50,392
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:50,562 --> 02:15:52,496
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:06,373
Open the door.

1829
02:16:10,382 --> 02:16:14,375
Open... Didrt we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:15,554 --> 02:16:17,715
This is my job.

1831
02:16:42,981 --> 02:16:44,972
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:45,150 --> 02:16:46,674
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:46,852 --> 02:16:50,083
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:50,255 --> 02:16:51,813
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:54,015
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:54,193 --> 02:16:57,788
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:57,963 --> 02:17:00,932
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:17:01,099 --> 02:17:04,591
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:04,770 --> 02:17:06,761
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:06,939 --> 02:17:08,804
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:08,974 --> 02:17:11,374
What is this, a citizers arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:11,543 --> 02:17:14,376
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:14,546 --> 02:17:16,446
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:16,615 --> 02:17:19,880
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:20,052 --> 02:17:23,180
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:23,355 --> 02:17:26,017
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:26,191 --> 02:17:28,659
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:28,827 --> 02:17:31,523
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:31,697 --> 02:17:36,157
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:36,335 --> 02:17:39,099
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:44,070
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:44,243 --> 02:17:45,938
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:46,378 --> 02:17:48,278
Get up.

1854
02:17:49,448 --> 02:17:52,474
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:52,651 --> 02:17:55,176
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:55,354 --> 02:17:58,721
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:58,891 --> 02:18:01,860
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:18:02,027 --> 02:18:04,154
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:04,329 --> 02:18:06,559
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:06,732 --> 02:18:10,429
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:10,602 --> 02:18:15,266
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:17,676 --> 02:18:19,610
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:19,778 --> 02:18:21,905
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:25,049
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:25,217 --> 02:18:28,186
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:28,353 --> 02:18:30,446
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:30,622 --> 02:18:32,817
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:36,128 --> 02:18:37,959
You know who I am.

1869
02:19:03,088 --> 02:19:04,953
Shut up.

1870
02:19:05,991 --> 02:19:09,017
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:09,194 --> 02:19:10,388
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:10,562 --> 02:19:13,087
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:24,242 --> 02:19:26,540
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:28,146 --> 02:19:30,307
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:32,584 --> 02:19:34,643
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:10,856 --> 02:20:13,586
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:13,825 --> 02:20:16,123
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:16,294 --> 02:20:17,989
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:18,163 --> 02:20:21,030
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:34,646 --> 02:20:36,238
Give me that.

1881
02:20:51,663 --> 02:20:55,030
Right. Slow. March.

1882
02:21:03,241 --> 02:21:05,436
I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...

1883
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:10,138
...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...

1884
02:21:10,315 --> 02:21:12,476
...and strike him in the head.

1885
02:21:12,651 --> 02:21:15,085
At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...

1886
02:21:15,253 --> 02:21:17,448
...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...

1887
02:21:17,622 --> 02:21:20,785
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:23,962 --> 02:21:26,226
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:26,965 --> 02:21:30,924
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:41,913 --> 02:21:44,245
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:44,416 --> 02:21:47,317
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:47,486 --> 02:21:50,284
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:50,455 --> 02:21:52,787
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:52,958 --> 02:21:57,793
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:57,963 --> 02:21:59,555
Amen.

1896
02:22:28,994 --> 02:22:31,224
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:32,597 --> 02:22:34,588
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:34,833 --> 02:22:36,460
Fire.

1899
02:22:36,635 --> 02:22:39,126
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:40,038 --> 02:22:43,064
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:43,508 --> 02:22:46,807
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:23:00,225 --> 02:23:02,591
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:09,868 --> 02:23:11,699
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:29,421 --> 02:23:31,048
Hi, pup.

1905
02:24:02,587 --> 02:24:04,214
Okay.
