1
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,956
我不想成為環境的產物
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't wanna be a product of my environment.{\r}

2
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:52,770
相反，我希望環境為我所左右
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want my environment to be a product of me.{\r}

3
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,238
很多年前，我們擁有一座教堂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Years ago, we had the Church.{\r}

4
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:03,039
那僅是表示我們彼此團結的一種方式
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That was only a way of saying we had each other.{\r}

5
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,579
但是現在，我不清楚 它很可笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But now, I don't know. It's a funny thing.{\r}

6
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:09,948
它向你心中灌輸仇恨
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It put hate in your heart.{\r}

7
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,920
哥倫布騎士是真正的意大利強硬派
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers.
True guineas.{\r}

8
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:17,619
他們在城市中開闢了自己的地盤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They took over their piece of the city.{\r}

9
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:24,195
20年前，愛爾蘭人連工作都找不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job...{\r}

10
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,499
現在我們終於迎來了安穩的生活
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we had the presidency. May he rest in peace.{\r}

11
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,974
這就是那些黑鬼們沒有意識到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what the niggers don't realize.{\r}

12
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:36,410
如果說我對那些黑鬼有什麼成見的話 那就是這個了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this:{\r}

13
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,709
沒人會施捨給你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one gives it to you.{\r}

14
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,784
你得自己爭取
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to take it.{\r}

15
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:06,007
文，別再讓我親自上門來要錢了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Vin, don't make me have to come down here again for this.{\r}

16
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:08,669
不會再有下次的，C先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wort happen again, Mr. C.{\r}

17
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:15,115
卡門已經出落成小美人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Carmers developing into a fine young lady.{\r}

18
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:17,380
你應該驕傲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should be proud.{\r}

19
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:32,760
開始來例假了沒，卡門？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You get your period yet, Carmen?{\r}

20
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,888
你是強尼·蘇利文的兒子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You Johnny Sullivars kid?{\r}

21
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:56,056
- 你和你奶奶一起住？ - 對
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You live with your grandmother? - Yeah.{\r}

22
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,593
文，給他拿些麵包和牛奶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread, couple half-gallons of milk.{\r}

23
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,326
你喜歡臘腸和奶酪嗎？ 再來點冷盤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you like bologna and cheese? Give him some cold cuts.{\r}

24
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:08,064
還有蛋黃醬 喜歡看漫畫書嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Throw some mayo in. You like comic books?{\r}

25
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,933
你學習好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You do good in school?{\r}

26
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,081
- 還行 - 不錯，我以前也是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah. - That's good. I did too.{\r}

27
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,843
他們說這點和我本人自相矛盾
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They call that a paradox.{\r}

28
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:24,952
不用找了，給你自己買點化妝品吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.{\r}

29
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:34,724
要是想賺零花錢的話 就到L街來找我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You ever wanna earn a little extra money, you come by L Street.{\r}

30
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,596
你知道在我在L街的哪裡？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know where I am on L Street?{\r}

31
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,396
很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.{\r}

32
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:42,096
- 乖孩子 - 謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Good boy. - Thanks.{\r}

33
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:48,040
主啊，您忠實的僕人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To you, O Lord, we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your servant.{\r}

34
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,204
在這個世界已經不復存在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In the sight of this world, he is now dead.{\r}

35
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,510
請饒恕他因人性弱點而犯下的罪過
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness.{\r}

36
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,983
- 阿門 - 教會要你聽話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Amen. - The Church wants you in your place.{\r}

37
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:58,714
說站就站，說跪就跪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.{\r}

38
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,383
如果你想幹這種事 我不知道還為你做什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you go for that sort of thing, I don't know what to do for you.{\r}

39
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,722
路都是自己走出來的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A man makes his own way.{\r}

40
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,489
沒人會施捨給你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one gives it to you.{\r}

41
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,530
你得自己爭取
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to take it.{\r}

42
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,969
- - 這是詹姆士·喬伊斯（著名作家）說的 - 聰明，科林
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- James Joyce. - Smart, Colin.{\r}

43
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,603
如果普羅維登斯的意大利佬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Guineas from the North End, down Providence...{\r}

44
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,470
跑到這來對我指手畫腳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...tried to tell me what to do.{\r}

45
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:22,410
那他們就有麻煩了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And something maybe happened to them.{\r}

46
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:26,582
也許，就像那樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe like that:{\r}

47
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:37,086
天，她倒下的姿勢可真可笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jeez. She fell funny.{\r}

48
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:42,498
弗蘭克，你應該去看看心理醫生了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Francis, you really should see somebody.{\r}

49
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,967
一旦你樹立了目標，你就能實現
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When you decide to be something, you can be it.{\r}

50
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,403
這個教會沒有教你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what they don't tell you in the Church.{\r}

51
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:54,102
我像你這麼大的時候，他們說 我們可能成為警察或者罪犯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I was your age, they would say we could become cops or criminals.{\r}

52
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,043
今天，我要對你這麼說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Today what I'm saying to you is this:{\r}

53
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,776
當你面對著一把上了膛的槍時
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When you're facing a loaded gun...{\r}

54
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,918
這兩者又有什麼區別呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...what's the difference?{\r}

55
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,891
乖孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's my boy.{\r}

56
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:13,193
彈道學是研究發射體
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Terminal ballistics is the study of a projectile...{\r}

57
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:16,061
以及擊中目標後對其所造成破壞的學科
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as it hits a target and the destruction that it causes.{\r}

58
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,328
以你們的佩槍為例，9毫米空尖彈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take, for instance, what you carry, 9 mm hollow-point.{\r}

59
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:23,133
當空尖彈擊中頭骨時 它會爆炸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When the hollow-point hits the skull, what happens is it mushrooms.{\r}

60
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,175
爆炸時彈片剝落 你可能會遇到6個，8個或10個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When it mushrooms it peels back. So you may have six, eight...{\r}

61
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:29,508
像刀片一樣的子彈殘粒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...ten little particles of the bullet that are like razor blades...{\r}

62
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,807
是的，長官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sir, yes, sir!{\r}

63
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,419
撕裂他們的內臟 肝，肺，心臟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Tearing their internal organs, their liver, their lungs, their heart...{\r}

64
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:38,147
內部組織，血液，大腦 …這就叫氣體反衝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...bringing tissue, bone, blood, brain matter, and that's called a blowback.{\r}

65
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:48,222
去你媽的，一幫娘們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck you. Fucking queers.{\r}

66
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,200
消防員第一次面對大火或女人時很遜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Firemen getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire or pussy.{\r}

67
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:56,068
嗨，快回去救困在樹上的貓吧 你們這些混蛋同性戀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, go save a kitten in a tree, you fucking homos.{\r}

68
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,032
鉛筆準備好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pencils.{\r}

69
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,078
開始
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Begin.{\r}

70
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:15,816
你在看什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you looking at?{\r}

71
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,030
別想了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Forget it.{\r}

72
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,827
老爸是看大門的 兒子就只有當警察的命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your father was a janitor, his sors only a cop.{\r}

73
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:30,106
那幫他媽的消防員都是同性戀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Those fucking firefighters are a bunch of homos.{\r}

74
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:32,070
確實
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They are.{\r}

75
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:35,805
她對我說，你從來沒完成過任何事 等你完成了警校的課程
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So she tells me, "You never finish anything. You finish the police course...{\r}

76
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:41,419
我就再和你好，寶貝 等畢業了，她就又給我爽了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you get taken care of again, baby." So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.{\r}

77
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,419
不錯啊了，你媽一定是個了不起的女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's great. Your mother must be a wonderful woman.{\r}

78
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:45,613
去你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck yourself.{\r}

79
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,157
這麼說吧，你是波士頓黑人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put it this way. You're a black guy in Boston.{\r}

80
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,886
不需要我動手就有人來整你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked.{\r}

81
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:54,328
麻薩諸塞州警察擁有悠久的良好聲譽
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence.{\r}

82
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,999
今天你們在此畢業
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance...{\r}

83
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,264
即將成為我們國家優秀的警務人員
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation.{\r}

84
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,206
做為馬薩諸塞州警務主管
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As the governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident...{\r}

85
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:10,747
我堅信，你們每一個人 都將出色，榮耀，誠實地效忠國家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity.{\r}

86
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,850
祝賀大家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Congratulations to all our new troopers.{\r}

87
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,112
謝謝，你們可以解散了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you. You are dismissed.{\r}

88
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:30,327
蘇利文，你剛畢業就是便衣 祝賀你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out of the gate, congratulations.{\r}

89
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:34,268
- 我們要去喝一杯，一起來嗎？ - 不了，我一會去找你們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- We're going for a beer. You wanna come? - No, I'll catch up with you guys.{\r}

90
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,207
再也不用上學了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}School's out.{\r}

91
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,920
弗蘭克，謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you, Frank.{\r}

92
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,711
你應得的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You earned it.{\r}

93
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,949
不用再唸書了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No more pencils, no more books.{\r}

94
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:57,650
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

95
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,353
這裡不是普通的警隊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is not the regular police...{\r}

96
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:01,431
- …是州立警隊 - 開槍！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...this is the state police. - And fire!{\r}

97
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,726
你們的訓練會證明有什麼不同
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your training will illustrate the difference.{\r}

98
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,598
州警察，有搜查證！ 州警察，開門！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}State police, search warrant! State police, open the door!{\r}

99
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,136
有什麼不同？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the difference?{\r}

100
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,706
- 上！上！ - 是的，長官！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Go, go, go! - Sir, yes, sir!{\r}

101
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,936
- 明白！ - 是的，長官！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Is that understood? - Sir, yes, sir!{\r}

102
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:17,275
給我趴下！快趴下！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Move it, get the fuck down right now. Get down, right now.{\r}

103
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,194
恭喜你通過了警探考核
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Congratulations on passing the detective's exam, and welcome...{\r}

104
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:34,855
…歡迎加入我們特別調查組 - 看你他媽的那德行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to the Special Investigation Unit. - Whoop-de-fucking-do.{\r}

105
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
我們以後不會一起工作，直接地說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We won't be working together, that is, directly.{\r}

106
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,903
你會跟艾勒文隊長 但我希望能看下你們每個人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody.{\r}

107
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,572
只要你努力，就會很快升職的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're a worker. You rise fast.{\r}

108
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,736
就像十二歲孩子的陽具
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like a 12-year-old's dick.{\r}

109
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,943
- 謝謝警官 - 不客氣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Thank you, sergeant. - My pleasure.{\r}

110
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,484
- 謝謝長官 - 祝你好運
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Thank you, sir. - Good luck.{\r}

111
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,887
- 祝賀你 - 謝謝，親愛的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Congratulations. - Thanks, hon.{\r}

112
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,690
你現在可以進去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can go in there now.{\r}

113
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,601
請坐
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can sit.{\r}

114
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,280
嗯…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So...{\r}

115
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:28,217
你知道我們是做什麼的嗎？ 我這個部門？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know what we do here? My section?{\r}

116
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,184
- 是的，長官，我知道… - 你根本什麼都不知道…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yes, sir, I have an idea... - Let's say you have no idea...{\r}

117
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,052
懂嗎？什麼都不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and leave it at that, okay?{\r}

118
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:37,718
不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No idea. Zip. None.{\r}

119
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,822
如果你知道我們是做什麼的 那就說明我們做的不好，是不是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you had an idea what we do, we would not be good at what we do, would we?{\r}

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,524
那我們就成狗屁了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We would be cunts.{\r}

121
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,727
你是不是叫我們狗屁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you calling us cunts?{\r}

122
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,304
迪克曼警官有他自己的處事風格
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his own.{\r}

123
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:51,408
恐怕我們都得去適應
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.{\r}

124
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,037
你家和南波士頓的黑幫有關係，對吧？ 通過你父親？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you have family connections down in Southie, right? Through your father?{\r}

125
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:58,739
和我們說說你叔叔傑西吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why don't you tell us about your Uncle Jackie?{\r}

126
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,556
他是喬治·馬沙的手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.{\r}

127
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:10,023
他只不過是個三流管帳而已 在薩默維爾管個小酒吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.{\r}

128
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,926
他95年被人幹掉了 我們在機場裡發現了他的屍體
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He got popped by Nicastro in '95. We found his body out by the airport.{\r}

129
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,032
沒錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's right.{\r}

130
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,595
- 我還記得他的葬禮 - 不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I remember his funeral. - Oh, good.{\r}

131
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,001
棺材是蓋著的吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Closed casket?{\r}

132
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,439
沒錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's right.{\r}

133
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:28,980
告訴大家在你因為用椅子 痛打一個體育老師
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So tell anybody up at Deerfield...{\r}

134
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,275
被開除之前你在預科學校的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a chair.{\r}

135
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,850
你叔叔就像那樣掛掉的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You had an uncle met his demise like that?{\r}

136
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,791
我有個問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got a question.{\r}

137
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,018
你這人到底多衰？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How fucked up are you?{\r}

138
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,432
嗨，親愛的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Darlene.{\r}

139
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:02,841
有什麼好消息嗎，參謀警官？ 用不了多久你就能當上警官了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What you got, staff sergeant? In no time you made sergeant.{\r}

140
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:07,818
- 特別調查組，很牛吧 - 太好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- SIU. What a country. - Perfect.{\r}

141
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,949
我不介意一個人獨闖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, I don't mind going it alone.{\r}

142
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:15,251
如果你偶爾也獨闖的話 可能有機會出頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, if you went alone once in a while you might get somewhere.{\r}

143
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,089
我們是警察，這不是出人投地
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're cops, all right? This isn't somewhere.{\r}

144
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:22,999
我知道你很努力，也許我能幫你一把
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, lookit, I know you're a worker. Maybe I can do something for you.{\r}

145
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,264
你家裡有沒有西裝？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got any suits, or do you like...{\r}

146
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,270
還是你就喜歡 穿得跟要進攻波蘭一樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...coming to work dressed like you're gonna invade Poland?{\r}

147
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,272
小子，你家族可不簡單啊 你另一個叔叔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got quite the family tree. That maggot uncle of yours...{\r}

148
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,812
湯米·科斯提根也是個傻子，他因為…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Tommy Costigan, is another goof. He gets busted selling guns...{\r}

149
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:40,007
販賣槍支給聯邦警察而被捕 這只是他眾多傻事中的一件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to federal officers, among many, many, many other departures...{\r}

150
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:43,518
這些和我有什麼關係？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...from our normative behavior. - And what's this got to do with me?{\r}

151
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,451
為什麼你要假裝做警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are you pretending to be a cop?{\r}

152
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:52,794
這是個新部門，你們也都是新人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This unit is new, and you are the newest members of it.{\r}

153
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,525
你們都是我們精選出來的人才
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have been selected for it on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.{\r}

154
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:59,795
這是精英部門
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is an elite unit.{\r}

155
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:04,237
我們的工作就是粉碎 或者說小規模地折騰一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Our job is to smash or marginally disrupt...{\r}

156
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,468
城裡有組織的犯罪團體
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...organized crime in this city...{\r}

157
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,374
我們與聯邦調查局的緊密合作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...by enanced cooperation with the FBI...{\r}

158
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,311
弗蘭克·拉齊奧探員是他們的代表
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...represented here today by Agent Frank Lazio.{\r}

159
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,645
我們會做到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And we will do it.{\r}

160
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,277
城裡有組織的犯罪團體 你們知道我們指的是誰
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And by organized crime in this city, you know who we mean.{\r}

161
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,751
傑西·科斯提根，這張是他的舊照
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's Jackie Costigan. That's an old picture.{\r}

162
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,984
傑西已經死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jackie met his demise.{\r}

163
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,091
最後的遺照
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Last known photograph.{\r}

164

菲茲，瘋子移民 和他媽一起住在德拉大街上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho, lives in Brockton with his mother.{\r}

166
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:35,300
她也有點瘋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's straight out of Going My Way.{\r}

167
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,566
德拉亨特，外號肌肉男
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Delahunt, muscle.{\r}

168
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:41,701
法國佬，他的頭號大將 當然，還有你們都知道的我們的頭號明星
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}French, the number one. But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.{\r}

169
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,610
我們已經作了一份簡報 讀一讀，有任何提議就告訴我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've done a briefing book, so read up. I want all ideas...{\r}

170
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,944
這樣我才可以拿去自己邀功
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...so I can pass them off as my own.{\r}

171
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,246
只要你們好好幹，就會很快陞遷的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Work hard, you'll rise fast. You're in the best possible position...{\r}

172
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,185
現在就是你們最好的機會 開始幹活吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in the department. Let's go to work.{\r}

173
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,654
你老爸在南波士頓賣苦力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your old man was a fucking hump from Southie.{\r}

174
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,795
機場的行李搬運工，是吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Baggage handler at the airport, right?{\r}

175
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,430
除了你老爸，你家其他人都是罪犯吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Family's all criminals except for the old man, huh?{\r}

176
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,066
還有個牧師呢 看上去你無所不知呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And one priest, since you seem to know everything.{\r}

177
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:07,102

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right?{\r}

182
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,184
和你老爸在一起時一個樣 和你老媽在一起時另一個樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One kid with your old man, one kid with your mother.{\r}

183
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:25,618
你平時以中產階級自居，到了週末
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're upper-middle class during the weeks, then you're hanging...{\r}

184
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,759
而到週末就跑到南岸你老爸那去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in the Southie projects with your daddy, the fucking donkey...{\r}

185
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,418
我說得沒錯吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...on the weekends. I got that right?{\r}

186
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:35,360
你有不同的口音吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yup. You have different accents?{\r}

187
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,425
你有，是不是？你他媽這個小騙子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You did, didn't you, you little fucking snake?{\r}

188
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,834
- 你就是兩面派 - 你是精神分析師？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You were like different people. - You a psychiatrist?{\r}

189
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,975
如果我是的話 我會問你為何甘願做州警領這區區3萬元
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I was, I'd ask you why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.{\r}

190
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,635
就算我他媽是弗洛伊德的話 我也不知道答案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud I wouldn't get an answer.{\r}

191
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:53,876
你告訴我，像你這樣的混蛋 在州警隊裡幹什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker like you doing in the staties?{\r}

192
00:13:54,886 --> 00:13:58,378
美國家庭總是起起落落，對嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, families are always rising or falling in America, am I right?{\r}

193
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:01,184
這話是誰說的？ - 霍桑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Who said that? - Hawthorne.{\r}

194
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:05,651
你他媽怎麼了 就不會說點莎士比亞的嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's the matter, smart-ass, you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?{\r}

195
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,996
我們有個問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have a question.{\r}

196
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,834
你是真想做警察 還是想看上去像個警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you wanna be a cop, or do you wanna appear to be a cop?{\r}

197
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,305
希望你能誠實回答
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's an honest question.{\r}

198
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:22,139
很多人只是覺得當警察很酷 佩槍，警徽，像電視上一樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.{\r}

199
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:24,941
很多人只是想找個借口教訓黑鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger through a window...{\r}

200
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,914
我聽夠了你那些個人工作的狗屁話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm set without your own personal job application, sergeant.{\r}

201
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,350
- 你說什麼？小子 - 你們到底想讓我幹什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What did you say? - Sir, what do you want from me?{\r}

202
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:31,613
嗨，混蛋，他幫不了你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, he can't help you.{\r}

203
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,757
我知道你是什麼人 我知道你是什麼人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know what you are. I know what you are...{\r}

204
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,290
我也知道你不是什麼人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and I know what you're not.{\r}

205
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,896
我是最瞭解你的人 而且我要告訴你，混蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna help you understand something.{\r}

206
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,031
你不是他媽的警察！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're no fucking cop.{\r}

207
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,728
他說的沒錯 我們這裡調查的是外面那些人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's right. We deal in deception here.{\r}

208
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,737
而不是自己人的欺詐行為
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What we do not deal with is self-deception.{\r}

209
00:14:48,907 --> 00:14:51,740
從現在起5年內，你可以成為任何人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Five years from now you could be anything else in the world.{\r}

210
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,505
但你不會成為馬薩諸塞州警員
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you will not be a Massachusetts state trooper.{\r}

211
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,341
- 你確定嗎？ - 我確定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Are you sure of that? - I'm sure of that.{\r}

212
00:14:58,516 --> 00:14:59,608
我他媽的保證
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Guaran-fucking-teed.{\r}

213
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,516
你大學入學考試得了1400分 這分夠當宇航員的了，還當什麼警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You had 1400 on your SATs, kid. You're an astronaut, not a statie.{\r}

214
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,621
你沒有什麼家人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't have much family.{\r}

215
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:13,290
- 我沒有任何家人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't have any family.{\r}

216
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:22,305
聽斯蒂芬尼說你要當上警察了 這是怎麼回事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman?{\r}

217
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:25,408
你說的是那個唯一來參加 我爸葬禮的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stephanie, who was the only one who came to my father's funeral?{\r}

218
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:28,978
- 那個斯蒂芬尼？ - 對，那個斯蒂芬尼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That Stephanie? - Yeah, that Stephanie.{\r}

219
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,981
- 沒什麼好說的，愛德華叔叔 - 你想證明什麼給你家人看嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward. - Trying to prove something to the family?{\r}

220
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:38,145
你說家人，你指的是誰？你嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When you say "the family," who do you mean exactly? You?{\r}

221
00:15:39,157 --> 00:15:41,557
你總是要置疑一切，是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You always have to question everything, don't you?{\r}

222
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,753
也許時不時地問自己一些問題對你有好處
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe it would've done you some good to have some questions from time to time.{\r}

223
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,626
我是混蛋嗎？我的孩子很糟糕嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Am I an asshole? Are my kids a mess?{\r}

224
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,499
我老婆是不是個貪財的婊子？ 這些都是問題，對吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?" I mean, those are questions, right?{\r}

225
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:58,438
我是否好好對待過我垂死的姐姐？ 還是我現在只是假裝這樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Have I ever been good to my dying sister, or am I just now pretending to be?"{\r}

226
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,582
你需要錢準備葬禮嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you need some money for the funeral?{\r}

227
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,614
我媽媽去世後，我們就再無瓜葛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When my mother dies, we don't have any more connection.{\r}

228
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:17,219
這房子很漂亮，天花板很高 木地板，浴室也很大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's lovely. You get the high ceilings, the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.{\r}

229
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,023
冰箱上有警報器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The fridge has got an alarm in it in case you have...{\r}

230
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,429
以防你吃飯噎著 開玩笑的…其實不是很好笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...eating issues, which is a joke. Not a very funny one.{\r}

231
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,560
這裡看市政廳，燈塔山也是一目瞭然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, there's a great view of the State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.{\r}

232
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,141
你要是搬進來的話 馬上就能成馬薩諸塞州的上流階級
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, you move in, you're upper-class by about Tuesday.{\r}

233
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:35,874
- 那麼你是警察了 - 州警探
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- So you're a cop. - A state-police detective.{\r}

234
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,878
州警探
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A state-police detective.{\r}

235
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:41,384
你是個結了婚的州警探嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And are you a married state-police detective?{\r}

236
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,052
不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

237
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:46,650
這房子…一個人住有點大了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because this is kind of a... Sort of a big place and...{\r}

238
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:48,849
我有合租人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have a co-signer.{\r}

239
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:53,721
那不錯，你有客人會來，很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.{\r}

240
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:56,196
- 嗯… - 把合同給我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, it's got... - Just give me the papers.{\r}

241
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,830
行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure.{\r}

242
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:04,138
主啊，請賦予她永恆的安寧 讓光明永照其身
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her.{\r}

243
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,833
- 阿門 - 願她安息，阿門
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Amen. - May she rest in peace. Amen.{\r}

244
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:10,208
願她的靈魂籍主的恩慈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed...{\r}

245
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,578
永遠安息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...through the mercy of God rest in peace.{\r}

246
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:16,549
阿門
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Amen.{\r}

247
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:35,296
<i>天堂收留虔誠的逝者，弗蘭克·卡斯特羅</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

248
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:39,975
要我幹什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what do I do?{\r}

249
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,111
這個行動有資金支持 我們不會像普通警察那樣付你工資
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a regular cop...{\r}

250
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,375
這裡有獎金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but there's a bonus involved.{\r}

251
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,884
免稅的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tax-free.{\r}

252
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:54,790
我們無法隱瞞你曾是警校學員的事實 你要去犯罪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can't conceal that you were a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime.{\r}

253
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:58,690
我們想有惡性傷人案底的警察 可能會比較可信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're thinking a guilty plea to assault and battery would make sense.{\r}

254
00:17:58,863 --> 00:17:59,921
正好符合你的本性
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Given your nature.{\r}

255
00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:03,100
你要在牢裡呆段時間 好叫別人相信這一切都不是圈套
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll do enough jail time to convince anyone this is no setup.{\r}

256
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,792
之後你會被假釋 看法庭指定的心理醫生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll be on probation, see a court-ordered shrink...{\r}

257
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,665
做整套戲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the whole nine yards.{\r}

258
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,166
你想為國家效力，這是個好機會
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You wanna serve the Commonwealth, this is your chance.{\r}

259
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,701
我們需要你，老兄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We need you, pal.{\r}

260
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,746
你已經假裝是南波士頓的卡斯提根了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston.{\r}

261
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,874
- 只有每個週末才是，警官 - 好極了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Every weekend, sergeant. - Perfect.{\r}

262
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,385
再做一次
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do it again.{\r}

263
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,218
為了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For me.{\r}

264
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,589
片名：《無間行者》 又譯：《無間道風雲》
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

265
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:05,462
- 你是比爾·卡斯提根？ - 對，怎麼了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hey, you Billy Costigan? - Yeah, who wants to know?{\r}

266
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,531
沒什麼，我認識一個叫肖恩·科斯提根的 他住在L街
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, nothing. I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.{\r}

267
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:12,032
- 那是我表兄 - 我認識他，那傢伙很不識相
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, that's my cousin. - Connected. Not too bright.{\r}

268
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:14,865
- 我知道 - 我並不想冒犯你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, I know. - I mean, no offense.{\r}

269
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,720
- 比利？ - 對，是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Billy? - Yeah, it's me.{\r}

270
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:36,826
- 我的上帝啊，見到你真好 - 姑媽，你還好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Oh, my God. Good to see you. - Aunt Kathy, how are you?{\r}

271
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:39,986
見到你真好啊，快進來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, good to see you. Come on in.{\r}

272
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,331
聽說你當上了州警，真是難以置信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They said you was in the staties. I couldn't believe it.{\r}

273
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,766
我被開除了，好像是我4個月前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got kicked out, like, four months ago.{\r}

274
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,168
都登報了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, it was in the papers.{\r}

275
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,703
這麼說你知道了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you know.{\r}

276
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:55,710
你怎麼會大駕光臨呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And why are we graced with your presence?{\r}

277
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:58,682
我給你媽帶了點我爸的照片來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I brought your mother some pictures of my father.{\r}

278
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,978
- 看那笑容 - 是我媽保存的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Look at the smile. - My mother had them. My...{\r}

279
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:04,782
我媽…我媽去世了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My mother's dead.{\r}

280
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,350
對不起，真的抱歉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry. Sorry for your troubles.{\r}

281
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:12,087
我也參加了個葬禮
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was at a funeral myself, man.{\r}

282
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:15,264
邁爾斯·卡內菲克，學校裡認識的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Myles Kennefick. Knew him in school.{\r}

283
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:19,695
他還很年輕，真可怕，真可惜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was a young guy, you know? It's terrible. It's a shame.{\r}

284
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,032
- 還記得那個晚上嗎？真是… - 聽著
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You remember that. What a night. - Listen.{\r}

285
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,531
我拿到…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got, like...{\r}

286
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,168
- 我拿到了大概3萬美金的保險金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money. - Yeah.{\r}

287
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:32,111
我媽去世的保險金
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, after my mother passed and everything.{\r}

288
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,945
在你們這行，如果我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In your line of work, if I gave you...{\r}

289
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,816
如果我給你1萬的話，我能賺多少？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...like, what, say, 10,000, what could I get back?{\r}

290
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,355
你知道…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what you...{\r}

291
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,858
你知道我們這種時候通常會說什麼嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what you usually say at these moments.{\r}

292
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,125
- 什麼？什麼？ - 別裝了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What? What? - Come on, man.{\r}

293
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,202
我靠，你這個混蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, come on, you fucking moron. Come on.{\r}

294
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:54,998
你想聽我親口說？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What, you want me to say it?{\r}

295
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:01,711
我不是警察，好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not a cop, all right?{\r}

296
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:06,046
- 我他媽是你表弟 - 你這壞蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm your fucking cousin. - You're bad.{\r}

297
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:10,011
你被腐蝕了，你一定是我表兄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You corrupt fuck, man. You must be my cousin.{\r}

298
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,749
那幫波多黎各人覺得他們什麼都懂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking Ricans think they know everything.{\r}

299
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:18,453
他們要是真懂 就他媽不是波多黎各人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If they knew shit, they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.{\r}

300
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:22,099
波多黎各豬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}R is for Ricans P is for pigs{\r}

301
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,360
你他媽就不能閉上會嘴一會？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you shut the fuck up for five seconds, huh?{\r}

302
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,505
沒錯，你以前是警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's right. You used to be a cop.{\r}

303
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:32,107
我們在幹活，你少吸點行不行？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When we're working together just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.{\r}

304
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:35,734
我們不應該在這兒幹活 離伍斯特德太近了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're not even supposed to be doing this shit this close to Worcester.{\r}

305
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:37,346
就在伍斯特德邊上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This side of Worcester.{\r}

306
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:41,245
- 誰說的？ - 他說的，卡斯特羅說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Says who? - Says him. Says Costello.{\r}

307
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,410
對你來說…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}God says, as far as you're...{\r}

308
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,419
就當是上帝說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...concerned.{\r}

309
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:51,461
不，不，不，他不是警察 他3周前才從牢裡放出來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, he's no cop. He got out of the joint three weeks ago.{\r}

310
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,995
- 王八蛋警察 - 不，不，不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Cunt cop. - No, no, no.{\r}

311
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,929
他說話不好聽，不過他是好人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He talks like his shit don't stink, but he's good people.{\r}

312
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,569
我認識他爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I knew his father.{\r}

313
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,464
- 我更喜歡他叔叔傑西 - 傑西還不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I liked his Uncle Jackie better. - Jackie was all right.{\r}

314
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,131
傑西叔叔棒極了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Uncle Jackie was excellent.{\r}

315
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,277
該死的意大利人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking guineas.{\r}

316
00:22:07,545 --> 00:22:09,945
- 敬傑西 - 傑西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- To Jackie. - Uncle Jackie.{\r}

317
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,206
來杯酸梅汁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cranberry juice.{\r}

318
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,546
那是天然利尿劑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a natural diuretic.{\r}

319
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,918
我馬子來例假時就喝這個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My girlfriend drinks it when she's got her period.{\r}

320
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:23,023
怎麼？你也來例假了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What, do you got your period?{\r}

321
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:29,665
- 靠！ - 放手！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fucking...! - Get off!{\r}

322
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:36,468
- 他媽的把你手拿開！ - 嘿，嘿，嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Get your fucking hands off me! - Hey. Hey, hey.{\r}

323
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,534
你知道我是誰嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know me?{\r}

324
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,573
不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No.{\r}

325
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,947
我是來告訴你什麼人能打…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I'm the guy that tells you there are guys you can hit...{\r}

326
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:48,108
還有什麼人不能打的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and there's guys you can't.{\r}

327
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,276
這人雖說不是一點不能打他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, that's not quite a guy you can't hit...{\r}

328
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,718
但你最好還是別打他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.{\r}

329
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,552
我現在就要立個規矩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling on this right now:{\r}

330
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,752
你他媽不能打他，明白嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't fucking hit him. You understand?{\r}

331
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:04,125
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.{\r}

332
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:09,231
我認識你，我認識你家人

333
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,366
你要是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You make one more drug deal...{\r}

334
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,375
再跟你那笨蛋表兄賣毒品的話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet of a cousin of yours...{\r}

335
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,841
我就忘了你祖母曾經對我有多好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and I'll forget your grandmother was so nice to me.{\r}

336
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:21,109
我會把你閹了的，明白了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll cut your fucking nuts off. You understand that?{\r}

337
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:26,018
明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. Yeah, I do.{\r}

338
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,449
你喝什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you drinking?{\r}

339
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,427
酸莓汁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A cranberry juice.{\r}

340
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,897
怎麼了，你來例假了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What is it, your period?{\r}

341
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:48,173
給他一杯酸梅汁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get him a cranberry juice.{\r}

342
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,743
嗨，他是傑西的侄子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.{\r}

343
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,585
什麼？你他媽「哦」什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What? "Oh," fucking what?{\r}

344
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:05,726
離開這吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the fuck out of here.{\r}

345
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,564
對不起，我遲到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry I'm late.{\r}

346
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:10,666
這是迪克曼警官 主要負責與臥底的聯繫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison to the undercover section.{\r}

347
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:12,427
對臥底工作非常瞭解
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His undercover work is extensive.{\r}

348
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,833
他來給我們做下報告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's here to give us his report. Sergeant Dignam.{\r}

349
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,235
我手下做臥底那幾個人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, my people are out there.{\r}

350
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
就像他媽的印第安人一樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're like fucking Indians. You're not gonna see them.{\r}

351
00:24:20,144 --> 00:24:22,578
除了我和昆南長官外 你們不會知道他們的行蹤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'll hear about them through me or Captain Queenan.{\r}

352
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:25,579
你們永遠都不會知道臥底的身份
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You will not ever know the identity of undercover people.{\r}

353
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,684
不幸的是，這鬼部門 比伊拉克海軍的漏洞還多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Unfortunately, this shithole has more leaks than the Iraqi navy.{\r}

354
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:31,117
- 去死吧 - 我干你老婆都干膩了

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- How's your mother? - Tired from fucking my father.{\r}

356
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,558
好了，姑娘們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. Today, girls...{\r}

359
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,859

360
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:47,299
這種處理器放進電腦中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These are the kind they put into computers...{\r}

361
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:50,304
能準確地從幾百英里外
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that could put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel...{\r}

362
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,305
把巡航導彈打進駱駝的屁眼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...from a couple hundred miles away.{\r}

363
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:55,309
這些塑料小東西要10幾萬塊一個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These pieces of plastic are won'th about 100 grand apiece.{\r}

364
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,039
有個人在那公司干了2個月
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We got a guy working for the company two months...{\r}

365
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:01,150

367
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,920
週四他的屍體就在垃圾箱裡被發現了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but on Thursday, he gets found in a Dumpster.{\r}

368
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,251
你知道這傢伙在哪長大的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know where that dirtball started his life?{\r}

369
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,983
南波士頓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Southie projects.{\r}

370
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,823
- 那死人叫什麼名字？ - 邁爾斯·卡內菲克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What was his name, the departed? - Myles Kennefick.{\r}

371
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:16,023
他靠假馬薩諸塞州州立大學文憑 找到這份工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass, Boston...{\r}

372
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,929
…恰好是在… - 南波士頓？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which happens to... - South Boston?{\r}

373
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:21,162
你真是個天才 你的假文憑是從哪來的，蠢貨？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, you're a fucking genius. Who forged your transcript, dickhead?{\r}

374
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,535
這個人他老爸馬特·卡內菲克 不也是愛爾蘭幫成員嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His old man runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.{\r}

375
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:29,437
我們現在不是要討論誰偷了微處理器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag.{\r}

376
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,046
卡斯特羅才是我們的重點
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're here to nail Costello.{\r}

377
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:32,682
線人報告說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, look. We got a guy...{\r}

378
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,375
卡斯特羅正準備把處理器賣到中國去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...says Costello's moving the processors to China.{\r}

379
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:38,021
他一手策劃了這件事 並謀殺邁爾斯·卡內菲克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He set up the whole fucking job and popped Kennefick.{\r}

380
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,589
我們可不能錯過卡斯特羅銷贓的事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You do not want to miss it if Costello takes a dump.{\r}

381
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:44,194
你要是多給我們情報 我們就能盯的更緊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'd miss less if you made your informants available to us and the Bureau.{\r}

382
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,092
我不想追究細節 現在在卡斯特羅身邊有你的臥底嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Without asking for too many details, do you have anyone in with Costello now?{\r}

383
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:50,864
可能有，也可能沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe. Maybe not.{\r}

384
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,730
可能去你媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe fuck yourself.{\r}

385
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:55,235
我對臥底的理論就和養蘑菇一樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms.{\r}

386
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,306
餵它們吃屎，把他們留在暗處
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Feed them shit and keep them in the dark.{\r}

387
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,101
姑娘們工作愉快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You girls have a good day.{\r}

388
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,573
這人其實還不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Normally he's a very nice guy.{\r}

389
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,647
只是這次會議有點反常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't judge him from this meeting alone.{\r}

390
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,882
卡內菲剋夫人，我認識你兒子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.{\r}

391
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:13,785
我認識邁爾斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew Myles.{\r}

392
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,791
他比我小，但是我的學弟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He was younger than me, but he was behind me in school.{\r}

393
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,122
我希望能抓到那些害死他的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I wanna get these people who did this to him.{\r}

394
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:22,288
你想幫我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would you like to help us? You wanna help catch the people...{\r}

395
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:25,299
你想幫我找到那些逼他搶劫 之後又殺了他的人嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who forced your son to do a robbery and then killed him?{\r}

396
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:27,301
據稱如此
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Allegedly.{\r}

397
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,467
據稱如此？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Allegedly.{\r}

398
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,108
如果他是被謀殺的 那他一定做了什麼錯事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If he was killed, he probably did something wrong.{\r}

399
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,244
不是說搶劫，那不算錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But not the robbery. That's not wrong.{\r}

400
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,470
他還做了其它錯事嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He did something else wrong?{\r}

401
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:41,775
親愛的，跟你馬子打個招呼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wave to your girlfriend, honey.{\r}

402
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:45,816
你去死吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, fuck yourself.{\r}

403
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,926
- 你記下來了嗎？ - 「據稱如此」還是「你去死吧」？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Did you get that? - "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?{\r}

404
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:53,530
- 長見識了吧 - 這人可真怪啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Welcome to the neighborhood. - Different breed down here, sarge.{\r}

405
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,499
我要去喝杯咖啡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need a cup of coffee.{\r}

406
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,511
你是上門服務嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You making a house call?{\r}

407
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,141
我工作上有見過你嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have I seen you professionally?{\r}

408
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:18,811
不，但我知道你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no. No, I know who you are, though. I know.{\r}

409
00:27:18,989 --> 00:27:22,652
那些在工作中開了槍的人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Guys gotta use their service revolver in the course of duty...{\r}

410
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:26,421
都得和你談談心，聊聊天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and then they get to come to talk to you about their feelings and whatnot.{\r}

411
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:30,431
不，不，我真的知道 你是心理健康專家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional.{\r}

412
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,262
對，我在這層有個預約…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have an appointment on this floor.{\r}

413
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:35,894
你一定會很開心的 這層都是些怪人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all frigging crazy on that floor.{\r}

414
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,166
- 我還要再上一層 - 噢，警察啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm one more up. - Oh, fancy policeman.{\r}

415
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,435
- 是啊 - 你是州警？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, that's right, fancy. - Are you a statie?{\r}

416
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:43,739

419
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,911
- 你上次是什麼時候查的？ - 在我上他媽的夜校之前
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Whers the last time you checked? - Before I went to fucking Suffolk.{\r}

420
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,853
好啦，我是馬薩諸塞州州立大學畢業的 我不想開你玩笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, listen, I went to UMass. I wasrt insulting you.{\r}

421
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,687
我覺得你是呢，所以你得請我吃飯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I thought you were. So now you gotta buy me dinner.{\r}

422
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,659

424
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,333
不用，我是警探 我能找到你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's all right. I'm a detective. I'll find you.{\r}

425

427

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, it's a blue sedan and then a white van.{\r}

430
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,425
貨車側面有塗鴉 上面有聲音探測系統
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's fucked up with graffiti. And the van is the audio surveillance.{\r}

431

438
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:00,746

439
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:03,950

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You keep on calling me Babu. It's Singh, motherfucker.{\r}

440
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,356

441
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,965
你一直說我是你的朋友 但你連我名字都他媽不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You keep telling me I'm your friend. You don't even know my fucking name.{\r}

442
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:12,591
如果我還想上星期那樣回去 我就要挨揍了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back again like last week.{\r}

443
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,228

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}See this guy? You see this guy? This guy don't want you to have the money.{\r}

444
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,240
要是我們再回來，他就會你打爆你的頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because he wants to come back there and squash your head.{\r}

445
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,844
我這還有一個顧客，你想叫我怎麼辦？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have one customer sitting here. What I'm gonna do?{\r}

446
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,879
生意好差？你是在愛爾蘭區開了這個店
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Business is bad? You opened a store in an Irish neighborhood.{\r}

447
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,278
這些人都是狠角色，你不知道嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These are dirty people. Don't you know that?{\r}

448
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,681
我也不知道你該怎麼辦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sell potatoes, I don't know what you're gonna do.{\r}

449
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,947
- 對不起，夥計們 - 你明白我的意思嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry. - Know what I'm saying?{\r}

450
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,647
你們是從普羅維登斯來的嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You fellas come from Providence?{\r}

451
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,884
這沒你的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It isn't any of your business, is it, now?{\r}

452
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,585
你們是不是送蛋卷的什麼的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What, are you fucking delivering cannolis or something?{\r}

453
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,603

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey! You are killing my business, man!{\r}

454
00:29:53,343 --> 00:29:54,537
靠！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck!{\r}

455
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,874
這個國家大家都彼此憎恨嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's wrong with this fucking country? Everybody hates everybody!{\r}

456
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,154
你給我滾！滾！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get out of here. Get out of here!{\r}

457
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,492
- 你也作假釋工作嗎？ - 是的，我見過暴力犯罪的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Now, you also do probation work, right? - That's right, I see violent offenders.{\r}

458
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:19,727
- 哦，壞人 - 不一定啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Oh, bad guys. - Not necessarily.{\r}

459
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:28,377
他們有這個，卻沒有我想點的菜
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, they got this but they don't got duck I'orange.{\r}

460
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:30,103
你吃得還好吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Was your meal okay?{\r}

461
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,838
哦，湊合，龍蝦很不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, no, the lobster was good.{\r}

462
00:30:32,015 --> 00:30:35,416
這是法國餐館，所以我有點吃驚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just, you know, because it was a French restaurant I was surprised.{\r}

463
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:42,921
我等你先開動呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm waiting for you to make your move.{\r}

464
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,028
我可不知道這東西會不會動 它要是動了，我會朝它開槍的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I don't know, if that thing moves, I'm gonna shoot it.{\r}

465
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:47,561
我都不知道這到底是什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't even know what it is.{\r}

466
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:57,670
每天你在辦公室幫人們重新找回自我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what's it like having people find themselves...{\r}

467
00:30:57,841 --> 00:30:59,706
那是什麼感覺？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in your office all day long?{\r}

468
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:02,505
被各種情緒包圍 你會不會感覺很混亂呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around?{\r}

469
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,213
為什麼？那讓你很不舒服嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why, does that make you uncomfortable?{\r}

470
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:07,782
- 沒有，沒有 - 沒有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- No, no, no. - No?{\r}

471
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,283
沒有，沒有，我現在可不是你的病人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.{\r}

472
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:13,850
你知道弗洛伊德怎麼評價愛爾蘭人的嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, you know what Freud said about the Irish?{\r}

473
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,423
當然知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I do.{\r}

474
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,757
如果你知道的話，我就會再見你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, if you actually do, I'll see you again.{\r}

475
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,563
誰說我還想再見你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who says I wanna see you again?{\r}

476
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:28,199
你不想嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't you?{\r}

477
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,840
- 你真應該看看你剛才的表情 - 你不想嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You should see your face. - Don't you?{\r}

478
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,442
我當然還想再見你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Course I wanna see you again.{\r}

479
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,169
弗洛伊德說愛爾蘭人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What Freud said about the Irish is...{\r}

480
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:40,612
是唯一不受心理分析影響的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we're the only people who are impervious to psychoanalysis.{\r}

481
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:43,917
- 對，他說過 - 我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, he said that. - I know he did.{\r}

482
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:47,250
你的病人裡有一堆愛爾蘭警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you're up shit's creek with a client list full of mick cops.{\r}

483
00:31:47,424 --> 00:31:49,415
那我就祝你好運了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.{\r}

484
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,754
為什麼你要幹這行？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why do you do it, then?{\r}

485
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:55,090
有些人確實好轉了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some people do get better.{\r}

486
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,432
不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fair enough.{\r}

487
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:03,300
有時我只想人們能忘掉他們自己的狗屁事 專心做好自己的工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sometimes I want people to forget their personal bullshit and do their jobs.{\r}

488
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,502
也包括那些罪犯？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Including the criminals?{\r}

489
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,940
要是他們不工作的話 你的工作也難保了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If they don't do their jobs, you don't have one.{\r}

490
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:11,840
我不擔心沒有工作做 到時候，只要去抓那些無辜的人就好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll always have a job. I'll just arrest innocent people.{\r}

491
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,844
- 你有麻煩了！ - 你根本不知道我有多少麻煩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Wait. You are trouble. - You don't know the half of it.{\r}

492
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,112
我現在就想逮捕你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll arrest you right now.{\r}

493
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:21,223
我說話算數
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My word against yours.{\r}

494
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:25,319
…你猜她在婚禮上和誰跳舞呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Then I see her dancing at the wedding with you-know-who.{\r}

495
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,530
我說「為什麼不單獨去拜訪父母」
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I say, "Why don't you go to Parents Without Partners?"{\r}

496
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:32,726
他說不帶伴侶自己去看父母的， 都是一事無成的人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He goes, "Ma, they're all losers at the Parents Without Partners," so...{\r}

497
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:37,805
我說「摩納哥公主卡羅琳娜…」
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So I say to him, "Princess Carolina of Monaco..."{\r}

498
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,841
斯科勒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Schuyler.{\r}

499
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,823
你知道我是誰嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know who I am?{\r}

500
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,588
不認識
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

501
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:10,937
你那天晚上和我朋友法國佬見過面
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You met my friend Mr. French the other night.{\r}

502
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,609
他的真名就是法國佬嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His real name Mr. French?{\r}

503
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,184
不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

504
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:33,763
跟我來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come with me.{\r}

505
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:42,567
我不是警察，也不是在請你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.{\r}

506
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:49,237
你要知道最好別惹 普羅維登斯的黑社會
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence.{\r}

507
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:53,281
這會給我惹不少麻煩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And this can cause me a lot of problems.{\r}

508
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:02,189
你惹的那些人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Those guys you tuned up...{\r}

509
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,520
和普羅維登斯黑社會有聯繫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...they're connected down Providence.{\r}

510
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,428
接下來他們會做的…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What they're gonna do...{\r}

511
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:11,192
就是帶些人回來把你殺了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...is come back with some guys and kill you.{\r}

512
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:14,394
只要你還活著，他們就不會放過你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Which, sure as you're born, they will do.{\r}

513
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,971
除非我叫他們停手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Unless I stop them.{\r}

514
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,208
你想要我阻止他們嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you want me to stop them?{\r}

515
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,575
這事我就不能自己解決嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is this something I can't do personally?{\r}

516
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,249
讓我手下搜一下你的身
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna have my associate search you.{\r}

517
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,718
要搜什麼？我不會叫你搜的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one's searching me. Search me for what?{\r}

518
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,619
看你身上有沒有什麼違禁物品 把鞋脫了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Contra-fucking-band. Take your shoes off.{\r}

519
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:37,660
鞋子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shoes.{\r}

520
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:45,791
我認識你爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I knew your father.{\r}

521
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:52,102
你知道他已經死了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah? Do you know he's dead?{\r}

522
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:55,945
很抱歉，他怎麼死的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, sorry. How'd he go?{\r}

523
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:59,773
- 站起來 - 他又沒抱怨什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Stand. - He didn't complain.{\r}

524
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,680
那是他的問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, that was his problem.{\r}

525
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,685
誰說他有問題？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who said he had a problem?{\r}

526
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,515
我剛剛說了他有問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just said he had a fucking problem.{\r}

527
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:13,159
他本來可以成就一番事業的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's a man could've been anything.{\r}

528
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,730
你是說他一事無成？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you trying to say that he was nothing?{\r}

529
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:19,335
- 靠 - 我是說他在機場工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fuck. - I'm saying he worked at the airport.{\r}

530
00:35:19,503 --> 00:35:21,368
- 沒問題 - 手臂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He's clean. - Arm.{\r}

531
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:22,800
過來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, come on.{\r}

532
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,497
什麼手臂？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What arm? What fucking arm?{\r}

533
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:28,007
手臂給我看看，翻過來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Show me your arm. Flip it.{\r}

534
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:38,345
在這一帶見到你讓我覺得很好奇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood.{\r}

535
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,421
沒問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's clean.{\r}

536
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,856
我也不想把自己的地方搞得這麼亂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if I can slander my own environment...{\r}

537
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:48,828
這讓我很傷心，後悔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...it makes me sad, this regression.{\r}

538
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:53,959
加上我也不知道昆南那樣的警察…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some fucking cop prick like Queenan...{\r}

539
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:58,437
是不是趕你出警隊，讓你來跟著我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to pull you out of the staties and send you after me.{\r}

540
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,542
我確實不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just can't know.{\r}

541
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:06,210
你也知道那個部門是幹什麼的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what they do in that particular department, anyway.{\r}

542
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:10,611
- 你還是警察嗎？ - 不是！不是！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Are you still a cop? - No! No!{\r}

543
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:14,123
你敢在你媽的墓前發誓 你不是警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Swear on your mother's grave you're still not a cop?{\r}

544
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,124
我他媽的絕對不是警察！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I am not a fucking cop!{\r}

545
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,964
你保證不再和你混蛋表兄賣毒品了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you gonna stop doing coke deals with your jerkoff fucking cousin?{\r}

546
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:26,261
是的，是的是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Yes, yes.{\r}

547
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:29,464
沒事，沒事了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right, all right.{\r}

548
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:32,437
你會好起來的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're okay. You'll be all right.{\r}

549
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,843
這點錢拿去看手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get your hand taken care of.{\r}

550
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:41,475
我很抱歉，但我必須這麼做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry, but it was necessary.{\r}

551
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:46,381
至於和普羅維登斯的過結
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As for our problem with Providence...{\r}

552
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:50,022
不要為那些倒霉的意大利人傷心哦
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...let's not cry over spilled guineas.{\r}

553
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:55,531
誰讓這個愛爾蘭共和軍來我的酒吧的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?{\r}

554
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:03,135
開個玩笑，你老媽還好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just kidding. How's your mother?{\r}

555
00:37:04,074 --> 00:37:05,541
她快不行了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's on her way out.{\r}

556
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,769
我們早晚都會到那一步的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We all are. Act accordingly.{\r}

557
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,309
殿下，如您所願
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.{\r}

558
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,642
上車，我給你看點東西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get in the car. I wanna show you something.{\r}

559
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,911
- 是什麼讓你蠢蠢欲動？ - 上車你就知道了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What's got you all hot and bothered? - Get in the car. You'll see.{\r}

560
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:20,415
你相信他嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you trust him?{\r}

561
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:22,285
這年頭…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, these days...{\r}

562
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,584
又有誰是可靠的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who's reliable?{\r}

563
00:37:25,128 --> 00:37:27,096
他叔叔傑西就是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His Uncle Jackie was.{\r}

564
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:32,257
絕對不能相信一無所有的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, but you can't trust a guy acts like he's got nothing to lose.{\r}

565
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,904
我是可靠的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm reliable.{\r}

566
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:43,145
阿諾，你是萬里挑一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Arnold, you're one in a million.{\r}

567
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:45,975
億，我是億里挑一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ten. Ten million.{\r}

568
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,614
你老婆呢，阿諾？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What about your wife, Arnold?{\r}

569
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:54,681
我以為她也是可靠的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I thought she was.{\r}

570
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,956
她才不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She wasrt.{\r}

571
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,128
她現在可靠了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, she got reliable.{\r}

572
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,260
你們就不能閉嘴嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?{\r}

573
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,463
又一個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Another county heard from.{\r}

574
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,369
一個就夠多了，她是個大嘴巴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One too many. She got a big mouth.{\r}

575
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,635
接電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Answer this for me, will you?{\r}

576
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:19,821
<i>他們閃亮的髮絲</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

577
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,693
<i>我愛那美麗的手指</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

578
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,274
<i>親愛的母親</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

579
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:39,026
按照偵查原則 這兩個人來自普羅維登斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The principles of detection tell me these two gentlemen came from Providence.{\r}

580
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:42,899
我是波士頓警察局的 請離開我的犯罪現場
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.{\r}

581
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,837
事實上這是我的犯罪現場 你自己好好幹吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene, but knock yourself out.{\r}

582
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,476
謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thanks.{\r}

583
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:53,974
我看到了死屍 我想我現在有很大的精神壓力
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having posttraumatic stress.{\r}

584
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,947
一起吃午飯嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I meet you for lunch?{\r}

585
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,381
好的，一會見
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, see you then.{\r}

586
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,588
這案子誰負責？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's the lead detective?{\r}

587
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,593
那好辦，那傢伙很蠢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good. He's a lox.{\r}

588
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:18,834
帶人去吉米·帕斯家查查 當然他和這事沒關係
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...{\r}

589
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:20,738
他也會這麼說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and he'll say so.{\r}

590
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,210
你去查他的車，裡面有一隻槍 那槍註冊的是普羅維登斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look in his car, you'll find the gun that did it, registered, official. Providence.{\r}

591
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:27,577
行禮箱還是前面的工具箱？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In the trunk or the glove compartment?{\r}

592
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,910
嗨，想見見死人嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?{\r}

593
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,854
這事肯定能讓艾勒文隊長上晚6點新聞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby on the 6:00 news.{\r}

594
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,326
難怪你這麼受寵
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No wonder you get ahead.{\r}

595
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:48,561
坐吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have a seat, Bill.{\r}

596
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:58,713
你知道約翰·列儂嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know John Lennon?{\r}

597
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,876
他是林肯總統的前任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, sure, he was the president before Lincoln.{\r}

598
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:07,549
列儂說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lennon said:{\r}

599
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,986
「我是藝術家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"I'm an artist.{\r}

600
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,563
你他媽給我根管子 我就能吹出首曲子來」
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You give me a fucking tuba, I'll get you something out of it."{\r}

601
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,166
告訴你卡斯特羅先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I tell you, Mr. Costello...{\r}

602
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,601
我更想從管子裡擠出點錢來花花
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I'd like to squeeze some fucking money out of it.{\r}

603
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:33,379
好個伶牙俐齒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Smart-mouth.{\r}

604
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:36,217
不過太糟了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Too bad.{\r}

605
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,718
如果你允許我…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you'll indulge me...{\r}

606
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:42,613
又去哪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now what?{\r}

607
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,094
唱詩班排練
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Choir practice.{\r}

608
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,461
唱詩班排練…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Choir practice...{\r}

609
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,737
我提列儂是要告訴你…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The point I'm making with John Lennon is...{\r}

610
00:40:56,873 --> 00:41:00,639
人應該能從任何東西裡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...a man could look at anything...{\r}

611
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:02,471
得到些他想要的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and make something out of it.{\r}

612
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,112
打個比方
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For instance...{\r}

613
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
看到你我就想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I look at you and I think:{\r}

614
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:10,017
你可以為我做什麼呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What could I use you for?{\r}

615
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:14,016
把這個處理掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get rid of this.{\r}

616
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,680
法國佬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}French.{\r}

617
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,327
把這個放到樓下去，謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put it downstairs. Here. Go ahead, thank you.{\r}

618
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:20,190
也許我們能幹出點明堂來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe we could work something out.{\r}

619
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,329
- 很好 - 把這個交給他老婆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Good. - And send this to his wife.{\r}

620
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:28,866
你問那傢伙用哪只手打飛機那招夠狠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was nice the way you asked the guy...
...which hand he jerked off with.{\r}

621
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:30,973
希望這個不會嚇到她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope this don't shake Rita up.{\r}

622
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,809
我記得她不是那麼脆弱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As I remember, she ain't that sentimental.{\r}

623
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,683
夠快的，他已經死了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That was quick. You think he's dead already?{\r}

624
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,548
我們只能用電話聯絡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have to do it by phone. I won't do it...{\r}

625
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:50,989
我身上不能帶著竊聽器，明白？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Understand?{\r}

626
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,561
- 你根本不知道這的情況 - 微處理器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You don't know what this is like. - Microprocessors.{\r}

627
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,028
- 微什麼？ - 微處理器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Micro what? - Microprocessors.{\r}

628
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:59,066
可能我們20年後就會和中國開戰
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in 20-odd years...{\r}

629
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:02,170
現在卡斯特羅在向他們出售軍事技術
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and Costello is selling them military technology.{\r}

630
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:04,738
微處理器，芯片，計算機部件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.{\r}

631
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,172
要是有人提到這方面的情況
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Anybody says anything about anything like that...{\r}

632
00:42:07,343 --> 00:42:08,332
及時向我們報告
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you let us know.{\r}

633
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:14,510
普羅維登斯的案子是誰犯的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So who did the two guys from Providence?{\r}

634
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:17,181
吉米·帕斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jimmy Pappas.{\r}

635
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,344
吉米·帕斯怎麼了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What happened to Jimmy Pappas?{\r}

636
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,818
他這個月比較倒霉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jimmy had a rough month.{\r}

637
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,323
他在監獄犯了心臟病
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...{\r}

638
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:28,692
然後在波士頓醫院被人殺了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and then he got himself knifed at Boston City Hospital.{\r}

639
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,696
我想這些報紙上應該有報道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I believe it's been in the papers.{\r}

640
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,902
看來你對這個結果很滿意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You seem quite happy with that result.{\r}

641
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:37,065
只是他媽的結果
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a fucking result.{\r}

642
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,505
為什麼呢？這事誰會受益？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?{\r}

643
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,703
管他呢，反正那案子是他犯的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cui gives a shit? It's got a frigging bow on it.{\r}

644
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:48,948
你是塊當警察的料，年輕人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think you are a cop, my son.{\r}

645
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,280
- 你的執照在哪兒？ - 什麼執照？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Where's your license? - What license?{\r}

646
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:55,390
我沒見過，根本沒有執照這回事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't see none. There's no such thing as a license, of course.{\r}

647
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:58,686
看來你是真欠扁了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you, you definitely need to have fucking one.{\r}

648
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:02,262
就算我們不來扁你，也會有別人來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you're not being run by us, you're being run by someone else.{\r}

649
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:04,957
也就是說你給卡斯特羅先生的地盤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That means you're bringing undesirable elements...{\r}

650
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,068
帶來了他不喜歡的東西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...into Mr. Costello's area.{\r}

651
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:15,002
我他媽只是要拿煙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was going for my fucking cigarettes!{\r}

652
00:43:15,178 --> 00:43:16,202
嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey.{\r}

653
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,478
嘿，他是吉米·派格斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's Jimmy Bags.{\r}

654
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:26,383
- 他要…我不知道 - 你到底幹什麼呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He was rea... I don't know. - What the fuck you doing?{\r}

655
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,184
我缺錢啊，我付給他兩千
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm in the hole, I pay him two grand.{\r}

656
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,156
我給他兩千，賺不到什麼錢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no profit, I pay him two grand.{\r}

657
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:33,227
那就多賺點錢，這可是美國
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then make more money. This is America.{\r}

658
00:43:33,396 --> 00:43:36,695
沒錢你就等死吧 你想怎樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't make money, you're a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?{\r}

659
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,494
- 多賺錢 - 這就對了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Make more money. - That's the spirit!{\r}

660
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:41,762
- 靠 - 別擔心
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Oh, fuck. - Don't worry about it.{\r}

661
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:44,463
那傢伙根本就不需要牙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The guy don't need any fucking teeth anyway.{\r}

662
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:47,768
這雖然只是個不起眼的監視小組 但我是頭兒
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a small surveillance subunit, but it's mine.{\r}

663
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:50,811
我不想搞砸這個組 也不想別人搞砸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I didn't take this job to fuck up or let anyone else fuck up.{\r}

664
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,212
你們都是我親自挑選的，都是我的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I handpicked this group. You're my A team. Now, our prim...{\r}

665
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:57,111
嗨，隊長
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Captain.{\r}

666
00:43:57,287 --> 00:43:58,481
這瘋小子…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This crazy fuck...{\r}

667
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:00,782
…把吉米·派格斯的牙都打出來了 - 然後呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out. - So?{\r}

668
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,050
- 他要… - 他要拿他的煙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He was... - He was reaching for his cigarettes.{\r}

669
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:06,059
你想陷害我？ 弗蘭克，我不是平白無故這麼做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're gonna give me shit? It wasrt for no reason, Frank.{\r}

670
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:07,491
那傢伙把手伸到衣服裡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He reached into his coat.{\r}

671
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,894
我不知道他是想掏賭注登記本還是什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know if he's a bookie or what he's doing.{\r}

672
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,500
但你知道有賭注登記本的人是幹什麼的吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, you do know what a bookie does, don't you?{\r}

673
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,728
知道，交錢給你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.{\r}

674
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:17,168
昆南把一切都劃分到特別調查組
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Queenars compartmentalizing everything in SIU...{\r}

675
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,671
這是對的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which is the right thing.{\r}

676
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,469
就個人而言，我不信任外面的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't trust half the troopers out there anymore.{\r}

677
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,878
關鍵是…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bottom line...{\r}

678
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:26,140
我們可能出問題了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we think we might have a problem.{\r}

679
00:44:26,316 --> 00:44:29,183
我們相信卡斯特羅安插了什麼人在警隊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We think Costello's got a rat in the state police.{\r}

680
00:44:30,853 --> 00:44:33,253
- 是嗎？ - 是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Really? - Yeah, really.{\r}

681
00:44:33,423 --> 00:44:35,721
我們能和昆南安插的臥底直接聯繫嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do we have direct access to Queenars undercovers?{\r}

682
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:38,486
不，目前還不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, not presently.{\r}

683
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:40,094
但我正在想辦法
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I'm working on that.{\r}

684
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,390
比爾，這個給你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here, Bill, this is for you.{\r}

685
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:46,695
從今以後打這個電話到酒吧 找麥克，只找麥克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}From now on, call the bar, ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.{\r}

686
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:50,361
你找麥克，是因為根本沒麥克這個人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You ask for Mikey because there is no Mikey.{\r}

687
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,438
然後你等著，我會給你打電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You wait. We'll call you.{\r}

688
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,270
- 明白嗎？ - 明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You got that? - Yeah, I got that.{\r}

689
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:58,380
- 我沒聽見 - 明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Sorry, I didn't hear you. - I got that.{\r}

690
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:00,175
很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.{\r}

691
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:03,549
嗨，爸爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Dad.{\r}

692
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:06,517
我升職了，好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got promoted. All right.{\r}

693
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:26,041
失陪一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me for one second.{\r}

694
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:28,940
你知道…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know...{\r}

695
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,579
如果你老爸還活著的話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if your father were alive...{\r}

696
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:34,808
看到你跟我在一塊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and saw you here sitting with me...{\r}

697
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:37,248
他會和我商談這件事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...let's say he'd have a word with me about this.{\r}

698
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,218
實際上，即使需要連殺七人才能殺了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat.{\r}

699
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,620
他也會做的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And he could do it...{\r}

700
00:45:43,226 --> 00:45:47,094
你對你老爸有些方面還不太瞭解
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which is maybe something you don't know about William Costigan Sr.{\r}

701
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:56,464
- 那他從來沒… - 從來沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- So he never...? I mean, never? - No. No, no.{\r}

702
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,131
他有自己的原則 他對錢從來不感興趣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He kept his own counsel. He never wanted money.{\r}

703
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,607
你不能跟這樣的人合作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't do anything with a man like that.{\r}

704
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:05,306
你叔叔傑西…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your Uncle Jackie...{\r}

705
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:10,248
如果看到我和你在一起的話 也會殺了我全家的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you.{\r}

706
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:14,849
我經常想起這些
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I think about this.{\r}

707
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:23,459
我們他媽到底在談什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what the fuck are we talking about here?{\r}

708
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:27,168
你有沒有想過再回學校去？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you ever think about going back to school?{\r}

709
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:29,361
學校？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}School?{\r}

710
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:34,104
恕我冒昧，卡斯特羅先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With all due respect, Mr. Costello...{\r}

711
00:46:34,277 --> 00:46:36,370
我不會再回去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...school is out.{\r}

712
00:46:37,113 --> 00:46:39,877
也許有天你他媽能夠清醒過來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.{\r}

713
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:42,946
你好，神父
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good day, Fathers.{\r}

714
00:46:44,153 --> 00:46:47,122
- 卡斯特羅先生 - 早上好，弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Mr. Costello. - Good morning, Francis, good morning.{\r}

715
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,952
你還記得我們以前談的那些淫話？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You recall our chat?{\r}

716
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:52,352
小男孩…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Little boys...{\r}

717
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:56,959
吸自己的雞雞，進進出出
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...sucking on their peckers, et cetera and so forth...{\r}

718
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,967
「上帝創造了我」，這是你的準則嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"I am as God made me." Was that your rationale?{\r}

719
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:07,374
我提醒你一下，在這個地盤上帝說了不算
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May I remind you, in this archdiocese, God don't run the bingo.{\r}

720
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:11,570
我也提醒你，驕者必敗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}May I remind you that pride comes before the fall.{\r}

721
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,052
特麗莎修女最近怎麼樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?{\r}

722
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,621
侍奉上帝之前，我和她的關係很滋潤呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows.{\r}

723
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,585
好好品嚐你的鮮蛤吧，混蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.{\r}

724
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,454
給他們付賬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pay them.{\r}

725
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:29,823
給那老傢伙來電喝的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the old bombardier a drink on the house.{\r}

726
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:39,767
- 問到了什麼？ - 他因持用已吊銷駕照被警察扣留
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What do you got for me? - Uniform clipped him for suspended license.{\r}

727
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:42,308
他還是我們調查的對象
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}However, he's a subject of an open investigation...{\r}

728
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:44,412
對不止一項罪案 他是卡斯特羅的手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}More than one. He's one of Costello's.{\r}

729
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,140
我們正在申請搜查令 但是問不到他的地址
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're getting a warrant. Can't get an address off him.{\r}

730
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:49,978
他已經傳了他的律師 不過律師還沒有回電
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn't called back yet.{\r}

731
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:52,780
- 誰是他的律師？ - 他也不知道名字，只有號碼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Who's the lawyer? - Didrt know the name. Just a number.{\r}

732
00:47:53,523 --> 00:47:54,922
呼機號碼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Beeper number.{\r}

733
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,923
- 律師還沒來？ - 沒來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- And the guy didn't show up? - No.{\r}

734
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,293
- 呼他了？ - 兩次了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- And he beeped him? - Twice.{\r}

735
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:08,003
把你電話給我，關掉那個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give me your phone. Turn that off.{\r}

736
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,297
- 幹嗎？ - 把攝像機關了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What? - Turn the fucking camera off.{\r}

737
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,900
他不知道他律師長什麼樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give it to me. He doesn't know what the fucking lawyer looks like.{\r}

738
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:16,135
這是誰的公文包？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whose briefcase is this? All right.{\r}

739
00:48:16,312 --> 00:48:17,574
- 像嗎？ - 不錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- It's off? - You're good.{\r}

740
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:20,409
下午好，菲茲先生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.{\r}

741
00:48:20,716 --> 00:48:22,911
- 他不能這麼干 - 他干了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He can't do that. - He just did.{\r}

742
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:26,543
- 你是我的律師？ - 你覺得呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You my attorney? - What do you think?{\r}

743
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:29,792
你有沒有說過什麼 打過什麼電話，
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you made statements or phone calls...{\r}

744
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:31,553
需要告訴我的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I need to be made aware of?{\r}

745
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:36,257
我呼了你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I beeped you.{\r}

746
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:39,559
按他們給我的卡片，就這些
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The card they gave me. That's it.{\r}

747
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:43,136
- 就這些？ - 是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That's it? - That's it.{\r}

748
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,775
給你媽打個電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You need to call your mother...{\r}

749
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:50,242
告訴她你今晚不能回家吃飯了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...tell her you're not gonna be home for supper.{\r}

750
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:58,478
攝像機關著，打吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Camera's off. It's off. Call your mother.{\r}

751
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:05,090
警察正在整裝準備突襲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid right now.{\r}

752
00:49:05,328 --> 00:49:08,855
我不知道他們要去哪 但是他們知道，你也知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know where they're going, but they do. And so do you.{\r}

753
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,390
快打電話吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So make the call.{\r}

754
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,497
聽著，豬頭，你用不著相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lookit, fuckstick, you don't gotta trust me...{\r}

755
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:24,573
只要照我說的做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...just listen to what I'm saying to you.{\r}

756
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:45,858
媽，我不能回家吃晚飯了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mom, I'm not gonna make it home for supper.{\r}

757
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:47,969
對不起，我有事耽擱了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry, yeah, I got held up.{\r}

758
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:52,440
你先吃，不用等我了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, no, you carry on without me.{\r}

759
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:56,707
回頭再聊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll talk to you later. Okay.{\r}

760
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:58,642
再見
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bye.{\r}

761
00:49:58,848 --> 00:50:02,045
大家快走，快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody out. Move.{\r}

762
00:50:19,168 --> 00:50:20,396
謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

763
00:50:21,704 --> 00:50:23,137
你是誰？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So who are you?{\r}

764
00:50:23,305 --> 00:50:26,741
看來你得另找一個律師了 費茲先生，好運
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think you need a different attorney, Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.{\r}

765
00:50:26,909 --> 00:50:28,570
我他媽什麼時候能出去？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So when the fuck am I gonna get out?{\r}

766
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:32,077
查查他最後打的電話，那就是他家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, run the last number he called. That's his house.{\r}

767
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,944
不管那是什麼地址 我要監視那地方
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll swear to the judge I surveilled him there...{\r}

768
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,210
我們有許可
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and abra-fucking-cadabra, we got a warrant.{\r}

769
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:40,753
- 為什麼用我的電話？ - 因為你沒進去啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Why did you use my phone? - Because you didn't go in there.{\r}

770
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,732
這兒早晨的光線真好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The light's nice here in the morning.{\r}

771
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:01,336
想談談昨晚發生的事情嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So do you wanna talk about last night?{\r}

772
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:11,510
沒什麼，有的人可能太在乎這些了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make too big a deal out of it.{\r}

773
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:19,027
其實很平常
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's actually quite common.{\r}

774
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:20,787
我要去上班了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I gotta go to work.{\r}

775
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,836
你撒謊嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you lie?{\r}

776
00:51:33,242 --> 00:51:35,733
為什麼？你撒謊嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why? Do you?{\r}

777
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:37,606
不，我問你撒謊嗎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I'm asking if you lie.{\r}

778
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:41,081
「誠實」不是「真相」的同義詞
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Honesty is not synonymous with truth.{\r}

779
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,343
哦，你也撒謊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, you lie.{\r}

780
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:44,679
你也撒謊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You lie.{\r}

781
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:47,512
這為了做好事，謀私利…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally...{\r}

782
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,749
還是純粹是為了玩玩？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...or, what, just for the fuck of it?{\r}

783
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:55,352
我認為有些人這麼做使事態緩和
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I expect that some people do it to keep things on an even keel.{\r}

784
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,792
哦，那你父母都是酒鬼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you had a parent who was a drunk.{\r}

785
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:06,402
你父母是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you?{\r}

786
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,202
不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

787
00:52:10,513 --> 00:52:12,276
還是談談你吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's keep it with you.{\r}

788
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:15,042
說說你的感受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Talk about how you feel.{\r}

789
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:19,150
我的感受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How I feel.{\r}

790
00:52:19,321 --> 00:52:21,221
我的感受
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How I feel.{\r}

791
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:43,806
- 媽的 - 布來恩，別這樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fuck. - Brian, stop it.{\r}

792
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:52,019
別，求你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. Please. No.{\r}

793
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:53,985
不會傷害你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ain't gonna hurt you.{\r}

794
00:52:57,493 --> 00:52:58,824
當你坐在那兒…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You sit there...{\r}

795
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:01,224
面對一個殺人狂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...with a mass murderer.{\r}

796
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,192
殺人狂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A mass murderer.{\r}

797
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:06,562
你的心跳加快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your heart rate is jacked.{\r}

798
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:09,365
你的手…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And your hand...{\r}

799
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,439
毫不顫抖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...steady.{\r}

800
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:19,144
我在監獄裡發現
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's one thing I figured out about myself in prison. My hand...{\r}

801
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:21,510
我的手不會顫抖
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...does not shake.{\r}

802
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:23,808
永遠不會
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ever.{\r}

803
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:34,788
別他媽在這發呆了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wake the fuck up.{\r}

804
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:39,257
我進來的時候有個警察從這出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There was a cop leaving when I came in.{\r}

805
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:41,636
你怎麼知道他是警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How did you know he was a cop?{\r}

806
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:46,605
頭型差，不懂得如何穿衣 整個就一流氓樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight, you know, air of scumbag entitlement.{\r}

807
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:48,936
- 你也輔導警察嗎？ - 這也是我的工作的一部分
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Do you see cops? - That's part of what I do.{\r}

808
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:52,308
當然，從警校裡被踢出來的比較少見
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I normally don't see cadets who've been kicked out of the academy.{\r}

809
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:55,712
你應該找個更好的工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, boy. You should get a better job, huh?{\r}

810
00:53:56,585 --> 00:53:58,246
是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Should I?{\r}

811
00:53:58,554 --> 00:54:01,887
他們到這來…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So do they all come in here...{\r}

812
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:04,287
大哭一場，都是你的警察？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and cry, your cops?{\r}

813
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,762
有時候是的 沒錯，有時候他們會大哭一場
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure. Sometimes they cry, yeah.{\r}

814
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:11,127
如果他們有什麼家庭問題，或者開了槍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If they've had trouble at home, if they've had to use their weapons...{\r}

815
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,427
開槍？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Use their weapons?{\r}

816
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:15,436
聽我說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me tell you something.{\r}

817
00:54:15,604 --> 00:54:17,902
他們就是為了能開槍才加入警隊的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They signed up to use their weapons.{\r}

818
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:20,541
大多數 但是他們看了太多的電視
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Most of them, all right. But they watch enough TV...{\r}

819
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,610
所以以為開過槍後都要痛哭流涕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...so they know they have to weep after they use their weapons.{\r}

820
00:54:23,779 --> 00:54:26,805
再沒有哪個比警察更假惺惺的了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There is no one more full of shit than a cop.{\r}

821
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,779
當然電視上的那些警察不算
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Except for a cop on TV.{\r}

822
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,611
<i>強力止痛藥</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

823
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,125
我看了你的檔案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I looked at your file.{\r}

824
00:54:39,762 --> 00:54:41,821
你曾有過襲擊他人的記錄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I see that you have a record of assault.{\r}

825
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:43,521
是啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

826
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:45,824
在監獄是什麼感覺？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So what was it like for you in jail?{\r}

827
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:50,467
你想聽淋浴之類的事？ 那就是你想聽的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What, you wanna hear about the showers? Is that what you wanna hear about?{\r}

828
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:52,470
在監獄裡發生什麼事了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did something happen to you?{\r}

829
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:54,274
沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

830
00:54:56,478 --> 00:55:00,938
- 好吧，孩子，開始吧，伸開手 - 你以為你可以隨便打人…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them. - Hey, you think you can pop somebody...{\r}

831
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:04,517
自己很了不起嗎？ 你把吉米·帕格斯的下巴都給打碎了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and there's a special card to play? Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...{\r}

832
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:07,588
他可是波士頓警察局的臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...happens to work undercover for the Boston Police Department.{\r}

833
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:10,122
我他媽的都要崩潰了 我不可能一天到晚偽裝成別人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going nuts. I can't be someone else every day.{\r}

834
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,884
都已經一年了，我受夠了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's been a year. I've had enough!{\r}

835
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,189
冷靜點，這世上大部分人每天都在偽裝 有什麼大不了的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Calm down. Most people do it every day. What's the big deal?{\r}

836
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:18,492
- 我不是那種人，不是他媽的那種人 - 沒錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay? - Exactly.{\r}

837
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,033
你是無名之輩 你簽下了合同的，記得嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're nobody. You signed the papers, remember?{\r}

838
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:24,764
我們倆是這世上唯一知道你是警察的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're the only two people on this earth that even know you're a cop.{\r}

839
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,965
我們把你的檔案銷毀怎麼樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How about we just erase your file, huh?{\r}

840
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:28,905
我們把你的檔案銷毀…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How about we erase your file...{\r}

841
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:31,512
那樣你就只不過是 卡斯特羅的另一條走狗而已
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and you're just another soldier for Costello...{\r}

842
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,911
然後你就等著被捕吧 我都不知道你犯了多少罪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...open to arrest for I don't know how many felonies. What do you say?{\r}

843
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:38,679
我要殺了你，我他媽的要殺了你！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How about I fucking kill you, huh? How about I fucking kill you!{\r}

844
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:40,981
- 他開玩笑的 - 我可沒開玩笑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That was a joke. Come on. - That wasrt a joke.{\r}

845
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:43,386
你裝得像個硬漢並不代表你就真是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You play a tough guy, doesn't mean you are one...{\r}

846
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,929
…你個愛爾蘭膿包 - 放開，快放開！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy! - Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!{\r}

847
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:53,000
- 去你媽的！ - 給我鬆手，這是命令！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fuck you, motherfucker! - Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!{\r}

848
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:55,862
天哪，理智點
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For chrissake, be smart.{\r}

849
00:55:56,038 --> 00:55:59,337
要是被別人看見了，我怎麼能不抓你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If anybody's watching us now, how are we not supposed to arrest you?{\r}

850
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:01,066
現在上車
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, get in the car.{\r}

851
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:03,609
你們倆都上車
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Both of you, get in the car.{\r}

852
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:07,576
你們什麼時候抓抓卡斯特羅？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When are you gonna take Costello?{\r}

853
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,877
他幹了這麼多壞事，你我都清楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's wrong with taking him on any one...{\r}

854
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:13,351
怎麼不去抓他？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...of the million felonies that you've seen him do or I've seen him do?{\r}

855
00:56:13,522 --> 00:56:15,217
他殺了人，對吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, he murdered somebody, right?{\r}

856
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:18,326
他殺了人你們都不來抓他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The guy fucking murders somebody and you don't fucking take him!{\r}

857
00:56:18,494 --> 00:56:22,191
你還在等什麼？ 你想看著我被碎屍後去餵窮人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you waiting for? Do you want him to chop me up and feed me to the poor?{\r}

858
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:24,059
- 那就是你們想要的？ - 那可倒好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That what you want? - That'd stick.{\r}

859
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:25,996
你閉嘴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Will you shut up?{\r}

860
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:28,534
我們正在立案，這需要時間
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We are building a case and it takes time.{\r}

861
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:29,932
你知道的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know that.{\r}

862
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,105
有點不對勁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something's wrong.{\r}

863
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:35,707
我告訴你，有點不對勁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm telling you, something's wrong.{\r}

864
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,305
是啊，可能是吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, maybe.{\r}

865
00:56:39,882 --> 00:56:42,612
聽著，你要保持警惕，好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, we need you to keep your ears open, all right?{\r}

866
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:44,781
我是認真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No bullshit.{\r}

867
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,483
我們認為卡斯特羅 在特別調查組裡安插了臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think Costello's got a spy inside the Special Investigation Unit.{\r}

868
00:56:51,393 --> 00:56:52,917
真的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You serious?{\r}

869
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:54,892
恐怕是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid so.{\r}

870
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,461
你有沒有聽說什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you heard anything like that?{\r}

871
00:57:01,637 --> 00:57:03,298
哦，上帝啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus Christ.{\r}

872
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,338
再堅持一陣，孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hang tight for me, kid.{\r}

873
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:09,306
再多堅持一陣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just a little while longer.{\r}

874
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:11,776
只差這麼一點了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We are this close:{\r}

875
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:15,578
好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right?{\r}

876
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:18,614
你來這想怎麼樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you expect coming in here?{\r}

877
00:57:18,787 --> 00:57:21,585
- 我必須來 - 我知道你必須來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I have to come here. - I know you have to come here.{\r}

878
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:24,682
既然現在你已經來了…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But now that you're here...{\r}

879
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,757
你想怎麼樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...what do you want?{\r}

880
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:28,595
你想聽實話？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You want the truth?{\r}

881
00:57:30,899 --> 00:57:32,457
安定藥
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Valium.{\r}

882
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,929
如果你撒謊，也許我就給你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you lied, you would have an easier time getting what you wanted.{\r}

883
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:39,506
- 那是你的工作 - 在給你開處方之前…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What's that say about what you do? - We should have a few more meetings...{\r}

884
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:43,372
…我還需要再和你好好聊聊 - 聽著，我現在驚惶失措
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...before we even talk about prescriptions. - Look, I'm having panic attacks.{\r}

885
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:47,879
有天晚上我還以為我犯了心臟病 我來這的路上還吐在垃圾箱裡了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Other night, I thought I was having a heart attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.{\r}

886
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,642
我已經有好幾周都沒有睡覺了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I haven't slept for fucking weeks.{\r}

887
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:51,342
- 真的嗎？ - 真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Is that true? - Yeah, that's true.{\r}

888
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,216
我說了真話，我需要藥片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I said something fucking true. I want some fucking pills...{\r}

889
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,220
你要幹什麼，想封了我的檔案？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and you're gonna close my file?{\r}

890
00:57:56,391 --> 00:58:00,020
- 我不會封你檔案的，我… - 我以為在這裡…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, l... - I thought I was supposed to tell...{\r}

891
00:58:00,195 --> 00:58:02,789
…我應該講真話，只有在這 - 是的，你是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the truth here, if only fucking here. - You are! Yes.{\r}

892
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:07,095
人們來這裡放棄了隱私和自尊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A guy comes in here against every instinct of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...{\r}

893
00:58:07,269 --> 00:58:08,258
而你呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and what do you do?{\r}

894
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:12,498
你把他們扔到大街上去買毒品吸？ 這就是你的工作？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you do? You send him off on the street to score smack? Is that what you do?{\r}

895
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,407
太荒謬了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're fucking ridiculous.{\r}

896
00:58:23,185 --> 00:58:24,982
2片？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Two pills?{\r}

897
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:28,015
你為什麼不直接給我一瓶威斯忌和一把槍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why don't you just give me a bottle of Scotch...{\r}

898
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,351
讓我轟掉腦袋算了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and a handgun to blow my fucking head off?{\r}

899
00:58:30,526 --> 00:58:33,518
- 這次的狗屁心理輔導結束了嗎？ - 好了，你可以走了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit? - You can leave!{\r}

900
00:58:33,695 --> 00:58:36,095
我受夠了，我走了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What did I just put myself through? I'm out of here.{\r}

901
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:40,702
你這叫「合法威脅」，想想吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what if that was a legitimate threat? Think about it, fucking hotshot.{\r}

902
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,697
靠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck.{\r}

903
00:58:52,414 --> 00:58:55,076
為什麼每天最後一個病人都那麼麻煩？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why is the last patient of the day always the hardest one?{\r}

904
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,047
因為你累了，不想認真對待
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're tired and you don't give a shit.{\r}

905
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:59,119
- 沒什麼不可思議的 - 聽著
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- It's not supernatural. - Listen.{\r}

906
00:58:59,288 --> 00:59:04,385
聽著，不要把我當成 為逃避坐牢而不得不見的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody that you have to see or they put you in jail.{\r}

907
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,427
如果你覺得壓力大，我會幫你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay? I mean, if you're in distress, I will help you.{\r}

908
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:11,022
這是什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's this?{\r}

909
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,333
我的名片，還有20粒安定的處方
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's my card. And a prescription for 20 lorazepam.{\r}

910
00:59:14,503 --> 00:59:16,061
是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

911
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:17,865
這量足夠自殺嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it enough to commit suicide?{\r}

912
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,931
也許，行了吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe it is. All right? Okay?{\r}

913
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,270
根據你那該死的標準 我盡到我的職責了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have I done my job up to your goddamn standards?{\r}

914
00:59:23,445 --> 00:59:27,176
以我的標準來說，你是典型的藥品依賴
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because according to my standards, you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.{\r}

915
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:30,978
太糟了，如果你不喜歡我最初的臨床反應
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, and too damn bad if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.{\r}

916
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:32,415
謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

917
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,215
我會把你轉給另一位心理醫生的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm transferring you to another counselor.{\r}

918
00:59:36,391 --> 00:59:38,382
- 很好 - 好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Good. - Okay.{\r}

919
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:42,121
想一起喝杯咖啡嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you wanna get a cup of coffee?{\r}

920
00:59:48,971 --> 00:59:51,838
搬到這來，來個人把它搬到這來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bring it in here, please. Would somebody bring it in?{\r}

921
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:53,372
進來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on in.{\r}

922
00:59:54,476 --> 00:59:58,469
本次行動的目標是微處理器交易
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors.{\r}

923
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:00,239
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes, those.{\r}

924
01:00:00,415 --> 01:00:04,146
我不知他們是什麼，你們也不知道 管他呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what they are, you don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.{\r}

925
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,844
錢，大量的現金將在這棟樓裡轉手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lots of cash is gonna change hands inside a building...{\r}

926
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:09,286
我們已經做好視頻監視
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that we have under AV surveillance close-by.{\r}

927
01:00:09,491 --> 01:00:13,052
我知道攝像頭位置不算好 但我們時間有限
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know this location is not the best, but we had very little time to set up.{\r}

928
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:15,093
- 你們知道這事嗎？ - 不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You guys know anything about this? - No.{\r}

929
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:18,324
蘇利文警官的小組將負責 辨認他們的身份，監聽電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sullivars team will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones.{\r}

930
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,865
我們先不行動
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Our unit will not take action.{\r}

931
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:24,370
我再說一遍，我們先不行動 直到昆南警官的臥底…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I repeat, not take action, until a man that Captain Queenan has inside...{\r}

932
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:26,734
…確認交易進行才行動，明白？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?{\r}

933
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:30,867
有什麼問題嗎？沒？ 這就是我們要抓的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Anybody? Any questions? No? This is who we're after.{\r}

934
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:34,648
我們已經盯了他很久了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight...{\r}

935
01:00:34,816 --> 01:00:37,341
今晚就能將他逮捕 開始工作吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we are going to get him. Let's go to work.{\r}

936
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,283
你們去弄清楚我們到底要做什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, you guys find out what we're doing and get on it.{\r}

937
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,787
對不起，這麼遲才通知你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sorry to get you last-minute, but things leak.{\r}

938
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,983
這條消息是昆南手下的臥底提供的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This lead came from Queenars undercover guy.{\r}

939
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,722
我要去抽煙，你不抽煙對嗎？ 怕得癌嗎？去死吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.{\r}

940
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:56,963
- 嗨，爸爸 - 嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hi, Dad? - Yes.{\r}

941
01:00:57,139 --> 01:00:59,300
工作上有點事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, something big came up at work.{\r}

942
01:00:59,474 --> 01:01:01,965
- 我晚上不能回來吃飯了 - 太糟了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm not gonna be home for supper. - Too bad.{\r}

943
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,711
你媽忙活了一天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your mother worked all goddamn day.{\r}

944
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:08,380
那我們就不等你和你朋友自己吃了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends.{\r}

945
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,711
不，我朋友還是要來的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, no, my friends are still coming.{\r}

946
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:17,022
我們明天一起吃午飯吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So we'll just... I'll just see you for lunch instead tomorrow.{\r}

947
01:01:17,926 --> 01:01:19,689
你媽媽會很高興的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your mother will be proud.{\r}

948
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:21,726
好的，謝謝，老爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.{\r}

949
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,521
一切都準備好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The readiness is all.{\r}

950
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,168
你熟悉那群人，你負責吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know the players. Call the game.{\r}

951
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,099
謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Thank you.{\r}

952
01:01:33,342 --> 01:01:35,276
你準備好了嗎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You ready? - Is your highness...{\r}

953
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:38,607
殿下是要工作之前帶我去懺悔 和我上床還是什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...gonna drop me off at confession before work, or fuck me, or what?{\r}

954
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,510
你要和那些狗屁神父懺悔什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What have you got to confess to that anointed pederast?{\r}

955
01:01:41,683 --> 01:01:44,618
懺悔的保密，這年頭…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A confessional seal, these days...{\r}

956
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,413
我也不能保證
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I'm not so sure.{\r}

957
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:54,123
很簡單，他操作攝像頭 你識別他們的身份
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them.{\r}

958
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:56,793
所有檢測的手機信號都會在那上面顯示
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All cell-phone signals are under surveillance...{\r}

959
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,729
多虧聯邦調查局朋友的幫助
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...through the courtesy of our federal friends over there.{\r}

960
01:02:02,237 --> 01:02:06,037
愛國行動，愛國行動！ 我喜歡，我喜歡

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Time is 10:46.{\r}

970
01:03:08,136 --> 01:03:10,195
好了，把你們的手機都關掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, turn off your cell phones.{\r}

971
01:03:10,372 --> 01:03:13,364
菲茲拿著貨，大家檢查一下武器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fitzy's got the chicken. Check your weapons.{\r}

972
01:03:36,131 --> 01:03:39,157
- 我們有個盲點 - 為什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- We have a blind spot. - Why do we have a blind spot?{\r}

973
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,234
我們只有2小時的時間安裝攝像頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We had two hours' notice. Two hours.{\r}

974
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:44,133
- 你以為我們是國家航空太空總署？ - 這我可沒想過

975
01:03:44,306 --> 01:03:47,366

977
01:03:57,152 --> 01:04:00,781
我想告訴你他們至少兩人帶了機槍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I wanna tell you, at least two of these gents have machine guns.{\r}

978
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,375

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

979
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,621

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

981

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

982
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:12,997
如果被人捉到，他就死定了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

983
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:14,403

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

984
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:17,028
這位先生是中國政府官員 他現在嚇壞了

985

986
01:04:20,742 --> 01:04:24,439

01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:30,079


989
01:04:36,925 --> 01:04:39,894
為他自己好 告訴李小龍和他手下的空手道們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids...{\r}

990

991
01:04:42,864 --> 01:04:46,163

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because here, in this country...{\r}

992
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:49,126

993
01:04:49,304 --> 01:04:51,499

994
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,934

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

997
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:07,462

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

998
01:05:07,556 --> 01:05:12,425
如果我們像國土安全部那些笨蛋有錢 我就能…
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we had some Homeland Security money like some douche bags I could mention...{\r}

999

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Any calls? - They turned off their cell phones.{\r}

1000
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,458

1002
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:21,668
縮小區域
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then narrow the area.{\r}

1003
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,396
開著手機的就是你們要抓的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What you see there for service is what you're gonna get.{\r}

1004
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:26,473
他們為什麼把手機都給關了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why did they turn their phones off?{\r}

1005
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:29,610
- 等等，還有一部手機開著 - 在哪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Wait. There's still one phone up. - Where?{\r}

1006
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,655
買家在那
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The buyers are there.{\r}

1007
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:50,696
和你臥底直接聯繫會更方便
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, direct contact with your guys would have its advantages.{\r}

1008
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,355
不能和我的人聯繫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not to my guy.{\r}

1009
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:55,631
難以置信 到底是誰他媽的裝的攝像頭？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is unbelievable. Who put the cameras in this place?{\r}

1010
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,266

1011
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,934

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...they'd better shape up and show me 1 million dollars.{\r}

1014
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:20,428
這是我們這個國家的規矩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What we generally do, in this country...{\r}

1015
01:06:20,996 --> 01:06:22,725

1019
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:34,966

1020
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:37,807
就別做買賣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...no laundry.{\r}

1021
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:48,347

1022
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:07,464
車子開了，看到有人出來了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cars are moving, but did you see anybody come out?{\r}

1023
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:11,236
告訴我這車不是空的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please tell me those cars aren't empty.{\r}

1024
01:07:11,413 --> 01:07:16,476
快告訴我這車不是空的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me that those Chinamers cars aren't empty!{\r}

1025
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:23,991
他們不知道我們有海軍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They didn't figure we had a navy.{\r}

1026
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,061
你在後面裝攝像頭了沒有？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you put a camera in the back?{\r}

1027
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:35,998
我能和你談談嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Can I talk to you for a second, please?{\r}

1028
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,569
蠢貨！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You stupid fucking hard-on!{\r}

1029
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:42,933
你全搞砸了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You fucked this whole thing up!{\r}

1030
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:46,376
你都幹了什麼？放開我！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck did you do, you cocksucker? Let go of me!{\r}

1031
01:07:46,548 --> 01:07:49,813
我要揪下你的胳膊，塞進比屁眼！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off and shove it up your fucking ass!{\r}

1032
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,346
我們見個面吧，親愛的 我給你買冰淇淋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why don't we meet? Let me buy you an ice cream.{\r}

1033
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,750
我要走了，除非你叫昆南接電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm getting on a plane unless you put Queenan on.{\r}

1034
01:07:54,923 --> 01:07:57,915
昆南去參加葬禮了 現在我值班，你冷靜一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down.{\r}

1035
01:07:58,093 --> 01:08:00,118
為什麼我他媽不能走，嗯？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane, huh?{\r}

1036
01:08:00,295 --> 01:08:02,923
見面？你真的想要我死嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Meet up? You actually want me dead?{\r}

1037
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:05,931
你的部門裡有內鬼，這是事實
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, there is a rat in your unit. That is a fact, all right?{\r}

1038
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:07,568
- 昆南在哪？ - 他不在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Where's Queenan? - He's not here.{\r}

1039
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:10,796
他們知道你們在樓裡裝了攝像頭 他們什麼都知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They knew you had cameras in the building. They knew everything.{\r}

1040
01:08:10,972 --> 01:08:14,135
消息是內部的人洩漏的，這是千真萬確 你得把他揪出來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There is a leak from the inside. It's real. Man, smoke him out.{\r}

1041
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:18,336
怎麼揪？ 你這連警校都沒畢業的天才給我說說看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who- Didrt-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?{\r}

1042
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:22,040
提供假情報 只你把情報透露給特別調查組的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have a sealed wiretap warrant...{\r}

1043
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:26,677
說你們在卡斯特羅的屋子裡裝了竊聽器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our division, but tell SIU.{\r}

1044
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,323
順藤摸瓜 看看我能否抓住他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Flush it down the pipe, see if it comes out on my end.{\r}

1045
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:31,356
這就是我們首先要做的 我們要縮小範圍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what we do first. Narrow it down.{\r}

1046
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:34,586
- 他媽的昆南在哪？ - 他不在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh? - He's not here.{\r}

1047
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:37,857
你要是想碰頭，或是有新情況再打給我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You wanna meet up or you got something real, call me back.{\r}

1048
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:47,035
從根本上改變你的生活
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Changing your life radically.{\r}

1049
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:49,608
改變一切，對嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Change anything. Right? Change everything.{\r}

1050
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,803
- 對嗎？ - 對
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Right? - Yeah.{\r}

1051
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:57,082
你和這人交往多久了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How long you been with this guy?{\r}

1052
01:08:57,919 --> 01:09:00,547
- 我男朋友？ - 是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- My boyfriend? - Yeah.{\r}

1053
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:06,455
- 四個月，快四個月了 - 四個月
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Four months. Almost four months. - Four months.{\r}

1054
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:08,152
你愛他嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you love him?{\r}

1055
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:12,799
我們倆都很認真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.{\r}

1056
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,332
很認真
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's very serious.{\r}

1057
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:18,199
他是不是也像我這樣怪？我只是好奇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is he a headcase like me? I'm just curious.{\r}

1058
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:20,832
不如我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No more than I am.{\r}

1059
01:09:21,476 --> 01:09:23,467
我知道這是一段認真的感情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know that it's a serious relationship.{\r}

1060
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:26,342
感情總是會有起伏的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know there are ups and downs. Right?{\r}

1061
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:28,846
有疑惑，有問題
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People have doubts and problems.{\r}

1062
01:09:29,317 --> 01:09:32,980
也許稱不上是問題，但是會有疑惑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, not problems, but doubts.{\r}

1063
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:39,489
如果他看到我們在一起，你會怎麼辦？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What would you do if he was standing right there and he saw us?{\r}

1064
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:47,866
我會撒謊 是的，我會撒謊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.{\r}

1065
01:09:48,036 --> 01:09:51,563
為了保持事態平穩，對吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, to keep things on an even keel, right?{\r}

1066
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,832
我們談過這個的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Right? We talked about that.{\r}

1067
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,348
- 早安 - 早安
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Morning. - Good morning.{\r}

1068
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,941
想吃法式甜圈嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Want a French doughnut?{\r}

1069
01:10:04,452 --> 01:10:05,919
好啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1070
01:10:07,355 --> 01:10:08,947
- 我能看嗎？ - 嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hey, can I lookit? - Yeah.{\r}

1071
01:10:09,357 --> 01:10:10,585
當然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure.{\r}

1072
01:10:13,228 --> 01:10:15,856
- 我要把這個拿走 - 什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- All right, we're not having this out. - What?{\r}

1073
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:18,191
你沒見過我小時候的照片吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't see any pictures of where I came from.{\r}

1074
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,133
我尊重你的現在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I respect who you are...{\r}

1075
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:22,462
只是這些不能放在客廳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...just, you know, not in the living room.{\r}

1076
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:24,229
可能會有客人來訪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We might have company.{\r}

1077
01:10:24,405 --> 01:10:26,396
- 來訪？ - 是的，來訪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Company? - Yeah, company.{\r}

1078
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:30,542
- 你為什麼為政府做事？ - 為什麼不呢，你也是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hey, now, why do you work for the state? - Why not? You do.{\r}

1079
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:34,409
你的工作埋沒了你的才能，你這麼辣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, what you do. The degrees and all, everything you got. You're hot shit.{\r}

1080
01:10:34,782 --> 01:10:35,771
是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1081
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:39,006
為什麼要做心理輔導？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So why do you make as much as a guidance counselor?{\r}

1082
01:10:39,174 --> 01:10:42,701
因為我相信公眾服務
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because I believe in public service.{\r}

1083
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,847
你在耍我嗎？ 很可笑嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So now you're gonna fuck with me? So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?{\r}

1084
01:10:48,617 --> 01:10:51,085
- 別跟我來這套，別... - 嘿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- No, don't start with me. Don't... - Hey.{\r}

1085
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,380
討厭的電話，能不能停下！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!{\r}

1086
01:10:54,556 --> 01:10:56,251
- 電話 - 別管電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- The phone. - Forget the phone.{\r}

1087
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:57,892
不，不，接電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get it. Answer it. Answer it.{\r}

1088
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,287
這是你新家的第一個電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is your first phone call in the new house.{\r}

1089
01:11:00,462 --> 01:11:02,657
你住在這裡,你是住戶了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You live here now. You're a resident.{\r}

1090
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,362
梅爾 蘇利文辦公室
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mayor Sullivars office.{\r}

1091
01:11:06,535 --> 01:11:09,333
讓科林接電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put Colin on the phone right now.{\r}

1092
01:11:09,805 --> 01:11:11,102
哦,天哪,對不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, my God. I'm sorry.{\r}

1093
01:11:11,273 --> 01:11:12,797
怎麼了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

1094
01:11:13,275 --> 01:11:15,402
這個人好像...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think it's a guy with...{\r}

1095
01:11:15,577 --> 01:11:19,570
- 有喉癌 - 喂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- It's like a cancer guy. - Hello.{\r}

1096
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:22,911
你的電話是他媽怎麼回事?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck is it with you and your phone, huh?{\r}

1097
01:11:24,753 --> 01:11:26,118
我…工作上的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something for work.{\r}

1098
01:11:26,288 --> 01:11:30,156
沒事沒事，手機沒電了 我事先不知道...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing. It went dead. I don't know, I get...{\r}

1099
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:32,623
剛才是那個小妞接的電話？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Was that that shrink cunt that answered the phone?{\r}

1100
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:35,423
我說過她要... 搬進來和我住一起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Remember I told you that we were... She was gonna move in?{\r}

1101
01:11:35,597 --> 01:11:37,292
- 對 - 她搬進來了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah. - She moved in.{\r}

1102
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:41,197
- 你最好把一切都搞定了 - 嘿,上次要不是我事先通知你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You better get organized, quick. - Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...{\r}

1103
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,201
你早就進監獄了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and you're not in jail.{\r}

1104
01:11:43,372 --> 01:11:46,773
- 你在聽我說嗎？ - 是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Are you listening to me? - Yeah.{\r}

1105
01:11:46,942 --> 01:11:50,673
你想要那個女人嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you like Little Miss Thing sucking on your cock?{\r}

1106
01:11:53,382 --> 01:11:54,747
當然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes. Yes, I do.{\r}

1107
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:56,544
那就好好幹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So earn it.{\r}

1108
01:11:57,419 --> 01:11:59,478
我有種感覺...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm getting the feeling...{\r}

1109
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:01,555
...我的手下有警察的臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we got a cop in my crew.{\r}

1110
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:04,257
我知道 我也感覺到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I know, I'm kind of getting that feeling too.{\r}

1111
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:07,224
是你們的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's one of yours. Inside.{\r}

1112
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:08,488
有什麼發現嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you seen anything?{\r}

1113
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:12,259
我無權查看昆南的臥底檔案 只有他和迪克曼兩個人知道臥底的情況
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got no access to Queenars undercover files. He and Dignam run the snitches.{\r}

1114
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:13,628
- 我正在盡力 - 盡力?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Doing my best. - Your best?{\r}

1115
01:12:13,802 --> 01:12:16,669
你以為我們是做服裝買賣的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you think we're in, the fucking haberdashery business?{\r}

1116
01:12:16,839 --> 01:12:18,397
聽著，弗蘭克，如果你不放輕鬆...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, Frank, if you don't relax...{\r}

1117
01:12:18,574 --> 01:12:22,442
聽著，弗蘭克，如果你不放輕鬆 我就不能放鬆,我現在需要的是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right? Now, what I need you to do...{\r}

1118
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:26,069
昨晚和你一起的那些手下的信息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...get me information on the people with you last night. Your crew.{\r}

1119
01:12:26,248 --> 01:12:28,182
給我他們的社會保險號碼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get me social-security numbers, get me...{\r}

1120
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:32,514
給你？給你？ 你他媽到底給誰幹活?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you work for?{\r}

1121
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,953
好了…弗蘭克… 好了，對不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank. All right. I'm sorry.{\r}

1122
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,322
請您幫我搞到 他們的社會安全號，出生日期
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you could, please. What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...{\r}

1123
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:44,023
所有能證明那些人來歷的資料
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...just all the pedigree information so I can run it on my end and we can ID the prick.{\r}

1124
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,996
你給我搞來那些信息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you can get me that information...{\r}

1125
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:48,602
我就能搞定的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I can... We're gonna handle it. I can handle it.{\r}

1126
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,965
冷靜，不然你要尿褲子了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.{\r}

1127
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,869
我會給你你要的資料
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll get you the records and whatnot.{\r}

1128
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:56,204
但是聽我說，孩子 不要讓我失望...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But listen to me, son. Don't disappoint me on this...{\r}

1129
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:59,677
不然的話...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...or some other guy will be putting their fat cock...{\r}

1130
01:12:59,848 --> 01:13:02,339
就會有別人來搞你女朋友了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...up Little Miss Freud's ass.{\r}

1131
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:11,524
你還好嗎，弗朗西斯？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How are you, Francis?{\r}

1132
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:20,190
- 我媽叫我弗朗西斯 - 我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- My mother called me Francis. - I know she did.{\r}

1133
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:23,167
我還知道你爸叫你腫瘤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And your father called you the tumor.{\r}

1134
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:26,000
那你爸怎麼叫你，查理？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And what did your father call you, Charlie?{\r}

1135
01:13:26,175 --> 01:13:30,168
哦，我忘了,你根本就沒老爸
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasrt around.{\r}

1136
01:13:30,345 --> 01:13:32,472
你老闆做過喉頭切除手術?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have a boss that has a laryngectomy?{\r}

1137
01:13:32,648 --> 01:13:36,550
不，那只是我的一個手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me.{\r}

1138
01:13:36,718 --> 01:13:38,709
你騙我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're lying to me.{\r}

1139
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:41,854
不盡然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not exactly.{\r}

1140
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:45,482
你把那些真的微處理器怎麼樣了，弗蘭克？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What did you do with the real microprocessors, Frank?{\r}

1141
01:13:45,928 --> 01:13:48,624
微處理器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Microprocessors.{\r}

1142
01:13:49,131 --> 01:13:50,359
噢，對了，我聽說了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yeah.{\r}

1143
01:13:50,532 --> 01:13:53,695
你在邊境抓到了什麼中國政府官員
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I heard the story. You arrested some Chinese government guys...{\r}

1144
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:57,202
那人身上帶著幾塊電燈插座
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...at the border carrying some light sockets or something.{\r}

1145
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:01,740
我真想把你那張假笑的臉給撕下來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk off of your face.{\r}

1146
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:05,073
你這混蛋就配給我擦屁股
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wouldrt you rather wipe my ass for me?{\r}

1147
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:09,206
我工作中一些事情不能告訴你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There are certain parts of my job that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.{\r}

1148
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:14,352
我也不容許有任何東西威脅到我們的調查
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation...{\r}

1149
01:14:14,523 --> 01:14:16,548
還有你的生命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...or your life.{\r}

1150
01:14:17,526 --> 01:14:20,518
真的，有些事你不會想知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, really, there are things you don't even wanna know about.{\r}

1151
01:14:21,163 --> 01:14:22,892
好，你說清楚就好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, then just say that.{\r}

1152
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,345
好的，我會的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, I will.{\r}

1153
01:14:26,982 --> 01:14:29,143
搬家的人來了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, that's the movers.{\r}

1154
01:14:29,318 --> 01:14:31,081
這麼說你還想住在這？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, you still wanna stay?{\r}

1155
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,215
- 是的 - 是嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yes. - Yeah?{\r}

1156
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:38,019
來了! 來的真不是時候
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, I'm coming! It's the worst timing.{\r}

1157
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:40,429
我會抓到你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm gonna get you.{\r}

1158
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,463
你要是抓得到我早抓了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you could've, you would've.{\r}

1159
01:14:44,734 --> 01:14:48,295
不過我猜你大概喜歡慢慢來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I guess you like to go at your own pace.{\r}

1160
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:52,840
失陪了，我和天使有約
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.{\r}

1161
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:01,872
弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frankie.{\r}

1162
01:15:02,818 --> 01:15:04,285
弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frankie!{\r}

1163
01:15:05,154 --> 01:15:07,247
你媽媽已經原諒我了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your mother forgives me.{\r}

1164
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,892
你帶著錢下車幹什麼去了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You take off an armored car at the mall.{\r}

1165
01:15:14,063 --> 01:15:16,088
是去給那些普羅維登斯 意大利佬送錢去了嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck, you pay guineas in Providence?{\r}

1166
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:19,098
- 我沒有! - 那你幹什麼去了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fucking now I do! - What the fuck do you do?{\r}

1167
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:23,671
我得在卡斯特羅把我 賣給聯邦調查局前把錢給他 他總是這麼幹的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me to the FBI? Because that's what he does.{\r}

1168
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:26,330
聯邦調查局？你他媽的在說什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}FBI? What the fuck you talking about, FBI?{\r}

1169
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,303
天啊，弗蘭克在外面嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My God, is that French out there?{\r}

1170
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,641
你說的聯邦調查局到底怎麼回事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck did you just say about the FBI?{\r}

1171
01:15:33,816 --> 01:15:35,750
沒什麼，我吸毒興奮瞎說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.{\r}

1172
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:38,909
不管你那弱智的腦袋是怎麼想的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whatever may be going on in that very fucking poor...{\r}

1173
01:15:39,088 --> 01:15:42,854
我是不會傷害你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...very limited brain of yours, I am not gonna hurt you, all right?{\r}

1174
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,286
- 再說一遍你剛說的話 - 沒什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Just tell me what you fucking said. - Forget it.{\r}

1175
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:49,363
我吸毒興奮了,我興奮的飄起來了 剛才那些話都是瞎說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high. I'd never say what you thought I said.{\r}

1176
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,188
去死!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck!{\r}

1177
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:54,666
你剛才他媽到底說什麼了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, what the fuck did you just fucking say?{\r}

1178
01:15:54,837 --> 01:15:58,796
為什麼他從沒被抓過？ 卡斯特羅是受聯邦調查局保護的線人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why do you think he never gets busted? Costello's a protected FBI informant.{\r}

1179
01:15:58,974 --> 01:16:01,465
他會把你們都出賣的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He'll trade you out.{\r}

1180
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:04,540
我還以為中了槍我會休克過去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I thought I was supposed to go into shock.{\r}

1181
01:16:04,713 --> 01:16:07,807
沒有，我現在好痛！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!{\r}

1182
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:10,975
疼死了!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It fucking hurts!{\r}

1183
01:16:18,494 --> 01:16:20,724
嗨，是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey. It's me.{\r}

1184
01:16:20,896 --> 01:16:23,228
- 你來這幹什麼？ - 過來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What are you doing here? - Come here.{\r}

1185
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:28,198
卡斯特羅把人賣給聯邦調查局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Costello's giving people up to the FBI.{\r}

1186
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:32,670
- 聯邦調查局? - 他給聯邦調查局工作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- The FBI? - He is giving information to the FBI.{\r}

1187
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:35,208
他是他媽的被保護的線人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a protected fucking informant.{\r}

1188
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:39,609
他們不是總想弄成個聯邦案件 卻總沒成功？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, aren't they always trying to make it a federal case and it never gets made?{\r}

1189
01:16:40,783 --> 01:16:43,411
到後面去，我來開門，快去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go around the back. I'll open the door. Go on.{\r}

1190
01:16:47,122 --> 01:16:50,489
- 這是冰水 - 謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Here's some ice water. - Oh, thanks. Thanks.{\r}

1191
01:16:55,564 --> 01:16:57,259
那是我兒子，帕特裡克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's my son, Patrick.{\r}

1192
01:16:57,566 --> 01:17:00,694
- 他在聖母大學讀書 - 是嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Goes to Notre Dame. - Oh, yeah?{\r}

1193
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:04,237
我太太睡覺了，她給我留了晚飯 你要吃點嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My wife's asleep but she left some supper out. You want something to eat?{\r}

1194
01:17:04,406 --> 01:17:05,896
不，謝了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. No, thanks.{\r}

1195
01:17:06,075 --> 01:17:09,670
吃點晚飯，我們到廚房裡談
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, come on, man. You have some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.{\r}

1196
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:11,472
來吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on.{\r}

1197
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:48,244
想來點兒白粉嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You want some coke?{\r}

1198
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:55,689
給你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There it is.{\r}

1199
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:58,816
在你麻木之前不要動啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't move till you're numb.{\r}

1200
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:15,776
進來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on. Get inside.{\r}

1201
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:19,944
老闆要你的真實姓名...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Boss wants your real name...{\r}

1202
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:23,641
你的社會保險號，銀行帳號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...your social and license number, your bank account numbers.{\r}

1203
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,912
我沒銀行帳號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't have a bank account.{\r}

1204
01:18:26,088 --> 01:18:29,285
- 我也喜歡現金交易 - 他要幹什麼，給我們開養老帳號？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm a cash business myself. - What's he doing, setting up IRAs?{\r}

1205
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:33,394
少廢話，把表填了 你的真名和帳號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name and all your account numbers.{\r}

1206
01:18:33,562 --> 01:18:35,393
然後我們在這裡等著
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Then we wait here.{\r}

1207
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:38,961
- 開玩笑吧 - 沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You're shitting me. - No, I ain't.{\r}

1208
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:52,473
把表放進去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put the forms in there.{\r}

1209
01:18:55,985 --> 01:18:58,351
我不知道怎麼拼「市民」
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know if this is how you spell "citizens."{\r}

1210
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,182
管他呢,你知道嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But fuck it, you know?{\r}

1211
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:04,158
不對，我來吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no, no. Come here.{\r}

1212
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:11,122
你他媽是不是弱智啊？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What, are you fucking retarded or something?{\r}

1213
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,461
肯定不是那麼寫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That ain't fucking right.{\r}

1214
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:14,897
開玩笑吧?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you kidding me?{\r}

1215
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:16,367

1218
01:19:21,176 --> 01:19:23,701
我他媽還要回去吸毒呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. I'm not sitting here without a tetanus shot.{\r}

1219
01:19:23,879 --> 01:19:25,244
你他媽去哪兒？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where the fuck are you going?{\r}

1220
01:19:25,414 --> 01:19:29,578
我不想呆在這，好嗎？ 告訴他我說的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not staying, all right? You can tell him I said that.{\r}

1221
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:50,929
- 嘿 - 嗨
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hey. - Hi.{\r}

不，沒什麼不合適的 你又不是我病人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, it's not inappropriate. You're not a patient.{\r}

1226
01:20:11,393 --> 01:20:13,361
你是搬出還是搬進？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you moving out or you moving in?{\r}

1227
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:16,290
租約還剩三周

1228
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:27,135

我知道

1230
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:41,483
- 你是不是舉棋不定了？ - 沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hedging your bets? - No. No.{\r}

1231
01:20:41,857 --> 01:20:43,256
你得選擇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have to choose.{\r}

1232
01:20:43,425 --> 01:20:46,087
- 你得做出... - 決定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You have to make a... - A decision.{\r}

1233
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:49,662
決定，然後就要堅持你的選擇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A decision. And, you know, you have to stick by what you choose.{\r}

1234
01:20:49,832 --> 01:20:52,096

1236
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:58,705

1237
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:14,751
我得說，你這種受傷的樣子 現在有點讓我害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to say your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now.{\r}

1238
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:21,623
是真的嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it real?{\r}

1239
01:21:25,534 --> 01:21:27,263
我想是吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think so.{\r}

1240
01:21:33,175 --> 01:21:35,040
你沒養貓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't have any cats.{\r}

1241
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:36,768
恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1242
01:21:37,746 --> 01:21:39,509
我喜歡這樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I like that.{\r}

1243
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,014
我不明白
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't get it.{\r}

1244
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:58,552
我們都相信卡斯特羅...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We are all convinced that Costello has at least...{\r}

1245
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:01,890
在特別調查組裡至少安插了一個內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...one mole inside the Special Investigations Unit.{\r}

1246
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:06,296
你要調查所有的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You will investigate everybody and anybody.{\r}

1247
01:23:06,468 --> 01:23:10,632
這可不是什麼好差事啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, that's not exactly a dream job for a cop.{\r}

1248
01:23:10,806 --> 01:23:14,071
在所有的候選人裡 你的檔案完美無缺
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We looked at all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record.{\r}

1249
01:23:14,243 --> 01:23:17,576
有些人不信任這種完美的人 但是我信任
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Some people don't trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do.{\r}

1250
01:23:17,746 --> 01:23:19,213
我也是完美的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have an immaculate record.{\r}

1251
01:23:20,482 --> 01:23:22,347
婚禮的事準備的怎麼樣了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How is your wedding coming along?{\r}

1252
01:23:22,517 --> 01:23:24,951
不錯，她是醫生
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Great. Great. She's a doctor.{\r}

1253
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:27,887
- 厲害 - 是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That's outstanding. - Yeah.{\r}

1254
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:30,183
婚姻是人生重要的一環
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Marriage is an important part of getting ahead.{\r}

1255
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,260
至少人們會知道你不是同性戀 而且你本人看上去也更可靠些
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lets people know you're not a homo. Married guy is more stable.{\r}

1256
01:23:33,428 --> 01:23:36,090
人們看到你的戒指就會想 至少還有個人能忍受這個混球
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}People see the ring, think at least someone can stand him.{\r}

1257
01:23:36,265 --> 01:23:40,326
女人看到你的戒指,立刻就知道你至少有點兒錢 而且你的老二還好用
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ladies see the ring, they know you must have some cash and your cock must work.{\r}

1258
01:23:41,136 --> 01:23:43,570
是好用,還能加班呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, it's working. Overtime.{\r}

1259
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,736
- 很高興聽到這個 - 謝謝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I'm glad to hear that. - Thank you.{\r}

1260
01:24:10,908 --> 01:24:13,994
<i>跟著信封</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1261
01:24:34,823 --> 01:24:38,486
來啊,來啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Be dirty, be dirty.{\r}

1262
01:24:40,662 --> 01:24:42,857
哦...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah...{\r}

1263
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,800
媽的，你有毛病啊?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?{\r}

1264
01:24:51,673 --> 01:24:54,699

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- See anything you like, Col? - I almost fucking shot you.{\r}

1265
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:57,777
- 你不喜歡自虐吧？ - 坐下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you? - Sit down.{\r}

1266
01:24:57,946 --> 01:25:02,007
我希望你不會背叛我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope you're not turning into one of them sob sisters wants to get caught.{\r}

1267
01:25:02,384 --> 01:25:04,079
你還承受的住嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're not cracking up, are you?{\r}

1268
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,580
- 我不會崩潰的 - 選這麼個地方見面...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I don't crack up. - Pick a place like this...{\r}

1269
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:09,656
太容易被警察發現了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...where any cop could see you. Jesus.{\r}

1270
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:12,988
如果這主意很糟，為什麼你還來?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If this is such a fucking bad idea why'd you show up?{\r}

1271
01:25:13,595 --> 01:25:15,256
因為這裡是我的地盤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I own the place.{\r}

1272
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:20,160
什麼？我他媽的太吃驚了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why am I not fucking surprised?{\r}

1273
01:25:21,503 --> 01:25:25,234
- 我有些事要告訴你... - 你被分配了其他任務
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you... - You're getting reassigned. I know.{\r}

1274
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:27,408
你他媽怎麼知道的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How the fuck do you know that?{\r}

1275
01:25:27,576 --> 01:25:29,874

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Where'd they put you? - Hey, Frank.{\r}

1276
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:33,606
我要查出"我自己"
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I gotta find myself.{\r}

1277
01:25:33,782 --> 01:25:35,374

1278
01:25:35,984 --> 01:25:38,384
我得找出你在警局裡安插的內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I gotta find the guy you got in the department.{\r}

1279
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:42,750
大家都自顧不暇 再加上你自己就是那個內鬼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself...{\r}

1280
01:25:42,924 --> 01:25:44,983
我打賭到頭來他們還是什麼也查不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I put my money on nobody finds nothing.{\r}

1281
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,597
我知道，但是弗蘭克，為了我 你現在要低調行事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know, but, Frank, lookit. For me, you gotta lay low.{\r}

1282
01:25:49,765 --> 01:25:51,596

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Right now. - Collie...{\r}

1283
01:25:51,767 --> 01:25:54,167
低調行事不是我的風格
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...laying low is not what I do.{\r}

1284
01:25:54,336 --> 01:25:56,998
沒錯，你厲害，什麼都不怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank. Fucking perfect.{\r}

1285
01:25:57,172 --> 01:25:59,402
如果你不聽我的勸告，
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What good am I to you if you don't listen to me?{\r}

1286
01:25:59,574 --> 01:26:01,166
那要我幹什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What good am I if you don't listen?{\r}

1287
01:26:04,353 --> 01:26:06,214
<i>識別疑犯</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1288
01:26:06,314 --> 01:26:09,112
昆南現在把他的部門和我們的分開
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Queenan is compartmentalizing. He's splitting everything up.{\r}

1289
01:26:09,284 --> 01:26:10,945
他很聰明，這點你清楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's fucking smart. You know this.{\r}

1290
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,714
弗蘭克，我能找到內鬼 但是你要讓我放手幹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can get the rat. You just gotta let me do it my way, Frank.{\r}

1291
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,420
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay.{\r}

1292
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:26,132
不過科林,我不想再提醒你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But Colin, I hope I won't have to remind you...{\r}

1293
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:30,328
如果你還找不到內鬼的話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that if you don't find that cheese-eating rat bastard in your department...{\r}

1294
01:26:30,505 --> 01:26:34,737
到頭來最先倒霉的可不是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...most likely, it won't be me who suffers for it.{\r}

1295
01:26:35,677 --> 01:26:38,168
何必一再提醒我這點呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, why would you have to remind me of that?{\r}

1296
01:26:38,346 --> 01:26:43,511
難道這對我現在的工作有任何幫助嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't fucking already know that?{\r}

1297
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:46,119
弗蘭克，你得相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank, you gotta trust me.{\r}

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right? Just trust me, Frank.{\r}

1299
01:26:50,258 --> 01:26:54,820
要是需要撒謊的話 你知道我他媽很在行的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, it fucking involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?{\r}

1300
01:26:54,996 --> 01:26:56,657
好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Right?{\r}

1301
01:26:56,832 --> 01:26:59,460
也許是因為我玩女人太容易了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe because it's always been so easy...{\r}

1302
01:26:59,634 --> 01:27:04,264
我就不明白為什麼 有人要在電影院裡玩手淫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a theater.{\r}

1303
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:12,337
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Christ.{\r}

1304
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:17,008
誰知道究竟什麼事情容易呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who knows what's easy?{\r}

1305
01:27:17,786 --> 01:27:22,450
科林，我相信你能辦好這件事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Colin, I know you'll take care of business.{\r}

1306
01:28:07,202 --> 01:28:08,669
媽的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shit!{\r}

1307
01:28:47,576 --> 01:28:49,009
干！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck.{\r}

1308
01:28:54,063 --> 01:28:56,482
<i>進行拘捕</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1309
01:30:07,155 --> 01:30:08,645
嗨，你好嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, how you doing?{\r}

1310
01:30:08,823 --> 01:30:10,984
嗨，親愛的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hi, Darlene, hi.{\r}

1311
01:30:15,163 --> 01:30:17,028
- 我走了 - 再見
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That's it for me. - Yeah, see you.{\r}

1312
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:18,893
祝你愉快
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have a good one.{\r}

1313
01:30:42,023 --> 01:30:44,184
我聞到了內鬼味
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I smell a rat.{\r}

1314
01:30:50,832 --> 01:30:52,060
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus Christ.{\r}

1315
01:30:53,134 --> 01:30:54,726
你有女朋友嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got a girlfriend?{\r}

1316
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:58,332
沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1317
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:00,565
為什麼問我這個，有什麼問題嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, no. Why, what does that matter?{\r}

1318
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:03,675
那要看情況了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It depends.{\r}

1319
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,509
我相信你已經知道...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sure by now you know...{\r}

1320
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:13,246
我的手下裡有臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I got an informer in my outfit.{\r}

1321
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:15,450
條子...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cop.{\r}

1322
01:31:15,623 --> 01:31:20,890
或者是州警 我也不太清楚
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Staties, Boston Police Department, I'm not sure.{\r}

1323
01:31:21,062 --> 01:31:23,223
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus Christ.{\r}

1324
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:27,461
你肯定不是聯邦調查局？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you sure it's not the FBI?{\r}

1325
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:31,804
不是聯邦調查局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It ain't the FBI.{\r}

1326
01:31:32,841 --> 01:31:34,775
前妻
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ex-wife.{\r}

1327
01:31:36,077 --> 01:31:38,136
女友
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Old girlfriend.{\r}

1328
01:31:39,514 --> 01:31:41,448
還有愚蠢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or stupid.{\r}

1329
01:31:42,617 --> 01:31:45,984
幹我們這行的最怕這幾樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is what brings you down in this business.{\r}

1330
01:31:46,154 --> 01:31:47,849
愚蠢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stupid, huh?{\r}

1331
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:50,423
至少我不在此列
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I guess that leaves me out.{\r}

1332
01:31:54,662 --> 01:32:00,032
要是這種事發生在以前 我早就把所有人都宰了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, past days, situation like this, I kill everybody.{\r}

1333
01:32:00,769 --> 01:32:03,203
所有我的手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody who works for me.{\r}

1334
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:05,969
弗蘭克，我們的人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Right. You know, Frank...{\r}

1335
01:32:06,141 --> 01:32:08,234
那些人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I look around at your other guys...{\r}

1336
01:32:09,043 --> 01:32:11,978
他們都殺人不眨眼，對吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, they're all murderers, right? Right?{\r}

1337
01:32:12,647 --> 01:32:15,810
我想，我能不能也像他們一樣？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And I think, "Could I do murder?"{\r}

1338
01:32:17,886 --> 01:32:21,049
我所知道的只是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And all I can answer myself is:{\r}

1339
01:32:22,557 --> 01:32:24,582
我和他們又有什麼分別呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"What's the difference?"{\r}

1340
01:32:25,326 --> 01:32:27,658
留給上帝發落吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give them up to the Almighty.{\r}

1341
01:32:28,196 --> 01:32:30,892
我想說的就是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You see, that's my point, you know?{\r}

1342
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:36,160
指責我一次，我還能容忍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You accuse me once, I put up with it.{\r}

1343
01:32:36,337 --> 01:32:37,668
指責我兩次...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You accuse me twice...{\r}

1344
01:32:39,307 --> 01:32:41,207
我退出不幹了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I quit.{\r}

1345
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:46,213
你要是想讓我膽戰心驚...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a fucking bullet in your head...{\r}

1346
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:49,316
我二話不說就崩了你的頭，懂嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as if you were anybody else. Okay?{\r}

1347
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:04,124
你有事要問我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got something you wanna ask me?{\r}

1348
01:33:06,267 --> 01:33:10,294
你都70歲了，弗蘭克 我只是說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, you're 70 years old, Frank. I'm just saying, okay?{\r}

1349
01:33:11,172 --> 01:33:13,470
總有人會出賣你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One of your guys is gonna pop you.{\r}

1350
01:33:13,641 --> 01:33:15,973
- 會有人的 - 我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- One of your guys is gonna pop you. - Yeah, yeah.{\r}

1351
01:33:16,144 --> 01:33:18,442
指控你搞毒品勾當 你到底在搞什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As for running drugs, what the fuck are you doing?{\r}

1352
01:33:18,613 --> 01:33:22,208
你根本就不缺錢花 但你就像他們的眼中釘肉中刺
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You don't need the money or the pain in the ass. And they will catch you.{\r}

1353
01:33:22,383 --> 01:33:24,510
自從我三年級的搶了同學的牛奶錢後
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I haven't needed the money...{\r}

1354
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:28,816
我就不缺錢花了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade.{\r}

1355
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:32,255
說實話，我也不需要女人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either.{\r}

1356
01:33:33,728 --> 01:33:35,559
但是我喜歡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I like it.{\r}

1357
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:39,495
我想說的是，比爾...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Point I'm making here is, Bill...{\r}

1358
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:42,500
現在我這有內鬼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I got this rat...{\r}

1359
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,970
噁心，該死的內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...this gnawing, cheese-eating, fucking rat...{\r}

1360
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:49,541
這使我產生了置疑
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and it brings up questions.{\r}

1361
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:53,704
比爾你是新來的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know. See, Bill, like, you're the new guy.{\r}

1362
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:56,780
還記得我們剛才說的前妻女友什麼的嗎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Girlfriend...{\r}

1363
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:03,489
讓你寫號碼那天，為什麼你不呆在酒吧裡？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why don't you stay in the bar that night I got your numbers?{\r}

1364
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:06,921
社會安全號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Social-security numbers.{\r}

1365
01:34:07,095 --> 01:34:10,030
- 是的 - 所有人的號碼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah. - Everybody's fucking numbers.{\r}

1366
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:12,996
這就是你想要問的?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is there something that you just wanna go ahead and ask me?{\r}

1367
01:34:13,167 --> 01:34:15,567
我他媽現在就回答你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because I'll give you the fucking answer, all right?{\r}

1368
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:17,671
看著我，弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank, look at me. Look at me.{\r}

1369
01:34:17,839 --> 01:34:21,138
我他媽的不是內鬼，懂嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?{\r}

1370
01:34:21,309 --> 01:34:22,708
我不是那個內鬼！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm not the fucking rat.{\r}

1371
01:34:23,811 --> 01:34:26,143
這麼說你也認為有內鬼了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Start with you agree there is a rat.{\r}

1372
01:34:27,048 --> 01:34:28,572
是你說的有內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You said there is one, all right?{\r}

1373
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:32,277
我這麼說是因為 我知道你對這種事情很在行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty good at what you do.{\r}

1374
01:34:32,453 --> 01:34:34,546
很好,很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sure. Sure, Will.{\r}

1375
01:34:34,722 --> 01:34:39,216
你，威廉，你會怎麼做？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You, William. What would you do?{\r}

1376
01:34:44,232 --> 01:34:45,756
弗蘭克，這裡有多少人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank, how many of these guys...{\r}

1377
01:34:45,934 --> 01:34:48,334
有資格坐上你的位置？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...have been with you long enough to be disgruntled?{\r}

1378
01:34:48,503 --> 01:34:51,472
你仔細想想 你給的錢不多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Think about it. You don't pay much, you know.{\r}

1379
01:34:51,639 --> 01:34:54,608
你給的錢只夠買棺材的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.{\r}

1380
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:58,303
問題是，這是唯一的問題...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The question is, and this is the only question...{\r}

1381
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:03,641
誰覺得他比你有能耐，可以取代你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who thinks that they can do what you do better than you?{\r}

1382
01:35:04,585 --> 01:35:07,748
唯一能取代我的人就是我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The only one who could do what I do is me.{\r}

1383
01:35:09,023 --> 01:35:12,459
其他能取代我的都死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lot of people had to die for me to be me.{\r}

1384
01:35:14,963 --> 01:35:16,988
你想取代我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You wanna be me?{\r}

1385
01:35:20,702 --> 01:35:23,364
我也許可以
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I probably could be you. Yeah.{\r}

1386
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:25,028
這我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I know that much.{\r}

1387
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:29,401
但我不想取代你，弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I don't wanna be you, Frank.{\r}

1388
01:35:29,577 --> 01:35:31,841
我不想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't wanna be you.{\r}

1389
01:35:32,847 --> 01:35:37,784
王冠難戴啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.{\r}

1390
01:35:38,286 --> 01:35:39,719
沒錯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

1391
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:43,023
- 弗朗西斯 - 我要走了，別忘了把警報...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Francis. - I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...{\r}

1392
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:47,287
- 好的,聖誕節見 - 好吧,晚安
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas. - All right. Good night.{\r}

1393
01:35:49,797 --> 01:35:52,664
為什麼大家喜歡餐廳？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what I like about restaurants?{\r}

1394
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:54,699
因為有吃的？我不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The fucking food? I don't know. What?{\r}

1395
01:35:55,203 --> 01:35:59,105
看別人吃飯你能學到很多東西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You learn a lot watching things eat.{\r}

1396
01:36:01,342 --> 01:36:03,674
有艘船貨要到格拉斯特
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's a boat coming up Gloucester.{\r}

1397
01:36:04,645 --> 01:36:07,478
具體情況法國佬會告訴你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}French will give you all the details. Don't forget.{\r}

1398
01:36:07,648 --> 01:36:10,811

1399

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}In the future, I tell you to do a thing, you fucking do it. You got that?{\r}

1400
01:36:21,062 --> 01:36:23,326
明白了,好的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got it. Okay?{\r}

1401
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,258
對不起...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Excuse me...{\r}

1402
01:36:27,435 --> 01:36:30,097
- 不好意思，法國佬，我的... - 好的，弗朗西斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...French, I forgot my... - Okay, Francis.{\r}

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Problem?{\r}

1406
01:36:46,387 --> 01:36:49,914
是，我確實有點問題 我才是主管，你少來這摻合
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks like you, okay? I don't like them.{\r}

1407
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:52,423
哪天你不想陞官了，記得告訴我一聲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The day you wouldn't take a promotion, let me know.{\r}

1408
01:36:52,593 --> 01:36:54,720
如果你能處理好的話 根本就不會叫我來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you'd taken care of this I wouldn't be here.{\r}

1409
01:36:54,896 --> 01:36:58,423
- 你去死吧，臭狗屎 - 我要你那個臥底的身份
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit. - I need the identity of your undercovers.{\r}

1410
01:36:58,599 --> 01:37:02,160
去死吧 你還沒到那個級別
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately, there's no promotion involved for you.{\r}

1411
01:37:02,336 --> 01:37:03,325
混蛋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking prick.{\r}

1412
01:37:03,738 --> 01:37:06,730
- 嗨，隊長 - 瞧瞧，這不是明星來了嗎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hi, captain. - Look who's here. The prom queen.{\r}

1413
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:09,240
- 大家好像都不喜歡我 - 你想怎麼樣呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- They are not happy with me. - What do you expect?{\r}

1414
01:37:09,577 --> 01:37:12,910
大家都知道你被分配到這裡 查卡斯特羅的臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Everybody knows you've been assigned here to find Costello's rat.{\r}

1415
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:16,275
他們和你一樣想揪出那個傢伙
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They want to find the leak as much as you do.{\r}

1416
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:20,812
兩天前,我的臥底差點就查出 卡斯特羅臥底的身份
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like I said, two days ago, my guy damn near found out who Costello's rat is.{\r}

1417
01:37:22,557 --> 01:37:25,458
- 不過最後在街上跟丟了 - 真的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- But he lost him in the streets. - Really?{\r}

1418
01:37:27,795 --> 01:37:31,060
- 他看到那人的相貌了沒？ - 沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Well, did he get a look at the guy? - No.{\r}

1419
01:37:31,232 --> 01:37:33,996
什麼都沒有？ 任何信息可能都對我們有幫助
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, nothing? Like, I mean, anything that could help us.{\r}

1420
01:37:34,168 --> 01:37:35,396
沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1421
01:37:37,872 --> 01:37:40,773
有什麼建議給我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you got any advice for me? Just, I mean, generally.{\r}

1422
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:45,239
沒有特別調查組內鬼的信息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Costello can't do much business without coordinating with his source...{\r}

1423
01:37:45,413 --> 01:37:47,278
卡斯特羅沒法做太多的生意
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who is here in SIU.{\r}

1424
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,416
跟蹤卡斯特羅就會找到他的線人的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.{\r}

1425
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,688
你要去查我的人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're gonna be looking at my people...{\r}

1426
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:06,128
查他們的銀行賬戶，電話記錄和醫療記錄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...going through their bank statements, their phone calls and medical records.{\r}

1427
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:11,101
他們不會請你去喝酒或去家裡作客
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't be surprised if they don't buy you a beer or invite you into their homes.{\r}

1428
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,531
要來杯咖啡嗎
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me get you a coffee.{\r}

1429
01:38:17,478 --> 01:38:20,709
如果我沒有當州警...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I wasrt with the Massachusetts State Police...{\r}

1430
01:38:21,349 --> 01:38:24,284
而是選擇去法學院學習的話...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if I did it full-time, law school...{\r}

1431
01:38:24,886 --> 01:38:27,047
我一年就可以完成學業
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I'd be through it in a year.{\r}

1432
01:38:28,356 --> 01:38:30,256
如果我不在警隊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I wasrt a trooper.{\r}

1433
01:38:34,562 --> 01:38:37,395
在另一個城市也許情況會好很多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But another city. I was thinking that.{\r}

1434
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:40,362
另一個城市
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Another city.{\r}

1435
01:38:40,601 --> 01:38:42,933
另一個城市?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Another city, huh?{\r}

1436
01:38:44,438 --> 01:38:47,566
那就可以重新開始了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.{\r}

1437
01:38:48,109 --> 01:38:51,374
我希望你知道，你沒有必要留下來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want you to know, you don't got to stay.{\r}

1438
01:38:53,714 --> 01:38:55,511
如果我們最後沒有走到一起...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we're not gonna make it...{\r}

1439
01:38:55,683 --> 01:39:00,143
你一定要先離開我，因為我做不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...it's gotta be you that gets out, because I'm not capable.{\r}

1440
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:05,789
我他媽的是愛爾蘭人 我只會一輩子生活在錯誤的陰影中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life.{\r}

1441
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:18,403
也許我們真應該到另一個城市去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It might not be a bad idea, you know, another city.{\r}

1442
01:39:36,657 --> 01:39:39,421

1444

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right. - I have reason to believe...{\r}

1486
01:42:29,096 --> 01:42:31,826
昆南隊長就是卡斯特羅的內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.{\r}

1487
01:42:31,999 --> 01:42:34,297
跟蹤他，注意不要被他發現
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So just follow him and don't get made.{\r}

1488
01:42:37,638 --> 01:42:40,505
警官，目標出來了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sarge, we got the target coming out.{\r}

1489
01:43:16,977 --> 01:43:18,205
嘿，你在哪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey. Where are you?{\r}

1490
01:43:18,379 --> 01:43:20,347
回頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look down the car.{\r}

1491
01:43:21,749 --> 01:43:24,217
- 看到我了嗎？ - 看到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You got me? - Yeah, I gotcha.{\r}

1492
01:43:24,385 --> 01:43:26,250
有人跟蹤你嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is there a reason you would have a tail?{\r}

1493
01:43:26,754 --> 01:43:28,153
不會
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

1494
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:32,623
- 但是我覺得… - 比利,沒人跟蹤我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Because I think... - Billy, I don't have a tail.{\r}

1495
01:43:33,961 --> 01:43:37,590
下一站下車，南站 在那裡等10分鐘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get off at the next stop, all right? South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.{\r}

1496
01:43:37,765 --> 01:43:40,029
南站，等10分鐘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}South Station. Wait 10 minutes.{\r}

1497
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:51,536
<i>沃時街344號</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1498
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:19,167
他進了一棟樓，沃時街344號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He just went into a building down the waterfront. 344 Wash.{\r}

1499
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,865
聽到了嗎？沃時街344號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got that? 344 Wash.{\r}

1500
01:44:26,046 --> 01:44:27,673
他去了頂樓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, he went up to the top floor.{\r}

1501
01:44:32,253 --> 01:44:34,915
頂樓空著，沒人住
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Building's empty. No tenants here.{\r}

1502
01:44:36,423 --> 01:44:39,722
有批毒品運進來了 但我不知道詳情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's got dope coming in. I don't know where. He...{\r}

1503
01:44:40,561 --> 01:44:42,051
他現在很神經質
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's getting spooky, captain.{\r}

1504
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:43,355
- 什麼意思？ - 他失去理智了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What? - I just saw him.{\r}

1505
01:44:43,531 --> 01:44:46,056
我看到他滿手是血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He had blood on his hands. He's lost his fucking mind.{\r}

1506
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:55,074
不知道我們來這幹什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't know what we're doing here, boys.{\r}

1507
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:58,678
他不用他的老手下了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not including his regular guys. But I'll tell you something.{\r}

1508
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:02,373
告訴你，遲早他會知道我的身份的 他會幹掉我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sooner or later he's gonna find out who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.{\r}

1509
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:04,882
- 我知道，他會幹掉我 - 好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me! - All right!{\r}

1510
01:45:11,725 --> 01:45:14,694
找到他了，昆南正在和他接頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think we got him. I think Queenars meeting with him right now.{\r}

1511
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:16,557
好了，聽我說
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right. Listen to me.{\r}

1512
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:19,528
很抱歉，我會把你弄出來

1513
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,965
也許需要些時間，但我一定會把你弄出來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll get you out of this. I can't do it overnight but I'll get you out.{\r}

1514
01:45:24,038 --> 01:45:25,096
是嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1515
01:45:25,272 --> 01:45:27,968
上車，有行動 大動作
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, get the van. We're moving. Heavy work.{\r}

1516
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:30,474
- 聯邦調查局怎麼辦？ - 他們那邊洩漏消息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What about the FBI? - They're compromised.{\r}

1517
01:45:30,644 --> 01:45:32,077
- 他們什麼？ - 他們完蛋了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- They're what? - They're fucked.{\r}

1518
01:45:36,116 --> 01:45:37,276
- 喂 - 比利，你在哪？

我們到處找你 找到內鬼了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've been trying to reach you. We found the rat.{\r}

1520
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:42,211
現在我們要趕去幹掉他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, we're gonna take him out. Lookit:{\r}

1521
01:45:42,389 --> 01:45:44,983

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it?{\r}

1522
01:45:45,159 --> 01:45:46,592

1523
01:45:47,127 --> 01:45:48,355
- 什麼？ - 你被跟蹤了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What? - You were followed.{\r}

1524
01:45:48,529 --> 01:45:50,121
- 被誰？ - 卡斯特羅的手下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- By who? - By Costello's people.{\r}

1525
01:45:50,297 --> 01:45:51,730
- 不可能 - 有可能，他在警局裡有線人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Impossible. - One of the cops...{\r}

1526
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:54,629
快走,快走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he's got on the inside tipped him. Come on. Come on.{\r}

1527
01:45:55,603 --> 01:45:57,127
快走!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on!{\r}

1528
01:46:03,777 --> 01:46:06,245
這他媽怎麼回事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck is going on?{\r}

1529
01:46:07,348 --> 01:46:10,181
看來都是來跟昆南接頭的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking shit. Looks like Queenars meeting with all of them.{\r}

1530
01:46:11,085 --> 01:46:13,519
對，昆南就是內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, he must be our guy.{\r}

1531
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:16,986
我們得要救他出來 那些人可不是開玩笑的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sarge, we gotta get him out of here. Those guys aren't fucking around.{\r}

1532
01:46:21,929 --> 01:46:24,762
太遲了，快回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ah, Christ, it's too late. Let's go back up.{\r}

1533
01:46:28,836 --> 01:46:30,633
- 媽的! - 你快走!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Shit! - You got to get out of here!{\r}

1534
01:46:30,804 --> 01:46:32,635
- 走消防梯 - 你怎麼辦？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Take the fire escape. - What about you?{\r}

1535
01:46:32,806 --> 01:46:35,832
我沒事的,要是你被抓到了 我就保護不了你了，快走!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll be fine. But if you get made I can't protect you. Now, go!{\r}

1536
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:56,020
- 能借個火嗎？ - 人呢?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- One of you mugs got a light? - Where's your boy?{\r}

1537
01:46:56,196 --> 01:46:59,222
- 在聖母大學讀法律 - 你的臥底在哪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He's studying law at Notre Dame. - Where's your fucking boy?{\r}

1538
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,493
- 嘿,嘿! - 媽的!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Hey! Hey! - Goddamn motherfucker!{\r}

1539
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:03,694
- 我殺了你! - 他媽的，你的臥底在哪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fucking kill you! - Where's your fucking boy?{\r}

1540
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:23,012
那他媽是什麼東西? 你看到了嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck was that? Did you fucking see that?{\r}

1541
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,386
警官，有東西從樓頂掉下來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sarge, something just came off the building.{\r}

1542
01:47:30,197 --> 01:47:32,256
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck?{\r}

1543
01:47:35,335 --> 01:47:36,324
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck.{\r}

1544
01:47:36,503 --> 01:47:38,403
什麼叫從樓頂掉下來？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you mean, off the building?{\r}

1545
01:47:38,572 --> 01:47:41,268
- 有東西從樓頂掉下來 - 是屍體，那是屍體
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Something came off the fucking roof. - It's a fucking body.{\r}

1546
01:47:49,983 --> 01:47:51,883
我們的視線被阻 你想叫我們下車去確定一下嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We can't get a visual. Want us to get out?{\r}

1547
01:47:52,052 --> 01:47:54,816
我們的下車才看得見
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We gotta get on foot if you want me to get up on this thing.{\r}

1548
01:47:55,422 --> 01:47:56,912
- 你他媽去哪了？ - 出什麼事了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Where were you? - What happened?{\r}

1549
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:58,888
你他媽遲到了，快上車!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're fucking late! Get in the van!{\r}

1550
01:47:59,059 --> 01:48:00,424
你說有東西墜樓是什麼意思？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you mean, off the roof?{\r}

1551
01:48:00,594 --> 01:48:02,255
這他媽怎麼回事？我趕來找你們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's going on? I came to meet you.{\r}

1552
01:48:02,429 --> 01:48:03,953
- 媽的... - 快上車!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What the fuck...? - Get in the van!{\r}

1553
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:07,066
警官，有4名帶槍男子出來 要不要我們行動？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got four armed men right out front. You want us to pursue?{\r}

1554
01:48:07,234 --> 01:48:09,293
不要行動，呆在車裡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.{\r}

1555
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:11,597
- 靠! 不准行動！ - 我需要知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fuck. No fucking pursuit. - I need information.{\r}

1556
01:48:11,772 --> 01:48:13,137
什麼東西從樓頂掉下來?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What came off the roof?{\r}

1557
01:48:13,307 --> 01:48:14,797
- 不追 - 真的他媽的扯淡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- No pursuit. - That's bullshit.{\r}

1558
01:48:14,975 --> 01:48:16,738
去他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck this.{\r}

1559
01:48:24,818 --> 01:48:26,445
快進車裡來!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fitzy! Get in the van!{\r}

1560
01:48:27,955 --> 01:48:30,890
上車!走，快走!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!{\r}

1561
01:48:31,058 --> 01:48:32,685
我抓到他了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right. I got him.{\r}

1562
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:41,328
32X向總部報告 我們被開槍射擊！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}32X to CP. We're being fired upon!{\r}

1563
01:48:41,502 --> 01:48:44,903
警員中槍，需要急救
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}An officer is down. I repeat, an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!{\r}

1564
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:47,097
快派支援...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Send some back...{\r}

1565
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:07,621
你知道為什麼昆南要去那棟樓？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So do you know why Queenan went into that building?{\r}

1566
01:49:07,795 --> 01:49:09,626
- 不知道 - 我有更好的問題問你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- No. - Well, a better question...{\r}

1567
01:49:09,797 --> 01:49:11,958
為什麼你的人跟蹤他？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...is why the fuck were your guys following him?{\r}

1568
01:49:12,132 --> 01:49:14,862
我讓內部調查組的人跟蹤昆南的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I told Internal Investigations to follow Captain Queenan.{\r}

1569
01:49:15,035 --> 01:49:17,435
- 為什麼？ - 那是內部調查組的事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Why? - That's Internal Investigations' business.{\r}

1570
01:49:18,338 --> 01:49:19,999
狗娘養的!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking piece of shit!{\r}

1571
01:49:20,174 --> 01:49:21,664
- 算了 - 嘿!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- All right. - Hey, hey!{\r}

1572
01:49:21,842 --> 01:49:23,207
- 你這個混蛋! - 放開他!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Fucking bitch! - Let him go!{\r}

1573
01:49:23,377 --> 01:49:26,540
混蛋!我不用向任何人解釋!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain anything to anybody!{\r}

1574
01:49:26,713 --> 01:49:28,874
我可以調查任何人，想查誰就查誰
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can fucking investigate anybody I want to!{\r}

1575
01:49:29,049 --> 01:49:31,279
- 來啊! - 我才在乎你怎麼想!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Come on! - I don't give a fuck what you think!{\r}

1576
01:49:31,451 --> 01:49:34,852
我有理由相信 昆南是被他自己的臥底殺害的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I got reason to believe that Queenan got killed by his fucking undercover.{\r}

1577
01:49:35,022 --> 01:49:36,114
撒謊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's a fucking lie.{\r}

1578
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,851
他的電腦裡保存著很多加密檔案 昆南隊長的也是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He has fucking information in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.{\r}

1579
01:49:40,027 --> 01:49:41,619
我要那些檔案
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need access to those files.{\r}

1580
01:49:41,795 --> 01:49:44,821
我忘記密碼了 有種你和我去車庫，在那我就告訴你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I forgot the password but if you come with me I'll give it to you.{\r}

1581
01:49:44,998 --> 01:49:47,125
- 撒謊 - 你再說一次!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- That's a fucking lie. - Nobody calls me a liar!{\r}

1582
01:49:47,301 --> 01:49:50,099
閉嘴!讓技術人員把那些檔案解密
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shut up! Work with the tech guys to unlock those files.{\r}

1583
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:53,137
- 你暫時離職 - 你說讓我什麼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Dignam, take a leave of absence. - Take a leave of what?{\r}

1584
01:49:53,307 --> 01:49:56,242
昆南死了，現在我是你的頭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.{\r}

1585
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:58,776
我不管，我寧願辭職
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't care. I'd rather hand in my papers first.{\r}

1586
01:49:58,946 --> 01:50:02,347
外面多得是酒吧服務生 給你兩周帶薪假
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}World needs plenty of bartenders. Two weeks with pay.{\r}

1587
01:50:02,516 --> 01:50:03,983
好極了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good.{\r}

1588
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:07,411
- 你這混蛋 - 去死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Piece of shit. - Fuck off.{\r}

1589
01:50:09,356 --> 01:50:11,187
- 我需要密碼 - 不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I need those codes. - No.{\r}

1590
01:50:11,358 --> 01:50:13,485
你想要密碼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You want those codes.{\r}

1591
01:50:16,597 --> 01:50:18,326
你他媽跑哪去了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So where the fuck were you?{\r}

1592
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,560
老闆讓我回家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, boss told me to go home.{\r}

1593
01:50:22,736 --> 01:50:26,934
算了，他可能這麼說了 不過你根本不在家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. But you werert at fucking home.{\r}

1594
01:50:27,107 --> 01:50:28,574
你去哪了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So where the fuck were you?{\r}

1595
01:50:29,176 --> 01:50:32,077
我在一家食品店，那裡沒信號
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was at the grocery store with no signal, all right?{\r}

1596
01:50:32,246 --> 01:50:34,237
有信號的時候，我才接到電話
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I got the signal, I got the call.{\r}

1597
01:50:34,414 --> 01:50:37,440
你想怎麼樣？我不是去了嗎?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck do you want from me? Was I there or was I not there?{\r}

1598
01:50:37,618 --> 01:50:39,677
比利，比利
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Billy. Billy.{\r}

1599
01:50:46,059 --> 01:50:47,583
怎麼了?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1600
01:50:49,796 --> 01:50:51,787
恩?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1601
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:54,427
知道我今天想什麼嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know what I thought today?{\r}

1602
01:50:56,236 --> 01:50:57,931
什麼?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's that?{\r}

1603
01:50:58,939 --> 01:51:02,397
今天沒出現的人,就是內鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who didn't show up today is the rat.{\r}

1604
01:51:05,879 --> 01:51:07,244
是嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

1605
01:51:08,282 --> 01:51:12,082
- 所以呢? - 你從來沒有遲到過
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- So? - And you never been late in your life.{\r}

1606
01:51:13,987 --> 01:51:16,217
我打給你的時候...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I called you...{\r}

1607
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,620
我犯了個錯誤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I made a mistake.{\r}

1608
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:22,592
我給你的地址是錯的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I gave you the wrong address...{\r}

1609
01:51:22,763 --> 01:51:26,597
但你卻在正確的地址出現了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but you showed up at the right one...{\r}

1610
01:51:27,067 --> 01:51:28,967
是不是？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...didn't you?{\r}

1611
01:51:30,237 --> 01:51:32,797
告訴我為什麼這事我誰都沒告訴?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?{\r}

1612
01:51:34,074 --> 01:51:35,405
告訴我為什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me why.{\r}

1613
01:51:58,298 --> 01:52:01,699
那警察是條硬漢 我們對他做的有點過分了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop.{\r}

1614
01:52:01,868 --> 01:52:03,665
他死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's dead.{\r}

1615
01:52:03,837 --> 01:52:05,464
我回家去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm going home.{\r}

1616
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:08,437
- 你的人不該那麼做 - 我們倆總要死一個
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Your guys should not have done that. - One of us had to die.{\r}

1617
01:52:08,608 --> 01:52:10,633
所以自然是他先死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}With me it tends to be the other guy.{\r}

1618
01:52:10,811 --> 01:52:12,278
現在昆南死了，我無從下手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But Queenan. Now I got no access.{\r}

1619
01:52:12,446 --> 01:52:15,643
你殺了那個知道所有信息的人 現在迪克曼也走了，別再提他了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You killed the guy who had the info. Dignam's gone. Forget about him.{\r}

1620
01:52:15,816 --> 01:52:18,478
- 他辭職了 - 我他媽才不在乎迪克曼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He resigned. - I don't give a fuck about Dignam.{\r}

1621
01:52:18,652 --> 01:52:20,119
他交了辭呈，弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He put in his papers, Frank.{\r}

1622
01:52:20,287 --> 01:52:24,348
- 他走了，我不知道他去哪了 - 迪克曼好對付，科林
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- He left. I don't know where he is. - Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.{\r}

1623
01:52:24,524 --> 01:52:25,957
那傢伙一心想抓住我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That Irish pissant...{\r}

1624
01:52:26,126 --> 01:52:29,789
稍微放出點消息，他就會找上門來
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he's so hot for me, we give him a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.{\r}

1625
01:52:29,963 --> 01:52:32,022
把他引出來吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's give him a whiff.{\r}

1626
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:35,862
- 我會的 - 別擔心，我會處理的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- I will. - Don't worry. I'll take care of it.{\r}

1627
01:52:37,537 --> 01:52:39,198
親愛的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sweetheart.{\r}

1628
01:52:39,373 --> 01:52:41,568
你讓我興奮起來了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're giving me a hard-on.{\r}

1629
01:52:42,175 --> 01:52:43,574
你確定是因為我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you sure it's me?{\r}

1630
01:52:44,077 --> 01:52:47,342
還是因為你剛才的電話？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not all that talk about whiffing and crawling up asses?{\r}

1631
01:52:47,814 --> 01:52:49,805
你他媽的說話小心點
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Watch your fucking mouth.{\r}

1632
01:52:49,983 --> 01:52:52,417
不，是你小心點
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No. You watch it.{\r}

1633
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,418

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I tried to call you a few times.{\r}

1635
01:53:09,403 --> 01:53:11,166
我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know.{\r}

1636
01:53:37,564 --> 01:53:41,466
我不能當你朋友
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Listen, I can't be a friend to you.{\r}

1637
01:53:46,606 --> 01:53:48,506

1645

我需要和迪克曼核實一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it.{\r}

1649
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,941

1653
01:56:48,054 --> 01:56:50,955

1659
01:57:40,373 --> 01:57:42,864

1664
01:57:54,187 --> 01:57:57,645
我他媽花了一整夜把這混蛋弄到那去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I spent all fucking night dragging the poor bastard in there.{\r}

1665
01:57:57,824 --> 01:57:59,758
你說他們怎麼這麼快就找到了？

1666
01:57:59,926 --> 01:58:02,554
就因為有人在3尺爛泥潭溜狗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Somebody walking a fucking dog in three feet of mud?{\r}

1667
01:58:02,729 --> 01:58:04,890

1668
01:58:05,065 --> 01:58:07,192

1669
01:58:07,367 --> 01:58:09,597

1670
01:58:09,969 --> 01:58:11,266

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm embarrassed.{\r}

1671
01:58:11,938 --> 01:58:14,600
我還是不信他是個警察 我不信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I still don't believe he was a cop. I don't believe it.{\r}

1672
01:58:14,774 --> 01:58:19,302
警察們說他是警察...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The cops are saying he's a cop...{\r}

1673
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:21,874
好讓我認為他是警察
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...so I won't look for the cop.{\r}

1674
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:24,776
你聽好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you soft, Fitz?{\r}

1675
01:58:24,951 --> 01:58:29,911
我讓你把屍體扔進沼澤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I tell you to dump a body in the marsh...{\r}

1676
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:33,025
那你就乖乖的把屍體扔進沼澤
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you dump him in the marsh.{\r}

1677
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:37,359
而不是扔到一個每週四都會有人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday...{\r}

1678
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:39,623
固定去那做口交的地方！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to get a fucking blowjob!{\r}

1679
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,561
別笑了!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't laugh!{\r}

1680
01:58:43,403 --> 01:58:46,304
這他媽不是電視真人秀！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This ain't reality TV!{\r}

1681
01:58:50,243 --> 01:58:52,006
出發吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Proceed.{\r}

1682
01:59:14,467 --> 01:59:15,934
- 怎麼了? - 喂
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What? - Yeah.{\r}

1683
01:59:16,102 --> 01:59:18,866
有人跟蹤你 兩部車，跟著你並沒有刻意躲避
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle.{\r}

1684
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:22,599
從現在開始，他們不會再遮遮掩掩地了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're not gonna be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to say.{\r}

1685
01:59:22,776 --> 01:59:23,902
那就把他們甩掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So get rid of them.{\r}

1686
01:59:24,077 --> 01:59:27,171
你沒必要親自去，弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no need for you to go yourself, Frank.{\r}

1687
01:59:27,347 --> 01:59:29,577
把他們給我甩掉!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get rid of the fucking tail!{\r}

1688
01:59:34,521 --> 01:59:36,079
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

1689
01:59:42,395 --> 01:59:45,592
可惡的內鬼 我發誓要對付他們
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking rats. It's wearing me thin.{\r}

1690
01:59:45,765 --> 01:59:48,563
弗朗西斯，這個國家就是這樣
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.{\r}

1691
02:00:04,884 --> 02:00:08,217
停下，停下 叫他們停下來，不用再監視了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello. There's no need to surveil him.{\r}

1692
02:00:08,388 --> 02:00:10,754
- 你說什麼呢？ - 我聽臥底說卡斯特羅
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- What are you saying? - I got it from an undercover.{\r}

1693
02:00:10,924 --> 02:00:13,586
已經知道自己被跟蹤了 那我們就交給臥底好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He knows he's being followed. So let the UC take him in.{\r}

1694
02:00:13,793 --> 02:00:15,158
- 什麼臥底？ - 昆南的那個臥底
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Undercover? - Queenars guy.{\r}

1695
02:00:15,328 --> 02:00:17,990
他得知昆南的死訊後給我打了電話 他現在和我聯繫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He called when he found out Queenan died. I'm running him.{\r}

1696
02:00:18,164 --> 02:00:21,099
- 和你？你得把他交給我 - 我可以告訴你卡斯特羅要去哪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You give him to me. - No, I can give you Costello's destination.{\r}

1697
02:00:21,301 --> 02:00:23,769
- 你知道他要去哪？ - 是的，我還知道他要做什麼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You know where he's going? - Yes. And what he's doing.{\r}

1698
02:00:23,937 --> 02:00:26,098
停止跟蹤，叫大家隨時待命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get rid of the tail, get Special Ops on standby.{\r}

1699
02:00:26,272 --> 02:00:28,706
- 我們今晚就跟這個混蛋做個了結 - 我們行動吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- We'll take this prick tonight. - Let's go. Now.{\r}

1700
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:31,867
所有人員撤回，所有人員撤回
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All units fall back. All units fall back.{\r}

1701
02:00:47,418 --> 02:00:50,587
<i>設菲爾德</i>
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

1702
02:00:52,232 --> 02:00:54,291
好了，在他設菲爾德的私人倉庫裡
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's the warehouse he owns over on Sheffield.{\r}

1703
02:00:54,467 --> 02:00:57,061
那一定有集裝箱或是卡車什麼的 走,走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's gotta have a container or a truck or something there. Go.{\r}

1704
02:01:21,361 --> 02:01:22,885
裝車
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Load it.{\r}

1705
02:01:30,904 --> 02:01:33,202
弗蘭克，你怎麼知道沒人跟蹤我們？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank, how do you know you don't have a tail, huh?{\r}

1706
02:01:34,474 --> 02:01:36,442
你他媽剛才在車裡沒聽到嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Were you not in the fucking car?{\r}

1707
02:01:36,609 --> 02:01:39,669
萬一他們換了別的車跟蹤我們呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, what if they took one off and they put another one on?{\r}

1708
02:01:42,882 --> 02:01:44,679
裝車
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Load.{\r}

1709
02:01:52,258 --> 02:01:54,089
快來!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go, go!{\r}

1710
02:01:56,529 --> 02:01:58,087
你等什麼呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, what are you waiting for?{\r}

1711
02:02:00,166 --> 02:02:02,293
弗蘭克讓我去查一下後面，你先走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank wants me to check the back. You go ahead.{\r}

1712
02:02:02,468 --> 02:02:05,926
- 看著你身後 - 我們走!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Watch your fucking back. - Move out! Go on!{\r}

1713
02:02:14,948 --> 02:02:17,382
媽的

1714
02:02:23,389 --> 02:02:25,949
混蛋!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Motherfucking shit!{\r}

1715
02:02:29,395 --> 02:02:31,056
操....
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Motherfucking...!{\r}

1716
02:02:34,467 --> 02:02:36,731
快增援!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Back the fuck up!{\r}

1717
02:02:36,903 --> 02:02:38,996
我他媽的中彈了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They fucking shot me.{\r}

1718
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:43,835
蹲低!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get down!{\r}

1719
02:02:46,846 --> 02:02:48,404

1720
02:03:07,133 --> 02:03:08,600
媽的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck it.{\r}

1721
02:03:48,041 --> 02:03:51,807
怎麼回事?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How the fuck did this happen?{\r}

1722
02:03:53,212 --> 02:03:55,806
你是聯邦調查局線人?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're an FBI informant?{\r}

1723
02:03:55,982 --> 02:03:58,177
你他媽耍我嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you fucking kidding me?{\r}

1724
02:03:59,652 --> 02:04:01,347
成熟點吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Grow up.{\r}

1725
02:04:02,055 --> 02:04:04,990
我當然要跟聯邦調查局有聯繫
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course I talk to the FBI.{\r}

1726
02:04:05,158 --> 02:04:06,648
他們知道我的身份嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do they know who I am?{\r}

1727
02:04:08,594 --> 02:04:12,963
我從未出賣過任何人 除非那人本來就要被抓了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I never gave up anybody who wasrt going down anyway.{\r}

1728
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,434
誰都不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nobody knows nothing.{\r}

1729
02:04:18,037 --> 02:04:19,527
弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank.{\r}

1730
02:04:19,839 --> 02:04:22,740
弗蘭克,弗蘭克
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank. Frank.{\r}

1731
02:04:22,909 --> 02:04:24,900
他們知道了我的事嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do they know about me?{\r}

1732
02:04:26,612 --> 02:04:29,137
只有我知道你的事，科林
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know about you, Collie.{\r}

1733
02:04:29,315 --> 02:04:32,148
你知道我永遠不會出賣你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know I'd never give you up.{\r}

1734
02:04:32,885 --> 02:04:35,649

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- You're like a... - What? Like a son?{\r}

1735
02:04:36,556 --> 02:04:39,923
就是這麼回事嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To you? Is that what this is about?{\r}

1736
02:04:40,893 --> 02:04:45,227
殺人，胡搞了一輩子 最後連個兒子都沒有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All that murdering and fucking, and no sons.{\r}

1737
02:05:07,253 --> 02:05:09,687
該死的，混蛋!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fucking rat prick!{\r}

1738
02:05:31,277 --> 02:05:32,869
弗蘭克?

1740
02:05:36,282 --> 02:05:37,510
你是誰？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who's this?{\r}

1741
02:05:39,418 --> 02:05:41,045
格溫?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gwen?{\r}

1742
02:05:42,188 --> 02:05:44,281
弗蘭克在哪兒？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where the hell's Frank?{\r}

1743
02:05:45,358 --> 02:05:47,155
弗蘭克中槍了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Frank got shot.{\r}

1744
02:05:49,996 --> 02:05:52,396
格溫，弗蘭剋死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Gwen, we lost Frank.{\r}

1745
02:06:00,773 --> 02:06:02,400
我打死他了!

1746
02:06:02,575 --> 02:06:05,009

恭喜，幹的好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hey, good job, sarge.{\r}

1748
02:06:12,418 --> 02:06:13,976
不，只是...

1751
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:27,861
他在那等你很久了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's been waiting here a long time for you.{\r}

1752
02:06:28,067 --> 02:06:30,501
你怎麼找到他的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How'd you get him without the files?{\r}

1753
02:06:30,670 --> 02:06:33,468
用昆南的手機聯繫上他的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Caller ID on Queenars phone.{\r}

1754
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,805
你認識他嗎？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know that guy?{\r}

1755
02:06:35,975 --> 02:06:38,842
是，我們在警校是同學
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah. We were classmates in the academy together.{\r}

1756
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:47,946
很高興見到你，警官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Good to see you, trooper.{\r}

1757
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,782

1759
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:55,823
你做臥底多久了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, how long were you undercover?{\r}

1760
02:06:55,995 --> 02:06:57,895
很久，很久了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Long time.{\r}

1761
02:06:58,064 --> 02:06:59,895

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}- Long fucking time. - Yeah. Yeah.{\r}

1762
02:07:00,299 --> 02:07:05,236

{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Well, I can't even tell you the debt...{\r}

1763
02:07:08,074 --> 02:07:11,407
我會推薦你榮譽獎章的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I just want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit.{\r}

1764

1765
02:07:14,213 --> 02:07:16,579
聽上去很誘人啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's kind of like a gold star around here, huh?{\r}

1766
