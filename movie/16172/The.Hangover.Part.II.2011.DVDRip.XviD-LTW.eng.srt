<i>(voice-mail) Hi, you've reached the
office of Dr. Stuart Price.</i>

<i>(voice-mail) Hi! This is Dr. Stu Price.
I'm getting married.</i>

10
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,485

country for 2 weeks.</i>

11
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,612

15
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:28,706
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

16
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:32,585
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

17
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:35,004
The eyes of a coward.

18

<i>(speaking in Thai again)</i>

19
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:43,470
Excuse me!

20
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,598
- Bill!
- Tracy!

21
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:51,269
- I'm sorry!
- Where the hell are you?

22
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,647
It happened again!

23
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,358
Don't say that, please!

24
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,776
No this time we really fucked up.

25
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:02,487
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

26
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,615
So much Trace, I don't even know
where to begin.

27
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,076
<i>Oh god! How bad?</i>

28
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:12,622
- Like, no wedding bad?
- Yeah...

29
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:17,209
a little worse than that.

30
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:22,631
THE HANGOVER PART II

31
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,216
ONE WEEK EARLIER

32
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:58,218
Uh, huh.

33
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:02,681
- You really need to floss more.
- Fuck that! That's why I come here.

34
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:06,518
- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

35
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:09,354
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

36
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:12,023
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Ah, you don't actually.

37
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,608
Come on! Just one hit!

38
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:18,278
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

39
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:22,491
Yeah, actually. You're getting married
in Thailand.

40
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:26,119
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

41
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:30,123
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So
now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

42
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:32,083
Plus, takes five days to get there.

43
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,628
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful
when you get there.

44
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:38,005
- Whatever, it's a hassle!
- It is kinda far.

45
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:40,424
Lauren's been there a week and she's
still jet lagged.

46
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:43,093
But it's where her parents are from and
it means a lot to them.

47
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:46,346
Who gives a shit about her parents!
Her dad hates you!

48
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,974
He doesn't hate me! He's just never
spoken to me...

49
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,517
...I think it's a cultural thing.

50
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,353
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like
you did the last time. It's so much easier.

51
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:57,147
Why can't you just be excited for me?

52
00:04:57,147 --> 00:05:01,818
This is my wedding!

53
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:08,658
- You're really happy, huh?
- I really am.

54
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:12,161
Alright...

55
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,789
...I'm happy too.

56
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:19,459
- Thank you!
- Gonna be fun.

57
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,131
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

58
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:42,272
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right?
- Fuck you, man!

59
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:47,193
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

60
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:50,029
- Oh my god, I just realized.
- What?

61
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,032
- I forgot to renew my passport!
- Oh no...

62
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:57,036
Good thing I did it last week. It's in
the kitchen drawer.

63
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:00,247
- You're the best!
- Hey! We're a team!

64
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:04,918
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

65
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,170
Thank you!

66
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,382
- So I know you're not gonna get mad.
- Mad? What, mad at what?

67
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,802
Alan found out that we're going to
Thailand for Stu's wedding.

68
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:18,347
- So?
- So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

69
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:21,266
No. Your family is like his family.

70
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:24,352
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

71
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:26,354
- And that weekend.
- Wait a second...

72
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:30,650
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

73
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,235
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

74
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:37,740
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

75
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,493
For me...

76
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:43,870
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

77
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,748
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

78
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:50,626
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

79
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,421
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

80
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,548
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

81
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,549
I consider Alan to be insane.

82
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:00,928
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to
pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

83
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,889
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze
the old man to cover the bachelor party.

84
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,057
- That's good.
- I'm glad you brought that up.

85
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:10,436
- Because... this is the bachelor party!
- What?

86
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,522
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

87
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:18,152
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a
lap dance from the waitress...

88
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:23,198
That's bullshit! You can't just skip
out of a bachelor party, Stu.

89
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:26,951
You see that? That's orange juice with
a napkin on top.

90
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:29,620
Do you know why? So nobody roofies me.

91
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,415
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party?

92
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:37,086
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting?
- No, I don't.

93
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:41,673
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken
psyche back together.

94
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:46,886
And you know what the glue is? Lauren!
I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

95
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,807
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

96
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,391
Stu, think about it!

97
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:55,436
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later
you met your true soul mate.

98
00:07:55,436 --> 00:08:00,148
You take Vegas out of that equation, you
would have married a cunt.

99
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,567
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's
a bachelor party.

100
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,069
Drink up everybody.

101
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,988
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot
we're at a fuckin IHOP!

102
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:10,074
Well it's my decision and it's final, so...
how bout a toast?

103
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,535
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

104
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,037
- C'mon Phil, where you going?
- Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

105
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,082
He's getting married in Thailand! That's
great for him, but what about us?

106
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:22,502
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

107
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,798
Shame on you!

108
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,550
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you
no matter what.

109
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,802
Thank you.

110
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:35,431
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

111
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,350
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

112
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,812
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever
since he got word of the wedding.

113
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,104
- I'm sure he has.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:46,191
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

115
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,735
- Well that's tough.
- Yeah.

116
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:52,446
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

117
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,699
He really needs this.

118
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,493
What?

119
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:01,538
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors!
Go in slowly.

120
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:06,209
Give him a chance to acclimate.

121
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:11,005
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

122
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:14,425
Hey, bud!

123
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:19,096
- You guys wanna come in?
- Sure. Absolutely.

124
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:23,058
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:27,729
- Hey, Stu!
- Ok. See you on the court in half...

126
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:32,358
- Pretty cool room, Alan!
- Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

127
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:36,028
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed
to delete these!

128
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,863
You made a promise!

129
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:39,323
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

130
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:43,994
What the hell? I'm not cool with this
at all. You can't have these.

131
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,287
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

132
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:50,917
- A total violation of trust!
- Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

133
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,461
<i>I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.</i>

134
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,380
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool.
- Wait a second!

135
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,758
- Al, is that Mr. Chow?
- Yeah. We still keep in touch.

136
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:00,801
Stu!

137
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,303
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

138
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,180
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

139
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,140
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

140
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,058
He's actually quite charming.

141
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,186
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys!

142
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:13,896
- Hi, Linda!
- Hi, Dougie!

143
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:16,315
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I
didn't get that memo.

144
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,318
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

145
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,695
Would a cupcake kill you?

146
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:25,740
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

147
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,618
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

148
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:32,496
- Well only if you're not busy.
- Stu!

149
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,874
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

150
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:38,877
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

151
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:43,548
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

152
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,430
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

153
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:55,476
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course!

154
00:10:55,476 --> 00:11:00,022
Then it will be fun.

155
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,237
What the fuck are you doing, man?

156
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:10,907
It's my immunizations. It's the last day
I can do it.

157
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,242
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

158
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,870
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

159
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,540
Stu, look at this!
I bought this cause I thought of you!

160
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,408
- Hey, there he is!
- Hey, Stu!

161
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:01,745
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya?
- Hey Stu.

162
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:04,914
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu?
- This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

163
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:07,876
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is
Phil, Alan and Doug.

164
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,127
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

165
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,379
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

166
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,841
- He's 17. Kind of a genius.
- Actually, I'm 16.

167
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:19,136
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take
the entrance exams early.

168
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,430
Because you're a genius.

169
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,432
- So what are you, a doctor?
- No, not yet. I'm premed.

170
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:27,852
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:31,147
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.
- Alan.

172
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:33,024
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

173
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:37,528
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something
for the plane. You guys want anything?

174
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:40,739
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- I would actually love a small water.

175
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,159
Cool.

176
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,995
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

177
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:51,082
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to
see us off or what. How does this work?

178
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:54,752
- How does what work?
- Is that person coming to the wedding?

179
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:59,423
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is
coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

180
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,970
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

181
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:11,684
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

182
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,855
- Hey. Mind if I sit?
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

183
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,859
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon.
- It's no problem. I'll find...

184
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:24,195
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here!
- Careful, that's a Louis...

185
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:28,825
That is a Louis Vuitton!

186
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:40,085
- That's a nice neck roll!
- Thanks! You can use it if you want.

187
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:46,132
Ok.

188
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:50,928
<i>The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing</i>

189
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:54,403
Baby!

190
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,875
This is so absolutely beautiful!
Thank you much!

191
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,209
Of course.

192
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,839
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited.
Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

193
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:19,384
You have to realize that in my country we
don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

194
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,053
Dad...

195
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,095
Ok.

196
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:26,808
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

197
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:28,935
Ouch!

198
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,603
I'm so sorry...

199
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:33,272
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your
brother, isn't he?

200
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:37,609
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's
always been that way.

201
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:40,946
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

202
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:44,532
You can just fax it over to me. I'll
pick it up at the concierge.

203
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,910
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

204
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,954
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

205
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:54,166
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

206
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,126
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

207
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:59,004
I've been meaning to ask someone. I
notice this is a fishing village.

208
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,964
Is there a Long John Silver's on
the island?

209
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:03,925
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

210
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:07,720
But, we are actually serving some
great fresh seafood.

211
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,223
- Better than Long John's?
- Yes.

212
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:14,977
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.
- You too. Ok.

213
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,055
All right!

214
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,268
Thank you, Teddy!

215
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,312
The hands of a brilliant musician!

216
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,858
And one day, a great surgeon.

217
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,068
I admit it...

218
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:13,739
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

219
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:18,702
He seemed unattractive. He lacked
intelligence and imagination.

220
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,000
He was missing the spark you look for
in a man.

221
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,795
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

222
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:33,341
It reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chai Yo.

223
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:38,011
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning
the sailboat and lives in a group home.

224
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:44,559
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

225
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,230
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

226
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:52,900
What is "khao"?

227
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,779
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

228
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,072
It has no taste.

229
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:03,702
We feed it to small baby and uh, very
old people.

230
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:07,372
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

231
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:12,084
The world needs "khao", just as the
world needs people like Stu.

232
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:19,550
To my sweet daughter and Stu!
Congratulations!

233
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,221
Cheers!

234
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:29,142
And now I believe that Teddy has
something to say.

235
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:34,021
Sit down! I got this.
Sit down, boy!

236
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,982
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

237
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:41,695
I like the comparison between
Stu and rice.

238
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:47,033
I've also prepared a few words.

239
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,786
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

240
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:53,372
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

241
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,875
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

242
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:59,628
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear
and rice.

243
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:04,299
Each year approximately 13,000 people are
killed in car accidents in Thailand.

244
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,468
- The climate in Thailand...
- Alan!

245
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:12,181
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy.
- Okay. Sorry!

246
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,978
None of you know Stu like I do.

247
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:22,649
Not you... not you... not you...

248
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:28,196
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

249
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,448
No one!

250
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:34,035
I can't even tell you what we've been
through cause we made a pact.

251
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:36,370
More important than blood.

252
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,999
What I can tell you is this. This is
not Stu's first marriage.

253
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,669
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago.

254
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,590
Sit down...

255
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,219
- Enough! He'll get over it!
- Okay. Thanks, Phil!

256
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,022
In your face!

257
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,901
Well that was exactly as painful as I
expected it to be.

258
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,945
Sorry...

259
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,240
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?
- HaHa. Very funny!

260
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,700
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

261
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,079
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's
supposed to hate you.

262
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,372
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

263
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:29,043
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're
just gonna go upstairs and crash.

264
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,255
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's
gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

265
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:36,091
That sounds fun!

266
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,093
- Nyah... I'm good.
- He's tired!

267
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:41,179
Stu, one drink with your friends who
came all this way.

268
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,266
- I just wanna hang out with you!
- Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

269
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:48,436
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to
have any fun.

270
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:50,938
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

271
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:53,816
- Alright. One drink!
- Perfect.

272
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,693
- See you later.
- Have fun!

273
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:58,737
- You have the key?
- Yep, got it right here!

274
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:03,366
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

275
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,245
My uncle Roger said that he once saw
an albino polar bear.

276
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:11,916
Really? Polar bears are white.
How would he know if it's an albino?

277
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:17,338
This one was black.

278
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:22,050
Did you ever think maybe it was
just a black bear?

279
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,553
Whatever...

280
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:29,724
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

281
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:34,270
- Sealed bottle!
- Thank you. Alright!

282
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,356
- I'm not really old enough to drink.
- Yeah, it's illegal.

283
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,816
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

284
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:43,945
Nobody's reporting anybody.
It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

285
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:45,405
Careful!

286
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:49,283
What is this? Instant marshmallows?
Nice touch!

287
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:53,287
- That was Alan's idea.
- Good thinking, Al!

288
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:57,875
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu!
This place is paradise.

289
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,126
Not bad, right?

290
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:03,672
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

291
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:07,175
- I mean, Lauren is an angel.
- Yeah, she really is amazing.

292
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,760
Wow, you guys are sweet.

293
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,472
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid
rack for an Asian.

294
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,725
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.
- That's ok.

295
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:18,852
That is just wildly inappropriate.

296
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:23,565
And yet... I'm really glad you're here.
All you guys. Even you Alan.

297
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:29,028
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

298
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:31,614
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy.
- Great!

299
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:36,243
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

300
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:40,080
Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

301
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,124
Come over here, Alan!

302
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:45,668
To Lauren and Stu!

303
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:49,297
- You did it, buddy.
- Sure did.

304
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:53,968
Cheers!

305
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:08,953
What the hell...

306
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:48,573
What?

307
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,136
Phil...

308
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,889
I think it happened again.

309
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,518
- Alan, what the fuck did you do?
- I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

310
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,188
Your hair is gone.

311
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:28,026
No, no... up.

312
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:37,993
Where the fuck are we?

313
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:48,086
Phil, I'm scared.

314
00:25:56,135 --> 00:26:00,806
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

315
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:12,024
- Oh, holy shit!
- Where are we?

316
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:18,113
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head.
- No your head!

317
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:22,951
- Is it bald?
- Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

318
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:26,621
- Why? Was it my teeth?
- Nope, it's not your teeth.

319
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:28,248
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

320
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:32,585
Can you see the bottom?

321
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:37,297
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

322
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:41,885
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

323
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:46,473
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

324
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:50,560
- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me?
- I didn't do anything!

325
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,271
Stu, he swore to god!

326
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:58,817
What happened?

327
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,530
Get it off of me!

328
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:07,158
- What the hell?
- It's a monkey.

329
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,661
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

330
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:15,416
Alan...

331
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:19,836
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

332
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:22,297
I got it!

333
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:25,425
- Doug, where the hell are you?
- I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

334
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:29,554
- You guys coming down or what?
- Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

335
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:33,599
- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.
- Why aren't we at the resort.

336
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,142
What's going on? Where are you guys?

337
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:38,937
I do not know, man! We woke up
in some shit hole room in some city.

338
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:42,482
- Oh god. What city?
- I don't know, Doug!

339
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:45,235
Fuckin Asia-town.

340
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:49,864
<i>- I do not know, I told you.
- Where are we?</i>

341
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,870
- Hey Stu.
- What?

342
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,455
Check this out.

343
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:02,959
Ever seen anything like this?

344
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:12,009
- What is that?
- Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

345
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:14,470
I've tangled with those before.

346
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,099
I don't get it man. We each had one beer
last night, right? I mean you too!

347
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:22,936
- Yeah but I left early, remember?
- I don't remember shit!

348
00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:25,814
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came
down to get me.

349
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:29,817
- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys?
- Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

350
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:32,612
He wasn't in his room. They've been
looking for him all morning.

351
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:35,489
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

352
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:38,867
Fuck!

353
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:42,496
- I just found his finger!
- What?

354
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:47,250
- I just found his fucking finger, Doug!
- Phil, what is going on?

355
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:51,420
Alright. Alright, alright... this is
what we're gonna do.

356
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,548
You tell the girls that we woke up early and went
on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

357
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:58,677
- Right.
- Right, stay by the phone!

358
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:03,265
Shit!

359
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:06,935
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

360
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:09,354
What is that?

361
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:11,898
We don't know.

362
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:16,443
- Is it a worm?
- It's a mushroom.

363
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,113
Yeah, shiitake.

364
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:23,116
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

365
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:27,620
- He can't understand you.
- He just did.

366
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,915
- Why is he pulling on it?
- He's probably hungry.

367
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:33,292
Wait a second. Is that...

368
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:37,921
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone.

369
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,464
Chow?

370
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:42,342
You're fucking crazy.

371
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:47,013
It's so fucking light in here!
Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

372
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:52,768
- It's great to see you, Leslie!
- Nice to see you too my little popo.

373
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,812
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

374
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:58,357
Alan called me a few days ago and
invited me to the wedding.

375
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:00,567
- Excuse me?
- What, he's my plus one.

376
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,111
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

377
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:06,281
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok.
Chow, what happened?

378
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:10,910
You guys texted me, said you're fucked
up and looking to party.

379
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,751
I picked you up on my boat and I brought
you here to Bangkok.

380
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,379
But we had a sick night, bitches!

381
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:27,091
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

382
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,511
Holler, city of squalor.

383
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:35,140
- Do you know how I got this tattoo?
- Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

384
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:38,185
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

385
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:42,647
What's the monkey holding?

386
00:30:42,647 --> 00:30:46,651
- That's a finger!
- Stu, I got some bad news.

387
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:51,322
Teddy was with us last night.
That's his finger.

388
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:56,994
- Teddy's dead?
- Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

389
00:30:57,494 --> 00:31:01,206
- Well then where is he?
- Don't you remember anything?

390
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,459
- No!
- No, nothing, Chow.

391
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,503
Ok I explain it all, ok?

392
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:12,174
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight.
Come to papa.

393
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,012
That's a big...

394
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:24,519
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

395
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:36,447
Chow!

396
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:40,951
Hey Chow, you okay?

397
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:45,622
You gotta be kidding me.

398
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,421
Fuck, he's dead!

399
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:58,675
- Help!
- Stu!

400
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,845
- Help!
- Stu, shut up!

401
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:04,681
- Call an ambulance!
- Shut up! He's dead!

402
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:07,475
Look if someone comes and finds a dead
body and a pile of cocaine...

403
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:11,521
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking
lives in a Thai prison.

404
00:32:11,521 --> 00:32:15,441
Alan! Please don't cry!

405
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:20,028
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to
figure this out.

406
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:39,963
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

407
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,518
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

408
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,270
What the fuck is this place?

409
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,898
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its
population is 12 million people...

410
00:32:59,898 --> 00:33:04,653
Alan, will you help!

411
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:12,868
- The elevator!
- I'll get the button!

412
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:18,874
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?
- That monkey gets it!

413
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,834
- Come on!
- Fuck no!

414
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,795
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

415
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:28,466
- Oh fuck!
- Come on!

416
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,637
Here it is!

417
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:37,307
Feet first. I've done this before.

418
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:45,815
Careful!

419
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:06,334
- Stu!
- What?

420
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:10,963
- We still have to find Teddy!
- Oh god.

421
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:19,471
The roof!

422
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:24,100
Teddy!

423
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:35,236
- You guys see him?
- No!

424
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:45,829
He's not here.

425
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,500
I can't believe this is happening again.

426
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:55,421
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get
back there.

427
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:58,924
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk
with him, we're still partying.

428
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:03,553
- You gotta go get married!
- No! Not going back without Teddy!

429
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,391
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost,
he's injured.

430
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:13,020
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

431
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,983
Ok.

432
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,861
Alright.

433
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:23,780
- Alan, check your pockets!
- What?

434
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,574
You know the drill. C'mon there might
be clues.

435
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:31,078
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts.
- That's a good idea!

436
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:34,206
- I got nothing. Fuck!
- I got an text from Chow.

437
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:37,001
- What time?
- Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

438
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:41,129
- What's it say?
- "On my way, Niggahs"

439
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:45,800
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

440
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:50,847
We are so... fucked!

441
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:55,434
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

442
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:01,815
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're
too hot.

443
00:36:02,482 --> 00:36:05,235
Phil, I really think we should go to
the American Consulate.

444
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:08,613
For what? To report a dead body we shoved
into an ice machine?

445
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:11,782
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around
in circles? Cause that's real productive.

446
00:36:11,782 --> 00:36:14,285
You know I'm trying to figure this thing
out here and your attitude is not helping.

447
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:17,329
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we
don't have a plan.

448
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:19,581
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

449
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:22,250
-What, it's a bag of Fanta!
- Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

450
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,335
I don't know!

451
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,253
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

452
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,796
It is your fault!

453
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:29,173
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

454
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,259
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

455
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:34,762
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD.
They've got him. He's ok.

456
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:37,890
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

457
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,641
- What happened?
- He got arrested.

458
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,352
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

459
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:44,562
- Seriously?
- Yeah! He's ok though.

460
00:36:44,562 --> 00:36:48,274
They'll release him to you. No questions
asked. No one has to know.

461
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:52,945
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

462
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:55,823
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

463
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:58,325
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We
gotta get a cab.

464
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:02,996
- Ok!
- Alright!

465
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:07,208
- Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

466
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:11,087
- He has been treated.
- Sounds good.

467
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:15,090
We're good. They've processed him for
release.

468
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,551
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

469
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:21,304
Sixteen years old and spent a night in
jail. Can you imagine?

470
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:26,017
Haha! We love to party.

471
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:29,854
Here we go!

472
00:37:29,854 --> 00:37:32,565
- Wait who's this fuckin guy?
- Teddy Sisay.

473
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:35,568
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

474
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:40,155
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought
the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

475
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:44,075
Of course it is!
We have his ID's and everything!

476
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,995
These were in his pocket
when we made the arrest.

477
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:49,872
They were in his pocket?

478
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:54,418
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

479
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:56,128
Hello?

480
00:37:56,128 --> 00:38:00,757
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English,
Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

481
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:03,176
Let me ask you something.

482
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:07,847
Does he look like he works out at Bally
Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

483
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:12,643
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot
analyze everything.

484
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:18,857
- What do you expect us to do with this guy?
- Not my problem!

485
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:23,653
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

486
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:31,911
You know where our friend is, Teddy?
He's missing!

487
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:35,497
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless.
- He knows something!

488
00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:38,292
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

489
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:43,088
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll
act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

490
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:46,674
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

491
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:50,428
This is not for you, Alan!

492
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:55,057
- American teenager... in Asia.
- Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

493
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,436
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

494
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:03,023
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave
this fucking guy here.

495
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:06,860
Here's something. There are 500 thousand
monks living in Thailand.

496
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,614
It is not uncommon for some monks to take
a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

497
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,325
There you go.

498
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:18,620
- Anything else in that envelope?
- Nah, it's empty.

499
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,375
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White
Lion bar in Bangkok?

500
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:28,171
Worth a shot.

501
00:39:28,171 --> 00:39:31,174
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

502
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:35,844
That's what it says.

503
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:43,727
- Whoa! This is the White Lion!
- What the fuck happened here?

504
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:46,479
Holy shit!

505
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:50,608
<i>(yelling in Thai)</i>

506
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:55,237
- Let's...
- We should probably...

507
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:59,366
That's ok.

508
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:03,870
What the fuck is going on here?

509
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,499
- Whoa, guys. Check it out!
- Holy shit! Stu, look!

510
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:13,713
That's my face. Go, go go!
Nice work, Alan!

511
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:21,136
- Hello?
- Be with you in a minute!

512
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:26,307
- Excuse me.
- Oh, look who it is!

513
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:29,977
- So what do ya think?
- What, I'm sorry?

514
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:34,648
- The tattoo. You love it?
- Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

515
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,985
- No refunds. Get the fuck out!
- Wait a second!

516
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,653
Read the sign!

517
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:41,154
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

518
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:43,698
We don't want any refunds. We just have
a couple of questions.

519
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:45,742
We're trying to figure out what went
down last night.

520
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:50,413
What went down? Take a look at what you
did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

521
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:54,166
- We did that?
- You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

522
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:58,837
- Starting a full on fuckin riot?
- Sir, we don't remember anything.

523
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:07,345
Oh boy...

524
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:12,016
Check this out!

525
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:17,938
Oh shit!

526
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,943
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

527
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:29,741
There's Teddy! He was with us!

528
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,127
Jesus christ!

529
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,838
That's when the cops arrived and started
cracking skulls.

530
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,674
I took you guys and hid you in the
shop here.

531
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:51,969
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
You cried like a little bitch.

532
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:55,139
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's
got balls twice your size.

533
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:58,851
- Show him your balls, Nao!
- No, no, no. That's ok.

534
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,479
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

535
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,648
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

536
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:09,318
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

537
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,531
- Oh well. Then fuck it!
- What do you mean, fuck it?

538
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,117
Bangkok has him now and she'll never
let him go.

539
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:21,163
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you
wanted? You happy now?

540
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,582
You're wasting your time. These monks
take their vow shit seriously.

541
00:42:24,582 --> 00:42:29,253
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang
Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

542
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:34,341
Maybe somebody over there can get him
to talk.

543
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:40,013
- Ok, can we just go over this one
more time? You got the beer from...

544
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:43,934
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case.
- Right.

545
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:47,312
- But, who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

546
00:42:47,312 --> 00:42:49,689
And then you brought em out and
I  opened them.

547
00:42:49,689 --> 00:42:53,025
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine
so it's not the beer.

548
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:55,444
- So what the hell happened?
- I have no idea!

549
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:58,864
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a
Chinese boner.

550
00:42:58,864 --> 00:43:03,493
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

551
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:08,915
- That is so wrong!
- Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

552
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:22,802
When a monkey nibbles on a penis
it's funny in any language!

553
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:28,099
Keep doing it!

554
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:31,310
Alright, thank you!

555
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,981
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

556
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:48,910
Wow! So beautiful!

557
00:43:49,118 --> 00:43:52,788
What is this, a PF Chang's?

558
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:55,624
Ah, they're meditating.

559
00:43:55,624 --> 00:43:58,877
- Such a peaceful people!
- Yeah.

560
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:02,756
- Knock, knock! Hello!
- Alan! Show some respect!

561
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:06,759
- Don't get up guys.
- We brought one of your guys back.

562
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:09,554
He's really funny. He's really nice
and cool.

563
00:44:09,554 --> 00:44:14,183
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

564
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:19,771
- Excuse me... ow... Wait!
- Stop it! Calm down!

565
00:44:19,771 --> 00:44:24,401
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

566
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:26,986
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

567
00:44:27,028 --> 00:44:29,947
Wait it's me!

568
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:34,577
Oh I get it.

569
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:39,706
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

570
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,631
Ok.

571
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:09,442
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery.

572
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:14,196
Shouting out questions about love, marriage
and the meaning of life.

573
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:20,369
Poor brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden.

574
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:24,873
- And you took him.
- Oh my god!

575
00:45:24,873 --> 00:45:29,168
- We kidnapped a monk.
- We live an alternative life style.

576
00:45:29,168 --> 00:45:33,839
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't
ourselves last night.

577
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,052
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little
bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

578
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:43,515
Can you find out if he knows where our
friend is?

579
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:46,851
Brother Han took a vow of silence many
years ago.

580
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:48,978
It would be useless to try.

581
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:52,982
Well maybe he can write down what happened,
on a piece of paper?

582
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:56,068
Actually Phil, that would be cheating.
Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

583
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:58,987
- Alan!
- I'm afraid fatty is right.

584
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:00,947
See?... What?

585
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:05,577
None of us will ever know what brother
Han knows.

586
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:08,955
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

587
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:12,958
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to
put some signs up that say no talking...

588
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:15,252
- ...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

589
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:18,297
And "your welcome" for bringing him
back safe.

590
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:21,133
- You know we found him in the drunk tank.
- Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

591
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:25,804
- C'mon guys, let's go.
- Wait!

592
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:30,516
The Buddha teach, every memory lives
somewhere deep within.

593
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:36,105
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the Garden of Meditation.

594
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:39,316
- Did you understand a word he just said?
- Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

595
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:40,942
He said something about the Garden of
Meditation?

596
00:46:40,942 --> 00:46:43,570
No, he said he's farting because of
his medication.

597
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:48,241
I get that.

598
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:55,372
It's a waste of time. I don't remember
anything. Do you?

599
00:46:55,623 --> 00:47:00,294
No. I got nothing. Alan?

600
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:07,342
Alan!

601
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:10,553

00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:12,305
<i>- Sweetie.
- What?</i>

603
00:47:12,305 --> 00:47:13,806
<i>You have visitors.</i>

604
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:15,558
<i>- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys!</i>

605
00:47:15,558 --> 00:47:17,601
<i>- Hey, Phil.
- Hey buddy!</i>

606
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,519
<i>Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.</i>

607
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,149
<i>- Is this true, Stuart?
- Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.</i>

608
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:25,483
<i>Fuck!</i>

609
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:30,154
<i>- For Lauren and Stu!
- Cheers!</i>

610
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:35,993
<i>- Chow!
- We had a sick night bitches!</i>

611
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,495
<i>Alan, what the fuck!</i>

612
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,455
<i>Is that person coming to the wedding?</i>

613
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,959
<i>- There is no wolfpack.
- Alan, Alan, don't do that!</i>

614
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,627
<i>And finally...</i>

615
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:50,298
<i>The three best friends anyone could have.</i>

616
00:47:57,346 --> 00:48:01,933
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

617
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:15,654
I know where to go.

618
00:48:15,654 --> 00:48:19,533
- What do you think, Alan?
- This is the place.

619
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:24,245
C'mon. Let's go.

620
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:28,916
I don't remember any of this!

621
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:33,587
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

622
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:42,596
Rose! Harmony!

623
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:44,889
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting
all day for him.

624
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:49,477
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who?
- Chow, that dick ass fuck!

625
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:52,855
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothings wrong.

626
00:48:52,855 --> 00:48:57,484
Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I
bring for him. Check it out, huh.

627
00:48:57,526 --> 00:48:59,861
- No, no!
- $ 6,000 American.

628
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:04,532
Wow looks so real!

629
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:09,871
Sorry!

630
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:14,416
- Alan, what the fuck!
- It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

631
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:18,003
Everybody ok?

632
00:49:18,003 --> 00:49:22,716
Ok, then get the fuck back to work!
Come on. Music, please!

633
00:49:23,758 --> 00:49:25,343
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

634
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:28,971
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We
got nothing to do with that.

635
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,973
Un-fucking believable.

636
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:34,518
This guy, if he backs out again, the
shits gonna catch up with him.

637
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:38,188
He's made a lot of enemies in this town,
and now they're gonna be your enemies.

638
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,731
That's not fair!

639
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:42,109
Ok listen. We're just looking for a
little kid.

640
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:44,027
- 2,000 dollars.
- What!

641
00:49:44,027 --> 00:49:46,779
I don't know, maybe more. How young you
want this kid to be?

642
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:51,450
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're
looking for our friend... 16 years old.

643
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,329
- Teddy.
- Teddy?

644
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,539
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night.
- He was?

645
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,249
Do you know if he left with us?

646
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,793
I don't know. You were in the corner all
night with Kimmy.

647
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:03,587
- I didn't see you leave.
- Kimmy?

648
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:06,756
- Is she here?
- Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

649
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:08,466
Go and talk to her.

650
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:10,927
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

651
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:13,262
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what
I'm going to talk to you know.

652
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:17,182
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir
says "Hello".

653
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:18,016
Okay!

654
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:22,729
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like
threatening. Like, ironic.

655
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:28,401
- "Hellooo"
- Okay!

656
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,448
Go away! Go away!

657
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,532
??

658
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,161
Of course I remember him. He was buying
shots for everyone.

659
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,706
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

660
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,249
You have no idea.

661
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,709
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

662
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:50,463
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but
you almost forgot this one right here.

663
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:53,507
Right, super star?

664
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:57,803
This one was following me around like a
little puppy dog. All night.

665
00:50:57,803 --> 00:51:02,474
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked
me to marry him.

666
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:05,560
Classic Stu!

667
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,229
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Course not!

668
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:10,731
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

669
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:14,193
- What happens in the Chardonnay room?
- Let's just stay on task.

670
00:51:14,193 --> 00:51:18,947
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

671
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:22,033
- Fuck!
- It's ok. You're not married yet.

672
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,868
- No big deal.
- It's cheating!

673
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:26,704
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

674
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:28,915
It's a violation of my moral code.

675
00:51:28,915 --> 00:51:33,502
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were
crying, saying how special it was.

676
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:37,840
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying?
- What a baby. He was crying.

677
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,511
You should have seen him. He was so
sexy. The way he moved around.

678
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:47,140
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't
drop my load too quick.

679
00:51:47,682 --> 00:51:52,103
- Load? What load?
- Oh, you know... My sperms.

680
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:58,150
I think your English is off. You're talking
about my sperm!

681
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:01,194
- Where would your sperm come from?
- From my balls!

682
00:52:01,194 --> 00:52:05,865
- Hold on! Back up!
- Wait... Are you...

683
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,742
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

684
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:12,413
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt".
- Oh!

685
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:19,962
- Oh god!
- Wow.

686
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:23,882
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

687
00:52:23,882 --> 00:52:28,594
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed
at the same time.

688
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:30,513
How's that work?

689
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:33,808
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load
on the floor.

690
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:38,520
- Ok!
- You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

691
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:43,525
Oh god!

692
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:52,283
- Stu! It's not the end of the world.
- Sorry, but I'm so confused.

693
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:56,745
I made love to a man... with boobies.

694
00:52:56,745 --> 00:53:00,332
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna
find out about this.

695
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:02,042
But we found out about it.

696
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:04,294
And then we forget. That's what we do!

697
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:07,589
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just
forget about it.

698
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:11,133
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

699
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:14,220
That might be harder to go away, but in
time it'll happen.

700
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:18,974
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

701
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,102
- Never happened.
- Great!

702
00:53:22,102 --> 00:53:24,688
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

703
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:27,565
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

704
00:53:27,565 --> 00:53:29,275
- Answer it!
- I can't.

705
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:31,944
What! He might know something about Teddy.
C'mon we still have a shot here.

706
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:36,657
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

707
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:41,119
Hello?

708
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,414
<i>Who takes an all day fishing trip the
day before a wedding?</i>

709
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:49,043
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid.
- Put Teddy on the phone.

710
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,298
<i>- Teddy's seasick actually.
- Seasick?</i>

711
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:59,011
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine.
- That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

712
00:53:59,553 --> 00:54:02,764
I'm gonna tell you something that you do
not know.

713
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,850
- I don't like you.
- Yeah,I knew that already.

714
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,685
<i>If my daughter chooses you,
that's her problem.</i>

715
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,353
This is ??.
Hey it's Phil Winnick!

716
00:54:09,353 --> 00:54:13,899
Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin
in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

717
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:15,651
Phil!

718
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:17,403
- Jesus!
- Phil!

719
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:18,779
Fuck me!

720
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:21,907
- Give us back our monkey!
- What monkey? Get your own monkey!

721
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:24,993
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

722
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:26,452
Come on!

723
00:54:26,452 --> 00:54:28,705
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

724
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:29,872
This is our monkey!

725
00:54:29,872 --> 00:54:32,041
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

726
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,168
Hand him over, now!

727
00:54:34,168 --> 00:54:36,962
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

728
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:41,174
No, no ...

729
00:54:41,174 --> 00:54:44,928
Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana
on his helmet. He's the real deal.

730
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,137
What the fuck's happening?

731
00:54:46,137 --> 00:54:49,098
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you
know where our friend is?

732
00:54:49,098 --> 00:54:53,769
<i>- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid.
- (says something in Russian?)</i>

733
00:54:54,103 --> 00:54:56,230
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I
didn't understand!

734
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,565
What'd he say?

735
00:54:58,565 --> 00:55:03,069
He said fuck you and your questions!

736
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:06,906
- Oh, my arm!
- Philip, are you okay?

737
00:55:06,906 --> 00:55:10,743
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

738
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:12,620
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

739
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,997
We'll figure this out and get the monkey
back, I promise.

740
00:55:14,997 --> 00:55:19,042
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

741
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:23,672
- What the fuck is going on?
- Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

742
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,551
I don't know, let me look!

743
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:30,761
What?

744
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,263
Don't look at it!

745
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,516
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

746
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:40,187
- You got shot!
- I know!

747
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:56,785
- Whoa, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

748
00:55:56,785 --> 00:56:01,164
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

749
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:04,000
Only cost six dollars. How is that even
possible?

750
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,671
How's any of this even possible?

751
00:56:09,464 --> 00:56:14,009
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

752
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:19,556
What are we gonna do?

753
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:25,895
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

754
00:56:25,895 --> 00:56:30,608
- What plan, Alan?
- I've said too much already.

755
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:42,661
Alan! What plan?

756
00:56:42,661 --> 00:56:45,955
- It's all Teddy's fault.
- What are you talking about, Alan?

757
00:56:45,955 --> 00:56:48,291
Why is he even here? He's not part of
the wolf pack!

758
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,877
- Alan, what did you do?
- It's not my fault!

759
00:56:51,877 --> 00:56:55,798
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

760
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:58,258
- What bag?
- The marshmallows.

761
00:56:58,258 --> 00:57:00,052
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

762
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:01,720
But it was dark and it was hard to keep
track.

763
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,015
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't
tell which was which.

764
00:57:05,015 --> 00:57:08,393
- It was mayhem!
- What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

765
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:11,062
Alan, what did you do?

766
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:12,897
Isn't it obvious?

767
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:17,151
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And
plus my ADHD medication.

768
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:19,152
- What?
- You drugged us again?!

769
00:57:19,152 --> 00:57:22,989
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a
little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

770
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:27,410
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that
you didn't do anything!

771
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,162
Alan, you swore to god!

772
00:57:29,162 --> 00:57:31,122
I just wanted things to stay the same.

773
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:35,751
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

774
00:57:35,876 --> 00:57:37,211
You're not my friend!

775
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:39,838
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious?
Even in America?

776
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:43,758
- Yes!
- Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

777
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:46,678
- Don't start crying, Alan!
- You're the bearded devil!

778
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:49,639
You liked it! You smiled at me when I
handed you the bag with marshmallows.

779
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:54,435
Because I like marshmallows, you
fucking psycho!

780
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:57,187
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

781
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:58,814
Enough!

782
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:01,858
- Why, Alan? Why?
- Stu!

783
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:04,402
Because we're the three best
friends, remember?

784
00:58:04,402 --> 00:58:06,112
Remember?

785
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:10,616
Stu, that's enough...

786
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:16,914
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta
stick together.

787
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:24,504
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

788
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:27,674
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

789
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:31,385
- You write that?
- No!

790
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:34,013
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

791
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:35,889
What about England, Phil? Will we still
be friends there?

792
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:40,560
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the
moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

793
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:45,440
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah.

794
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,443
What about you, Stu?

795
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:51,362
We'll see.

796
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:56,033
Gentlemen, follow me.

797
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:12,131
Here you go.

798
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,634
Well. About time! Sit down.

799
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:18,345
Come on, sit.

800
00:59:18,345 --> 00:59:22,891
Wow, you guys look like shit.

801
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:24,351
- Uh, do we know you?
- Hey!

802
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:28,980
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a
restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

803
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,778
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's
going on here.

804
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:39,823
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here,
it's fuckin unreal.

805
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:44,452
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm
sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

806
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:53,210
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you...
- You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

807
00:59:53,878 --> 00:59:58,423
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account
code and the fuckin password!

808
01:00:05,513 --> 01:00:10,143
We don't know anything about any codes. We're
just trying to find our friend.

809
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:18,066
- Teddy?
- Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

810
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:24,322
Hmm, let's see...

811
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:26,658
There's Teddy!

812
01:00:26,658 --> 01:00:31,204
Holy shit! It's from last night.

813
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:34,456
- Who are you?
- I'm a businessman.

814
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:38,752
And I've invested a large chunk of capital
in your friend Chow.

815
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:42,589
And in return, he was supposed to transfer
my profits electronically.

816
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:46,551
About five fuckin minutes ago.

817
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:50,930
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

818
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:55,601
- Oh my god! Is he okay?
- Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

819
01:00:56,935 --> 01:01:00,272
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast
on the roof of this hotel...

820
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:03,733
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

821
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:05,777
Or if he makes the transfer, you will
get Teddy.

822
01:01:05,777 --> 01:01:10,490
If not well then hey, you know...
it's Bangkok.

823
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:16,620
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

824
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:23,918
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

825
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:27,255
Alan leave the hat.

826
01:01:27,255 --> 01:01:31,926
Atta boy.

827
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:41,101
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

828
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:45,814
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu.
This whole things about a fucking bank account.

829
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:49,400
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll
search Chow's body.

830
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,653
Hopefully the password's in his
wallet or something.

831
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,989
- And what if it isn't?
- He's gonna kill Teddy.

832
01:01:54,989 --> 01:01:59,701
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow
to figure it out.

833
01:02:01,787 --> 01:02:06,499
First the monkey and now my hat. How
much worse can this day get.

834
01:02:10,503 --> 01:02:15,216
Jesus christ!

835
01:02:19,386 --> 01:02:24,057
<i>Well we're livin here in Alan town. And
he's drivin our lives into the ground.</i>

836
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:34,275
<i>When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.</i>

837
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:38,946
<i>Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.</i>

838
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:46,619
<i>I was happy, and my life was good.</i>

839
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:51,415
<i>Getting married like a dentist should.</i>

840
01:02:51,415 --> 01:02:55,127
<i>Roasting marshmallows on a stick.</i>

841
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:59,798
<i>I got fucked in the ass... by a girl
with a dick.</i>

842
01:03:02,384 --> 01:03:06,513
Oh yeah, remember that.

843
01:03:06,513 --> 01:03:11,225
<i>And we're livin in Alan town.</i>

844
01:03:12,977 --> 01:03:15,145
There's water everywhere.

845
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:18,023
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The
fuckin powers out.

846
01:03:18,023 --> 01:03:20,859
With an inadequate electrical grid,
serving millions of people

847
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:24,154
Bangkok experiences 1500 power
outages per year.

848
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:26,197
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

849
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:30,826
Out of the way!

850
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:38,417
We got it.

851
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:43,505
Oh my god!

852
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:46,341
Chow, calm down!

853
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:51,012
- You put the chill on me?
- No, no!

854
01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:53,848
It's okay.

855
01:03:53,848 --> 01:03:58,435
Relax!

856
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:07,777
It's just us. Breathe!

857
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,986
It was so cold.

858
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:12,281
- We're gonna warm you up.
- I was so cold!

859
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:16,952
- You did good, buddy. You did good.
- I did good.

860
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,625
Feelin better?

861
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:26,377
- Alright, you warm enough?
- I don't know.

862
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:28,254
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

863
01:04:28,254 --> 01:04:31,549
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box
all day!

864
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:34,176
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

865
01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:37,221
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

866
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:41,224
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already
dead. You didn't have a pulse.

867
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,143
Oh, you never do blow before?

868
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:45,728
Sometimes your heart stop... start
up again.

869
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:48,940
- Read a book!
- Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

870
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,027
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

871
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:55,904
- I got shot!
- But did you die?

872
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:59,241
Chow, some guy told us that you got
a bank code or something...

873
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:02,577
...and if we don't bring it to him first
think in the morning...

874
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:03,995
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

875
01:05:03,995 --> 01:05:08,624
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry.
I got the bank codes.

876
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:15,714
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am.
Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

877
01:05:16,048 --> 01:05:19,468
- An investor in my business.
- Yeah, what business is that?

878
01:05:19,468 --> 01:05:22,637
It's called "not your business" ok!

879
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:25,890
- Oh, where's the monkey?
- The monkey...

880
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:30,603
Yeah I put the account number and
password in his vest. Where is he?

881
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,941
- Why would you do that?
- Safe keeping, pretty boy.

882
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:40,612
I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got
FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

883
01:05:43,615 --> 01:05:45,575
That little monkey snorting coke with me
all night...

884
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:48,703
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make
fuckin lady boy.

885
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:52,623
- He not going anywhere.
- We don't have the monkey, Chow.

886
01:05:52,623 --> 01:05:55,459
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

887
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:58,253
Oh you fucking guys!

888
01:05:58,253 --> 01:06:02,007
Okay. No problem. We just have to get
him back.

889
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:06,719
- From where?
- From the same place we took him from.

890
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,616
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

891
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:44,629
Every night, monkey drug mule.

892
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:49,300
He take coke to buyer...

893
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:54,096
And deliver cash to dealer. He
middle man.

894
01:06:54,096 --> 01:06:56,890
Dealer never handle drug directly.

895
01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:00,102
He clean.

896
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:04,647
- That's terrible.
- Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

897
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:08,318
You ever see monkey go to jail?

898
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:13,072
We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

899
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,951
- We get some blow too, you know... bump.
- No, no more bumps, Chow.

900
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:23,748
This is ridiculous.

901
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:28,378
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your
monkey.

902
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,096
Alright, here we go.

903
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:43,767
Come on!

904
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:47,604
How did we wind up with the monkey
last night anyway?

905
01:07:47,604 --> 01:07:49,856
I needed some blow and Alan thought
he was cute...

906
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:54,568
...so we stole him!

907
01:08:02,868 --> 01:08:04,285
So stupid!

908
01:08:04,285 --> 01:08:05,912
Stu, ready to grab vest?

909
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:10,458
- Okay. I just grab it?
- Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

910
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:15,129
- Hey, little monkey.
- Alan, be quiet.

911
01:08:16,338 --> 01:08:19,883
- Fuck!
- We gotta go, right now!

912
01:08:19,883 --> 01:08:24,554
- Pull that fuckin monkey in!
- I'm trying!

913
01:08:27,473 --> 01:08:32,103
Shit!

914
01:08:32,103 --> 01:08:36,190
- Get that monkey in here, Stu!
- He won't let go!

915
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,859
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

916
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:43,530
I'm trying! Slow down!

917
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:51,621
He's so strong!

918
01:08:51,912 --> 01:08:54,832
Let go you fuckin monkey!

919
01:08:54,832 --> 01:08:59,503
- Look out!
- Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

920
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:05,050
I got him!

921
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:09,846
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

922
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,016
- Got it, Alan?
- Yes, I got a .

923
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:18,729
- Slow down Chow!
- Hold on, J-Birds.

924
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,733
Holy Shit!

925
01:09:23,733 --> 01:09:27,779
Don't worry. I got this shit!

926
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:32,408
Pig!

927
01:09:33,325 --> 01:09:34,827
Oh, my word.

928
01:09:34,827 --> 01:09:39,456
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

929
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,169
Oh, shit!

930
01:09:44,169 --> 01:09:45,587
Get down!

931
01:09:45,587 --> 01:09:48,089
What the fuck!

932
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:50,967
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

933
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,594
They shot the monkey.

934
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:58,223
I'm at my wits end.

935
01:09:58,223 --> 01:10:00,475
He's coming back around.

936
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:05,188
Look out!

937
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:10,026
- Holy fuck!
- Oh no...

938
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:29,794
- Everyone alright?
- Yeah.

939
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:34,423
I have such an erection right now!

940
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:41,179
Are you for real?

941
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:56,568
They're gonna take good care of you
here, ok.

942
01:10:56,610 --> 01:11:00,447
What's that?

943
01:11:00,447 --> 01:11:05,076
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here.
Here you go.

944
01:11:09,205 --> 01:11:13,375
Right here.

945
01:11:13,375 --> 01:11:17,629
Deep breathe. Good.

946
01:11:17,629 --> 01:11:20,173
Soak it in.

947
01:11:20,173 --> 01:11:24,552
Breathe the smoke into your tiny
little lungs. There you go.

948
01:11:24,552 --> 01:11:28,348
It's funny. I've never been much of a
smoker, but...

949
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:30,600
Boy does it look cool on you.

950
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,229
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

951
01:11:36,146 --> 01:11:40,734
I'll miss you, monkey.

952
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:44,571
I wish monkeys could Skype.

953
01:11:44,571 --> 01:11:49,367
Maybe one day...

954
01:11:53,704 --> 01:11:58,250
Come on! Get in!

955
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,907
Are you guys seriously this calm?

956
01:12:32,907 --> 01:12:35,409
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

957
01:12:35,409 --> 01:12:37,578
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

958
01:12:37,578 --> 01:12:40,163
You ever do anything that doesn't end
up in a standoff, Chow?

959
01:12:40,163 --> 01:12:43,291
I'm an international criminal. It always
ends like this.

960
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:46,002
I met my wife at one of these things.

961
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:50,089
- You got a wife?
- Yeah, we married 15 years.

962
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:53,676
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

963
01:12:53,676 --> 01:12:56,929
No, that's cool.

964
01:12:56,929 --> 01:12:57,971
Let's do this!

965
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:02,309
- Welcome to the Tower Club.
- Blah blah blah, who cares.

966
01:13:02,309 --> 01:13:07,021
Stop! Chow crossing.

967
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:11,275
- Hey, Kingsley!
- Well, well.

968
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:13,235
Propecia looking nice!

969
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:15,321
You been hitting the gym?

970
01:13:15,321 --> 01:13:18,699
Yes I am actually. Thank you for
noticing, Chow.

971
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:21,243
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

972
01:13:21,243 --> 01:13:24,662
- Where's Teddy?
- He's waiting downstairs in my car.

973
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:26,789
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

974
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:29,584
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you
keep Teddy.

975
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:34,296
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

976
01:13:34,338 --> 01:13:37,216
- Chow.. Chow...
- Could we move this along!

977
01:13:37,216 --> 01:13:41,761
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

978
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:46,474
8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.

979
01:13:52,646 --> 01:13:55,983
- Password?
- "baloney1"

980
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:57,484
Your password is "baloney1" ?

981
01:13:57,484 --> 01:14:00,404
Well it used to be just "baloney" but
now they make you add number.

982
01:14:00,404 --> 01:14:05,116
Fuckin annoying.

983
01:14:13,124 --> 01:14:15,960
- And it's that easy.
- Ta dah!

984
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,463
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

985
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:24,092
- Great, now can we please have Teddy?
- Yeah. Bring him up.

986
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:30,640
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I
bust a nut.

987
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,311
We did it, Stu. It's over!

988
01:14:41,817 --> 01:14:46,446
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

989
01:14:47,322 --> 01:14:48,531
Oh, nuts!

990
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:50,867
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

991
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:52,326
Gotcha, Leslie!

992
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,411
Get him outta here.

993
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:58,165
Go! Just do it! Go!

994
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,793
How the fuck...

995
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:06,631
Samir, you fucked me over six grand?
You camel jockey!

996
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:11,677
You spit on me?

997
01:15:11,677 --> 01:15:16,098
Six grand this time, eight grand last time.
It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

998
01:15:16,098 --> 01:15:19,059
Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

999
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:21,394
Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

1000
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:25,565
- Put em in, motherfucker!
- He's an asshole, man.

1001
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:26,941
You guys ok?

1002
01:15:26,941 --> 01:15:30,236
- What the fucks going on?
- Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

1003
01:15:30,236 --> 01:15:31,529
- You're a cop?
- Yes.

1004
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:34,198
This sting operation has been in place
for weeks.

1005
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,825
When Samir told us that your friend
was lost...

1006
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:41,413
We took advantage of that information.
I'm sorry.

1007
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:46,626
- So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

1008
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,920
They don't have him. They never had him.

1009
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,424
They just needed us to bring them Chow.
They used Teddy as bait.

1010
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:57,136
- Do you have any leads at all?
- No. We've checked everywhere.

1011
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,055
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1012
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:04,726
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid
Bangkok has him.

1013
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:13,984
Why do people keep saying that?

1014
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:18,697
Stu... It's time.

1015
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:25,036
Alan...

1016
01:16:25,036 --> 01:16:29,457
-I'm sorry.
- Don't say that. Please.

1017
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:33,586
- No this time we really fucked up.
- Oh god! How bad?

1018
01:16:33,586 --> 01:16:37,464
<i>Like, no wedding bad?</i>

1019
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:42,135
Yeah... a little worse than that!

1020
01:17:04,698 --> 01:17:09,368
Ok, how about this? He fell off
the fishing boat and drowned.

1021
01:17:09,827 --> 01:17:12,455
No.

1022
01:17:12,455 --> 01:17:16,291
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1023
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:19,378
- Alan!
- Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1024
01:17:19,378 --> 01:17:21,213
How many people get run over here?

1025
01:17:21,213 --> 01:17:24,883
- Over 1200 a year, Phil.
- Perfect!

1026
01:17:24,883 --> 01:17:29,387
His body was too mangled to recover.
Case closed.

1027
01:17:29,387 --> 01:17:32,098
Can I get more ice, please?

1028
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:33,766
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1029
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:38,437
- Stu, do you want this or not?
- Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1030
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:48,780
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All
kinds, apparently.

1031
01:17:52,825 --> 01:17:57,496
- I have a demon in me!
- So what?

1032
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:01,917
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1033
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:03,793
Just let her live her life without me.

1034
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:05,170
Stu!

1035
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,798
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm
never coming back.

1036
01:18:08,798 --> 01:18:12,218
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1037
01:18:12,218 --> 01:18:16,638
Gonna stay here in Bangkok.
I think I belong here.

1038
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,100
Open up a little dentists office.

1039
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,854
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1040
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:30,818
You sure about this?

1041
01:18:34,863 --> 01:18:38,659
Hey, what the crud!

1042
01:18:38,659 --> 01:18:43,330
Powers out, Alan.

1043
01:18:44,247 --> 01:18:45,457
- Phil!
- Doug.

1044
01:18:45,498 --> 01:18:48,751
- I need answers, man.
- I know...

1045
01:18:48,751 --> 01:18:49,794
Doug, who are you talking to?

1046
01:18:49,794 --> 01:18:50,753
- What?
- Give me the phone!

1047
01:18:50,753 --> 01:18:51,921
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1048
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,047
Who is this?

1049
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:57,051
- Lauren?
- Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1050
01:18:57,051 --> 01:18:58,969
We lost your little brother.

1051
01:18:58,969 --> 01:19:03,682
- What?
- Bangkok has him now.

1052
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:11,105
You gotta take the stairs.

1053
01:19:11,105 --> 01:19:15,651
You're in Bangkok?

1054
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:19,613
Ooh, that's a finger!

1055
01:19:19,613 --> 01:19:21,698
Put Stu on the phone!

1056
01:19:21,698 --> 01:19:25,285
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages
per year.

1057
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:28,079
<i>Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.</i>

1058
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:29,539
<i>- Water everywhere. Powers out.</i>

1059
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:34,168
<i>Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain</i>

1060
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,296
Phil! Give me the phone!

1061
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,172
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it!
- I know.!

1062
01:19:39,172 --> 01:19:41,007
- Give me the fuckin...
- I can handle it, Stu!

1063
01:19:41,007 --> 01:19:42,509
She's gonna break your heart!

1064
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:45,095
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

1065
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:48,765
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he
mean you lost Teddy?

1066
01:19:48,765 --> 01:19:53,477
What? Is that what Phil said?
No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1067
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:57,564
But we're all good now. We heading back to the
hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

1068
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:02,235
I love you so much! And I gotta go, but
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1069
01:20:05,363 --> 01:20:09,700
Stu!

1070
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:12,536
- Stu!
- God!

1071
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:15,205
Taxi!

1072
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:19,793
Come on, Alan!

1073
01:20:19,793 --> 01:20:21,503
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1074
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:24,047
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1075
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:26,466
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1076
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:29,552
- In a pool of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

1077
01:20:29,552 --> 01:20:31,220
No, it was ice.

1078
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,847
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1079
01:20:32,847 --> 01:20:35,391
...came back to the room. Put his finger
on ice and fell asleep.

1080
01:20:35,391 --> 01:20:36,392
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1081
01:20:36,392 --> 01:20:39,144
...and you find your finger floating in
a bowl of melted ice?

1082
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:42,522
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th
fuckin floor!

1083
01:20:42,522 --> 01:20:45,567
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1084
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:50,238
- Holy shit! Of course!
- He's at the ice machine.

1085
01:20:51,155 --> 01:20:55,868
Alan, no!

1086
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:57,578
It's on ten!

1087
01:20:57,578 --> 01:21:00,288
- Sir, is the elevator stuck?
- ??.

1088
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:05,043
- C'mon!
- Go, go, go!

1089
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:08,129
Hey, Teddy!

1090
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:12,800
Look out, look out!

1091
01:21:18,514 --> 01:21:21,725
- Teddy!
- You're ok!

1092
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:24,686
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

1093
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:27,814
- Where am I?
- You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

1094
01:21:27,814 --> 01:21:30,066
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's
gonna be fine.

1095
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:34,778
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

1096
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:36,655
Thanks, man.

1097
01:21:36,655 --> 01:21:38,907
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

1098
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:43,662
Tell him we found him.
Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

1099
01:21:45,705 --> 01:21:50,334
Alright, guests are arriving, people starting
to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1100
01:21:50,877 --> 01:21:53,587
- How?
- I don't know, with a taxi?

1101
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:55,130
- Chow's speed boat.
- What?

1102
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:57,424
Last think I remember, was getting off
Chow's speed boat.

1103
01:21:57,424 --> 01:22:01,845
- Chow has a speed boat?
- "The Perfect Life".

1104
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:06,558
C'mon!

1105
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:10,478
Stu, get that back line.

1106
01:22:10,478 --> 01:22:14,190
Good jump, Phil!

1107
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,400
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1108
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,278
- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1109
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:24,032
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I
know what I'm doing.

1110
01:22:44,551 --> 01:22:46,928
You know where we're going?

1111
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,805
Leave it to the Captain!

1112
01:22:48,805 --> 01:22:52,099
Oh fuck you, Alan!

1113
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:55,769
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

1114
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:58,397
Affirmative cadet!
We're going south.

1115
01:22:58,397 --> 01:23:03,151
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand.
- Good.

1116
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:26,339
Hey! You okay?

1117
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:30,051
- Feeling a little better.
- Alright!

1118
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:34,680
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

1119
01:23:35,055 --> 01:23:39,726
It's funny. I can't remember anything
But... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

1120
01:23:45,023 --> 01:23:47,817
Yeah!

1121
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:51,445
By the way... Do you have any idea
where my finger is?

1122
01:23:51,445 --> 01:23:55,991
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing
monkey.

1123
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:59,036
Bangkok...

1124
01:23:59,036 --> 01:24:03,665
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

1125
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,053
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

1126
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,097
He is on his way. He will be here...

1127
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,684
Please, if you will all move to the bar.
We are going to clear this area.

1128
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:28,938
Please!

1129
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:33,526
<i>I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.</i>

1130
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:39,865
Look! There they are!

1131
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:45,912
Stu!

1132
01:24:48,373 --> 01:24:51,125
- Alan, there's no dock.
- Just hang on!

1133
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:53,878
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat!
- Hang on!

1134
01:24:53,878 --> 01:24:56,630
- Is that Alan driving the boat?
- What?

1135
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:00,509
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1136
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:02,677
Oh my god!

1137
01:25:02,677 --> 01:25:04,804
Turn the boat!

1138
01:25:04,804 --> 01:25:06,264
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1139
01:25:06,264 --> 01:25:10,935
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1140
01:25:24,781 --> 01:25:29,202
Hi! Hi everybody!

1141
01:25:29,202 --> 01:25:33,914
Came in a little hotter than we planned.
I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1142
01:25:34,456 --> 01:25:36,709
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll
be fine.

1143
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:38,669
- Baby!
- Oh my god!

1144
01:25:38,669 --> 01:25:42,047
I'm so happy to see you!

1145
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:46,676
- Teddy! Teddy here.
- Hi, Dad!

1146
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:50,638
- You alright?
- Yeah, ok.

1147
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:53,390
- Your hand!
- I know.

1148
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:57,478
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1149
01:25:57,478 --> 01:25:58,687
This is your fault!

1150
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:03,400
- Dad.
- He's right. I have not been completely honest.

1151
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:05,026
- Stu? Don't do this.
-Yeah?

1152
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:07,737
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1153
01:26:07,737 --> 01:26:12,408
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1154
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:17,204
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery
that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

1155
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:24,669
Maybe I would be if you added some
cayenne pepper!

1156
01:26:26,296 --> 01:26:28,047
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1157
01:26:28,047 --> 01:26:30,216
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1158
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:32,676
... but I don't and I'm not.

1159
01:26:32,676 --> 01:26:35,095
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1160
01:26:35,095 --> 01:26:38,473
It's not weird. It's pretty cool
actually. No membership fees.

1161
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:41,101
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1162
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:45,313
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1163
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:49,025
- I got a dark side!

1164
01:26:49,025 --> 01:26:51,777
There's a demon in me!

1165
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:54,446
It's true, he has semen in him.

1166
01:26:54,446 --> 01:26:56,156
I said demon.

1167
01:26:56,156 --> 01:27:00,911
- But you also have semen in you, remember?
- Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1168
01:27:02,621 --> 01:27:07,333
The point is, this demon takes me to
some pretty weird places.

1169
01:27:08,251 --> 01:27:11,962
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1170
01:27:11,962 --> 01:27:15,883
But that same demon took us to
hell and back to find him.

1171
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:18,468
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1172
01:27:18,468 --> 01:27:23,098
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1173
01:27:25,809 --> 01:27:29,896
I love your daughter, and I'm
gonna marry her.

1174
01:27:29,896 --> 01:27:33,816
- Unless you have any problem with that?
- I'm good.

1175
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:38,487
But all that said, it would actually mean
a great deal to both of us...

1176
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:43,533
...if we could just get your mother fucking
blessing!

1177
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,757
Hey, Alan...

1178
01:28:00,757 --> 01:28:05,178
- That looks pretty cool shaved.
- Thanks, Phil.

1179
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:07,055
You should shave your head too.

1180
01:28:07,055 --> 01:28:11,684
- Why would I do that?
- Well than we would look exactly alike.

1181
01:28:21,735 --> 01:28:26,447
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu.
- I will.

1182
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:35,581
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with
the boat.

1183
01:28:35,581 --> 01:28:40,043
Just happy you're here.

1184
01:28:40,043 --> 01:28:43,755
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna
have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1185
01:28:43,755 --> 01:28:48,343
- That's ok. I can get used to it.
- Really?

1186
01:28:50,678 --> 01:28:52,888
But for now, let's switch sides?

1187
01:28:52,888 --> 01:28:56,350
- Yeah, ok.
- Thank you.

1188
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:59,019
Much better.

1189
01:28:59,019 --> 01:29:02,898
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1190
01:29:02,898 --> 01:29:07,443
...I welcome all of you, to this
marriage celebration.

1191
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:12,114
We are here today to...

1192
01:30:03,411 --> 01:30:06,164
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

1193
01:30:06,164 --> 01:30:10,751
Thank you.

1194
01:30:14,755 --> 01:30:18,675
Hello? Hi everyone!

1195
01:30:18,675 --> 01:30:21,219
My name's Alan Garner.

1196
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:25,932
I want to thank the Asiatic people for
allowing us in your land.

1197
01:30:28,684 --> 01:30:32,980
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really
happy to be here...

1198
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,609
...and I have a wedding gift to present
to Lauren and Stu.

1199
01:30:37,943 --> 01:30:40,737
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

1200
01:30:40,737 --> 01:30:45,408
...and I hope that you appreciate it as
much as I did, or going to.

1201
01:30:45,408 --> 01:30:50,079
Okay, guys!

1202
01:31:03,883 --> 01:31:08,554
Oh, fuck!

1203
01:31:25,945 --> 01:31:29,073
Alan!

1204
01:31:29,073 --> 01:31:31,242
What the fuck?

1205
01:31:31,242 --> 01:31:34,495
- So what do ya think?
- That's insane! How did you do that?

1206
01:31:34,495 --> 01:31:36,205
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

1207
01:31:36,205 --> 01:31:40,292
I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's
for my third best friend.

1208
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:44,337
Alan, it's amazing!
I love it! Thank you so much!

1209
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:48,299
We only have him for tonight. We don't
have him permanently.

1210
01:31:48,299 --> 01:31:52,845
Understood!

1211
01:32:04,939 --> 01:32:08,943
<i>- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?
- I barely ??</i>

1212
01:32:08,943 --> 01:32:13,656
Mike, you were great. It's true, that
was incredible.

1213
01:32:13,739 --> 01:32:16,700
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

1214
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:20,370
By the way, you really need to remove that
fuckin tattoo from your face!

1215
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:24,416
Yeah! On it!

1216
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:26,709
Sorry about the last minute change up
to the performance, Mike.

1217
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,503
- Don't worry, Alan.
- What are you talking about?

1218
01:32:28,503 --> 01:32:31,172
Well he was originally supposed to sing
"Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

1219
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:34,008
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1220
01:32:34,008 --> 01:32:36,427
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1221
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:38,804
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

1222
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,764
How come you never tried calling us?

1223
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:42,557
It's been dead for two days.

1224
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,934
But I recharged it and found all
these photos.

1225
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,269
What?

1226
01:32:46,269 --> 01:32:48,312
- Shit!
- Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

1227
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,232
- Awesome, let's check em out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1228
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:52,858
No one needs to see this stuff!

1229
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:55,736
C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

1230
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:59,281
<i>- It'll be fine.
- (mumbles something)</i>

1231
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:03,785
- Alright, we look at it once.
- And then we delete them. It's gonna be ok.

1232
01:33:05,245 --> 01:33:09,957
- Oh, ooh!
- Mother fucker!
