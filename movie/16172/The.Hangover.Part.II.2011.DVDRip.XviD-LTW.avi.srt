哇，哇，哇！

116
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:43,810
What the hell? I'm not cool with this
at all. You can't have these.
搞啥啊？看到这我怎麽能冷静
你不能留下这些东西

117
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,102
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.
放松，史都！从来没人会来这里。

- 违背了我们之间的信赖！
- 妈，我吃完了午餐。我坐在这里等你！

119
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:53,273
I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.
对不起，亲爱的。我马上上来。

120
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,191

- Wait a second!
- 艾伦，这是周先生吗？
- 是啊。我们仍然保持联络。

121
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:59,567
- Al, is that Mr. Chow?

122
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,610
Stu!
史都！

123
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,111
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?
老周？那个绑架我们的家夥？

124
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,987
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.
他没有绑架我们。他绑架的是黑色的道格。

125
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,946
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.
还记得吗？这整个就是个大误会。

He's actually quite charming.

127
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:11,989

- 嗨，琳达！
- 嗨，小道！

I guess we don't do desert anymore. I
didn't get that memo.
我以为我们没有点心了。我没收到通知。

I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

Would a cupcake kill you?
多放个蛋糕会杀了你？

132

You're inviting me?
你真的是认真的吗，史都？ 真的要邀请我吗？

138
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:51,216

I can do it.
这是我的免疫接种。这是我最後能做到一点。

That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

史都，看看这个！

- 他17岁大。天才的一种。
- 其实，我是16。

the entrance exams early.

I'm a little confused. Is he here just to
see us off or what. How does this work?
我有点糊涂了。他在这儿只是要替我们送行或什麽。这是如何进行的？

嗯，这是我第一次听说过。

泰迪和我，你一定很兴奋。
很快你就会有2名医生在家庭中。

你必须认识到，在我国，我们不认为牙医是真正的医生。

180
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,880

哦...实在没有必要的。

I've been meaning to ask someone. I
notice this is a fishing village.
我一直想问别人。我注意这里是一个渔村。

当我第一次见到史都，我不太想接受他。

He seemed unattractive. He lacked
intelligence and imagination.
他似乎没有吸引力。他缺乏智慧和想像力。

206
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:24,771
He was missing the spark you look for
in a man.

207
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,565
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

Chai Yo.
让我想起了我可爱的弟弟，柴育。

the sailboat and lives in a group home.
对於那些不认识他的人，柴育学习帆船，生活在大家庭里。


210

But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

What is "khao"?

old people.

216
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:07,124
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.
这是每个人都可以消化的营养。

217
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:11,834
The world needs "khao", just as the
world needs people like Stu.
世界需要「米汁」，正如
世界需要人们喜欢史都。

something to say.

- 这都是泰迪的错。
- 你在说什麽，艾伦？

the wolf pack!
他为什麽要来在这里？他不属於狼群！

- It's not my fault!
- 艾伦，你又做什麽了？

I had a separate bag just for Teddy.
我有一包只为泰迪准备的。

track.
但那时很黑，它是很难保持注意。

And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't
tell which was which.
然後，你们几乎坐好了。我不能
知道哪个是哪个。

Alan, what did you do?

- 什麽？
- 你又对我们下迷药？！

Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a
little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.
不是要对你们！我只是想搞掉泰迪一会儿，我们才可以享受周末。

756
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:26,912
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that
you didn't do anything!
享受周末？艾伦，你告诉我，你什麽也没做！

00:57:26,912 --> 00:57:28,664
Alan, you swore to god!

I just wanted things to stay the same.

Even in America?
别那麽说，菲尔！你是认真的？即使在美国也一样

- 是的！
- 哦，上帝！别那麽说，菲尔！

763
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:46,172

- You're the bearded devil!
- 不要开始哭，艾伦！
- 你是胡子恶魔！

764
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:49,132
You liked it! You smiled at me when I
handed you the bag with marshmallows.
你喜欢它！你对我微笑时，当我递棉花糖给你时。

Because I like marshmallows, you
fucking psycho!
