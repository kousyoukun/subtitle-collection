1
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,070
Hi, you've reached the office, Dr. Stuart Price.

2
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,260
Please note the office will be closed until the 24th.

3
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,980
If this is an emergency, please try...

4
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,290
Hi, It's Dr. Stuart Price,

5
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,590
I'm getting married.

6
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,510
So I'll be out of the country for 2 weeks.

7
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,380
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.

8
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,040
If this is a dental emergency...

9
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,500
Nothing.

10
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,570
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

11
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,790
I looked into his eyes. Not the eyes of a man.

12
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,720
The eyes of a coward.

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,930
Excuse me!

14
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,730
- Bill! - Tracy!

15
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,770
- I'm sorry! - Where the hell are you?

16
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,370
It happened again!

17
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,950
Don't say that, please!

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,340
No, this time we really fucked up.

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,770
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,210
So much, Trace, I don't even know where to begin.

21
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,710
Oh god! How bad?

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,510
- Like, no wedding bad? - Yeah...

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,090
A little worse than that.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,990
2

25
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,670
You really need to floss more.

26
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,090
Fuck that! That's why I come here.

27
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,320
Then you should come more than once every two years!

28
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,350
Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

29
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,440
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

30
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,310
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous? - Ah, you don't actually.

31
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,050
Come on! Just one hit!

32
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,580
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

33
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,690
Yeah, actually. You're getting married in Thailand.

34
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.

35
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,710
That's two grand right there.

36
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,330
Then my mother in laws watching the kids.

37
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,810
So now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

38
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,990
Plus, takes five days to get there.

39
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,780
It's a 16 hour flight.

40
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,550
And it's beautiful when you get there.

41
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,980
- Whatever, it's a hassle! - It is kinda far.

42
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,240
Lauren's been there a week and she's still jet lagged.

43
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,870
But it's where her parents are from

44
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,310
and it means a lot to them.

45
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,170
Who gives a shit about her parents! Her dad hates you!

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,390
He doesn't hate me! He's just never spoken to me...

47
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,610
...I think it's a cultural thing.

48
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,180
Why can't you just get married in Vegas

49
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,860
like you did the last time. It's so much easier.

50
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,410
Why can't you just be excited for me?

51
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,820
This is my wedding!

52
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,460
- You're really happy, huh? - I really am.

53
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,420
Alright...

54
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,510
...I'm happy too.

55
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,810
- Thank you! - Gonna be fun.

56
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,920
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

57
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,640
Thank you. You know that's a felony right?

58
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,940
Fuck you, man!

59
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,980
- Was this right up against your scrotum? - Yep.

60
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,160
- Oh my god, I just realized. - What?

61
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,360
- I forgot to renew my passport! - Oh, no...

62
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,910
Good thing I did it last week. It's in the kitchen drawer.

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,600
- You're the best! - Hey! We're a team!

64
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,700
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

65
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,750
Thank you!

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
So I know you're not gonna get mad.

67
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,760
Mad? What, mad at what?

68
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,690
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding.

69
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,690
So?

70
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,510
So he's heart broken, Doug. You guys are like his family!

71
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,450
No. Your family is like his family.

72
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,420
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

73
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,900
- And that weekend. - Wait a second...

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,080
Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?

75
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,040
He does that when he's upset.

76
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,900
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

77
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,780
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

78
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,950
For me...

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,100
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

80
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,290
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

81
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,140
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

82
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,210
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

83
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,250
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

84
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,310
I consider Alan to be insane.

85
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,300
Stu, throw him a bone!

86
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,940
We've already said

87
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,830
he's got to pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,850
You know what. We should see

89
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,050
if we can squeeze the old man to cover the bachelor party.

90
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,230
- That's good. - I'm glad you brought that up.

91
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,850
- Because... this is the bachelor party! - What?

92
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,090
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,820
Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

94
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,370
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes...

95
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,070
A lap dance from the waitress...

96
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,380
That's bullshit!

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,080
You can't just skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

98
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
You see that?

99
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,020
That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,750
Do you know why? So nobody will refuse me.

101
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,740
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe at a bachelor party?

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,640
C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting?

103
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,500
No, I don't.

104
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,670
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken psyche back together.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,770
And you know what the glue is?

106
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,450
Lauren! I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

107
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,530
Oh, please. You wouldn't even be

108
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,950
with her if it wasn't for us.

109
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,850
Oh, this'll be good.

110
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,500
Stu, think about it!

111
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,860
You ended up ditching Melissa,

112
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,810
and two years later you met your true soul mate.

113
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,420
You take Vegas out of that equation,

114
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,720
you would have married a cunt.

115
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,210
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's a bachelor party.

116
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,580
Drink up everybody.

117
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh wait, there's no alcohol!

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,740
I forgot we're at a fuckin IHOP!

119
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,150
Well, it's my decision and it's final, so... how bout a toast?

120
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,700
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

121
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,110
C'mon Phil, where you going?

122
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,360
Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

123
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,420
He's getting married in Thailand!

124
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,090
That's great for him, but what about us?

125
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,140
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

126
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,340
Shame on you!

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Don't worry Stu.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,120
I will stand up for you no matter what.

129
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,200
Thank you.

130
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,020
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

131
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,570
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

132
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,920
Alan's been waiting for the invite

133
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
ever since he got word of the wedding.

134
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,330
- I'm sure he has. - Yeah.

135
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,370
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

136
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,350
- Well that's tough. - Yeah.

137
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,900
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

138
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,670
He really needs this.

139
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,600
What?

140
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,700
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors! Go in slowly.

141
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,640
Give him a chance to acclimate.

142
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,080
Hey, Alan!

143
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,760
Hey, bud!

145
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,990
- You guys wanna come in? - Sure. Absolutely.

146
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,390
- Hey, Stu! - Ok. See you on the court in half...

147
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,040
Pretty cool room, Alan!

148
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,780
Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

149
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,560
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed to delete these!

150
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,330
You made a promise!

151
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,380
What the hell?

152
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm not cool with this at all. You can't have these.

153
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,060
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

154
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,070
A total violation of trust!

155
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,350
Mother, I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

156
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,550
I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

157
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,880
I can't believe you guys stopped by.

158
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,710
- This is really cool. - Wait a second!

159
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,150
Al, is that Mr. Chow?

160
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,200
Yeah. We still keep in touch.

161
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Stu!

162
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,380
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

163
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,870
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

164
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,100
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

165
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,450
He's actually quite charming.

166
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,500
Alan, he's a criminal.

167
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,370
Excuse me, boys!

168
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,100
- Hi, Linda! - Hi, Dougie!

169
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,340
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I didn't get that memo.

170
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,870
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

171
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,320
Would a cupcake kill you?

172
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,630
You know, I don't think this was a good idea.

173
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,330
Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

174
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,990
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

175
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,430
- Well, only if you're not busy. - Stu!

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,680
Well, maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,180
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

178
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,710
Are you really being serious, Stu?

179
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,220
You're inviting me?

180
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,160
Yeah, why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

181
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,610
- Phil, are you going? - Of course!

182
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,500
Then it will be fun.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,770
What the fuck are you doing, man?

184
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,610
It's my immunizations. It's the last day I can do it.

185
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,010
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

186
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,950
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

187
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,550
Stu, look at this! I bought this cause I thought of you!

188
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,790
- Hey, there he is! - Hey, Stu!

189
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,270
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya? - Hey Stu.

190
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,620
- Alright. - Who's this guy, Stu?

191
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,830
This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

192
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,430
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med.

193
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,810
This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

194
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,840
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

195
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,420
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

196
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,300
He's 17. Kind of a genius.

197
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,960
Actually, I'm 16.

198
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,230
I'm not a genius.

199
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,640
My dad just had me take the entrance exams early.

200
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,490
Because you're a genius.

201
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,440
So what are you, a doctor?

202
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,330
No, not yet. I'm premed.

203
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,930
Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?

204
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah.

205
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,430
- Well, he turned out to be a gay. - Alan.

206
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,990
It's true, i read it in Teen People.

207
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,060
Right, ok... well, I'm gonna grab a book

208
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,990
or something for the plane. You guys want anything?

209
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,050
No, thanks. I'm good.

210
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,970
I would actually love a small water.

211
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,870
Cool.

212
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,560
What's the matter with you.

213
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,820
- He's 16 years old. - Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

214
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm a little confused.

215
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,780
Is he here just to see us off or what.

216
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,870
How does this work?

217
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,310
- How does what work? - Is that person coming to the wedding?

218
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,560
Yes, Alan. My brides little brother

219
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,290
is coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

220
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,170
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.

221
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,390
You could have paged me.

222
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,250
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

223
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,250
Hey. Mind if I sit?

224
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,820
Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

225
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,670
There's no wolfpack, Alan.

226
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,950
- C'mon. - It's no problem. I'll find...

227
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,220
Teddy, don't be ridiculous!

228
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,290
- You're sitting here! - Careful, that's a Louis...

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,860
That is a Louis Vuitton!

230
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,580
- That's a nice neck roll! - Thanks! You can use it if you want.

231
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,850
Ok.

232
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,690
Baby!

233
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,020
This is so absolutely beautiful! Thank you much!

234
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,110
Of course.

235
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,730
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited.

236
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,860
Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

237
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,000
You have to realize that in my country

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,660
we don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

239
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,570
Dad...

240
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,390
Ok.

241
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,310
Anyway I have to go

242
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,870
and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight.

243
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,840
Ouch!

244
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,900
I'm so sorry...

245
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,280
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your brother, isn't he?

246
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,760
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's always been that way.

247
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,160
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

248
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,850
You can just fax it over to me. I'll pick it up at the concierge.

249
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,390
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

250
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,350
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

251
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,940
We were discussing your wedding gift. He's sparing no expense.

252
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,830
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

253
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,680
I've been meaning to ask someone.

254
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,100
I notice this is a fishing village.

255
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,140
Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?

256
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,690
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

257
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,010
But, we are actually serving some great fresh seafood.

258
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,840
- Better than Long John's? - Yes.

259
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,860
I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.

260
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,580
You too. Ok.

261
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,440
Thank you, Teddy!

262
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,990
The hands of a brilliant musician!

263
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,380
And one day, a great surgeon.

264
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,240
I admit it...

265
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,760
When I first met Stu,

266
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,450
I was not quite sold.

267
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,500
He seemed unattractive. He lacked intelligence and imagination.

268
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,750
He was missing the spark you look for in a man.

269
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

270
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,740
It reminded me of my sweet brother, Chai Yo.

271
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,160
For those who do not know,

272
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,660
Chai Yo is learning the sailboat

273
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,280
and lives in a group home.

274
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,370
But Chai Yo loves "Khao" .

275
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,570
And that's when I realized, Stu is "Khao".

276
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,080
What is "Khao"?

277
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,410
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

278
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,830
It has no taste.

279
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,730
We feed it to small baby and uh, very old people.

280
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,820
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

281
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:02,010
The world needs "Khao", just as the world needs people like Stu.

282
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,810
To my sweet daughter and Stu! Congratulations!

283
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,500
Cheers!

284
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,980
And now I believe that Teddy has something to say.

285
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,280
Sit down! I got this. Sit down, boy!

286
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,560
That was a.. A great speech, sir!

287
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,740
I like the comparison between Stu and rice.

288
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,790
I've also prepared a few words.

289
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,520
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

290
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,520
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

291
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,970
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

292
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,330
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.

293
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,660
Each year approximately 13,000 people

294
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,480
are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

295
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
- The climate in Thailand... - Alan!

296
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,650
Why don't you skip to

297
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,240
- the last card there, buddy. - Okay. Sorry!

298
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,460
None of you know Stu like I do.

299
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,270
Not you... not you... not you...

300
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,100
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

301
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,650
No one!

302
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,700
I can't even tell you

303
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,070
what we've been through cause we made a pact.

304
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,770
More important than blood.

305
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,350
What I can tell you is this.

306
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,690
This is not Stu's first marriage.

307
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,990
There was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.

308
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,520
Sit down...

309
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,770
Enough! He'll get over it!

310
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,050
Okay. Thanks, Phil!

311
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,290
In your face!

312
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.

313
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,910
Sorry...

314
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,680
Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?

315
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,490
HaHa. Very funny!

316
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,720
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

317
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,670
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's supposed to hate you.

318
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,820
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

319
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,850
You know... I'm really exhausted.

320
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,400
We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

321
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,940
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager.

322
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,800
He's gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

323
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,940
That sounds fun!

324
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,880
- Nyah... I'm good. - He's tired!

325
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,160
Stu, one drink with your friends

326
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,100
who came all this way.

327
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,570
I just wanna hang out with you!

328
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,510
Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

329
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,810
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.

330
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,720
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

331
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,780
- Alright. One drink! - Perfect.

332
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,930
- See you later. - Have fun!

333
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,160
- You have the key? - Yep, got it right here!

334
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,040
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

335
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,260
My uncle Roger said that he once saw an albino polar bear.

336
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,710
Really? Polar bears are white.

337
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,410
How would he know if it's an albino?

338
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,120
This one was black.

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,160
Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?

340
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,990
Whatelse...

341
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,110
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

342
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,640
- Sealed bottle! - Thank you. Alright!

343
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,240
I'm not really old enough to drink.

344
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,390
Yeah, it's illegal.

345
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,270
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

346
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,270
Nobody's reporting anybody. It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

347
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,240
Careful!

348
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,930
What is this? Instant marshmallows? Nice touch!

349
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,470
- That was Alan's idea. - Good thinking, Al!

350
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,930
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu! This place is paradise.

351
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,090
Not bad, right?

352
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,150
And I can't believe I'm saying this,

353
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,640
but I'm actually jealous of you.

354
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,870
I mean, Lauren is an angel.

355
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,750
Yeah, she really is amazing.

356
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,270
Wow, you guys are sweet.

357
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,590
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid rack for an Asian.

358
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,380
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true. - That's ok.

359
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,380
That is just wildly inappropriate.

360
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,100
And yet... I'm really glad you're here.

361
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,130
All you guys. Even you Alan.

362
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,380
It means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.

363
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,840
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy. - Great!

364
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,450
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

365
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,360
Alright. Toast! C'mon, stand up guys.

366
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,900
Come over here, Alan!

367
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,190
To Lauren and Stu!

368
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,490
- You did it, buddy. - Sure did.

369
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,150
Cheers!

370
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,920
What the hell...

371
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,580
What?

372
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,830
Phil...

373
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,730
I think it happened again.

374
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,120
Alan, what the fuck did you do?

375
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,540
I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

376
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,370
Your hair is gone.

377
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,740
No, no... up.

378
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,020
Where the fuck are we?

379
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,990
Phil, I'm scared.

380
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,070
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

381
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,940
- Oh, holy shit! - Where are we?

382
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,200
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head. - No your head!

383
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,140
- Is it bald? - Stu,

384
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,930
you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

385
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,820
- Why? Was it my teeth? - Nope, it's not your teeth.

386
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,410
- Are you sure? - Yep.

387
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,250
Can you see the bottom?

388
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,560
Oh my god! What the fuck!

389
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,860
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

390
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,960
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

391
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,540
Alan, what did you do!

392
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,630
- Did you Roofie me? - I didn't do anything!

393
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,090
Stu, he swore to god!

394
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,010
What happened?

395
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,470
Get it off of me!

396
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,710
- What the hell? - It's a monkey.

397
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,360
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

398
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,230
Alan...

399
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,600
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

400
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,430
I got it!

401
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,350
- Doug, where the hell are you? - I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

402
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,470
You guys coming down or what?

403
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,390
Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

404
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,710
Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.

405
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,470
Why aren't we at the resort.

406
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,160
What's going on? Where are you guys?

407
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,140
I do not know, man!

408
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,590
We woke up in some shithole room in some city.

409
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,020
- Oh god. What city? - I don't know, Doug!

410
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,740
Fuckin Asia-town.

411
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,540
- I do not know, I told you. - Where are we?

412
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,220
- Hey Stu. - What?

413
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,340
Check this out.

414
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,770
Ever seen anything like this?

415
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,310
- What is that? - Careful. Might be a spider's nest.

416
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,310
I've tangled with those before.

417
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,850
I don't get it man.

418
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,330
We each had one beer last night, right? I mean you too!

419
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,990
- Yeah. But I left early, remember? - I don't remember shit!

420
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,600
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came down to get me.

421
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,910
Wait a second. Is Teddy with you guys?

422
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,420
Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

423
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,090
He wasn't in his room. They've been looking for him all morning.

424
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,580
- Teddy went to Stanford, right? - Yeah. Why?

425
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,480
Fuck!

426
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,170
- I just found his finger! - What?

427
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,840
I just found his fucking finger, Doug!

428
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,700
Phil, what is going on?

429
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,730
Alright. Alright, alright... this is what we're gonna do.

430
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,060
You tell the girls that we woke up early

431
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,040
and went on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

432
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,170
- Right. - Right, stay by the phone!

433
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,640
Shit!

434
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,900
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

435
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,920
What is that?

436
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,580
We don't know.

437
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,570
- Is it a worm? - It's a mushroom.

438
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,170
Yeah, shiitake.

439
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,030
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

440
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,530
- He can't understand you. - He just did.

441
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,540
- Why is he pulling on it? - He's probably hungry.

442
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,870
Wait a second. Is that...

443
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,370
What the fuck, man! Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone!

444
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,480
Chow?

445
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,700
You're fucking crazy.

446
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,600
It's so fucking light in here! Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

447
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
It's great to see you, Leslie!

448
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,730
Nice to see you too my little popo.

449
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,950
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

450
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,140
Alan called me a few days ago and invited me to the wedding.

451
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,620
- Excuse me? - What, he's my plus one.

452
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,100
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

453
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,720
Guys, guys. Just focus, okay? Chow, what happened?

454
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,530
You guys texted me, said you're fucked up and looking to party.

455
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,810
I picked you up on my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.

456
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,460
But we had a sick night, bitches!

457
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,470
Wait a second Chow, we're in Bangkok?

458
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,160
Holler, city of squalor.

459
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,630
Do you know how I got this tattoo?

460
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,310
Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

461
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,860
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

462
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,170
What's the monkey holding?

463
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,650
- That's a finger! - Stu, I got some bad news.

464
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,090
Teddy was with us last night. That's his finger.

465
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,580
- Teddy's dead? - Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

466
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,480
- Well then where is he? - Don't you remember anything?

467
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,140
- No! - No, nothing, Chow.

468
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,200
Okay, I explain it all, okay?

469
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,850
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight. Come to papa.

470
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,470
That's a big...

471
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,520
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

472
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Chow!

473
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,220
Hey Chow, you okay?

474
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,900
You gotta be kidding me.

475
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,880
Fuck, he's dead!

476
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,810
- Help! - Stu!

477
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,460
- Help! - Stu, shut up!

478
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,240
- Call an ambulance! - Shut up! He's dead!

479
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,960
Look, if someone comes and

480
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,240
finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

481
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,550
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking lives in a Thai prison.

482
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,280
Alan! Please don't cry!

483
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,420
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to figure this out.

484
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,000
Ice machine located on 15th floor.

485
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,570
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

486
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,750
What the fuck is this place?

487
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,470
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.

488
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,780
Its population is 12 million people...

489
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,480
Alan, will you help!

490
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,750
- The elevator! - I'll get the button!

491
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,790
What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?

492
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,070
That monkey gets it!

493
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,620
- Come on! - Fuck no!

494
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,290
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

495
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,890
- Oh fuck! - Come on!

496
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,520
Here it is!

497
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,310
Feet first. I've done this before.

498
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,930
Careful!

499
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,160
- Stu! - What?

500
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,200
- We still have to find Teddy! - Oh god.

501
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,060
The roof!

502
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,620
Teddy!

503
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,600
- You guys see him? - No!

504
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,250
He's not here.

505
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,690
I can't believe this is happening again.

506
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,200
Okay, look. We'll handle this. You get back there.

507
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,420
You tell them that Alan and

508
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,550
I got drunk with him, we're still partying.

509
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,470
- You gotta go get married! - No! Not going back without Teddy!

510
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,600
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost, he's injured.

511
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,080
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

512
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,160
Okay.

513
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,930
Alright.

514
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,490
- Alan, check your pockets! - What?

515
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,660
You know the drill. C'mon there might be clues.

516
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,310
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts. - That's a good idea!

517
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,130
- I got nothing. Fuck! - I got an text from Chow.

518
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,110
- What time? - Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

519
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,070
- What's it say? - "On my way, Niggahs"

520
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,960
Oh, niggahs... hip hop.

521
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,030
We are so... fucked!

522
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,590
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

523
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,310
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're too hot.

524
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,950
Phil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate.

525
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,900
For what? To report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?

526
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,070
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around in circles?

527
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,190
Cause that's real productive.

528
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,780
You know I'm trying to figure this thing out here

529
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,820
and your attitude is not helping.

530
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,140
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we don't have a plan.

531
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,510
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

532
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,890
What, it's a bag of Fanta!

533
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,370
Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

534
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,320
I don't know!

535
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,560
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

536
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,950
It is your fault!

537
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,140
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

538
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,700
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

539
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,870
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD.

540
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,240
They've got him. He's ok.

541
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,620
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

542
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,410
- What happened? - He got arrested.

543
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,450
- Arrested? For what? - Disorderly conduct.

544
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,610
- Seriously? - Yeah! He's ok though.

545
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,850
They'll release him to you.

546
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,320
No questions asked. No one has to know.

547
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,930
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

548
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,760
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

549
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,320
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We gotta get a cab.

550
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,900
Okay! Alright!

551
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,160
- Yes, I have his paperwork here. - Okay.

552
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,180
- He has been treated. - Sounds good.

553
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,860
We're good. They've processed him for release.

554
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,330
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

555
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,620
Sixteen years old and spent a night in jail. Can you imagine?

556
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,950
Haha! We love to party.

557
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,190
Here we go!

558
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,050
- Wait, who's this fuckin guy? - Teddy Sisay.

559
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,060
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

560
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,670
Excuse me, I'm sorry, officer.

561
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,900
You brought the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

562
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,530
Of course it is! We have his ID's and everything!

563
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,200
These were in his pocket when we made the arrest.

564
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,730
They were in his pocket?

565
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,710
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

566
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,410
Hello?

567
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,730
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English, Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

568
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,060
Let me ask you something.

569
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,670
Does he look like he works out

570
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,770
at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

571
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:52,220
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything.

572
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,380
- What do you expect us to do with this guy? - Not my problem!

573
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,510
Hey guys, I think he knows us.

574
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,250
You know where our friend is, Teddy? He's missing!

575
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,020
- Stu, forget it. The guy's worthless. - He knows something!

576
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,950
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

577
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,620
Maybe he just doesn't understand.

578
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,680
I'll act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

579
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,290
- Two words. - Is it a movie?

580
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,310
This is not for you, Alan!

581
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,830
- American teenager... in Asia. - Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

582
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,910
It's easy 'cause you're talking to him.

583
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,690
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave this fucking guy here.

584
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,820
Here's something.

585
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,670
There are 500 thousand monks living in Thailand.

586
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,180
It is not uncommon for some monks

587
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,780
to take a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

588
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,290
There you go.

589
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,440
- Anything else in that envelope? - Nah, it's empty.

590
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,600
Hang on, a drink card from White Lion bar in Bangkok?

591
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,240
Worth a shot.

592
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,570
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

593
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,210
That's what it says.

594
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,690
Whoa! This is the White Lion!

595
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,950
What the fuck happened here?

596
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,090
Holy shit!

597
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,510
- Let's... - We should probably...

598
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,790
That's ok.

599
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,730
What the fuck is going on here?

600
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,170
Whoa, guys. Check it out!

601
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,040
Holy shit! Stu, look!

602
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,600
That's my face.

603
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,230
Nice work, Alan!

604
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,400
- Hello? - Be with you in a minute!

605
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,200
- Excuse me. - Oh, look who it is!

606
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,040
- So what do ya think? - What, I'm sorry?

607
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:19,390
- The tattoo. You love it? - Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

608
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,940
- No refunds. Get the fuck out! - Wait a second!

609
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,050
Read the sign!

610
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,400
We don't want any refunds. We just have a couple of questions.

611
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,980
We're trying to figure out what went down last night.

612
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,870
What went down? Take a look at what you did outside.

613
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,310
Half the neighborhood went down.

614
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,800
- We did that? - You don't

615
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,220
remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

616
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,530
Starting a full-on fucking riot?

617
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,270
Sir, we don't remember anything.

618
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,940
Oh boy...

619
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,120
Check this out!

620
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,980
Oh shit!

621
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,210
Fuck the Police!

622
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,350
There's Teddy! He was with us!

623
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,560
Jesus christ!

624
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,370
That's when the cops arrived and started cracking skulls.

625
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,880
I took you guys and hid you in the shop here.

626
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,240
Then you decided to get a tattoo. You cried like a little bitch.

627
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,170
This kid is fucking nine years old.

628
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,890
He's got balls twice your size.

629
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,630
- Show him your balls, Nao! - No, no, no. That's ok.

630
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,520
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?

631
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,860
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

632
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry

633
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,960
his sister tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

634
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,340
- Oh well. Then fuck it! - What do you mean, fuck it?

635
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,510
Bangkok has him now and she'll never let him go.

636
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,990
You hear that, huh? Is this what you wanted? You happy now?

637
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,260
You're wasting your time.

638
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,540
These monks take their vow shit seriously.

639
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,240
Look at this. That's the sign

640
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,890
of the Chang Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

641
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,400
Maybe somebody over there can get him to talk.

642
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,060
Ok, can we just go over this one more time?

643
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,440
You got the beer from...

644
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,460
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.

645
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,900
- But, who gave it to you? - The bartender.

646
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,910
And then you brought them out and I opened them.

647
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,700
Yeah, and Doug had one and he was fine, so it's not the beer.

648
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,630
- So what the hell happened? - I have no idea!

649
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,960
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a Chinese boner.

650
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,570
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

651
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,620
- That is so wrong! - Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

652
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,550
When a monkey nibbles on a penis, it's funny in any language!

653
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,490
Keep doing it!

654
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,800
Alright, thank you!

655
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,140
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

656
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,870
Wow! So beautiful!

657
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,000
What is this, a PF Chang's?

658
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,860
Ah, they're meditating.

659
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,930
- Such a peaceful people! - Yeah.

660
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,380
- Knock, knock! Hello! - Alan! Show some respect!

661
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,570
- Don't get up guys. - We brought one of your guys back.

662
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,410
He's really funny. He's really nice and cool.

663
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,980
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

664
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,760
- Excuse me... ow... Wait! - Stop it! Calm down!

665
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,940
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

666
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,630
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

667
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,140
Wait, it's me!

668
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,080
Oh I get it.

669
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,920
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

670
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,090
Ok.

671
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,780
Late last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery.

672
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,450
Shouting out questions about love,

673
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,180
marriage and the meaning of life.

674
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:17,310
Poor brother Han was meditating alone in the garden.

675
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,100
- And you took him. - Oh my god!

676
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,490
- We kidnapped a monk. - We live an alternative life style.

677
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,060
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't ourselves last night.

678
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,800
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little bit.

679
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,230
But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

680
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,020
Can you find out if he knows where our friend is?

681
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,860
Brother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.

682
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,200
It would be useless to try.

683
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,490
Well maybe he can write down what happened, on a piece of paper?

684
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,160
Actually Phil, that would be cheating.

685
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:54,540
Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

686
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,450
- Alan! - I'm afraid fatty is right.

687
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,200
See?... What?

688
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,270
None of us will ever know what brother Han knows.

689
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,100
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people.

690
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,130
Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

691
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,770
Hey you know what! FYI,

692
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,420
You may want to put some signs up that say no talking...

693
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,780
before you unleash your dragon.

694
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,980
Yeah, that was a little rough.

695
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,830
And "You are welcome" for bringing him back safe.

696
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,330
You know we found him in the drunk tank.

697
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,950
Yeah well, we did take him in the first place.

698
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,590
- C'mon guys, let's go. - Wait!

699
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,840
The Buddha teach, every memory lives somewhere deep within.

700
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,210
Perhaps you should bring your question

701
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,470
to the Garden of Meditation.

702
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,620
Did you understand a word he just said?

703
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,630
Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

704
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,830
He said something about the Garden of Meditation?

705
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,820
No, he said he's farting because of his medication.

706
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,510
I get that.

707
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,680
It's a waste of time. I don't remember anything. Do you?

708
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,990
No. I got nothing. Alan?

709
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,320
Alan!

710
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,610
"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"

711
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,680
- Sweetie. - What?

712
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:15,950
You have visitors.

713
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,850
- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys!

714
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,190
- Hey, Phil. - Hey buddy!

715
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,290
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

716
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:26,170
- Is this true, Stuart? - Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.

717
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,840
Fuck!

718
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,220
- For Lauren and Stu! - Cheers!

719
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,980
- Chow! - We had a sick night, bitches!

720
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,940
Alan, what the fuck!

721
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,750
Is that person coming to the wedding?

722
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,820
- There is no wolfpack. - Alan, Alan, don't do that!

723
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,760
And finally... The three best friends anyone could have.

724
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,430
Fuck the Police!

725
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,530
I know where to go.

726
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:24,300
- What do you think, Alan? - This is the place.

727
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,630
C'mon. Let's go.

728
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,330
I don't remember any of this!

729
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,120
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place? - Yeah, pretty sure.

730
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,130
Rose! Harmony!

731
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,100
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting all day for him.

732
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:55,770
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who? - Chow, that dick ass fuck!

733
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,080
- Why? What's wrong? - Nothings wrong.

734
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
Ok, good. Look at this.

735
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,770
Look what I bring for him. Check it out, huh.

736
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,960
- No, no! - $ 6,000 American.

737
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,200
Wow looks so real!

738
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,780
Sorry!

739
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,610
It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

740
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,960
Everybody ok?

741
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,830
Ok, then get the fuck back to work! Come on. Music, please!

742
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,270
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

743
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,890
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal.

744
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,290
We got nothing to do with that.

745
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,280
Un-fucking believable.

746
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,560
This guy, if he backs out again,

747
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,530
the shits gonna catch up with him.

748
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,290
He's made a lot of enemies in this town,

749
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,850
and now they're gonna be your enemies.

750
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,050
That's not fair!

751
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,900
Ok listen. We're just looking for a little kid.

752
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,890
- 2,000 dollars. - What!

753
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,820
I don't know, maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?

754
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,880
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood.

755
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,790
We're looking for our friend... 16 years old.

756
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,560
- Teddy. - Teddy?

757
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,050
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night. - He was?

758
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,280
Do you know if he left with us?

759
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,420
I don't know. You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.

760
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,280
- I didn't see you leave. - Kimmy?

761
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,130
- Is she here? - Yes, she's in the back.

762
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,420
She just came for her shit.

763
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,600
Go and talk to her.

764
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,990
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything that happened.

765
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,830
Listen to me, ok?

766
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,300
Pay attention to what I'm going to talk to you know.

767
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,530
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir says "Hello".

768
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,440
Okay!

769
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,160
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" Like threatening. Like, ironic.

770
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,360
- "Hellooo" - Okay!

771
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,890
Go away! Go away!

772
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:50,280
Of course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.

773
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,910
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

774
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,520
You have no idea.

775
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,250
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

776
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,120
Yeah, you were all leaving together,

777
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,110
but you almost forgot this one right here.

778
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,110
Right, super star?

779
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,020
This one was following me

780
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,700
around like a little puppy dog. All night.

781
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,980
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked me to marry him.

782
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,960
Classic Stu!

783
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,600
- We didn't get married, did we? - Course not!

784
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,090
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

785
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:26,810
- What happens in the Chardonnay room? - Let's just stay on task.

786
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:30,990
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

787
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,950
- Fuck! - It's ok. You're not married yet.

788
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,610
- No big deal. - It's cheating!

789
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,230
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

790
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,270
It's a violation of my moral code.

791
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,090
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it.

792
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,530
You were crying, saying how special it was.

793
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:51,440
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying? - What a baby. He was crying.

794
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,920
You should have seen him.

795
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,330
He was so sexy. The way he moved around.

796
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,220
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't drop my load too quick.

797
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,610
- Load? What load? - Oh, you know... My sperms.

798
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,550
I think your English is off. You're talking about my sperm!

799
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,670
- Where would your sperm come from? - From my balls!

800
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:20,330
- Hold on! Back up! - Wait... Are you...

801
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,770
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

802
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,290
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt". - Oh!

803
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,940
- Oh god! - Wow.

804
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,080
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

805
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,080
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed at the same time.

806
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,160
How's that work?

807
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,310
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load on the floor.

808
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:53,890
- Ok! - You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

809
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,110
Oh god!

810
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,290
Stu! It's not the end of the world.

811
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,380
Sorry, but I'm so confused.

812
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,480
I made love to a man... with boobies.

813
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,760
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna find out about this.

814
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,320
But we found out about it.

815
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,420
And then we forget. That's what we do!

816
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,110
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just forget about it.

817
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,570
- Yeah? - Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

818
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,110
That might be harder to go away, but in time it'll happen.

819
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:37,150
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

820
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,930
- Never happened. - Great!

821
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,530
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

822
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,880
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

823
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,780
- Answer it! - I can't.

824
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,440
What! He might know something about Teddy.

825
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,790
C'mon we still have a shot here.

826
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,020
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

827
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,120
Hello?

828
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,190
Who takes an all day fishing trip the day before a wedding?

829
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:08,480
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid. - Put Teddy on the phone.

830
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,880
- Teddy's seasick actually. - Seasick?

831
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,980
Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine.

832
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,180
That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

833
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,830
I'm gonna tell you something that you do not know.

834
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,950
- I don't like you. - Yeah, I knew that already.

835
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,690
If my daughter chooses you, that's her problem.

836
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,260
Hey it's Phil Winnick!

837
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,170
Listen, I apologize. We've been

838
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,470
reelin in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

839
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,930
Phil!

840
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,510
- Jesus! - Phil!

841
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,530
Fuck me!

842
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,910
- Give us back our monkey! - What monkey? Get your own monkey!

843
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,500
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

844
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:46,860
Come on!

845
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,810
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

846
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,070
This is our monkey!

847
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,270
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

848
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,640
Hand him over, now!

849
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,710
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

850
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,830
No, no ...

851
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,830
Hey Phil, check it out.

852
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,270
He's got a banana on his helmet. He's the real deal.

853
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,520
What the fuck's happening?

854
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,890
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you know where our friend is?

855
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:15,940
- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid. -[Russian]

856
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,380
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I didn't understand!

857
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,520
What'd he say?

858
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,930
He said fuck you and your questions!

859
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:29,000
- Oh, my arm! - Philip, are you okay?

860
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:33,480
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

861
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,390
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

862
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,100
We'll figure this out and get the monkey back, I promise.

863
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,740
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

864
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,840
What the fuck is going on?

865
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,220
Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

866
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,120
I don't know, let me look!

867
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,240
What?

868
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,840
Don't look at it!

869
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,450
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

870
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,100
- You got shot! - I know!

871
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,210
- Whoa, you all right? - Yeah, I'm ok.

872
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,530
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm. Eight stitches.

873
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,020
Only cost six dollars. How is that even possible?

874
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,890
How's any of this even possible?

875
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,980
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

876
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,800
What are we gonna do?

877
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,620
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

878
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:56,370
- What plan, Alan? - I've said too much already.

879
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,930
Alan! What plan?

880
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,760
- It's all Teddy's fault. - What are you talking about, Alan?

881
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,100
Why is he even here? He's not part of the wolf pack!

882
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,330
- Alan, what did you do? - It's not my fault!

883
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,500
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

884
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,570
- What bag? - The marshmallows.

885
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,540
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

886
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,430
But it was dark and it was hard to keep track.

887
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,580
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't tell which was which.

888
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,550
- It was mayhem! - What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

889
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,460
Alan, what did you do?

890
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,490
Isn't it obvious?

891
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:45,210
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And plus my ADHD medication.

892
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,320
- What? - You drugged us again?!

893
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,100
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy

894
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,390
for a little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

895
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,890
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that you didn't do anything!

896
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,820
Alan, you swore to god!

897
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,960
I just wanted things to stay the same.

898
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,420
Look at my face! You ruined my life!

899
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,040
You're not my friend!

900
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,860
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious? Even in America?

901
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,980
- Yes! - Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

902
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,990
- Don't start crying, Alan! - You're the bearded devil!

903
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,680
You liked it! You smiled at me

904
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,440
when I handed you the bag with marshmallows.

905
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:23,410
Because I like marshmallows, you fucking psycho!

906
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,270
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

907
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,970
Enough!

908
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,570
- Why, Alan? Why? - Stu!

909
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,280
Because we're the three best friends, remember?

910
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,760
Remember?

911
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,310
Stu, that's enough...

912
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,440
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta stick together.

913
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,920
- Alan, what's that written on your belly? - What? Huh?

914
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,790
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

915
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,480
- You write that? - No!

916
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,400
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

917
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,260
What about England, Phil? Will we still be friends there?

918
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,500
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the moment.

919
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,260
We're still friends. All over the world.

920
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,000
- Even Great Britain? - Yeah.

921
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,780
What about you, Stu?

922
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,550
We'll see.

923
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,090
Gentlemen, follow me.

924
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,040
Here you go.

925
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:47,920
Well. About time! Sit down.

926
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,500
Come on, sit.

927
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,240
Wow, you guys look like shit.

928
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,450
Uh, do we know you?

929
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,750
Take off your fuckin hat.

930
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,920
You're in a restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

931
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,820
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's going on here.

932
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,590
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here, it's fuckin unreal.

933
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,300
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up!

934
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,520
Oh, I'm sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

935
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:26,130
Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you...

936
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,690
You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

937
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:29,820
Where's Chow?

938
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,240
With the fuckin account code and the fuckin password!

939
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,000
We don't know anything about any codes.

940
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,430
We're just trying to find our friend.

941
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,300
- Teddy? - Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

942
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,820
Hmm, let's see...

943
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,910
There's Teddy!

944
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,310
Holy shit! It's from last night.

945
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,830
- Who are you? - I'm a businessman.

946
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:15,250
And I've invested a large chunk of capital in your friend Chow.

947
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,860
And in return, he was

948
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,430
supposed to transfer my profits electronically.

949
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,580
About five fuckin minutes ago.

950
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,360
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

951
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,530
- Oh my god! Is he okay? - Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

952
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,240
You tell Chow, that we are

953
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,560
having breakfast on the roof of this hotel...

954
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,590
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

955
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,920
Or if he makes the transfer, you will get Teddy.

956
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,280
If not well then hey, you know... it's Bangkok.

957
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,140
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

958
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,510
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

959
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,870
Alan leave the hat.

960
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,150
Atta boy.

961
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,980
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

962
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,320
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow,

963
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,500
Stu. This whole things about a fucking bank account.

964
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,520
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll search Chow's body.

965
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,160
Hopefully the password's in his wallet or something.

966
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:35,470
- And what if it isn't? - He's gonna kill Teddy.

967
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:39,130
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow to figure it out.

968
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,440
First the monkey and now my hat. How much worse can this day get.

969
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,240
Jesus christ!

970
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,660
Well we're livin here in Alan town.

971
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,950
And he's drivin our lives into the ground.

972
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:16,400
When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.

973
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,810
Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.

974
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,670
I was happy, and my life was good.

975
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:34,250
Getting married like a dentist should.

976
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,370
Roasting marshmallows on a stick.

977
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:44,780
I got fucked in the ass... by a girl with a dick.

978
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,080
Oh yeah, remember that.

979
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,080
And we're livin in Alan town.

980
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:57,970
There's water everywhere.

981
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,980
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The fuckin powers out.

982
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,170
With an inadequate electrical grid, serving millions of people

983
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,450
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

984
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,320
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

985
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,760
Out of the way!

986
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,560
We got it.

987
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,280
Oh my god!

988
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,280
Chow, calm down!

989
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,550
- You put the chill on me? - No, no!

990
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,440
It's okay.

991
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,130
Relax!

992
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,620
It's just us. Breathe!

993
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,080
It was so cold.

994
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,350
- We're gonna warm you up. - I was so cold!

995
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:02,410
- You did good, buddy. You did good. - I did good.

996
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,000
Feelin better?

997
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:13,430
- Alright, you warm enough? - I don't know.

998
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,080
Come feel my balls and tell me.

999
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,180
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box all day!

1000
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,580
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

1001
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,690
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

1002
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,600
Chow, nobody killed you.

1003
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
You were already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

1004
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,750
Oh, you never do blow before?

1005
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,170
Sometimes your heart stop... start up again.

1006
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:36,790
- Read a book! - Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

1007
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,370
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

1008
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,620
- I got shot! - But did you die?

1009
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:48,250
Chow, some guy told us that you got a bank code or something...

1010
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,290
...and if we don't bring it to him first think in the morning...

1011
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:52,960
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

1012
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,940
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

1013
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,870
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am.

1014
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,010
Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

1015
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:08,520
- An investor in my business. - Yeah, what business is that?

1016
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,190
It's called "Not your business" Ok!

1017
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:15,280
- Oh, where's the monkey? - The monkey...

1018
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,980
Yeah I put the account number

1019
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,540
and password in his vest. Where is he?

1020
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,860
- Why would you do that? - Safe keeping, pretty boy.

1021
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,640
I got a lotta heat on my ass.

1022
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:33,330
I got FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

1023
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,920
That little monkey snorting coke with me all night...

1024
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,650
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make fuckin lady boy.

1025
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:43,250
- He not going anywhere. - We don't have the monkey, Chow.

1026
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:46,160
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

1027
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,980
Oh you fucking guys!

1028
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,820
Okay. No problem. We just have to get him back.

1029
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:56,370
- From where? - From the same place we took him from.

1030
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,140
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

1031
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,550
Every night, monkey drug mule.

1032
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,760
He take coke to buyer...

1033
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:46,480
And deliver cash to dealer. He middle man.

1034
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:49,630
Dealer never handle drug directly.

1035
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,480
He clean.

1036
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,360
- That's terrible. - Not terrible.

1037
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,020
What he talking about. Fucking genius.

1038
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,150
You ever see monkey go to jail?

1039
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,880
We just take the monkey for deal,

1040
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,470
he come close, we take his vest. That's that.

1041
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,290
We get some blow too, you know...

1042
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,590
- bump. - No, no more bumps, Chow.

1043
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,390
This is ridiculous.

1044
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,580
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your monkey.

1045
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,330
Alright, here we go.

1046
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,590
Come on!

1047
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,010
How did we wind up with the monkey last night anyway?

1048
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,520
I needed some blow and Alan thought he was cute...

1049
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,650
...so we stole him!

1050
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,610
So stupid!

1051
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:02,310
Stu, ready to grab vest?

1052
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:06,920
- Okay. I just grab it? - Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

1053
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,050
- Hey, little monkey. - Alan, be quiet.

1054
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,870
- Fuck! - We gotta go, right now!

1055
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,400
- Pull that fuckin monkey in! - I'm trying!

1056
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,700
- Get that monkey in here, Stu! - He won't let go!

1057
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,040
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

1058
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,510
I'm trying! Slow down!

1059
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,950
He's so strong!

1060
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,160
Let go you fuckin monkey!

1061
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:57,210
- Look out! - Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

1062
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,420
I got him!

1063
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:07,490
- Where's the code, Chow? - Check his little vest.

1064
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,220
- Got it, Alan? - Yes, I got a code.

1065
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:16,880
- Slow down Chow! - Hold on, J-Birds.

1066
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,870
Holy Shit!

1067
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:25,340
Don't worry. I got this shit!

1068
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,540
Pig!

1069
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,580
Oh, my word.

1070
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,370
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

1071
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,530
Oh, shit!

1072
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,770
Get down!

1073
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,810
What the fuck!

1074
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,290
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

1075
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,290
They shot the monkey.

1076
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:56,230
I'm at my wits end.

1077
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,700
He's coming back around.

1078
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,720
Look out!

1079
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,510
- Holy fuck! - Oh no...

1080
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:30,900
- Everybody alright? - Yeah.

1081
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:34,650
I have such an erection right now!

1082
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,810
Are you for real?

1083
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,560
They're gonna take good care of you here, ok.

1084
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:01,460
What's that?

1085
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:08,840
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here. Here you go.

1086
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,560
Right here.

1087
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,610
Deep breathe. Good.

1088
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,760
Soak it in.

1089
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,150
Breathe the smoke into your tiny little lungs. There you go.

1090
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:31,660
It's funny. I've never been much of a smoker, but...

1091
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,990
Boy does it look cool on you.

1092
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:38,200
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

1093
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:43,130
I'll miss you, monkey.

1094
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,050
I wish monkeys could Skype.

1095
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,660
Maybe one day...

1096
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,710
Come on! Get in!

1097
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:24,140
If I could save time in the bottle

1098
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:29,250
The first thing  that I'd like to do

1099
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,450
Is to save every day

1100
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:36,220
Till eternity passes away

1101
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,380
just to spend them with you

1102
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,240
Are you guys seriously this calm?

1103
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,110
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

1104
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:45,100
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

1105
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,510
You ever do anything that doesn't

1106
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:48,030
end up in a standoff, Chow?

1107
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,330
I'm an international criminal. It always ends like this.

1108
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,460
I met my wife at one of these things.

1109
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,570
- You got a wife? - Yeah, we married 15 years.

1110
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,770
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

1111
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:03,980
No, that's cool.

1112
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,660
Let's do this!

1113
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,710
- Welcome to the Tower Club. - Blah blah blah, who cares.

1114
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,520
Stop! Chow crossing.

1115
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,330
- Hey, Kingsley! - Well, well.

1116
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:22,300
Propecia looking nice!

1117
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:24,640
You been hitting the gym?

1118
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:28,100
Yes I am actually. Thank you for noticing, Chow.

1119
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,930
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

1120
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:34,220
- Where's Teddy? - He's waiting downstairs in my car.

1121
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,740
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

1122
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,880
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.

1123
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,370
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

1124
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,380
- Chow.. Chow... - Could we move this along!

1125
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,940
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

1126
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:56,830
8-1-4,

1127
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,110
K as in knife,

1128
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:02,570
2398.

1129
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,390
- Password? - "Baloney1"

1130
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,500
Your password is "Baloney1" ?

1131
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,890
Well it used to be just "Baloney"

1132
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,800
But now they make you add number.

1133
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,630
Fuckin annoying.

1134
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,790
- And it's that easy. - Ta dah!

1135
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,090
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

1136
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,520
Great, now can we please have Teddy?

1137
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,950
Yeah. Bring him up.

1138
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:43,280
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I bust a nut.

1139
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,390
We did it, Stu. It's over!

1140
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,430
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

1141
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,670
Oh, nuts!

1142
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,100
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

1143
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,580
Gotcha, Leslie!

1144
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:07,170
Get him outta here.

1145
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,710
Go! Just do it! Go!

1146
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,160
How the fuck...

1147
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:19,620
Samir, you fucked me over six grand?

1148
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,860
You camel jockey!

1149
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,950
You spit on me?

1150
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,550
Six grand this time, eight grand last time.

1151
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,660
It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

1152
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,520
Principle? Nigga, please!

1153
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,650
We both dead inside.

1154
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,960
Call me nigga... don't call me "Nigga"!

1155
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,050
- Put em in, motherfucker! - He's an asshole, man.

1156
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,920
You guys ok?

1157
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,290
What the fucks going on?

1158
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:45,350
Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

1159
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:46,660
- You're a cop? - Yes.

1160
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,950
This sting operation has been in place for weeks.

1161
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,590
When Samir told us that your friend was lost...

1162
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,500
We took advantage of that information. I'm sorry.

1163
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,910
So can Teddy come out of the car now?

1164
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:02,290
No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

1165
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:04,120
They don't have him. They never had him.

1166
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,970
They just needed us to bring them Chow.

1167
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,890
They used Teddy as bait.

1168
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,860
Do you have any leads at all?

1169
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,450
No. We've checked everywhere.

1170
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:15,330
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1171
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,480
If you haven't found him by now,

1172
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,310
I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

1173
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,540
Why do people keep saying that?

1174
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:34,670
Stu... It's time.

1175
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,210
Alan...

1176
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:47,070
- I'm sorry. - Don't say that. Please.

1177
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:51,400
- No this time we really fucked up. - Oh god! How bad?

1178
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,470
Like, no wedding bad?

1179
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:57,070
Yeah... A little worse than that!

1180
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,320
Ok, how about this?

1181
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,950
He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

1182
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:30,490
No.

1183
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:35,070
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1184
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:39,300
- Alan! - Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1185
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,850
How many people get run over here?

1186
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,450
- Over 1200 a year, Phil. - Perfect!

1187
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:48,090
His body was too mangled to recover. Case closed.

1188
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,260
Can I get more ice, please?

1189
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,280
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1190
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,740
Stu, do you want this or not?

1191
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:01,890
Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1192
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,960
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All kinds, apparently.

1193
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:19,070
- I have a demon in me! - So what?

1194
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:23,430
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1195
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,560
Just let her live her life without me.

1196
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,680
Stu!

1197
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,610
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm never coming back.

1198
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,460
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1199
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,060
Gonna stay here in Bangkok. I think I belong here.

1200
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,910
Open up a little dentists office.

1201
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,440
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1202
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,170
You sure about this?

1203
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,290
Hey, what the crud!

1204
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:03,300
Powers out, Alan.

1205
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:09,110
- Phil! - Doug.

1206
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:12,250
- I need answers, man. - I know...

1207
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:13,460
Doug, who are you talking to?

1208
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,190
- What? - Give me the phone!

1209
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,430
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1210
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:16,690
Who is this?

1211
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:20,600
- Lauren? - Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1212
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,580
We lost your little brother.

1213
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:25,820
- What? - Bangkok has him now.

1214
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,160
You gotta take the stairs.

1215
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,160
You're in Bangkok?

1216
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,340
Ooh, that's a finger!

1217
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,870
Put Stu on the phone!

1218
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:50,410
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

1219
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,890
Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.

1220
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:54,730
Water everywhere. Powers out.

1221
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:57,180
Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain

1222
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,750
Phil! Give me the phone!

1223
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,070
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it! - I know!

1224
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,940
- Give me the fuckin... - I can handle it, Stu!

1225
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,370
She's gonna break your heart!

1226
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:10,990
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

1227
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,430
Stu? What the hell is going on?

1228
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,990
What does he mean you lost Teddy?

1229
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,240
What? Is that what Phil said?

1230
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,810
No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1231
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,160
But we're all good now. We

1232
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,270
heading back to the hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

1233
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:27,460
I love you so much! And I gotta go,

1234
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,090
but I'll see you soon. Bye.

1235
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:33,190
Stu!

1236
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,130
- Stu! - God!

1237
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:40,890
Taxi!

1238
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,550
Come on, Alan!

1239
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,890
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1240
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:51,340
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1241
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,840
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1242
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,020
- In a pool of water. - But it didn't start out as water.

1243
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,190
No, it was ice.

1244
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:01,090
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1245
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:01,910
...came back to the room.

1246
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,750
Put his finger on ice and fell asleep.

1247
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,730
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1248
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:05,820
...and you find your finger floating

1249
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,190
in a bowl of melted ice?

1250
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,130
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th fuckin floor!

1251
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:14,190
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1252
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:19,380
- Holy shit! Of course! - He's at the ice machine.

1253
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,370
Alan, no!

1254
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:26,160
It's on ten!

1255
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,070
Sir, is the elevator stuck?

1256
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,160
- C'mon! - Go, go, go!

1257
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,340
Hey, Teddy!

1258
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,030
Look out, look out!

1259
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,490
- Teddy! - You're ok!

1260
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,010
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

1261
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,740
- Where am I? - You're in an elevator,

1262
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,030
in the middle of Bangkok.

1263
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,280
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's gonna be fine.

1264
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:03,760
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

1265
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,360
Thanks, man.

1266
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,750
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

1267
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:12,430
Tell 'em we found him. Yeah,

1268
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:16,520
I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

1269
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,040
Alright, guests are arriving, people

1270
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,310
starting to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1271
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,910
- How? - I don't know, with a taxi?

1272
01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:26,610
- Chow's speed boat. - What?

1273
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:29,180
Last thing I remember, was getting off Chow's speed boat.

1274
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,630
- Chow has a speed boat? - "The Perfect Life".

1275
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,750
C'mon!

1276
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,380
Stu, get that back line.

1277
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:43,910
Good jump, Phil!

1278
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,600
- You alright? - Yeah.

1279
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,330
You sure you know how to drive this thing?

1280
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,600
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I know what I'm doing.

1281
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,800
You know where we're going?

1282
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,000
Leave it to the Captain!

1283
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,870
Oh fuck you, Alan!

1284
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,720
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

1285
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,560
Affirmative cadet! We're going south.

1286
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,940
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand. - Good.

1287
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:00,090
Hey! You okay?

1288
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,230
- Feeling a little better. - Alright!

1289
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,100
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry!

1290
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,050
We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1291
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:16,070
It's funny. I can't remember anything But...

1292
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:20,150
when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

1293
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,400
Yeah!

1294
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,880
By the way... Do you have any idea where my finger is?

1295
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,250
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing monkey.

1296
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,400
Bangkok...

1297
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:39,580
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

1298
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:55,830
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

1299
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:58,110
He is on his way. He will be here...

1300
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:00,760
Please, if you will all move to the bar.

1301
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,570
We are going to clear this area.

1302
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,620
Please!

1303
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,670
I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.

1304
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,850
Look! There they are!

1305
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,090
Stu!

1306
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:30,210
- Alan, there's no dock. - Just hang on!

1307
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,060
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat! - Hang on!

1308
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,210
- Is that Alan driving the boat? - What?

1309
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:39,030
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1310
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,480
Oh my god!

1311
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,380
Turn the boat!

1312
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:46,120
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1313
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,050
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1314
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,870
Hi! Hi everybody!

1315
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:11,980
Came in a little hotter than we planned.

1316
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,420
I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1317
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,690
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll be fine.

1318
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,470
- Baby! - Oh my god!

1319
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:21,770
I'm so happy to see you!

1320
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:28,270
- Teddy! Teddy here. - Hi, Dad!

1321
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:31,400
- You alright? - Yeah, ok.

1322
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,100
- Your hand! - I know.

1323
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,250
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1324
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,610
This is your fault!

1325
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:43,470
- Dad. - He's right. But swich side with Lauren...

1326
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,530
I have not been completely honest.

1327
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,160
- Stu? Don't do this. - Yeah?

1328
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,060
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1329
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:54,610
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1330
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,050
I'm not some weird, milky,

1331
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:00,380
ricy, watery that you

1332
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,950
feed to infants and old people, ok!

1333
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:06,910
Maybe I would be if you added some cayenne pepper!

1334
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,270
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1335
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:13,510
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1336
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,210
... but I don't and I'm not.

1337
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,540
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1338
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,130
It's not weird. It's pretty cool actually. No membership fees.

1339
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:24,660
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1340
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:28,850
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1341
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,360
I got a dark side!

1342
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,740
There's a demon in me!

1343
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:38,180
It's true, he has semen in him.

1344
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,330
I said demon.

1345
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:43,200
But you also have semen in you, remember?

1346
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,160
-  - Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1347
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,790
The point is, this demon takes

1348
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:53,260
me to some pretty weird places.

1349
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,320
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1350
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:01,380
But that same demon took us to hell and back to find him.

1351
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,700
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1352
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,500
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1353
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,840
I love your daughter, and I'm gonna marry her.

1354
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,060
- Unless you have any problem with that? - I'm good.

1355
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:22,480
But all that said, it would

1356
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:25,270
actually mean a great deal to both of us...

1357
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:28,550
...if we could just get your mother fucking blessing!

1358
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,760
Hey, Alan...

1359
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,900
- That looks pretty cool shaved. - Thanks, Phil.

1360
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,280
You should shave your head too.

1361
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,000
Why would I do that?

1362
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:58,050
Well than we would look exactly alike.

1363
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,210
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu. - I will.

1364
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,310
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with the boat.

1365
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:25,760
Just happy you're here.

1366
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,410
And don't worry about the tattoo.

1367
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:32,630
I'm gonna have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1368
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,810
- That's ok. I can get used to it. - Really?

1369
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,720
But for now, let's switch sides?

1370
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,560
- Yeah, ok. - Thank you.

1371
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,250
Much better.

1372
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:52,870
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

1373
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:57,300
...I welcome all of you, to this marriage celebration.

1374
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,960
We are here today to...

1375
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,410
I walked along the avenue

1376
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,180
I never thought I'd meet girl like you

1377
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:46,550
Meet girl like you

1378
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:52,590
And I ran so far away

1379
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:55,040
I couldn't get away

1380
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,650
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

1381
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,760
Thank you.

1382
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:10,140
Hello? Hi everyone!

1383
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:14,210
My name's Alan Garner.

1384
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:18,160
I want to thank the Asiatic people

1385
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,820
for allowing us in your land.

1386
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:26,670
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really happy to be here...

1387
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:30,870
...and I have a wedding gift to present to Lauren and Stu.

1388
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:34,760
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

1389
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,130
...and I hope that you

1390
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:39,350
appreciate it as much as I did, or going to.

1391
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,130
Okay, guys!

1392
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,780
Alan!

1393
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,470
What the fuck?

1394
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:28,540
So what do ya think?

1395
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,040
That's insane! How did you do that?

1396
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,670
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

1397
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:34,720
I told Mike that you gotta do it.

1398
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,360
It's for my third best friend.

1399
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,910
Alan, it's amazing! I love it! Thank you so much!

1400
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,260
We only have him for tonight.

1401
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,860
We don't have him permanently.

1402
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,630
Understood!

1403
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:06,370
- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan? - I barely?

1404
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,910
Mike, you were great. It's true, that was incredible.

1405
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:14,740
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

1406
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,260
By the way, you really need

1407
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,400
to remove that fuckin tattoo from your face!

1408
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,050
Yeah! On it!

1409
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:24,290
Sorry about the last minute change

1410
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,380
up to the performance, Mike.

1411
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,180
- Don't worry, Alan. - What are you talking about?

1412
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:28,530
Well he was originally supposed

1413
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,350
to sing "Burning Up" By the Jonas Brothers...

1414
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:32,170
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1415
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,380
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

1416
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,690
- Is that your phone? - Yeah.

1417
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,870
How come you never tried calling us?

1418
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,670
It's been dead for two days.

1419
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:44,390
But I recharged it and found all these photos.

1420
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:45,300
What?

1421
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,950
- Shit! - Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

1422
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:50,320
- Awesome, let's check em out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1423
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:52,560
No one needs to see this stuff!

1424
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,320
C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

1425
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:56,490
It'll be fine.

1426
01:36:56,490 --> 01:37:01,200
Alright, we look at it once.

1427
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,960
And then we delete them. It's gonna be ok.

1428
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,980
Mother fucker!
