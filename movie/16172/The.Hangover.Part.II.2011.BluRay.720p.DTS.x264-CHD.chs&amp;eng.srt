00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,055
嗨！我是斯图亚特・普莱斯医生 我要结婚了
(voice-mail) Hi! This is Dr. Stu Price. I'm getting married.

7
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,276
所以我要出国两周
So I'll be out of the country for 2 weeks.

8
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,289
我不确定到时手机有没有信号
I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.

9
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,864
如果有牙科急症…
If this is a dental emergency...

10
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:27,046
没人接
Nothing.

11
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:31,186
(泰语)
(speaking in Thai)

12
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:34,467
爸 别再抱怨了 有用吗？！
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

13
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:38,510
我看着斯图的眼睛 他一点儿也不像个男人
I looked into his eyes. Not the eyes of a man.

14
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,031
他就是个懦夫
The eyes of a coward.

15
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,038
(泰语)
(speaking in Thai again)

16
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,857
不好意思！
Excuse me!

17
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,119
- 菲尔 - 特蕾西！
- Bill! - Tracy!

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,986
- 对不起！ - 你们他妈的死哪儿去了?
- I'm sorry! - Where the hell are you?

19
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,509
我们又喝高了！
It happened again!

20
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:04,334
别吓我！
Don't say that, please!

21
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,856
不 这次我们真的搞砸了
No this time we really fucked up.

22
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:09,683
说真格的 你们几个是不是脑子进水了？
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

23
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,942
对不起 特蕾西 我不知从何说起
So much Trace, I don't even know where to begin.

24
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,508
天哪！到底有多糟糕？
Oh god! How bad?

25
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,247
- 难道 要取消婚礼？ - 差不多…
- Like, no wedding bad? - Yeah...

26
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:25,029
可能更糟一些
a little worse than that.

27
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:29,680
《宿醉 2》
THE HANGOVER PART II

28
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:07,197
（一周前）
ONE WEEK EARLIER

29
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:10,328
嗯哼
Uh, huh.

30
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,979
- 你真得多用用牙线了 - 去你的 我要是愿意用牙线 还跑你这儿干嘛
- You really need to floss more. - Fuck that! That's why I come here.

31
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,024
- 那你来勤点啊 两年一次也忒儿少了 - 干嘛？你想榨光我的钱啊
- Then you should come more than once every two years! - Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

32
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,935
菲尔 我从你那儿一个子儿也没收过
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

33
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,763
- 嘿 你这麻醉的玩意怎么用？ - 呃 别乱碰
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous? - Ah, you don't actually.

34
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:27,586
拜托 就试一下！
Come on! Just one hit!

35
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:31,413
你的补牙正常 还哪儿有问题？
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

36
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:35,805
有问题 你非要到泰国结婚
Yeah, actually. You're getting married in Thailand.

37
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:39,587
首先 我们得坐飞机 光路费 就得2000美元
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph. That's two grand right there.

38
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:43,761
孩子得我岳母看着 我心里怕怕的
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

39
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,804
再说了 光路上就需要5天时间
Plus, takes five days to get there.

40
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:49,499
你就扯吧 是16个小时 再说那地方挺美的
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful when you get there.

41
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,978
- 有够麻烦的 - 是有点远
- Whatever, it's a hassle! - It is kinda far.

42
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:54,499
劳拉用了一周也没倒过时差来
Lauren's been there a week and she's still jet lagged.

43
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,282
但那是她父母的故乡 这对他们很重要
But it's where her parents are from and it means a lot to them.

44
00:04:57,283 --> 00:05:00,673
谁他妈的管她父母！ 何况他爸那么烦你
Who gives a shit about her parents! Her dad hates you!

45
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:04,454
他不烦我 他只是没跟我说过话…
He doesn't hate me! He's just never spoken to me...

46
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:06,065
…文化差异嘛
...I think it's a cultural thing.

47
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:09,020
你干嘛不能像上次一样 在拉斯维加斯结婚 麻烦少多了
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like you did the last time. It's so much easier.

48
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,932
你干嘛就不能替我高兴呢？
Why can't you just be excited for me?

49
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:16,801
我要结婚了！
This is my wedding!

50
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:23,931
- 你很高兴 是吗？ - 当然
- You're really happy, huh? - I really am.

51
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,585
好吧…
Alright...

52
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:30,323
…我也替你高兴
...I'm happy too.

53
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:35,191
- 谢谢！ - 应该挺有趣的
- Thank you! - Gonna be fun.

54
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:41,104
菲尔 把处方本还给我
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

55
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:58,973
- 谢了 你知道这是犯罪 嗯？ - 滚犊子
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right? - Fuck you, man!

56
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:04,103
- 你是不是把它放你裤裆里了？ - 是
- Was this right up against your scrotum? - Yep.

57
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,060
- 噢 老天 我刚发现 - 什么?
- Oh my god, I just realized. - What?

58
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:10,190
- 我忘了更新我的护照了 - 哦 不…
- I forgot to renew my passport! - Oh no...

59
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:14,365
好消息是 我上周已经帮你更新了 就放在厨房的抽屉里
Good thing I did it last week. It's in the kitchen drawer.

60
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,711
- 你真好！ - 嘿！谁让咱俩是两口子呢
- You're the best! - Hey! We're a team!

61
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:22,581
你是个好人 一个纯粹的好人！
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

62
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,929
谢谢
Thank you!

63
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,320
- 所以 我求你件事 你别生气啊 - 生气？是什么事？
- So I know you're not gonna get mad. - Mad? What, mad at what?

64
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,884
艾伦知道我们要去泰国 参加斯图的婚礼了
Alan found out that we're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding.

65
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:36,581
- 然后? - 他伤透心了 你们几个就像他的家人一样
- So? - So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

66
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,622
不 不 你家人才是他的家人
No. Your family is like his family.

67
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:42,840
艾伦每天嘴里都是你们三个
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

68
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,928
- 还有维加斯的那个周末 - 等等…
- And that weekend. - Wait a second...

69
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:49,405
- 是不是他给我电话 打了又挂 挂了又打 不说话 - 他难过的时候会这么做
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up? - He does that when he's upset.

70
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:52,100
他不明白为什么斯图没请他
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

71
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:56,797
你能跟斯图说说吗？就当为了我
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

72
00:06:56,798 --> 00:07:00,709
行不…
For me...

73
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,187
死都不行 绝对不行
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

74
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:06,187
拜托 斯图 艾伦很想去
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

75
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:10,230
说实话 你们俩我都不想请
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

76
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,144
我理解 真的 但是 你要知道
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

77
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,362
艾伦把你当他最好的朋友之一
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

78
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,447
我把艾伦当疯子
I consider Alan to be insane.

79
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:20,968
斯图 你就让他去吧！ 说好了他捅了篓子由他赔
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

80
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,056
我们想法让你未来岳父掏钱搞单身汉派对
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze the old man to cover the bachelor party.

81
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:26,316
- 这主意不错 - 我很高兴你提起这事儿
- That's good. - I'm glad you brought that up.

82
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:30,882
- 因为 这顿饭就是我的单身派对 - 什么？
- Because... this is the bachelor party! - What?

83
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:34,098
- 你说什么? - 是的 这就是我单身早午餐派对！
- What are you talking about? - Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

84
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:38,924
伙计们 放开点儿 多来点儿碎巧克力煎饼… …再让服务员来个膝舞…
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a lap dance from the waitress...

85
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:44,185
纯属扯淡！斯图 你不能连单身派对都不搞
That's bullshit! You can't just skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

86
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:48,097
看见没 我在橘子汁上盖了纸巾
You see that? That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

87
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:50,880
知道为什么吗？就是为了防止有人给我下药
Do you know why? So nobody roofies me.

88
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,793
我怎么会拒绝在单身派对上吃香瓜呢？
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe at a bachelor party?

89
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:58,663
- 斯图 你是不是有点反应过度？ - 不 没有
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting? - No, I don't.

90
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:03,445
拉斯维加斯那次 我还没缓过来呢
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken psyche back together.

91
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:08,879
是劳拉的出现才让我逐渐恢复过来 为了劳拉 我不能再搞砸了
And you know what the glue is? Lauren! I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

92
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:12,966
- 切 要不是因为我们 你能和劳拉在一起嘛 - 那又怎么样
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us. - Oh, this'll be good.

93
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,617
斯图 仔细想想吧
Stu, think about it!

94
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:17,792
因此你才甩了梅丽莎, 两年后 遇到你的真命天女
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later you met your true soul mate.

95
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:22,703
如果不是因为拉斯维加斯那次 你就跟那个婊子结婚了
You take Vegas out of that equation, you would have married a cunt.

96
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,226
别大惊小怪的 这是个单身派对
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's a bachelor party.

97
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:26,792
干杯 各位
Drink up everybody.

98
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:29,834
噢 等等 我忘了这儿没有酒！ 因为这是他妈的茶餐厅！
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot we're at a fuckin IHOP!

99
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:33,053
不管怎样 这是我的最终决定 所以…说句祝词吧？
Well it's my decision and it's final, so... how bout a toast?

100
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,618
滚犊子的 我走了
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

101
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:38,225
- 拜托 菲尔 你去哪儿？ - 道格 我真是不知道他怎么想的
- C'mon Phil, where you going? - Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

102
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,399
他要去泰国结婚 好极了！ 他考虑过我们吗？
He's getting married in Thailand! That's great for him, but what about us?

103
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,008
你太自私了 我们走 宝贝…
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

104
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:50,485
我都替你害臊！
Shame on you!

105
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:53,355
别担心 斯图 你的决定我支持
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you no matter what.

106
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,660
谢谢
Thank you.

107
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:59,485
求你让艾伦参加你的婚礼吧
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

108
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:02,528
伙计们 你们能来 我真高兴…
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

109
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:06,137
自从听说婚礼这事儿 艾伦一直在等着
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever since he got word of the wedding.

110
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,484
- 我相信 - 是啊
- I'm sure he has. - Yeah.

111
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:10,703
他整日整日地站在邮箱旁边
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

112
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:13,354
- 难为他了 - 是啊
- Well that's tough. - Yeah.

113
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:17,223
我想他对上次维加斯之行还念念不忘
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

114
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,614
参加婚礼对他很重要
He really needs this.

115
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:22,484
什么事?
What?

116
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:26,702
宝贝 是我 爸爸！ 斯图他们来了！慢慢走进去
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors! Go in slowly.

117
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:31,570
给他点儿时间去适应
Give him a chance to acclimate.

118
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:36,570
- 嘿 艾伦！ - 嘿 伙计们！嘿 菲尔！
- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

119
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:40,135

Hey, bud!

120
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:45,004
- 你们要进来吗? - 好 当然
- You guys wanna come in? - Sure. Absolutely.

121
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:49,135
- 嘿 - 嘿

122
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:54,004
- 嘿 斯图 - 好啦 那我们中场休息时再见…
- Hey, Stu! - Ok. See you on the court in half...

123
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,829
- 艾伦 你的房间很有品嘛！ - 谢谢 菲尔！我老爸帮我付房租
- Pretty cool room, Alan! - Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

124
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,657
艾伦 搞什么！你怎么能留着这些照片
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed to delete these!

125
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,568
你发过誓要删掉的！
You made a promise!

126
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,090
哇哦 哇哦！
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

127
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,958
见鬼的？这让我很不爽 你不能留着这些照片
What the hell? I'm not cool with this at all. You can't have these.

128
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:13,350
放轻松 斯图！不会有人来我这儿的
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

129
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,177
- 你践踏了我对你的信任！ - 妈 午餐我不吃了 你来拿走！
- A total violation of trust! - Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

130
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,829
对不起 宝贝 我马上来
I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

131
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,871
- 真不敢相信 你们来看我 棒极了 - 等等！
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool. - Wait a second!

132
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:27,392
- 艾伦 这个是周先生? - 是啊 我们还有联系呢
- Al, is that Mr. Chow? - Yeah. We still keep in touch.

133
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,481
斯图 看
Stu!

134
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:31,090
周 那个绑架我们的周？
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

135
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,046
他没绑架我们 他绑架了黑人道格
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

136
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,088
想起来没？那只不过是个误会
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

137
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,089
他挺不错的
He's actually quite charming.

138
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,348
- 艾伦 他是个罪犯 - 抱歉打扰你们！
- Alan, he's a criminal. - Excuse me, boys!

139
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,132
- 嗨 琳达！ - 嗨 道格！
- Hi, Linda! - Hi, Dougie!

140
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,653
我是不是不能吃甜点了 怎么我没接到通知
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I didn't get that memo.

141
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:47,784
对不起 宝贝 我马上去拿
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

142
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,261
拿个蛋糕你能死啊？
Would a cupcake kill you?

143
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:54,478
- 我觉得 这真不是个好主意 - 艾伦 我们有个惊喜带给你
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea. - Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

144
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:57,479
斯图想邀请你参加他的婚礼
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

145
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:01,520
- 当然 如果你有事儿就算了 - 斯图！
- Well only if you're not busy. - Stu!

146
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:04,000
也许乔纳斯兄弟巡演到这里呢
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

147
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:08,173
不 那个周末恰好他们在罗利 （北卡罗那州首府）
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

148
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:13,041
你真愿意让我去 斯图？ 真的吗？
Are you really being serious, Stu? You're inviting me?

149
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:21,259
是 干嘛不呢？应该挺有趣的 是吧？
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

150
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,478
- 菲尔 你去吗? - 当然了！
- Phil, are you going? - Of course!

151
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:30,216
那我们全体归队了
Then it will be fun.

152
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,738
你疯了吗？
What the fuck are you doing, man?

153
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,564
这是我的疫苗 最后一支
It's my immunizations. It's the last day I can do it.

154
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:43,997
这必须由有执照的护士来做
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

155
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,737
我是护士 无照而已
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

156
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:51,605
斯图 看这个！ 因为你我才买的！
Stu, look at this! I bought this cause I thought of you!

157
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:30,039
(曼谷）
- Hey, there he is! - Hey, Stu!

158
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,560
- 嘿 他在那儿！ - 嘿 斯图！
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya? - Hey Stu.

159
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,864
- 泰迪 怎么样？最近好吗？ - 挺好
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu? - This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

160
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:40,950
- 喂 他是谁 斯图？ - 这位是泰迪 劳拉的弟弟
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

161
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,255
斯坦福大学的 医学预科 这是菲尔 艾伦和道格
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

162
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,604
嘿 很高兴认识你
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

163
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:49,254
哇哦 斯坦福？你多大？
- He's 17. Kind of a genius. - Actually, I'm 16.

164
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:52,691
- 17 天才儿童 - 其实是16
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take the entrance exams early.

165
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,081
我不是天才 只是我老爸 让我参加入学考试比较早而已
Because you're a genius.

166
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,254
因为你是天才嘛
- So what are you, a doctor? - No, not yet. I'm premed.

167
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,820
- 那你现在已经是医生了？ - 不 还不是 预科而已
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser? - Yeah.

168
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,297
- 你听说过《天才小医生》吗？（美剧） - 嗯
- Well, he turned out to be a gay. - Alan.

169
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,341
- 原来他是个“同志” - 艾伦
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

170
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:12,037
是真的 我在青少年杂志上读到的
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something for the plane. You guys want anything?

171
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,384
好了…我要去买本书之类的 你们需要什么吗？
- No, thanks. I'm good. - I would actually love a small water.

172
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:18,949
- 不 谢谢 - 能帮我带一小瓶水吗？
Cool.

173
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,906
没问题
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old. - Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

174
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:26,166
- 你发什么疯 他才16岁而已 - 就是 艾伦 你正常点
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to see us off or what. How does this work?

175
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:29,993
我不太明白 他是送了我们就离开 还是怎样？
- How does what work? - Is that person coming to the wedding?

176
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:34,861
- 什么怎样？ - 他要跟我们一起去参加婚礼？
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

177
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:40,643
是的 我新娘的弟弟去参加婚礼 你有问题吗？
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it. You could have paged me.

178
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:47,643
有 你就不能提前告诉我一下嘛
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

179
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:53,032
别大惊小怪 没事的
- Hey. Mind if I sit? - Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

180
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:57,207
- 嘿 我能坐这儿吗？ - 只有狼群能坐 你找其他位置吧
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon. - It's no problem. I'll find...

181
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:00,684
- 什么狼群 艾伦 别闹了 - 没关系 我找其他…
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here! - Careful, that's a Louis...

182
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:05,512
- 泰迪 别听他的 你就坐这里 - 小心点 这是我的…
That is a Louis Vuitton!

183
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:17,250
LV包！
- That's a nice neck roll! - Thanks! You can use it if you want.

184
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:23,554
- 这个颈枕不错！ - 谢谢！你要用可以借你
Ok.

185
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:28,552
好
The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing

186
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:34,724
宝贝！
Baby!

187
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:49,810
这里真是布置得太好了！ 谢谢您！
This is so absolutely beautiful! Thank you much!

188
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:51,201
当然
Of course.

189
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,026
你一定挺高兴的 不久你家里就有2个医生了
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited. Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

190
00:15:56,115 --> 00:16:00,767
你得知道 在我的国家 看牙的可算不上医生
You have to realize that in my country we don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

191
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,504
爸…
Dad...

192
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,591
哦
Ok.

193
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:08,505
我要去找泰迪了 谈谈今晚他的独奏
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight.

194
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:10,722
哎哟！
Ouch!

195
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:12,461
对不起…
I'm so sorry...

196
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:15,244
你老爸未免太宠你弟弟了
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your brother, isn't he?

197
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:19,764
泰迪是我老爸最宝贵的财产了 一直这样
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's always been that way.

198
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:23,243
他慢慢会喜欢你的 好吧?
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

199
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:26,982
爸爸 你可以发传真到酒店 我到礼宾部去取
You can just fax it over to me. I'll pick it up at the concierge.

200
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:29,459
谢谢 爸爸！再见！
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

201
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,633
我老爸电话 我是个啃老族
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

202
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:37,024
我们刚才在讨论结婚礼物 他会送份大礼
We were discussing your wedding gift. He's sparing no expense.

203
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,067
噢…不必那么破费了
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

204
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:42,068
我一直在打听 既然这里是个渔村
I've been meaning to ask someone. I notice this is a fishing village.

205
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:44,111
那岛上有没有“海滋客” （美国连锁海鲜快餐店）
Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?

206
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,198
对不起 这里没有
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

207
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,154
但是 我们这里有非常新鲜的海鲜
But, we are actually serving some great fresh seafood.

208
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,763
- 比“海滋客”还好? - 当然
- Better than Long John's? - Yes.

209
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:58,719
- 我得亲自去评判一下 你们好好享受 - 你也是
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening. - You too. Ok.

210
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:39,456
哇哦！
All right!

211
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,891
谢谢 泰迪！
Thank you, Teddy!

212
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:48,064
才华横溢的音乐家！
The hands of a brilliant musician!

213
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:52,803
未来出色的外科医生
And one day, a great surgeon.

214
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,107
我承认…
I admit it...

215
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:59,976
当我第一次见到斯图 我不太满意
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

216
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:05,150
他缺乏魅力 智力平庸 没有想像力
He seemed unattractive. He lacked intelligence and imagination.

217
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,715
他没有男人身上的火花
He was missing the spark you look for in a man.

218
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:15,672
但是 当我注视他的双眼
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

219
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:20,409
他让我想起了我的弟弟 常勇
It reminded me of my sweet brother, Chai Yo.

220
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:25,279
在座的各位也许不知道 常勇在学习帆船 住在痴呆老人院
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning the sailboat and lives in a group home.

221
00:18:28,628 --> 00:18:32,105
常勇喜欢“Khao”(泰语）
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

222
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:36,974
我就意识到 斯图就是“Khao”
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

223
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,801
什么是“Khao”？
What is "khao"?

224
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:44,842
“Khao”是一种泡在温水里的软白米
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

225
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:47,235
没有味道
It has no taste.

226
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:52,061
我们用它喂婴儿和非常老的老人
We feed it to small baby and uh, very old people.

227
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,887
谁吃了都能消化
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

228
00:18:55,887 --> 00:19:00,798
这个世界需要“khao” 就像这个世界需要斯图
The world needs "khao", just as the world needs people like Stu.

229
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,581
敬我的宝贝女儿和斯图！ 恭喜你们！
To my sweet daughter and Stu! Congratulations!

230
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:13,450
干杯！
Cheers!

231
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:18,580
下面 泰迪你来说几句
And now I believe that Teddy has something to say.

232
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:23,666
你坐下 我来 坐下 听见没！
Sit down! I got this. Sit down, boy!

233
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,754
先生 你…你刚才讲得很好
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

234
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:31,666
我喜欢你把斯图比做米饭
I like the comparison between Stu and rice.

235
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:37,233
我也有几句话要讲
I've also prepared a few words.

236
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:40,101
嘿 大家好 给大家讲几个有趣的事实
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

237
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:43,840
泰国的人口是6300万
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

238
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:46,449
是怀俄明州的两倍
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

239
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,362
主要出口物是纺织品 鞋子和大米
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.

240
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:55,230
每年大约有13000人死于车祸
Each year approximately 13,000 people are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

241
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,534
- 泰国的气候是… - 艾伦！
- The climate in Thailand... - Alan!

242
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:03,447
- 你干嘛不直接读最后一张 - 好的！
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy. - Okay. Sorry!

243
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,492
你们没有人比我更了解斯图
None of you know Stu like I do.

244
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:14,360
不是你…不是你…不是你…
Not you... not you... not you...

245
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:20,143
没人比我更了解斯图
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

246
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:22,490
没有人！
No one!

247
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:26,229
我不能告诉你们我跟斯图经历了些什么 因为我们有君子协议
I can't even tell you what we've been through cause we made a pact.

248
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,663
歃血之盟
More important than blood.

249
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:33,489
但是我能告诉你们 这不是斯图的头婚
What I can tell you is this. This is not Stu's first marriage.

250
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:37,316
在几年前 有个拉斯维加斯的妓女
There was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.

251
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:41,401
你给我坐下…
Sit down...

252
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:46,229
- 够了！那些都会过去的！ - 好的 谢谢 菲尔！
- Enough! He'll get over it! - Okay. Thanks, Phil!

253
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:59,574
傻脸了吧！
In your face!

254
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:03,619
就料到你爸爸会那样挖苦我
Well that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.

255
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,792
对不起…
Sorry...

256
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:10,228
- 哦 大米布丁！干嘛呢？ - 哈哈 很搞笑吗？！
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing? - HaHa. Very funny!

257
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,792
乖一点 菲尔！他今晚特别感性
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

258
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:16,313
有什么呢！你抢走了他女儿 他恨你很正常
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's supposed to hate you.

259
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,706
走 咱们老爷们儿出去喝一杯
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

260
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:23,573
不了…我累了 我们打算上楼休息去了
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

261
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,922
别扫兴 我刚求了那个经理 他允许我们在海滩上生个火
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

262
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:30,921
听起来不错！
That sounds fun!

263
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:33,007
- 嗯…我还是算了 - 人家累了！
- Nyah... I'm good. - He's tired!

264
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:36,225
斯图 你就去陪他们喝几杯了
Stu, one drink with your friends who came all this way.

265
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:39,442
- 我只想跟你多待会儿！ - 去吧！带上泰迪
- I just wanna hang out with you! - Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

266
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:43,876
就当是帮我的忙 他一直挺闷的
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.

267
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,529
好主意 带上泰迪
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

268
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,572
- 好吧 只喝一杯！ - 棒极了
- Alright. One drink! - Perfect.

269
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,528
- 再见 - 好好玩！
- See you later. - Have fun!

270
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,704
- 你带钥匙了吗? - 带了！
- You have the key? - Yep, got it right here!

271
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:59,529
我20分钟后就上去！
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

272
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:03,572
我叔叔罗杰告诉我 他见过一只得白化病的北极熊
My uncle Roger said that he once saw an albino polar bear.

273
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,441
是吗？北极熊本来就是白的 他怎么知道它得白化病了？
Really? Polar bears are white. How would he know if it's an albino?

274
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,093
那只北极熊原来是黑的
This one was black.

275
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:19,005
你有没有想过那不是北极熊 就是只黑熊？
Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?

276
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:22,657
随便了…
Whatever...

277
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:27,005
来一瓶 美国啤酒
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

278
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:31,743
- 原装的！ - 谢谢 不错！
- Sealed bottle! - Thank you. Alright!

279
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:34,961
- 我还没到饮酒的年龄 - 没错 这违法
- I'm not really old enough to drink. - Yeah, it's illegal.

280
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,527
要是有人举报 你就惨了
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

281
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:41,830
谁举报啊 别理他 喝一瓶 泰迪
Nobody's reporting anybody. It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

282
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:43,352
小心！
Careful!

283
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:47,394
这是什么？棉花糖？ 想法不错！
What is this? Instant marshmallows? Nice touch!

284
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:51,570
- 艾伦拿来的 - 好主意 艾伦！
- That was Alan's idea. - Good thinking, Al!

285
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,351
我得向你坦白… 这地方真是天堂 斯图！
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu! This place is paradise.

286
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:57,655
不错 是吧?
Not bad, right?

287
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:02,393
我真不敢相信自己这么说 不过 我还真有点嫉妒你
And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually jealous of you.

288
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:06,045
- 劳拉是个天使 - 嗯 她确实很棒
- I mean, Lauren is an angel. - Yeah, she really is amazing.

289
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,697
哇 你们什么时候嘴这么甜
Wow, you guys are sweet.

290
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:12,610
咪咪虽然不大 但是 很挺
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid rack for an Asian.

291
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:16,003
- 不好意思让你听见 泰迪 这是事实 - 没关系
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true. - That's ok.

292
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,220
这么说哥们的媳妇 太不合适了
That is just wildly inappropriate.

293
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,132
不过…真的很感谢你们能来 艾伦你也是
And yet... I'm really glad you're here. All you guys. Even you Alan.

294
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:28,827
这对我很重要 谢谢
It means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.

295
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,524
- 我们一直都挺你 - 是的！
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy. - Great!

296
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:36,350
现在来干一杯?
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

297
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:40,349

Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

300
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,957
- 兄弟 你终于结婚了 - 没错
- You did it, buddy. - Sure did.

301
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:54,825
干杯！
Cheers!

302
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:12,995
见鬼…

303
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:54,296

304
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,861
菲尔…

305
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:21,731
上次拉斯维加斯的状况重现了
I think it happened again.

306
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:26,557
- 艾伦 你他妈都干什么了? - 我发誓 我什么都没干
- Alan, what the fuck did you do? - I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

307
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:30,384
你头发没了
Your hair is gone.

308
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:35,426
不是这儿…往上摸
No, no... up.

309
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:45,816
我们这是在哪儿?
Where the fuck are we?

310
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:56,337

- Oh my god, Alan. Your head. - No your head!

314
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:32,683
- 我也秃了? - 斯图 你别抓狂 一切都会好的
- Is it bald? - Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

315
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,510
- 怎么？我牙又没了？ - 不 不是你的牙
- Why? Was it my teeth? - Nope, it's not your teeth.

316
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,205
- 你确定? - 是的
- Are you sure? - Yep.

317

你能看见我牙根吗?
Can you see the bottom?

318

噢 老天 靠！
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

319

That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

320
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:57,203
洗不掉 靠 这是真纹身！
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

321
00:27:58,073 --> 00:28:01,464

Ever seen anything like this?

341
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,373
- 啥玩意儿？ - 小心 可能是蜘蛛网
- What is that? - Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

342
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:28,939
我被蜘蛛网粘住过
I've tangled with those before.

343
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,765

- Why is he pulling on it? - He's probably hungry.

364
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,281
等等 这是不是…
Wait a second. Is that...

365
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:56,107
搞什么搞 让猴子别扯我耳朵
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone.

- Excuse me? - What, he's my plus one.

373
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:22,366
不 你没有 一个人餐费要200美元呢
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

374
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,670
哥们 别扯远了 周 发生什么事了？
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok. Chow, what happened?

375
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:30,496
你们发短信给我 说想开心一下
You guys texted me, said you're fucked up and looking to party.

376
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,713
我就开了船 带你们到了曼谷
I picked you up on my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.

377
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:42,451
贱人们 我们昨天可疯狂了
But we had a sick night, bitches!

378
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:47,364
等一下 周 我们在曼谷?
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

379
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:50,930
哈哈 是啊 “上帝之城”
Holler, city of squalor.

380
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:55,756
- 你知道我怎么有这个纹身的吗? - 当然是从纹身专业人士那里纹的啦！
- Do you know how I got this tattoo? - Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

381
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,928
拜托 斯图 用用你犹太人的大脑
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

382
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,581
猴子拿的是什么？
What's the monkey holding?

383
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:07,753
- 是根手指头！ - 斯图 我有个坏消息
- That's a finger! - Stu, I got some bad news.

384
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:12,623
泰迪昨天和我们在一起 这是他的指头
Teddy was with us last night. That's his finger.

385
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:18,536
- 泰迪死了? - 泰迪没死！他昨晚和我们一起疯呢！
- Teddy's dead? - Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

386
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,927
- 那他在哪儿? - 你们什么都不记得了?
- Well then where is he? - Don't you remember anything?

387
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,320
- 不！ - 什么都不记得 周
- No! - No, nothing, Chow.

388
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,493
那我给你们讲讲 好吧?
Ok I explain it all, ok?

389
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:34,361
让我先爽一爽 清醒下
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight. Come to papa.

390
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:39,405
太多了吧…
That's a big...

391
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:47,231
你们准备好听有史以来最疯狂的故事…
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

392
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,665
周！
Chow!

393
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:04,360
周 你没事吧?
Hey Chow, you okay?

394
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:09,229
真是扯淡
You gotta be kidding me.

395
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:17,359
靠 他死了！
Fuck, he's dead!

396
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:22,837
- 救命！ - 斯图！
- Help! - Stu!

397
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:26,141
- 救命！ - 斯图 闭嘴！
- Help! - Stu, shut up!

398
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:29,097
- 快叫救护车！ - 闭嘴！他已经死了！
- Call an ambulance! - Shut up! He's dead!

399
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:32,012
如果有人来了 发现一具死尸和一堆毒品…
Look if someone comes and finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

400
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:36,229
我们就等着在泰国把牢底坐穿吧
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking lives in a Thai prison.

401
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,315
艾伦！求你别哭了！
Alan! Please don't cry!

402
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:45,097
行了 行了 容我考虑几分钟
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to figure this out.

403
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:05,878
（制冰机在15楼）
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

404
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,053
这是个蠢主意！
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

405
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,877
这是什么鬼地方?
What the fuck is this place?

406
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,661
曼谷是泰国的首都 人口1200万…
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its population is 12 million people...

407
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:31,617
艾伦 帮把手！
Alan, will you help!

408
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:40,180
- 电梯！ - 我来按！
- The elevator! - I'll get the button!

409
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,440
- 这猴子跟来干嘛? - 猴子可聪明着呢！
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey? - That monkey gets it!

410
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,485
- 快啊！ - 靠 不是吧
- Come on! - Fuck no!

411
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,572
停电了 我们走楼梯
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

412
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:56,439
- 靠！ - 走吧！
- Oh fuck! - Come on!

413
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,789
到了！
Here it is!

414
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,658
先放脚 我以前干过
Feet first. I've done this before.

415
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:14,527
小心！
Careful!

416
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:35,918
- 斯图！ - 什么？
- Stu! - What?

417
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:40,743
- 我们还得找泰迪！ - 老天
- We still have to find Teddy! - Oh god.

418
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:49,613
屋顶！ （参见第一部 他们最终在屋顶找到失踪的道格）
The roof!

419
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:54,439
泰迪！
Teddy!

420
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:06,045
- 你们找到他没? - 没有！
- You guys see him? - No!

421
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:17,088
他没在这儿
He's not here.

422
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,958
我真不敢相信 又来一次
I can't believe this is happening again.

423
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:27,088
我们留下来找泰迪 你先回去吧
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get back there.

424
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:30,739
你告诉他们 我们三个喝多了 还在派对呢
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk with him, we're still partying.

425
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,565
- 明天就要婚礼了！ - 不！没有泰迪我不回去！
- You gotta go get married! - No! Not going back without Teddy!

426
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:40,608
他是劳拉的弟弟 他丢了 而且受伤了
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost, he's injured.

427
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,435
如果我搞砸了 我什么都没了
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

428
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,609
好吧
Ok.

429
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,609
好
Alright.

430
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,651
- 艾伦 翻翻你的口袋！ - 干嘛?
- Alan, check your pockets! - What?

431
00:36:56,652 --> 00:36:59,564
你知道的 可能会有昨晚的线索
You know the drill. C'mon there might be clues.

432
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:04,260
- 看看你的电话！通话记录 短信 - 好主意！
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts. - That's a good idea!

433
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:07,521
- 我毫无线索 靠！ - 我有一条周的短信
- I got nothing. Fuck! - I got an text from Chow.

434
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:10,433
- 什么时候? - 昨晚10点
- What time? - Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

435
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:14,737
- 他说什么? - “同志们 我就到了”
- What's it say? - "On my way, Niggahs"

436
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:19,606
哦 弟兄们… 嗯…很复古
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

437
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:24,868
我们死定了！
We are so... fucked!

438
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:29,650
嘿 菲尔！看后面是什么！
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

439
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:36,301
我们得离开这儿了 你快晒傻了
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're too hot.

440
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,866
菲尔 我真觉得我们应该去美国领事馆
Phil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate.

441
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:43,388
去干吗？说我们把一具死尸放到制冰机里去了？
For what? To report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?

442
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:46,693
那我们怎么办？在这儿绕圈子？ 这难道有用？
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around in circles? Cause that's real productive.

443
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:49,302
我一直都在想办法 你跟我这是什么态度
You know I'm trying to figure this thing out here and your attitude is not helping.

444
00:37:49,302 --> 00:37:52,475
对不住了 这儿有100度 除了给他买帽子和苏打水
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we don't have a plan.

445
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,824
我们什么也没干
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

446
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:57,605
- 不 这是芬达！ - 好 那你想怎么干 斯图?
-What, it's a bag of Fanta! - Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

447
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,735
我不知道！
I don't know!

448
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,737
那你就别唧唧歪歪了 好像这全是我的错
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

449
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,345
就是你的错！
It is your fault!

450
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,823
我都说那个早午餐就当是单身派对算了
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

451
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,997
靠！闭嘴！是道格！说话！
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

452
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:10,646
我刚和曼谷警察局通过电话了 他们找到泰迪了 他没事
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD. They've got him. He's ok.

453
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:13,908
真太好了！道格找到泰迪了
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

454
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:15,734
- 怎么回事? - 他被拘留了
- What happened? - He got arrested.

455
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,562
- 拘留? 因为什么? - 违反公共秩序
- Arrested? For what? - Disorderly conduct.

456
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,864
- 真的? - 嗯！他没事就行
- Seriously? - Yeah! He's ok though.

457
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,734
他们会放了他 你们什么也别问 就当没这回事
They'll release him to you. No questions asked. No one has to know.

458
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:29,602
他被关在RATRA Wang警察局
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

459
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,603
好 我们到那了再给你电话
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

460
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:35,212
泰迪在局子里 没啥事 我们赶快找个出租
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We gotta get a cab.

461
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:40,079
- 好！ - 好！
- Ok! - Alright!

462
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,472
- 是 我这儿有他的记录 - 好的
- Yes, I have his paperwork here. - Okay.

463
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:48,514
- 手续都办好了 - 听起来不错
- He has been treated. - Sounds good.

464
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:52,690
好了 他们已经去带他了
We're good. They've processed him for release.

465
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,254
他们把他跟喝多的人关在一起 所以没啥事
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

466
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:59,167
16岁就在局子里蹲一夜 你能想像吗？
Sixteen years old and spent a night in jail. Can you imagine?

467
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:04,123
哈哈！我们爱派对
Haha! We love to party.

468
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:08,167
来了！
Here we go!

469
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:11,035
- 这老头儿是谁? - 泰迪啊
- Wait who's this fuckin guy? - Teddy Sisay.

470
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:14,209
不 不 长官 人不对！
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

471
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:18,991
不好意思 长官 你们带来的人不对 这不是泰迪！
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

472
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:23,078
他就是泰迪！ 我们有他的身份证 钱包啥的！
Of course it is! We have his ID's and everything!

473
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,122
我们逮捕他的时候 在他口袋里发现的
These were in his pocket when we made the arrest.

474
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:29,122
在他口袋里?
They were in his pocket?

475
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:33,859
对不起 先生！这些东西怎么在您这儿？
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

476
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,643
听见了吗?
Hello?

477
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:40,469
泰迪是哑巴 我们跟他说英语 泰语 中文…他啥也不说
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English, Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

478
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:42,990
我来问你件事
Let me ask you something.

479
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,858
你看这老头像是在加州倍力健身俱乐部健过身的吗？
Does he look like he works out at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

480
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:52,858
听着 老子拘人无数 不可能什么都验
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything.

481
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,336
- 那你让我们怎么处理这老头儿？ - 不关我事儿！
- What do you expect us to do with this guy? - Not my problem!

482
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:04,337
嘿 兄弟们 我觉得他认识我们 你好啊
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

483
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:12,945
你知道我们的朋友泰迪在哪吗？ 他不见了！
You know where our friend is, Teddy? He's missing!

484
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:16,684
- 斯图 别费劲儿了 没用 - 他一定知道些什么！
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless. - He knows something!

485
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:19,597
他穿着泰迪的卫衣呢
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

486
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:24,597
也许他只是不明白 我来表演给你看 就像猜字谜 看
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

487
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:28,336
- 两个词 - 是电影吗?
- Two words. - Is it a movie?

488
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:32,247
不是让你猜 艾伦！
This is not for you, Alan!

489
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:37,074
- 美国少年…在亚洲 - 贾登・史密斯的《功夫梦》
- American teenager... in Asia. - Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

490
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,638
你都说出来了 太简单了
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

491
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,378
斯图 你这是浪费时间！ 我们就把他搁这儿吧
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave this fucking guy here.

492
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:49,378
我有发现 在泰国有50万僧侣
Here's something. There are 500 thousand monks living in Thailand.

493
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:54,332
其中会有不少人 从八岁开始禁言
It is not uncommon for some monks to take a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

494
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,161
原来如此
There you go.

495
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:01,637
- 信封里还有什么? - 没了 空了
- Anything else in that envelope? - Nah, it's empty.

496
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,594
哇 等下 曼谷白狮子酒吧的卡片？
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White Lion bar in Bangkok?

497
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:11,593
值得跑一趟
Worth a shot.

498
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:14,725
老天爷！我们来对地方了吗？
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

499
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:19,592
上面是这么写的
That's what it says.

500
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:27,810
- 哇哦！就是这儿 白狮子酒吧！ - 靠 这地方怎么了?
- Whoa! This is the White Lion! - What the fuck happened here?

501
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,679

- 走… - 我们应该…
- Let's... - We should probably...

504
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,113
小心
That's ok.

505
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:48,808
他们干嘛这么对我们?
What the fuck is going on here?

506
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:53,635
- 哇哦 兄弟们 看！ - 见鬼！你看 斯图！

- So what do ya think? - What, I'm sorry?

511
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:20,894
- 纹身 你喜欢吗? - 呃 我恨这个纹身
- The tattoo. You love it? - Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

512
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:24,373
- 恕不退款 快滚吧！ - 等一下！
- No refunds. Get the fuck out! - Wait a second!

513
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:26,112

514
00:42:26,112 --> 00:42:27,677
恕不退款 快滚吧
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

515
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,328
我们没想退款 就想问几个问题
We don't want any refunds. We just have a couple of questions.

516
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,460
我们想知道昨天发生什么事了
We're trying to figure out what went down last night.

517
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,328
发生什么？你们去外面看看 外面塌了一半
What went down? Take a look at what you did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

518
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:41,242
- 那是我们干的? - 你们几个不记得昨晚在白狮子酒吧斗殴？
- We did that? - You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

519
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:46,110
- 引起了一场大暴动？ - 兄弟 我们什么都不记得了
- Starting a full on fuckin riot? - Sir, we don't remember anything.

520
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:54,979
苍天啊…
Oh boy...

521
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:59,848
你们看看！
Check this out!

522

警察去死！
Fuck the Police!

524
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:18,326
是泰迪！他跟我们在一起！
There's Teddy! He was with us!

525
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,238
老天！
Jesus christ!

526
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,065
那时警察就来了 不少人头破血流
That's when the cops arrived and started cracking skulls.

527
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:37,021
我让你们藏到这里
I took you guys and hid you in the shop here.

528
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:41,498
然后你就决定弄个纹身 哭得像个娘们儿
Then you decided to get a tattoo. You cried like a little bitch.

529
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,803
这小孩才他妈的9岁 蛋蛋是你的两倍
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's got balls twice your size.

530
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:48,672
- 让他们看看, 桡！ - 不 不 我们不看了
- Show him your balls, Nao! - No, no, no. That's ok.

531
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:52,455
听着 我们想找我们的朋友泰迪 你看见他了吗？
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?

532
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,716
昨晚后就没见了 怎么了？
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

533
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:59,585
我明天就要和他姐结婚 可我把他弄丢了
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

534
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:03,975
- 哦 那我没辙 你认命吧！ - 什么认命?
- Oh well. Then fuck it! - What do you mean, fuck it?

535
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:07,715
在曼谷丢了的人 是找不到的
Bangkok has him now and she'll never let him go.

536
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:11,932
听到了吗？这就是你想要的？ 你高兴了吧？
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you wanted? You happy now?

537
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:15,497
你这是浪费时间 僧侣对他们的誓言是非常认真的
You're wasting your time. These monks take their vow shit seriously.

538
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:20,366
看这个 这是清迈寺的标志 没准那儿的人能问出点什么
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

539
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:25,670
出城你们就能找到
Maybe somebody over there can get him to talk.

540
00:44:28,714 --> 00:44:31,583
好 我们再来回顾一下？ 你从哪拿的啤酒？
- Ok, can we just go over this one more time? You got the beer from...

541
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:35,669
- 从酒店的酒吧 他们给了我一箱 - 对
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.

542
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,191
- 那是谁给你的? - 酒吧服务员
- But, who gave it to you? - The bartender.

543
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:41,669
然后你拿出来 我打开的
And then you brought em out and I  opened them.

544
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,146
而且道格喝了也没事 所以不是酒的问题
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine so it's not the beer.

545
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,668
- 那到底是怎么回事? - 不知道啊！
- So what the hell happened? - I have no idea!

546
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:51,233
嘿 兄弟们 快看 他下面有反应了
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a Chinese boner.

547
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:56,059
艾伦 别闹了！停下来！
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

548
00:44:56,973 --> 00:45:01,710
- 疯子！ - 别停下来 小猴 继续
- That is so wrong! - Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

549
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:16,190
黄段子 不分国界！
When a monkey nibbles on a penis it's funny in any language!

550
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:21,710

Keep doing it!

551

What is this, a PF Chang's?

555
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,406
哦 他们在沉思
Ah, they're meditating.

556

- 真是宁静的人们！ - 可不

- Knock, knock! Hello! - Alan! Show some respect!

558
00:45:57,883 --> 00:46:02,012
- 不必起来 兄弟们 - 我们把你们同伴带回来了
- Don't get up guys. - We brought one of your guys back.

559
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:04,925
他很不错 很酷
He's really funny. He's really nice and cool.

560
00:46:04,926 --> 00:46:09,751
嗨 你好 你是管事的？
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

- Excuse me... ow... Wait! - Stop it! Calm down!

562
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,404
对了 我们是因为说话才挨打的
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

563
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,099
混蛋！啊！住手！
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

564
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:26,186
是我！
Wait it's me!

565
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:31,011
我知道了
Oh I get it.

566
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:36,358
不说话！不说话！好吧…
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

567
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:45,661
好吧
Ok.

568
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:07,356
昨天晚上 你们爬墙进到我们寺里
Late last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery.

569
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:12,312
大声嚷嚷着什么爱情 婚姻 生命的意义
Shouting out questions about love, marriage and the meaning of life.

570
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,748
可怜的韩长老正一个人在花园里沉思
Poor brother Han was meditating alone in the garden.

571
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:23,442
- 你们劫持了他 - 喔 老天！
- And you took him. - Oh my god!

572
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:27,921
- 我们绑架了一个僧人 - 我们昨晚在另一个世界里
- We kidnapped a monk. - We live an alternative life style.

573
00:47:27,922 --> 00:47:32,790
我们很抱歉 我们昨天喝得找不着北了
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't ourselves last night.

574
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:38,225
是啊 昨天发生的事情确实失控了 现在我们的朋友受伤了而且不见了
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

575
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:42,876
你能帮忙问问我朋友在哪儿吗？
Can you find out if he knows where our friend is?

576
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:46,441
韩长老很多年前就发誓禁言了
Brother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.

577
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:48,659
我也没有办法
It would be useless to try.

578
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,875
那是不是能让他拿笔写下来？
Well maybe he can write down what happened, on a piece of paper?

579
00:47:52,876 --> 00:47:56,136
不 菲尔 这样做会被认为是作弊 对不对 住持大人
Actually Phil, that would be cheating. Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

580
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:59,178
- 艾伦！ - 这位胖施主说的对
- Alan! - I'm afraid fatty is right.

581
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,224
听到了吧?…你叫我啥?
See?... What?

582
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:06,050
我们没有人知道韩长老在想什么
None of us will ever know what brother Han knows.

583
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,571
哦 好吧 说的这么虔诚 不过就是群秃驴 走 我们走
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people. Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

584
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:13,744
嘿 知道吗？！顺便说一下！ 在你们放孙悟空出来打人之前…
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to put some signs up that say no talking...

585
00:48:13,745 --> 00:48:16,135
- …不如贴个禁止说话的招牌 - 是 我们被打惨了
- ...before you unleash your dragon. - Yeah, that was a little rough.

586
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:19,310
不用“谢谢”我们把他送回来了
And "your welcome" for bringing him back safe.

587
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,266
- 我们可是把他从局子里搞出来的 - 我们先前是挟持了他嘛
- You know we found him in the drunk tank. - Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

588
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:27,134
- 兄弟们 我们走 - 等等！
- C'mon guys, let's go. - Wait!

589
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:32,047
佛语有云：汝所经之诸事 必深藏于记忆
The Buddha teach, every memory lives somewhere deep within.

590
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:37,873
也许你们几个可以试试静思
Perhaps you should bring your question to the Garden of Meditation.

591
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:41,221
- 你听懂他说什么了吗? - 嗯 大概三分之二
- Did you understand a word he just said? - Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

592
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,917
他说沉思什么的？
He said something about the Garden of Meditation?

593
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,656
不 他就是沉思太多 所以在这儿放屁
No, he said he's farting because of his medication.

594
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:50,524
看什么看
I get that.

595
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,958
这是浪费时间 我什么都不记得 你呢？
It's a waste of time. I don't remember anything. Do you?

596
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:03,089
不 我也没有 艾伦？
No. I got nothing. Alan?

597
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:10,438
艾伦！
Alan!

598
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:13,785
“汝所经之诸事 必深藏于记忆”
"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"

599
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,610
- 宝贝 - 什么事?

三个最要好的朋友
The three best friends anyone could have.

613
00:50:02,565 --> 00:50:07,345

Is he coming or what? I've been waiting all day for him.

621
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:56,909
- 对不起 等谁？ - 周 那个贱人！
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who? - Chow, that dick ass fuck!

622
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:00,430
- 什么?出什么事了？ - 没事 没事
- Why? What's wrong? - Nothings wrong.

623
00:51:00,431 --> 00:51:05,256

00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:07,735
- 不 不！ - 6000美元
- No, no! - $ 6,000 American.

625
00:51:07,736 --> 00:51:12,603
哇 看起来好像真家伙！
Wow looks so real!

626
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:18,169
对不起！
Sorry!

627
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,908
- 艾伦 你他妈搞什么！ - 没事儿 这枪比较灵敏
- Alan, what the fuck! - It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

628
00:51:23,822 --> 00:51:26,647
没人受伤吧?
Everybody ok?

629
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:31,559
没事就赶快开始干活！ 来 音乐！
Ok, then get the fuck back to work! Come on. Music, please!

630
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,298
我的6000块钱呢？
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

631
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:38,081
6,000块? 不 不 不 这是周要的 跟我们没关系
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We got nothing to do with that.

632
00:51:38,081 --> 00:51:40,167
真他妈不敢相信
Un-fucking believable.

633
00:51:40,168 --> 00:51:43,862
那个贱人 要是让我再看见他 让他好好尝尝这枪的味道
This guy, if he backs out again, the shits gonna catch up with him.

634
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:47,690
他在这里结了不少梁子 你们也别想划清关系
He's made a lot of enemies in this town, and now they're gonna be your enemies.

635
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,298
这不公平！
That's not fair!

636
00:51:49,298 --> 00:51:51,775
听着 我们在找个孩子
Ok listen. We're just looking for a little kid.

637
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,775
- 2000美元 - 什么！
- 2,000 dollars. - What!

638
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:56,646
我不知道 这可能还不够 你想要多大的孩子？
I don't know, maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?

639
00:51:56,646 --> 00:52:01,512
不 不！你没听明白 我们在找我们的朋友…16岁
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're looking for our friend... 16 years old.

640
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:05,558
- 泰迪 - 泰迪?

641
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:07,860
- 他昨晚不是还和你们在一起 - 是吗?
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night. - He was?

642
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,645
那你知道他有没有和我们一起走？
Do you know if he left with us?

643
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:12,295
我不知道 你们昨天整晚都在那个角落 和卡米在一起
I don't know. You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.

644
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,165
- 我没看见你们离开 - 卡米?

645
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:17,469
- 她在吗? - 她刚来上班 在后台呢
- Is she here? - Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

646
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,253
你们去找她吧
Go and talk to her.

647
00:52:19,253 --> 00:52:21,818
听着 我们为所发生的一切表示抱歉
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything that happened.

648
00:52:21,818 --> 00:52:24,251
你听好了 记住我跟你说的话
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what I'm going to talk to you know.

649
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:28,338
当你看见周 告诉他 萨米尔跟他说“你好”
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir says "Hello".

650
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,208
好！
Okay!

651
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:34,120
记住 说的要像这样！ “你好”像是讽刺 恐吓
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like threatening. Like, ironic.

652
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:40,034
- “你好” - 好！
- "Hellooo" - Okay!

653
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,337
滚开！快滚开！
Go away! Go away!

654
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:51,250
我当然记得泰迪 他请所有人喝酒
Of course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.

655
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,946
好孩子！他父母一定特骄傲
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

656
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:56,555
可不是
You have no idea.

657
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:59,119
好 你记得我们离开时他有没有一起？
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

658
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,032
是啊 你们一起离开的 怎么你怎么好像连我都不记得了
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but you almost forgot this one right here.

659
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,205
是不是 超级明星？
Right, super star?

660
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:10,684
你昨晚一直跟着我 像个哈巴狗
This one was following me around like a little puppy dog. All night.

661
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:15,554
说你爱上我了 要我跟你结婚
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked me to marry him.

662
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:18,770
经典款的斯图！

663
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:21,554
- 我们没结婚吧? - 当然没有！
- We didn't get married, did we? - Course not!

664
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:24,163
我们只是在酒窖里寻了些乐子
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

665
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:27,770
- 寻什么乐子? - 我们还是先打听泰迪的事吧
- What happens in the Chardonnay room? - Let's just stay on task.

666
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:32,725
我为他跳舞 他挑逗我 我们做爱了
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

667
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,944

- Fuck! - It's ok. You're not married yet.

668
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,856
- 不是大事 - 这是背叛！
- No big deal. - It's cheating!

669
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:40,813
没有冒犯你的意思 你是一个可爱的女士
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

670
00:53:40,814 --> 00:53:43,118
这是对我道德准则的践踏
It's a violation of my moral code.

671
00:53:43,118 --> 00:53:47,898
别难过 斯图 你挺享受的 你哭着 说你有多喜欢
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were crying, saying how special it was.

672
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,421
- 等等 你说 他哭了? - 真是个小宝宝 还哭呢
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying? - What a baby. He was crying.

673
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:57,289
你们应该看看他当时的样子 屁股扭扭的 性感极了
You should have seen him. He was so sexy. The way he moved around.

674
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:02,116
我不得不让他悠着点 让我别那么快泄了
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't drop my load too quick.

675
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:07,290
- 泄了？什么泄了? - 哦 你知道的 我的精液
- Load? What load? - Oh, you know... My sperms.

676
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:13,593
你英文也太差了 我想你是指我的精液吧！
I think your English is off. You're talking about my sperm!

677
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:16,767
- 你从哪来的精液? - 从我的那地方啊！
- Where would your sperm come from? - From my balls!

678
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:21,635
- 等等！你说什么！ - 等等…难道你是…

679
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:23,592
嘿 亲爱的 这可是曼谷
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

680
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:28,461
- 曼谷可不是个名字 - 噢！
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt". - Oh!

681
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:36,332
- 老天啊！ - 哇
- Oh god! - Wow.

682
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:40,418
我不明白 这是魔术表演吗？
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

683
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:45,331
别纠结了 斯图 我们都很开心 同时到了高潮
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed at the same time.

684
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:47,330
那怎么可能?
How's that work?

685
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:50,766
我射到你身体里 你射到了地上
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load on the floor.

686
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:55,678
- 是啊！ - 你毁了我 毁了我的菊花
- Ok! - You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

687
00:54:55,982 --> 00:55:00,894
老天啊！
Oh god!

688
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:10,024
- 斯图！这也不是世界末日 - 对不起 到底怎么回事
- Stu! It's not the end of the world. - Sorry, but I'm so confused.

689
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:14,676
我跟一个有胸部的男人…做爱了
I made love to a man... with boobies.

690
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,417
听着 我发誓 没人会发现这事的
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna find out about this.

691
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,198
但是我们几个不都发现了
But we found out about it.

692
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,547
那就都忘了 就这么办！
And then we forget. That's what we do!

693
00:55:22,547 --> 00:55:25,981
我干过那么多蠢事 我还不是都忘了
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just forget about it.

694
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:29,677
- 是吗? - 是啊！忘了 就什么事都没有了
- Yeah? - Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

695
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:32,894
可能有点难 但是总会过去的
That might be harder to go away, but in time it'll happen.

696
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:37,850
行 那我就忘了它
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

697
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:41,111
- 从没发生过 - 好极了！
- Never happened. - Great!

698

Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

699
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,806

700
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:48,589
- 接啊！ - 我做不到
- Answer it! - I can't.

701
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:51,370
等等！他可能知道泰迪的下落 我们可以试试
What! He might know something about Teddy. C'mon we still have a shot here.

702
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:56,284
整理头绪 面对现实 斯图！
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

703
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:00,934

704
00:56:00,935 --> 00:56:04,370
谁会在婚礼前花整天去钓鱼呢？
Who takes an all day fishing trip the day before a wedding?

705
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:09,195
- 嗯 确实有点傻 - 让泰迪接电话
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid. - Put Teddy on the phone.

706
00:56:11,718 --> 00:56:14,673
- 泰迪晕船了 - 晕船?
- Teddy's seasick actually. - Seasick?

707
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:19,585
- 泰迪从9岁起就是候补海军了 - 那还真奇怪了 他吐的到处都是
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine. - That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

708
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:23,499
我要告诉你些你不知道的事情
I'm gonna tell you something that you do not know.

00:56:23,544 --> 00:56:26,804
- 我不喜欢你 - 哦 这我早知道了
- I don't like you. - Yeah,I knew that already.

710

我女儿选择你 那是她的事
If my daughter chooses you, that's her problem.

743
00:58:18,015 --> 00:58:22,535
- 哇 你出来了? - 是 我没事
- Whoa, you all right? - Yeah, I'm ok.

744
00:58:22,537 --> 00:58:27,101
子弹只是擦过我的胳膊 缝了8针
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm. Eight stitches.

745
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,057
只花了6块钱 不可思议吧？
Only cost six dollars. How is that even possible?

746
00:58:30,058 --> 00:58:34,926
发生的所有一切都不可思议呢
How's any of this even possible?

747
00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:40,490
要是当时往左站一英尺 我就死了
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

748
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:46,274
我们到底怎么办？
What are we gonna do?

749
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:52,882
对不起 兄弟们 这不是计划范围内的
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

750
00:58:52,883 --> 00:58:57,795
- 什么计划 艾伦? - 我已经说太多了
- What plan, Alan? - I've said too much already.

751
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:10,360
艾伦！什么计划?
Alan! What plan?

752
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:13,792
- 都是泰迪的错 - 你到底说什么 艾伦?
- It's all Teddy's fault. - What are you talking about, Alan?

753
00:59:13,793 --> 00:59:16,227
他为什么非和我们在一起！ 他不是我们狼群的成员！
Why is he even here? He's not part of the wolf pack!

754
00:59:16,229 --> 00:59:19,967
- 艾伦 你到底干了什么? - 不是我的错！
- Alan, what did you do? - It's not my fault!

755
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:24,054
泰迪不该把他那包拿出来和大家分享
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

756
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:26,620
- 那一包什么? - 棉花糖
- What bag? - The marshmallows.

757
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,489
我给泰迪特地准备了一包
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

758
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,228
但是晚上太黑 本来就分不太清楚了
But it was dark and it was hard to keep track.

759
00:59:30,228 --> 00:59:33,662
然后 你又差点儿坐上去 我就完全分不清楚了
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't tell which was which.

760
00:59:33,663 --> 00:59:37,185
- 这是犯罪！ - 你对那些棉花糖做了什么 艾伦？
- It was mayhem! - What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

761
00:59:37,186 --> 00:59:39,967
艾伦 说话？
Alan, what did you do?

762
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:41,879
不是很明显的吗?
Isn't it obvious?

763
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:46,315
我往里面加了肌肉松弛剂和我的多动症药
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And plus my ADHD medication.

764
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:48,401
- 什么? - 你又给我们下药?！
- What? - You drugged us again?!

765
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:52,400
不是你们！我只是想把泰迪麻翻 让我们四个好好玩儿
756  Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

766
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:57,009
好好玩？艾伦 你告诉我你什么都没做的！
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that you didn't do anything!

767
00:59:57,009 --> 00:59:58,836
艾伦 你可是发了誓的！
Alan, you swore to god!

768
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:00,878
我只是想我们几个在一起 就像以前一样
I just wanted things to stay the same.

769
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,705
你看看我的脸！你毁了我一生！
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

770
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:07,226
你不是我朋友！
You're not my friend!

771
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:09,964
别这么说 菲尔！你是认真的？ 回美国也不是？
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious? Even in America?

772
01:00:09,966 --> 01:00:14,051
- 是的！ - 老天啊！别这么说 菲尔！
- Yes! - Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

773
01:00:14,052 --> 01:00:17,096
- 别哭 艾伦！ - 你是魔鬼！
- Don't start crying, Alan! - You're the bearded devil!

774
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:20,182
你很喜欢的！我把棉花糖给你时 你还冲着我笑
You liked it! You smiled at me when I handed you the bag with marshmallows.

775
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:25,182
那是因为我喜欢棉花糖 你这个疯子！
Because I like marshmallows, you fucking psycho!

776
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:28,051
嘿！哇哦！别打了！
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

777
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,747
够了！
Enough!

778
01:00:29,747 --> 01:00:32,920
- 为什么 艾伦？为什么？ - 斯图！
- Why, Alan? Why? - Stu!

779
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,571
因为我们三个是最好的朋友 记得吗？
Because we're the three best friends, remember?

780
01:00:35,573 --> 01:00:37,355
记得吗？
Remember?

781
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:42,050
斯图 算了…
Stu, that's enough...

782
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:48,614
兄弟们 现在不是内讧的时候 我们要团结
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta stick together.

783
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:56,526
- 艾伦 你肚子上写了什么? - 什么？嗯？
- Alan, what's that written on your belly? - What? Huh?

784
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:59,832
乐华酒店 周六下午6点
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

785
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:03,700
- 你自己写的? - 不是！
- You write that? - No!

786
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,440
靠 就差20分钟6点了
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

787
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:08,397
英国怎么样 菲尔？在那儿我们是朋友吗？
What about England, Phil? Will we still be friends there?

788
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:13,264
艾伦 我告诉你了 我是一时气急了 我们还是朋友 到哪儿都是
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

789
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:18,352
- 即使在大英帝国? - 是的
- Even Great Britain? - Yeah.

790
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:21,482
你呢 斯图?
What about you, Stu?

791
01:01:21,484 --> 01:01:24,526

792
01:01:24,526 --> 01:01:29,394

Well. About time! Sit down.

795
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:52,655
来 坐吧
Come on, sit.

796
01:01:52,656 --> 01:01:57,393
哇 你们看起来跟狗屎一样
Wow, you guys look like shit.

797
01:01:57,394 --> 01:01:58,914
- 嗯 我们认识你吗? - 嘿！
- Uh, do we know you? - Hey!

798
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:03,742
摘掉你的帽子 看在上帝的份上 你是在酒店里呢 快
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

799
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,829
好 听着 我们对为什么来这里一无所知
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's going on here.

800
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:15,045
知道吗 他们这里卖的威士忌是假的
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here, it's fuckin unreal.

801
01:02:15,046 --> 01:02:19,871
真的 喝起来像狗屎一样 不过你们已经像狗屎一样了
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

802
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:29,000
- 嗯 听着 我有点迷惑 你怎么… - 你知道吗？我也有点迷惑！
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you... - You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

803
01:02:29,698 --> 01:02:34,434
周在哪里？账号和密码在哪儿？
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account code and the fuckin password!

804
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:46,652
我们不知道什么密码 我们只是来找个朋友
We don't know anything about any codes. We're just trying to find our friend.

805
01:02:50,088 --> 01:02:54,913
- 泰迪? - 是的！泰迪！你看见他了吗？
- Teddy? - Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

806
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:01,435
嗯 让我看看…
Hmm, let's see...

807
01:03:01,435 --> 01:03:03,869
这是泰迪！
There's Teddy!

808
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:08,606
狗屎的！是昨天晚上照的
Holy shit! It's from last night.

809
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:11,998
- 你是谁? - 我是个商人
- Who are you? - I'm a businessman.

810
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:16,475
我给你的朋友周投资了一大笔钱
And I've invested a large chunk of capital in your friend Chow.

811
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:20,476
作为回报 他应该在5分钟前
And in return, he was supposed to transfer my profits electronically.

812
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:24,606
把我的钱打给我
About five fuckin minutes ago.

813
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:29,172
所以昨晚 我们绑了泰迪作为保证
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

814
01:03:29,173 --> 01:03:34,040
- 噢 上帝 他没事吧? - 噢 上帝 我还没说完话呢
- Oh my god! Is he okay? - Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

815
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:38,910
你告诉周 明早8点 在这个酒店的天台…
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast on the roof of this hotel...

816
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:42,518
…和我一起吃早饭
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

817
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,650
如果他完成交易 你们就得到泰迪
Or if he makes the transfer, you will get Teddy.

818
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,561
如果没有 你知道… 这可是曼谷
If not well then hey, you know... it's Bangkok.

819
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:55,953
赶快滚吧
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

820
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:03,559
嘿 知道吗？把你的帽子留下
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

821
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:07,038
艾伦 放下帽子
Alan leave the hat.

822
01:04:07,038 --> 01:04:11,906
好孩子
Atta boy.

823
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:21,472
我们死定了！周死了 我们怎么办？
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

824
01:04:21,473 --> 01:04:26,384
这人才不管周是死是活 斯图 他只想知道账号和密码
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu. This whole things about a fucking bank account.

825
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:30,125
我们先回酒店 在周的尸体上找找
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll search Chow's body.

826
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:33,515
希望密码在他的钱包里或其它地方
Hopefully the password's in his wallet or something.

827
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:35,950
- 如果找不到呢? - 他会杀了泰迪
- And what if it isn't? - He's gonna kill Teddy.

828
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:40,862
放松点 到明早8点还有很长时间 我们能想到办法的
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow to figure it out.

829
01:04:43,037 --> 01:04:47,949
先抢我猴子 又抢我帽子 今天可真糟糕
First the monkey and now my hat. How much worse can this day get.

830
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:57,035
上帝啊！
Jesus christ!

831
01:05:01,383 --> 01:05:06,251
我们住在艾伦的小镇里 他让我们的生活跌到了谷底
Well we're livin here in Alan town. And he's drivin our lives into the ground.

832
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:17,078
我们起来的时候 又醉又废柴
When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.

833
01:05:17,078 --> 01:05:21,946
菲尔中了枪 我们被和尚打
Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.

834
01:05:25,078 --> 01:05:29,946
我以前的生活很好 很开心
I was happy, and my life was good.

835
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:34,947
像一名普通牙医那样准备结婚
Getting married like a dentist should.

836
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:38,815
用竹签烤棉花糖吃
Roasting marshmallows on a stick.

837
01:05:38,817 --> 01:05:43,685
被一个有鸡鸡的女孩爆菊…
I got fucked in the ass... by a girl with a dick.

838
01:05:46,381 --> 01:05:50,684
欧耶 我记得这个
Oh yeah, remember that.

839
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:55,597
我们住在艾伦的小镇里
And we're livin in Alan town.

840
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:59,684
到处都是水
There's water everywhere.

841
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:02,685
没电 冰都化了嘛
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The fuckin powers out.

842
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:05,640
因为供电不足
With an inadequate electrical grid, serving millions of people

843
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:09,075
曼谷每年停电1500小时
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

844
01:06:09,076 --> 01:06:11,205
真格的 艾伦 闭嘴！
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

845
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:16,031
闪开！
Out of the way!

846
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:23,944
我们来打开
We got it.

847
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:29,247
哦 上帝！
Oh my god!

848
01:06:29,248 --> 01:06:32,204
周 冷静点！
Chow, calm down!

849
01:06:32,249 --> 01:06:37,074
- 你们想冻死我? - 不 不！
- You put the chill on me? - No, no!

850
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:40,029
没事了
It's okay.

851
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:44,812
放轻松！
Relax!

852
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:54,551
是我们 别激动 深呼吸！
It's just us. Breathe!

853
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,812
我好冷啊
It was so cold.

854
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:59,245
- 我们想法让你暖和起来 - 我好冷啊！
- We're gonna warm you up. - I was so cold!

855
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:04,115
- 你挺过来了 哥们 你挺过来了 - 我挺过来了
- You did good, buddy. You did good. - I did good.

856
01:07:08,594 --> 01:07:11,072
感觉好点了吗?
Feelin better?

857
01:07:11,116 --> 01:07:13,941
- 怎样 你暖和些了吗？ - 我不知道
- Alright, you warm enough? - I don't know.

858
01:07:13,941 --> 01:07:15,897
你来摸摸我的五脏六腑然后告诉我
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

859
01:07:15,897 --> 01:07:19,332
我被关在制冰机里一整天！
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box all day!

860
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:22,070
嘿 艾伦 如果你想要我的太阳镜…
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

861
01:07:22,115 --> 01:07:25,244
…跟我说就行 没必要杀了我
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

862
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:29,418
周 没人想杀你 你当时已经死了 没有脉搏
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

863
01:07:29,419 --> 01:07:31,419
哦 你以前没吸过毒？
Oh, you never do blow before?

864
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:34,114
有时候你的心脏停跳了…然后又开始跳了
Sometimes your heart stop... start up again.

865
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:37,460
- 好好学习吧！ - 听着 真对不起 我们这一天 也过得很糟糕
- Read a book! - Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

866
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:41,723
哦 你过得糟糕！你死了吗？
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

867
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:44,722
- 我中枪了！ - 那你死了吗?
- I got shot! - But did you die?

868
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:48,200

- 我的一个投资商了 - 嗯 投资什么生意？
- An investor in my business. - Yeah, what business is that?

874
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:12,588
这个生意就是“关你屁事” 知道了吧！
It's called "not your business" ok!

那只小猴子昨晚和我一起吸毒…
That little monkey snorting coke with me all night...

880
01:08:36,503 --> 01:08:39,763
当我看斯图和那个人妖亲热时 帮我脱衣服
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make fuckin lady boy.

881
01:08:39,764 --> 01:08:43,849
- 它能去哪儿 - 周 猴子不在我们这里
- He not going anywhere. - We don't have the monkey, Chow.

01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,805
嗯 俄罗斯歹徒抢走了它
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

883
01:08:46,806 --> 01:08:49,718
你们这些白痴！

884
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:53,630
好了 没问题 我们只要把它抢回来就行了

885
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:58,542
- 去哪儿抢? - 从我们刚开始抢它的地方抢
- From where? - From the same place we took him from.

886
01:09:18,456 --> 01:09:23,455
它不是只普通的猴子
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

887
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:38,062
夜里 他就是猴子跑腿
Every night, monkey drug mule.

- That's terrible. - Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

893
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:02,758
你见过猴子坐牢的吗？
You ever see monkey go to jail?

894
01:10:02,758 --> 01:10:07,714
我们招呼猴子过来做生意 等它过来了 抢了它的马甲 就这样
We just take the monkey for deal, he come close, we take his vest. That's that.

895
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:12,800
- 顺便也买点毒品, 你知道的…爽一爽 - 不 别再爽了 周
- We get some blow too, you know... bump. - No, no more bumps, Chow.

我们昨晚为什么把猴子偷走？
How did we wind up with the monkey last night anyway?

901

930
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:59,879
我束手无策了

931
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:02,225
他从后面追上来了
He's coming back around.

932

你说真的?
Are you for real?

937
01:13:56,049 --> 01:14:00,874
他们会好好照顾你的 好吧
They're gonna take good care of you here, ok.

938
01:14:00,919 --> 01:14:04,918

吸进去
Soak it in.

943
01:14:25,483 --> 01:14:30,048
把烟吸到你的小肺里 就这样
Breathe the smoke into your tiny little lungs. There you go.

944
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:34,003
有趣的是 我一直对抽烟不感冒 但是…
It's funny. I've never been much of a smoker, but...

945
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:36,352
你抽烟的样子可真酷啊
Boy does it look cool on you.

946
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:41,176
艾伦 快！我们要走了！

953
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,173
我给钱 他交人
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

954
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,869
你就从没遇到过事情不这么顺利的 周？
You ever do anything that doesn't end up in a standoff, Chow?

955
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:52,129

你的密码是 “胡扯1”?
Your password is "baloney1" ?

977
01:17:09,473 --> 01:17:12,515
我以前只是用“胡扯” 但银行非让加个数字
Well it used to be just "baloney" but now they make you add number.

978
01:17:12,516 --> 01:17:17,428

Samir, you fucked me over six grand? You camel jockey!

992

你吐我?
You spit on me?

993
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:31,425
这次6000 上次8000 这不是钱的问题 这是原则！
Six grand this time, eight grand last time. It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

994
01:18:31,426 --> 01:18:34,511

01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:42,728
你们没事吧?
You guys ok?

998
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:46,164
- 到底怎么回事? - 国际刑警 彼得森警探
- What the fucks going on? - Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

999
01:18:46,164 --> 01:18:47,511
- 你是个警察? - 是的
- You're a cop? - Yes.

1000
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:50,293
这个行动计划已经好几周了
This sting operation has been in place for weeks.

1001
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:53,031
萨米尔告诉我们 你们的朋友失踪了…
When Samir told us that your friend was lost...

1002
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:57,814
我们就利用这个信息引周出来 对不起
We took advantage of that information. I'm sorry.

1003
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,248
- 那现在能让泰迪上来了吗? - 不 艾伦 他不知道泰迪在哪里！
- So can Teddy come out of the car now? - No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

1004
01:19:03,249 --> 01:19:05,640
他们没有抓住泰迪 一直都没有
They don't have him. They never had him.

1005
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,334
他们只是利用我们找周 泰迪只是他们的饵
They just needed us to bring them Chow. They used Teddy as bait.

1006
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:14,205
- 你们完全都没有线索吗? - 没有 我们能找的地方都找过了
- Do you have any leads at all? - No. We've checked everywhere.

1007
01:19:14,205 --> 01:19:17,247
没人看见他 对不起
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

1008
01:19:17,248 --> 01:19:22,116
如果你们到现在还没找到他 我怕是凶多吉少了
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

1009
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:31,769
为什么他们老这么说？
Why do people keep saying that?

1010
01:19:31,857 --> 01:19:36,682
斯图…不能再拖下去了
Stu... It's time.

1011
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:43,290
艾伦…
Alan...

1012
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:47,897
- 对不起 - 求你别说这个
-I'm sorry. - Don't say that. Please.

1013
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:52,203
- 不 这次我们真的搞砸了 - 天哪！到底有多糟糕？
- No this time we really fucked up. - Oh god! How bad?

1014
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:56,246
难道 要取消婚礼？
Like, no wedding bad?

1015
01:19:56,247 --> 01:20:01,115
差不多…可能更糟一些！
Yeah... a little worse than that!

1016
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:29,504
你看 这么说怎么样？ 他掉下渔船 溺水了
Ok, how about this? He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

1017
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:32,723
不行
No.

1018
01:20:32,723 --> 01:20:36,722
好 那说他被车给撞了
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

1019
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:39,938
- 艾伦！ - 干嘛啊 菲尔 我正忙着呢 ！
- Alan! - Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

1020
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,853
这里每年多少人被车撞死？
How many people get run over here?

1021
01:20:41,853 --> 01:20:45,678
- 一年1200以上 菲尔 - 好极了！
- Over 1200 a year, Phil. - Perfect!

1022
01:20:45,678 --> 01:20:50,372
他的尸体被撞得无法辨认 就这么定了
His body was too mangled to recover. Case closed.

1023
01:20:50,374 --> 01:20:53,200
能给我加点冰吗？
Can I get more ice, please?

1024
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,938
我不打算对劳拉撒谎
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

1025
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:59,806
- 斯图 你想结婚还是不想？ - 看看我都干了些什么啊 菲尔
- Stu, do you want this or not? - Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

1026
01:21:05,765 --> 01:21:10,589
很明显 我对所有种类的妓女缺乏免疫力
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All kinds, apparently.

1027
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:19,675
- 我内心有个魔鬼！ - 那又怎样?
- I have a demon in me! - So what?

1028
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:24,284
泰迪死了 我仍然可以救劳拉
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

1029
01:21:24,285 --> 01:21:26,241
就是让她摆脱我这个魔鬼
Just let her live her life without me.

1030
01:21:26,242 --> 01:21:27,675
斯图！
Stu!

1031
01:21:27,676 --> 01:21:31,458
我要给道格打电话 告诉他我不回去了
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm never coming back.

1032
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:35,023
远离这失败的人生
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

1033
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:39,631
我以后就呆在曼谷了 我想我是属于这里的
Gonna stay here in Bangkok. I think I belong here.

1034
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:43,239
开一个小牙医诊所
Open up a little dentists office.

1035
01:21:43,241 --> 01:21:48,196
洗洗牙 安心过日子
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

1036
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:54,414
你确定?
You sure about this?

1037
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:02,586
嘿 搞什么鬼！
Hey, what the crud!

1038
01:22:02,586 --> 01:22:07,454

- 我需要答案 哥们 - 我知道…
- I need answers, man. - I know...

1041
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:14,194
道格 你在和谁说话？
Doug, who are you talking to?

1042
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,195
- 什么? - 给我电话！
- What? - Give me the phone!

1043
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:16,410
劳拉 不！这是私人电话…
Lauren, no! That's a private...

1044
01:22:16,412 --> 01:22:17,586

Who is this?

1045
01:22:17,586 --> 01:22:21,760
- 劳拉? - 菲尔？告诉我怎么回事 马上！
- Lauren? - Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

1046

我们把你弟弟丢了
We lost your little brother.

1047
01:22:23,759 --> 01:22:28,715
- 什么? - 他在曼谷下落不明
- What? - Bangkok has him now.

1048
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,585
得走楼梯
You gotta take the stairs.

1049
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:41,323
你们在曼谷?
You're in Bangkok?

1050
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,454
呃 是个指头！
Ooh, that's a finger!

1051
01:22:45,454 --> 01:22:47,627
让斯图接电话！
Put Stu on the phone!

1052
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:51,367
曼谷每年停电1500小时
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

1053
01:22:51,368 --> 01:22:54,279
斯图现在不想和任何人说话
Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.

1054

到处是水 停电了
- Water everywhere. Powers out.

1055

她会伤透你的心的！
She's gonna break your heart!

1060

1061
01:23:12,018 --> 01:23:15,843
斯图？到底怎么回事？泰迪丢了？
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he mean you lost Teddy?

1062
01:23:15,843 --> 01:23:20,755
什么？菲尔这么告诉你的？ 不 不 我们跟泰迪约错地方了
What? Is that what Phil said? No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

1065
01:23:33,147 --> 01:23:37,668
斯图！
Stu!

1066
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:40,625
- 斯图！ - 上帝！

1068
01:23:43,408 --> 01:23:48,189
跟上 艾伦！
Come on, Alan!

1069
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,972
嘿 能给我们讲讲你想起什么了吗！
Hey, you mind filling us in!

1070
01:23:49,973 --> 01:23:52,623
好 记得我们醒来的时候 停电了
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

1071
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:55,144
你在哪里发现了泰迪的指头？
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

1072
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:58,363
- 在一滩水里 - 但那刚开始并不是水
- In a pool of water. - But it didn't start out as water.

1073
01:23:58,363 --> 01:24:00,102
对啊 是冰
No, it was ice.

1074
01:24:00,103 --> 01:24:01,797
没错！泰迪是从制冰机里拿的冰…
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

1075
01:24:01,797 --> 01:24:04,449
…然后回到房间 把指头放到冰里 然后睡着了
...came back to the room. Put his finger on ice and fell asleep.

1076
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:05,492
你试想一下 如果你醒来…
Now what do you do if you wake up...

1077
01:24:05,493 --> 01:24:08,362
…发现你的指头飘在一碗水里 你会怎么做？
...and you find your finger floating in a bowl of melted ice?

1078
01:24:08,363 --> 01:24:11,884
我会去取更多的冰 斯图…去15楼取冰！
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th fuckin floor!

1079
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:15,058
是的！泰迪坐上电梯 忽然停电了…
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

1080
01:24:15,059 --> 01:24:19,927
- 狗屎的！原来是这样！ - 他在制冰机里
- Holy shit! Of course! - He's at the ice machine.

1081
01:24:20,885 --> 01:24:25,795
艾伦 不对！
Alan, no!

1082
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:27,579

But we're gonna get you outta here. It's gonna be fine.

1091

Alright, guests are arriving, people starting to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

1096
01:25:23,142 --> 01:25:25,968
- 怎么回去? - 我不知道 坐计程车?

It's funny. I can't remember anything But... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

曼谷…

He is on his way. He will be here...

1125
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:12,696

I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.

1126
01:28:14,437 --> 01:28:19,304

Look! There they are!

1127

1128
01:28:28,174 --> 01:28:31,042
- 艾伦 那里没码头 - 坐稳了！
- Alan, there's no dock. - Just hang on!

1129
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:33,913
- 艾伦 这一点都不好玩！转一下方向！ - 坐稳了！
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat! - Hang on!

1130
01:28:33,914 --> 01:28:36,781
- 是艾伦在开船吗? - 什么?
- Is that Alan driving the boat? - What?

1131
01:28:36,781 --> 01:28:40,824
呃 我们应该往后退几步
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

1132
01:28:40,825 --> 01:28:43,085
噢 上帝！
Oh my god!

1133
01:28:43,086 --> 01:28:45,304
转个弯！
Turn the boat!

1134
01:28:45,304 --> 01:28:46,824
大家都往后退
Everyone back up a little bit here.

1135
01:28:46,825 --> 01:28:51,693
先生 在事情变好之前 总有点糟糕
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

1136
01:29:06,128 --> 01:29:10,736
嗨！大家好！
Hi! Hi everybody!

1137
01:29:10,737 --> 01:29:15,649
出场比我们预计的要火爆 不好意思弄坏了草坪
Came in a little hotter than we planned. I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

1138
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:18,563
没事 都能修护 别担心
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll be fine.

1139
01:29:18,563 --> 01:29:20,605
- 宝贝！ - 哦 上帝！

见到你我真高兴！
I'm so happy to see you!

1141
01:29:24,129 --> 01:29:28,953

1142
01:29:29,302 --> 01:29:33,083
- 你还好吗? - 嗯 我没事

1143
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:35,952
- 你的手！ - 我知道
- Your hand! - I know.

1144
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:40,212
出了点小意外 我没事
We had an accident. I'm ok.

1145
01:29:40,213 --> 01:29:41,473
都是你的错！
This is your fault!

1146
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:46,387
- 爸 - 他说得对 我不够坦诚
- Dad. - He's right. I have not been completely honest.

1147
01:29:46,517 --> 01:29:48,081
- 斯图？别说了 - 嗯?
- Stu? Don't do this. -Yeah?

1148
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:50,908
谢谢 菲尔 但我得说出来
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

1149
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:55,777
你说我是个笑柄 但我不是
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

1150
01:29:55,952 --> 01:30:00,776
我不是什么怪怪的 乳状的 米做的 烂烂的 喂小孩和老人的东西!
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

1151
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:08,559
如果你加点辣椒粉的话我还有可能是！
Maybe I would be if you added some cayenne pepper!

1152
01:30:10,256 --> 01:30:12,081
我也希望我是个无聊的牙医…
I wish I was a boring dentist...

1153
01:30:12,082 --> 01:30:14,341
…过着无聊的生活 有一堆无聊的朋友…
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

1154
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:16,906
…但我不是
... but I don't and I'm not.

1155
01:30:16,908 --> 01:30:19,429
我是这个怪异狼群的一员
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

1156
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:22,950
不是怪异 是酷！ 而且不收会费
It's not weird. It's pretty cool actually. No membership fees.

1157
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,688
我听够了 你给我过来
I've had enough of this. Come here.

1158
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:30,080
哇哦！告诉你
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

1159
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:33,949
我有黑暗的一面！
- I got a dark side!

1160
01:30:33,949 --> 01:30:36,818
我心里住着贞子！
There's a demon in me!

1161
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,601
是真的 他身体里有精子
It's true, he has semen in him.

1162
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:41,385
我说的是贞子
I said demon.

1163
01:30:41,385 --> 01:30:46,339
- 但你身体里确实有精子 不是吗？ - 不一回事 但是谢谢 艾伦
- But you also have semen in you, remember? - Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

1164
01:30:48,123 --> 01:30:53,035
我要说的是 我身体里的贞子 把我带到了一些很危险的地方
The point is, this demon takes me to some pretty weird places.

1165
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:57,861
我们在曼谷丢了泰迪两天
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

1166
01:30:57,862 --> 01:31:01,947
但是同样的贞子 让我们找到了他 把他带回来
But that same demon took us to hell and back to find him.

1167
01:31:01,949 --> 01:31:04,643
我们战胜了曼谷 我们赢了
We took on Bangkok and we won.

1168
01:31:04,644 --> 01:31:09,469
如果你问 我会说这感觉棒极了！
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

1169
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,642
我爱你的女儿 我要和她结婚
I love your daughter, and I'm gonna marry her.

1170
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:20,817
- 除非你不愿意? - 我愿意
- Unless you have any problem with that? - I'm good.

1171
01:31:20,818 --> 01:31:25,685
但是 如果我们可以得到你TMD祝福…
But all that said, it would actually mean a great deal to both of us...

1172
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:30,945
…将对我们意义重大！
...if we could just get your mother fucking blessing!

1173
01:31:46,207 --> 01:31:48,901
嘿 艾伦…
Hey, Alan...

1174
01:31:48,902 --> 01:31:53,509
- 你的光头挺酷的 - 谢谢你 菲尔
- That looks pretty cool shaved. - Thanks, Phil.

1175
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:55,466
你也应该把你的剃了
You should shave your head too.

1176
01:31:55,468 --> 01:32:00,293
- 为什么我要那么做? - 那样我们看上去就像双胞胎
- Why would I do that? - Well than we would look exactly alike.

1177
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:15,682
- 好好照顾我女儿 斯图 - 我会的
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu. - I will.

1178
01:32:22,597 --> 01:32:25,204
非常抱歉我们差点用那艘船撞死大家
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with the boat.

1179
01:32:25,204 --> 01:32:29,856
只要你在这里就行了
Just happy you're here.

1180
01:32:29,856 --> 01:32:33,724
也别担心纹身 我一回洛杉矶就洗掉它
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

1181
01:32:33,726 --> 01:32:38,508
- 没关系 我能适应它的 - 真的吗?
- That's ok. I can get used to it. - Really?

1182
01:32:40,943 --> 01:32:43,247
但是现在 我们还是换个位置吧?
But for now, let's switch sides?

1183
01:32:43,248 --> 01:32:46,855
- 哦 好吧	 - 谢谢
- Yeah, ok. - Thank you.

1184
01:32:46,855 --> 01:32:49,637
好多了
Much better.

I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's for my third best friend.

...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

1216
01:36:33,756 --> 01:36:36,277
嘿 兄弟们 说了你们也不信
