1
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,471
This food is not cooked, Soledad.

2
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:56,644
Mine has too much salt.

3
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:59,568
Silence. Speak to your mother with respect.

4
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:02,569
Soledad is Xavier's mother.
She is my mother.

5
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,365
Who remembers?

6
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,410
I have many sons. And many sons
should have many mothers. Is logic.

7
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,250
Also more enjoyable.

8
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,881
Now go to the whore Inez
who you will not remember.

9
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,179
I have sons here who are sons.

10
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,443
We must honour this harlot.
She's famous in the world.

11
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:45,774
One time in the capital,
she serviced a whole military prison.

12
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,360
On a Sunday.

13
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,454
Azul, the woman wishes you first.

14
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:03,547
Come to her, Azul.
I've lit her fires for you.

15
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,429
I do not understand.

16
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:13,048
This Azul will kiss the lips
of the Captain of the Police...

17
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,135
but he will not kiss Inez.

18
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,562
Has he not heard of my fame in the capital?

19
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,258
We do not use our knives
to kill our brothers.

20
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,901
Now shake the hand.

21
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,816
You will make peace with my son.

22
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,619
A gringo is your son?

23
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,705
This one is no gringo. No more.

24
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:47,827
He has become my son. As you are, Xavier.

25
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,215
You will shake the hand.

26
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:57,924
I have ordered it!

27
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:13,048
There's a sweet smell in the night,
Carlos, but you wear a sour face.

28
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:14,247
Go away.

29
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,169
You are a fool, Angel.

30
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,340
It is good for young boys to fight.
It turns them into men.

31
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:26,012
You've learned little of this life,
my brother.

32
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,513
I have learned to be a leader of men.

33
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:30,887
You're a leader of bandits...

34
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,605
teaching the one who is not your son
to be the same.

35
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,983
I am a leader of revolutionaries...

36
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:38,195
and if I choose Azul above the others...

37
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,987
it is because Azul is worth more
than my blood.

38
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,365
He's more like me than my blood...

39
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,111
and one day, will be a leader as I am.

40
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,283
For the cause, Carlos.

41
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:52,788
- We do not fight for the cause anymore.
- Take care, old man. You provoke.

42
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,922
I will provoke if I wish.
I'm older than you.

43
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:05,715
Do you think your men are not tired
of the way that we live?

44
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:09,221
They do not wear sour faces,
but behind their faces they doubt now.

45
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:11,520
They question and they wonder.

46
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:15,524
You say we must destroy the French
and the Spanish...

47
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:19,312
and the rich Yanquis who devour Mexico
and swallow her bones.

48
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:21,945
And yet we do not attack the French
and the Spanish.

49
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:24,822
And the rich Yanquis, if they are rich...

50
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:27,451
stay on their side of the river.

51
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,617
No, my lovely brother.

52
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:34,667
We only play games, children's games...

53
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,206
or the games of madmen.

54
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:42,009
What is the day today?

55
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:46,635
A Thursday. The third day of July.

56
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,346
So I believed.

57
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,940
We will do something new tomorrow.

58
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,604
In the north.

59
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:38,144
The land across the river
belonged to the people of Mexico...

60
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:41,023
before the gringos took it for their own.

61
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:46,525
Now, on the day these Yanquis call
their Day of Independence...

62
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,780
we go back for land.

63
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:55,751
And what our regular armies
could not keep for us, we take.

64
00:15:58,464 --> 00:15:59,662
Azul...

65
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,506
and Xavier will lead.

66
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,038
I know what you think,
that this is the land of your people.

67
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:48,504
But they are not your people now.

68
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:51,045
You are one of us.

69
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,715
They celebrate the Day of Independence
as I had thought.

70
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:04,368
- Look at your boy.
- Look at him.

71
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:09,539
- Mighty fine boy.
- Mighty pretty gal.

72
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:20,261
Save your energy for the wedding, Jess.

73
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,982
I reckon you and Doc will have to start
putting up a wedding soon, Abe.

74
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,154
If our crops are good, God willing,
maybe so.

75
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,660
But that's for the young folks to decide,
wouldn't you say, Doctor?

76
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,097
You and Manuel. If there are people...

77
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,199
It sure can tire a girl, dancing with Jess.

78
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,369
Yes, miss.

79
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,925
Do you want to dance out
the rest of your life with him?

80
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:41,346
Well, I admit he doesn't exactly
hang the moon for me.

81
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,219
I like him. If I have to, I'll settle for him.

82
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,979
Do you really have to settle for anyone?

83
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:50,189
Now look, miss...

84
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:57,027
I don't want to hold you here
like I held your mother.

85
00:21:57,114 --> 00:22:00,566
I belong here, Pa. This is my home.

86
00:22:16,843 --> 00:22:19,049
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

87
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:31,939
Charlie!

88
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,562
- Doc!
- Coming.

89
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,491
- Make way for the Doc.
- Let me get through.

90
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,741
- What happened?
- He fell out of that tree.

91
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,952
Let me take a look, Charlie.

92
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:54,289
My bag's home.

93
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,630
Here now, you take this thumb
and this thumb...

94
00:22:57,717 --> 00:22:59,793
and press them hard together.

95
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,587
- Joanne, I'll come with you.
- Tarnation, Jess!

96
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:08,383
You fuss and fret too much over me.
I can look after myself.

97
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:12,431
It's nothing serious.
Let's get back to dancing.

98
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:12,533
Nobody upstairs.

99
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,451
No women, nothing.

100
00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:19,958
Nothing nowhere. Rich Yanquis.

101
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,543
Come, Azul, there's nothing there!

102
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,314
GREASER

103
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,654
Please.

104
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:10,990
No!

105
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,778
Come on, let's go get them!

106
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:36,082
- Let me get on!
- No, Doc, no more room!

107
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:42,299
I've got to get to my daughter!
My daughter...

108
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,532
Find Azul and Manuel.
We will wait by the river.

109
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:40,770
Come on.

110
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:53,362
- He said for you to come.
- Leave the gringo.

111
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,369
Come, Azul, with me.

112
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:01,040
Leave him.

113
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,379
Come!

114
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:04,562
That's Joanne's buggy. Let me off.

115
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:43,891
Come on, get them!

116
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,747
Come on, men, hurry up there!
Come on, boys, let's go!

117
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:54,840
Come on, let's get him! Over here!

118
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:35,525
Pa, don't do that.
If it hadn't been for him...

119
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,861
They'll kill him, Pa.

120
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,568
Fair skin, blue eyes.

121
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:04,898
Now, how did he come to be with them?

122
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:32,969
We wait.

123
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,899
There is no use for more waiting.
It is too dangerous.

124
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:38,901
You do not understand.
Four sons are missing.

125
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,527
Antonio, Manuel, Xavier.

126
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,317
- Azul?
- Yes, all.

127
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,993
If they're alive, we find them. We go back!

128
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:04,966
The gringos killed Antonio.

129
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,970
- And the others?
- Manuel was murdered.

130
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:15,266
By Azul, for attacking a gringo woman.

131
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:18,643
You are lying. You lie, Xavier.

132
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,820
We go back!

133
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:27,857
To kill him or to save him?
Which, my father?

134
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:30,819
We go back, but to Mexico.

135
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,588
We cross!

136
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,581
Pa had to work hard
putting you back together.

137
00:42:28,262 --> 00:42:30,136
We both undressed you.

138
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,639
I've been a doctor's daughter all my life.

139
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:40,098
I've seen more than one grown man
in his natural state.

140
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,943
The spectacle holds no surprises for me.

141
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,076
Are you up to my asking
a few pertinent questions?

142
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:00,960
What's your name?

143
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,709
I asked for your name, boy.

144
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:14,007
Now look, son, I don't expect gratitude
for saving your life.

145
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,101
But I have a hunch you're strong enough
to do some talking...

146
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:18,515
so I'd like you to talk.

147
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:20,348
Where are you from?

148
00:43:26,112 --> 00:43:29,647
We know you're not Mexican, boy.
Where do you belong?

149
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:38,739
I see. It's not that you can't talk,
it's just that you won't.

150
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,660
Pa, it's not the time.

151
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,581
All right.

152
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:47,788
I'm not gonna force you now.

153
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:52,210
But later you're gonna tell me
everything I want to know.

154
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:58,220
Here, you come along, miss. Come along.

155
00:43:59,353 --> 00:44:02,557
Let's give him a while
to think things over a bit.

156
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,062
Should my tears forever flow

157
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:56,282
Should my zeal no languor know

158
00:44:56,953 --> 00:45:01,365
All for sin could not atone

159
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:06,334
Thou must save, and thou alone

160
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:11,250
In my hand no price I bring

161
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:31,915
All I'm saying is the Governor
ought to be made aware of the matter.

162
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:35,838
How do we know raids like last night
ain't taking place all along the border?

163
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:39,711
There is no master plan in Mexico City,
if that's what you're thinking.

164
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:41,549
The war's over, Jess.

165
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:46,888
A band of outlaws just crossed the river,
so let's not make any more of it.

166
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,390
Well, I'll wager they never crossed back
over the river.

167
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:53,270
I wager a few of them
are still hanging around.

168
00:46:53,361 --> 00:46:56,812
If that's so,
we'll just have to take our chances.

169
00:46:56,906 --> 00:47:00,026
Hell, I don't think
we ought to take any chances.

170
00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:04,368
Doc, Joanne.

171
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:26,934
If you're bound and determined to clear
out of here, I'm not gonna stop you.

172
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:31,099
As a medical man, I may not advise it,
but as a member of this community...

173
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:36,018
I'm sure not in favour of you staying.
So if you want to go, just go right ahead.

174
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,192
Well, what's holding you?

175
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,540
Sit down, boy. It's wiser.

176
00:48:03,806 --> 00:48:07,009
Since it's obvious that
you have to put up here for a spell...

177
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:11,051
accept that fact and answer
those questions I asked you earlier.

178
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:19,610
Don't try me, boy.

179
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:23,992
Just because I patched you up doesn't
mean I can't let others string you up.

180
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:26,994
There's no point in saving a life
if it's not worth saving.

181
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,828
- Where you going, miss?
- Chores, Pa. Possess yourself.

182
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:36,787
You're hell-bent on putting me
to the test, aren't you?

183
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:40,341
All right. You're gonna get satisfaction.

184
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:43,877
You're gonna get it right now.
What's all that for?

185
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:47,672
Hush, Pa, no need to make noise
for two. Excuse me.

186
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,352
Have you gone plumb crazy?

187
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:53,354
I just want to examine
this wild man's face.

188
00:48:55,024 --> 00:48:58,144
Easy, boy.
At this moment, I'm stronger than you.

189
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:00,904
Lather him up.

190
00:49:01,364 --> 00:49:04,649
- Do as I say, Pa.
- Yes, miss.

191
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,376
I think you should know I'm not
a woman of minor achievement...

192
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,010
and I add to my list daily.

193
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:27,713
I cook, sew, undertake all
the normal female activities.

194
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:31,384
And then in addition,
I handle a plough as well as a piano...

195
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:33,933
split a log in record quick time and...

196
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:37,058
I'm just about as good as any man, huh, Pa?

197
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:39,067
Did I hurt you?

198
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,735
I'm fearfully sorry.

199
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:45,365
But with all my accomplishments, I have...

200
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:48,282
Now, did I do it again?

201
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:53,622
How can I apologise? Except to say that
I've never shaved a man before.

202
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:57,492
So if my hand should falter
and my fingers slip...

203
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:14,054
- I'll do it.
- The walls of silence have crumbled.

204
00:50:14,604 --> 00:50:15,802
My God.

205
00:50:31,537 --> 00:50:32,735
Hungry?

206
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,514
The wild man doesn't have
very civilised eating habits, does he?

207
00:50:56,604 --> 00:51:00,305
In time, Pa.
Infants crawl before they can walk.

208
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,945
- Now...
- Doctor, you to home?

209
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:18,205
You damn fool.

210
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:27,258
Another sound like that
and they'll be up here.

211
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,425
Give me that gun.

212
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:35,348
I'm no hero, boy. The gun's empty.

213
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,538
What is it now, Jabe?

214
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,746
Alma's convinced
she's got complications again.

215
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:03,037
I'm sure there's no cause for alarm.
Go right in.

216
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:05,998
You must be hungry.

217
00:52:14,807 --> 00:52:19,136
You know, it's mighty awkward for me
to still not know what to call you.

218
00:52:21,189 --> 00:52:24,273
I can't go on calling you "sir" and "boy."

219
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,402
My name are...

220
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:30,155
My name is...

221
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,064
Azul.

222
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,571
That's Spanish for "blue," isn't it?

223
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,250
It's not my real name.

224
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:48,748
It's a kind of...

225
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:51,087
Nickname?

226
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,184
Yeah, nickname.

227
00:53:19,455 --> 00:53:21,329
Put your shirt back on.

228
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:24,538
I'm all right?

229
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:28,043
All right? As much as most
and more so than some.

230
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:31,715
Want a swig of
some honest to goodness brandy?

231
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:37,753
I can go?

232
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:41,848
I asked if you wanted a drink.

233
00:53:48,484 --> 00:53:52,149
It mightn't do you any harm
to stay on a few extra days.

234
00:53:53,114 --> 00:53:57,112
No, I figure I'll leave before sunup.

235
00:53:57,994 --> 00:53:59,737
Whatever seems fair.

236
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,165
Since you haven't told us
where you're from...

237
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:10,373
I don't imagine you'll let on
where you're going.

238
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,461
Have you made any plans, Blue?

239
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,974
I see.

240
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,773
Right back where we started.

241
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:34,571
Before you go...

242
00:54:34,655 --> 00:54:37,692
I think there's something
you might wanna have.

243
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:44,117
We found this on you that first night.

244
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:49,369
It might be stolen goods,
but I have a sneaky hunch it's not.

245
00:55:01,057 --> 00:55:02,551
Your mother's?

246
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:07,767
Dead?

247
00:55:30,545 --> 00:55:32,584
Where's he looking off to?

248
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:35,628
South.

249
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:39,129
Mexico, I guess.

250
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:44,012
Well, I reckon he feels
they are more his people now.

251
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:46,843
He can't go back to them, Pa.

252
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:50,103
He killed one of them.
He's got nowhere to go.

253
00:55:51,858 --> 00:55:55,606
No, miss.
What he does has to be his decision.

254
00:56:00,283 --> 00:56:01,991
Leave him be, girl.

255
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:50,547
- Pa!
- Blue!

256
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:52,600
Pa, come down here quick!

257
00:57:52,687 --> 00:57:54,395
- What is it?
- Something's happened!

258
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,974
What happened?

259
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:03,402
What? Where is he?

260
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,411
What in damnation...

261
00:58:20,756 --> 00:58:22,416
He's talking, Pa.

262
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:27,595
- He's saying he wants to stay and work.
- That's talking?

263
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:34,851
He's gonna have to be
a little less subtle to suit me.

264
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:36,182
Pa, use your senses.

265
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:39,024
We need a hand around the place.
We always needed someone.

266
00:58:39,108 --> 00:58:42,524
- Have you forgotten what he is?
- Was, Pa.

267
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:46,489
You're always going on
about giving a man a fair chance.

268
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:48,732
That's all Blue's asking for.

269
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:54,823
If you aren't the damndest...

270
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,908
most ornery, most blackmailing daughter...

271
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,199
Yes, Pa.

272
00:58:59,545 --> 00:59:01,454
That's why you love me.

273
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:05,379
Now I'm gonna tell Blue
how delighted you are to take him on.

274
01:00:57,872 --> 01:01:00,410
They're coming.

275
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:05,622
I sure do wish I'd never invited anybody.

276
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:08,795
Have a do, expect some doings.

277
01:01:11,636 --> 01:01:13,545
Possess yourself, miss.

278
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,551
We can't hide him from people forever.

279
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:51,629
The good Lord and my daughter's
needle sure work miracles.

280
01:01:52,552 --> 01:01:54,628
Yes, sir, you look splendid.

281
01:01:55,096 --> 01:01:56,720
My suit fits.

282
01:01:57,515 --> 01:02:00,302
It fits splendid.

283
01:02:00,393 --> 01:02:02,136
You are gonna do just fine.

284
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:06,308
Just stand tall and smile, and you'll
win them over with your charm.

285
01:02:06,566 --> 01:02:09,235
- Charm.
- Charm, yeah.

286
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:13,519
Hi, Jim.

287
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:17,484
- Hi, Jess.
- Evening.

288
01:02:17,952 --> 01:02:20,739
I'm sure glad you could all come
to our social.

289
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:23,237
Sure is nice seeing y'all again.

290
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,406
Looks more like a military drill
than a social.

291
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:30,630
Might as well come prepared, Doctor,
after what happened last time.

292
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,667
How you doing, Joanne?

293
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:35,510
Come on now, let's not dilly-dally.

294
01:02:36,137 --> 01:02:39,138
Let's get in here
and get this party started.

295
01:02:42,351 --> 01:02:43,976
Yeah, charm.

296
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:55,357
I see you've finally gotten somebody
to help you around the place.

297
01:02:55,698 --> 01:02:57,572
He's come here to help us out.

298
01:02:57,658 --> 01:03:00,529
You and Joanne can't farm this place alone.

299
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:04,197
Especially after what's been going on
around here lately.

300
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,291
It's sure been nice talking to you,
Mr. Blue.

301
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:52,747
"The attention of every lady
was soon caught by a young man...

302
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:55,247
"whom they had never seen before...

303
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:57,832
"of most gentlemanlike appearance...

304
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,420
"walking with an officer
on the other side of the way.

305
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:04,012
"The officer was Mr. Denny...

306
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,722
"and he bowed as they passed.

307
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:10,057
"All were struck with the stranger's air.

308
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:13,015
"All wondered who he could be.

309
01:04:14,735 --> 01:04:16,443
"Mr. Denny addressed them..."

310
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:19,102
We don't have many strangers come this way.

311
01:04:19,198 --> 01:04:20,776
Last one was Mr. Saunders.

312
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:23,951
Stayed with the Corralls
about five years ago, ain't that right?

313
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:26,112
Yes, all of five years ago.

314
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:29,243
You good at games like this, Mr. Hamilton?

315
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:34,087
I used to be.

316
01:04:34,255 --> 01:04:35,915
That's my boy Jess.

317
01:04:36,007 --> 01:04:39,257
- He's real good at games.
- Yeah, I can see that.

318
01:04:40,803 --> 01:04:42,796
Come on and join us in a hand.

319
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:45,925
Think we'd all like to see
just how good you be.

320
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:49,139
"He had all the best parts of beauty...

321
01:04:49,228 --> 01:04:53,641
- "a fine countenance, a good figure..."
- What are you, reformed, Mr. Hamilton?

322
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,319
You could say.

323
01:04:57,403 --> 01:05:02,148
"...determined if possible to find out,
led the way across the street..."

324
01:05:05,328 --> 01:05:07,486
Just stretching my legs, Pa.

325
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:29,351
That's a mighty special rig you got there.

326
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:31,720
That's Mexican, ain't it?

327
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:42,147
"...turning back,
had reached the same spot."

328
01:05:43,366 --> 01:05:44,860
Pick them up.

329
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:49,319
I've seen a couple just like it
on some outlaws.

330
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:51,618
Mexicans.

331
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:57,412
Doc tell you about the trouble we had
not long back?

332
01:05:58,714 --> 01:06:00,257
He's heard about it.

333
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:04,042
He hear about the stealing?
You tell him about the killings?

334
01:06:04,512 --> 01:06:07,679
- What are you getting at, Jess?
- Nothing, Pa.

335
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:13,892
I'm surprised to see one of us
outfitted like one of them, that's what.

336
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,723
Blue's from El Paso.

337
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:20,183
It's common enough to pick up
Mexican goods in a border town.

338
01:06:20,486 --> 01:06:21,731
How many?

339
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:26,322
Yeah, that's for true,
and the point is why bother?

340
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:30,528
Unless a body happens to be partial
to bean eaters.

341
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:33,205
You partial to them?

342
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:38,584
Mexicans are no worse or better
than anybody else.

343
01:06:45,136 --> 01:06:48,587
Listen to that, folks.
He is partial to them after all.

344
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,172
I wonder if he don't shoot
the way them greasers do...

345
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:54,510
seeing as how he takes so to their gear.

346
01:06:54,604 --> 01:06:57,973
I have a busy day ahead of me.

347
01:06:58,399 --> 01:07:01,850
So if you'll excuse me, good night.

348
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,688
It's a crying shame.

349
01:07:05,323 --> 01:07:08,277
I was gonna ask him to show off
his shooting techniques to us.

350
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:10,941
And he says he's got a busy day ahead.

351
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,285
There mightn't be some other reason
you're leaving our company?

352
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,786
There might.

353
01:07:19,712 --> 01:07:21,954
I'm tired, Mr. Parker...

354
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:24,673
particularly of you.

355
01:07:55,122 --> 01:07:57,281
Well, are we playing or not?

356
01:07:57,959 --> 01:07:59,073
Your deal.

357
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,868
What's gonna happen?

358
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:45,372
I guess there'll be some whispering
and wondering...

359
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:47,791
and a little speculating.

360
01:08:48,718 --> 01:08:52,668
But it'll all die down soon enough.
They'll come to accept Blue.

361
01:08:55,892 --> 01:08:57,516
What in damnation was that for?

362
01:08:57,602 --> 01:09:01,136
If we're in it, we're in it,
and we might as well see it through.

363
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:22,908
- He knows.
- He only suspects.

364
01:09:26,714 --> 01:09:28,754
Nobody pays Jess any mind.

365
01:09:34,931 --> 01:09:36,591
They can't forget.

366
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:39,767
Why should they?

367
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:42,431
I don't belong.

368
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:47,609
It can't work.

369
01:09:50,112 --> 01:09:51,607
You do belong.

370
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:58,322
I guess I was brought out here...

371
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:01,734
about the time your kin
settled this spread.

372
01:12:01,827 --> 01:12:04,034
What was it took them to Mexico?

373
01:12:04,247 --> 01:12:06,916
What takes hold of most people
who keep on the move...

374
01:12:06,999 --> 01:12:08,458
if that's the kind they be?

375
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:11,709
A place that sounds like it's the answer,
I guess.

376
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:23,137
My folks settled in Mexico when I was...
How old?

377
01:12:24,684 --> 01:12:28,100
Five? Maybe six.

378
01:12:28,938 --> 01:12:33,066
There was no trouble
with the Mexicans at first.

379
01:12:34,235 --> 01:12:38,019
Of course, in those days
it was all one country, you know?

380
01:12:38,948 --> 01:12:42,993
It was just their kind of people
and our kind of people...

381
01:12:43,953 --> 01:12:45,696
living side by side.

382
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:48,616
Ranching, farming.

383
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:55,125
Till the war came.
The war with Texas, that is.

384
01:12:56,549 --> 01:12:59,669
Then one night...

385
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:05,045
a group of nice people from the village
paid a call on us.

386
01:13:06,058 --> 01:13:10,851
Said we'd have to clear out by morning.

387
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:24,741
My pa stood up to these nice people...

388
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:27,786
and he said to them:

389
01:13:28,998 --> 01:13:32,118
"You'll have to burn me out to make me go."

390
01:13:33,336 --> 01:13:37,036
So the next day, they did just that.

391
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:40,710
They burned him out.

392
01:13:42,011 --> 01:13:43,470
Burned him...

393
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:47,682
and Ma when they wouldn't quit the house.

394
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:57,518
When it was over...

395
01:14:00,071 --> 01:14:03,522
there was this smell...

396
01:14:06,285 --> 01:14:08,527
and smoke.

397
01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:13,040
And I just walked out of there.

398
01:14:13,709 --> 01:14:15,204
Just walked...

399
01:14:16,838 --> 01:14:19,375
walked right out to the prairie...

400
01:14:19,715 --> 01:14:22,041
where another kind of Mexican...

401
01:14:22,218 --> 01:14:26,085
a bandit named Ortega found me.

402
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:31,090
Then he took care of me...

403
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:36,896
brought me up
to be just like one of his own.

404
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:46,277
Let's go.

405
01:14:47,577 --> 01:14:50,447
Jess here says
his sister's come down with the fever.

406
01:14:50,538 --> 01:14:53,455
I'm gonna stay on a piece
and talk to Joanne.

407
01:15:02,466 --> 01:15:05,420
Would you care to honour me
with your company?

408
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:11,844
Don't be too late.

409
01:15:11,934 --> 01:15:15,137
We should be back in time for supper.
Come on, boy.

410
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:32,949
Now, there's a mighty fine piece
of farmland...

411
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:35,956
just waiting for someone
to lay claim to it.

412
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,627
He's one of them. I know it. You know it.

413
01:15:49,722 --> 01:15:52,723
For you and your pa to hide him here
and try passing him off...

414
01:15:52,808 --> 01:15:56,889
You've no proof of anything,
Jess Parker. Not a damn bit of proof.

415
01:16:04,278 --> 01:16:07,896
I'll wager you and Doc
heard some sobbing tale out of him.

416
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:10,197
That's what I wager you heard.

417
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:13,824
I wager you two think
you can change him over...

418
01:16:13,913 --> 01:16:17,080
just by snapping your fingers.

419
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,538
People do change, Jess. They can.

420
01:16:19,836 --> 01:16:23,169
That's the wondrous thing about people.
They change.

421
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:33,098
Jess, what are you aiming to do?

422
01:16:33,182 --> 01:16:36,349
I haven't said a word
you can honestly pin to him.

423
01:16:36,519 --> 01:16:40,137
Please, Jess, leave him be.
I swear to you he's good.

424
01:16:40,273 --> 01:16:42,846
- I swear to you that he's...
- Changed?

425
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:47,522
I wonder about that.
I really wonder about that.

426
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:50,442
And I maybe reckon to find out if it's so.

427
01:16:52,618 --> 01:16:56,236
Jess, please, leave him be!

428
01:17:37,205 --> 01:17:39,742
You comfortable squatting like that?

429
01:17:40,124 --> 01:17:44,169
- You know how you're sitting, don't you?
- You tell me.

430
01:17:44,587 --> 01:17:48,170
That's how a greaser sits.
You're sitting like a greaser.

431
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,129
- What is it you want?
- I don't like you.

432
01:18:00,102 --> 01:18:03,934
- What's that gonna prove?
- What sort of person you really are.

433
01:18:04,315 --> 01:18:08,644
- Which is what sort of person?
- One who ain't changed.

434
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,415
Don't prod me, boy.

435
01:18:50,444 --> 01:18:54,193
Make sure she takes her quinine
and she'll be up in a day or two.

436
01:18:54,282 --> 01:18:55,942
- Jess!
- No, Pa.

437
01:19:27,356 --> 01:19:31,354
Are you gonna get yourself killed
for some crazy, damn fool notion?

438
01:19:33,696 --> 01:19:35,689
Don't forget the quinine.

439
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:11,531
It has been a long time, Azul.

440
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,807
These people saved my life.

441
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:35,849
Permit me to thank you...

442
01:21:37,445 --> 01:21:39,651
for saving the life of my son.

443
01:21:42,366 --> 01:21:45,985
It will be good to have you back with us,
Azul, as before.

444
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:54,367
Things have changed. I have.

445
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:02,676
Azul is no more.

446
01:22:20,863 --> 01:22:23,485
Then I have lost three sons here...

447
01:22:25,576 --> 01:22:26,821
not two.

448
01:22:29,664 --> 01:22:31,407
Azul was murdered...

449
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,535
as Antonio was...

450
01:22:36,212 --> 01:22:37,754
and Manuel.

451
01:22:39,382 --> 01:22:42,632
You did not save the life of Azul.

452
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,844
You took his life from him.

453
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:52,050
Why?

454
01:22:52,395 --> 01:22:54,103
Leave him alone.

455
01:22:54,188 --> 01:22:56,347
It's all right, Blue.
I can look after myself.

456
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,555
You?

457
01:22:58,442 --> 01:23:03,401
You can look only after dirt because
that is what you are, nothing else.

458
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:06,616
And that is what she is: Dirt.

459
01:23:06,909 --> 01:23:08,403
Yanqui dirt!

460
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,743
No, we do not kill him.

461
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:19,129
Not this way.

462
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:30,263
So finally it is you who defies me.

463
01:23:34,228 --> 01:23:37,644
All right, defy me then, and with the fist.

464
01:23:38,482 --> 01:23:40,226
Yours against mine.

465
01:23:43,446 --> 01:23:45,237
I don't wanna fight.

466
01:23:48,618 --> 01:23:51,191
Have they turned you into a coward...

467
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,079
as well as a traitor?

468
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:06,258
Fight me, I said.

469
01:24:09,138 --> 01:24:10,301
Fight!

470
01:25:56,078 --> 01:25:58,914
This business between us is not finished.

471
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:04,787
I will be back with all my men.

472
01:26:06,506 --> 01:26:08,747
I will avenge the murders...

473
01:26:09,383 --> 01:26:12,219
of Antonio, and Manuel...

474
01:26:13,471 --> 01:26:14,930
and Azul.

475
01:26:16,098 --> 01:26:17,925
And in their memory...

476
01:26:18,017 --> 01:26:21,386
I will put the torch
to each building and farm here.

477
01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:26,020
I will burn out the murderers of my sons!

478
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:04,303
Look, clear out.

479
01:27:05,231 --> 01:27:07,722
Clear out while there's still time.

480
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:11,486
Waiting around to be slaughtered,
it's stupid.

481
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:13,729
I don't see we have any choice but to wait.

482
01:27:13,823 --> 01:27:16,278
There's only one choice
that makes any sense...

483
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:18,858
and that's to live and go on living,
and not to die.

484
01:27:18,953 --> 01:27:23,366
I can't say I disagree with you.
But where do you want to do your living?

485
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:26,497
Don't you feel you belong here now?

486
01:27:31,174 --> 01:27:33,332
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

487
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:38,543
But I'm tired of hearing, thinking...

488
01:27:40,349 --> 01:27:43,516
worrying about where I truly belong.

489
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:47,554
Whether I'm one of you, or one of them,
or one of anybody.

490
01:27:50,026 --> 01:27:52,018
Maybe I just belong to me.

491
01:28:00,036 --> 01:28:02,075
No, Pa. Let him go.

492
01:29:30,293 --> 01:29:32,581
What do we know about fighting?

493
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:35,371
I'm a farmer and so is my son.

494
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:38,756
You're asking me what should be done?
I just don't know.

495
01:29:38,843 --> 01:29:40,123
But to my way of thinking...

496
01:29:40,219 --> 01:29:43,137
we'd all stand a better chance of it
by sticking together...

497
01:29:43,222 --> 01:29:45,511
instead of each one of us
trying to make it alone.

498
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,142
That the only choices we got, Abe?

499
01:29:47,226 --> 01:29:49,848
Why wait to see them set fire
to our crops and houses?

500
01:29:49,937 --> 01:29:53,472
I'll be damned if I leave my claim
to some greaser to burn down!

501
01:29:53,566 --> 01:29:56,235
I came out here alone,
and I fought Indians alone!

502
01:29:56,319 --> 01:29:59,485
- I'm with Jim!
- You ain't fighting a few Indians!

503
01:30:00,531 --> 01:30:03,022
Those Mexicans are like an organised army.

504
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:05,738
Some of us once fought
a real, organised Mexican army.

505
01:30:05,828 --> 01:30:08,319
- You're no match for it.
- Abe's right! Let's get out!

506
01:30:08,414 --> 01:30:11,201
- Maybe we should get out.
- If Abe goes, he goes without me!

507
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:14,328
I'll tell you one thing.
My husband never would've given up.

508
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,709
Maybe he should have.
Then he'd still be alive!

509
01:30:16,797 --> 01:30:17,996
Hold on!

510
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:24,174
Quarrelling is not gonna get us nowhere.

511
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:27,891
We need to find a way to stand up to them!

512
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:56,871
I still say we should be back home
defending our farms...

513
01:30:56,963 --> 01:30:58,872
instead of heading down to the river.

514
01:30:58,965 --> 01:31:02,797
You argued that back at the meeting,
and then we all agreed to go his way.

515
01:31:02,885 --> 01:31:06,254
Agreed, hell.
You all agreed, but I'm still asking.

516
01:31:06,347 --> 01:31:09,016
Why is he heading us down to the river?

517
01:31:16,482 --> 01:31:20,432
Did you hear him talking
as if he was the Lord Almighty himself?

518
01:31:21,863 --> 01:31:24,235
"I'll lead you if you do what I tell you to...

519
01:31:24,323 --> 01:31:27,609
"when I tell you to, and how I tell you to."

520
01:31:28,744 --> 01:31:32,493
Why are we trusting him?
He could be leading us into a trap.

521
01:31:33,165 --> 01:31:36,665
And he could have killed my boy Jess
when he had cause.

522
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:41,211
No, Alma. I say we trust him.

523
01:32:00,109 --> 01:32:01,769
Who called a halt?

524
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:03,818
I thought we could use a minute's breather.

525
01:32:03,905 --> 01:32:05,814
It wasn't called.

526
01:32:06,199 --> 01:32:09,153
- The heat.
- A breather's not gonna hurt anyone.

527
01:32:09,243 --> 01:32:13,027
You'll do your breathing
when I tell you to. Now move on.

528
01:32:13,497 --> 01:32:15,122
You, too! Move on!

529
01:32:58,876 --> 01:33:02,126
Take them wagons back to the canyon
and hide them.

530
01:33:03,756 --> 01:33:07,670
Most of you, stay here.
The others, cross over.

531
01:33:08,344 --> 01:33:11,795
Jess, take the men across.

532
01:33:12,181 --> 01:33:15,633
Start digging holes.
Dig them deep and brush them over.

533
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:20,766
All right, get those tools and follow me!

534
01:33:22,525 --> 01:33:25,645
We start doing the same on this side.
Women, too.

535
01:34:15,036 --> 01:34:16,945
BLACK POWDER

536
01:34:37,266 --> 01:34:38,511
Cover it.

537
01:34:40,102 --> 01:34:43,103
When you light them,
how quick will they fire?

538
01:35:00,122 --> 01:35:01,700
Come on, fellas.

539
01:35:15,012 --> 01:35:17,338
You're in your own line of fire.

540
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,261
Fill them in and start over. Up there.

541
01:35:20,476 --> 01:35:23,263
Hey, Jess, he says this hole ain't right.

542
01:36:31,464 --> 01:36:34,381
Jess, move your men back over the river.

543
01:36:50,858 --> 01:36:53,776
I figure if we come
through this tomorrow...

544
01:36:54,362 --> 01:36:55,986
you and him will...

545
01:36:58,533 --> 01:37:01,154
I no longer reckon what will be, Jess.

546
01:37:02,703 --> 01:37:04,495
So much has happened.

547
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:07,245
You love him a lot, don't you?

548
01:37:12,547 --> 01:37:13,922
I guess...

549
01:37:17,927 --> 01:37:19,551
Good luck, Jess.

550
01:37:27,645 --> 01:37:31,892
I want every gun cleaned and oiled
right away.

551
01:37:32,775 --> 01:37:34,234
So get to it.

552
01:38:05,975 --> 01:38:08,644
Now we've gotta be fair with him, miss.

553
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:11,353
He's gotta be hard.

554
01:38:33,878 --> 01:38:36,416
You're thinking of them, aren't you?

555
01:38:46,182 --> 01:38:50,429
Blue, I know how hard it must be
to have to kill those you once loved.

556
01:38:52,563 --> 01:38:54,355
I still love them...

557
01:38:54,982 --> 01:38:57,105
in spite of what's happened.

558
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:00,102
And what will happen tomorrow.

559
01:39:01,864 --> 01:39:04,355
But hard as it is for me...

560
01:39:05,993 --> 01:39:08,200
it's easy for me to kill also.

561
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,326
You saw these hands
the night I was choking Ortega.

562
01:39:14,877 --> 01:39:17,036
You saw how it pleasured me.

563
01:39:18,256 --> 01:39:20,960
It pleasured me. I took pleasure in it.

564
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,922
Like I always did, like I always will.

565
01:39:27,265 --> 01:39:29,471
I could never change, Joanne.

566
01:39:31,018 --> 01:39:32,762
It's not possible...

567
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:37,226
if it ever was.

568
01:39:42,572 --> 01:39:44,860
Blue, I've lost you, haven't I?

569
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:48,528
Everybody, out of sight.

570
01:42:52,678 --> 01:42:53,876
Xavier.

571
01:44:08,713 --> 01:44:09,911
Signal.

572
01:44:10,548 --> 01:44:13,418
It is too late for you
to change face, gringo.

573
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:15,881
My father will not take you back.

574
01:44:18,055 --> 01:44:19,218
Signal.

575
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:47,788
Careful. Head your horses into the current.

576
01:45:12,944 --> 01:45:14,189
Go back!

577
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:23,848
Let's go back!

578
01:46:42,867 --> 01:46:44,195
Come back!

579
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,169
Come back!

580
01:47:16,692 --> 01:47:18,068
Cowards!

581
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:44,803
Hold your fire.

582
01:48:21,465 --> 01:48:24,632
You have fought well,
as a true leader should.

583
01:48:28,347 --> 01:48:30,007
Ortega honours you.

584
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:06,424
Let me die on my side of the river...

585
01:49:08,012 --> 01:49:09,127
Azul.

586
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:54,689
The End

587
01:52:54,713 --> 01:52:55,813
†
