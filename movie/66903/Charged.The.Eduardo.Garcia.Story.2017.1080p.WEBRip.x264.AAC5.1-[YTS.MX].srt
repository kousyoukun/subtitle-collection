00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,087
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,057
[man] Filming?

5
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,458
[Jennifer] Mmhmm?

6
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,527
Good morning.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,064
I don't know if I should
wave with my right hand

8
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,433
or try and wave
with this hand.

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,104
Kinda hurts.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,111
So maybe I'll just
talk about today

11
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,479
and kind of today's
significance

12
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:49,083
but I'll introduce myself
to my camera first.

13
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,119
Eduardo Garcia, hi.

14
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:54,455
Today I'm going
into an operation

15
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,457
where I've made a decision

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,260
to take off my own limb,

17
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,796
this big ole...

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,435
left arm of mine
I've had for 30 years.

19
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:12,740
And I don't know if it's
always done great things

20
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:16,577
but it's always done
great things by me.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,680
(music playing)

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,288
* When I grow up

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,557
* I want to be a forester

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,328
* Run through the moss
on high heels

25
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:38,632
* That's what I'll do

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,868
* Throwing out a boomerang

27
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:45,806
* Waiting for it
to come back to me

28
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,885
* That's what I'll have

29
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,155
* Staring at a sea shell

30
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,527
* Waiting for it

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,230
* To catch me or hold

32
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,218
(dramatic music)

33
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:33,521
-(heavy breathing)
-(heart beating)

34
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,193
[Garcia]
I remember coming to

35
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,765
and not being able
to move my body.

36
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,571
But I remember knowing
that I had to move my body.

37
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,606
From that point,

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,444
from waking up and rolling
over onto my hands and knees,

39
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,412
there's a gap.

40
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,551
(heavy breathing)

41
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,730
My next memory is the road.

42
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:19,700
I thought I was
totally in a dream,

43
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,303
somewhere in the mountains.

44
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,474
There's no way I could
be in this sensation

45
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,776
and not be in a dream state.

46
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,248
When I put it together
that I wasn't dreaming

47
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,350
was I could hear birds.

48
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,820
(imitating chirping)

49
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,257
I could hear my boots scuffing

50
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,260
and that was real,
that was then.

51
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,331
And then it clicked.

52
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,437
I was out hunting today.

53
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,007
I came across this metal barrel

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,943
that was in the earth.

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,346
I looked in it,

56
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,250
there's this decomposing
or decaying carcass.

57
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,622
I want to check it out,
I'm curious,

58
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,924
I take my knife out.

59
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,559
(dramatic music)

60
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,528
(explosion)

61
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,031
But it hits me like
I'm being electrocuted.

62
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,970
I need to get down,
I need to get to a house,

63
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,440
I need to ask
someone to call 911.

64
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,578
(dramatic music)

65
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,400
There was no warning,

66
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,370
it was just this dead
bear in a metal can.

67
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:08,308
How was I supposed to
know it was on live power?

68
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,495
The outdoors was my first love

69
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,931
and then cooking
was my second.

70
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,434
It came from
my environment.

71
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,771
It was a place of freedom.

72
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,141
Food became this language

73
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,710
that I could speak with anyone

74
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,846
from anywhere in the world.

75
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,751
A passion that was
defining who I was in life

76
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,655
and everything was
just coming together.

77
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:59,527
Something that you've
worked your whole life for

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,432
and having it yanked out
from underneath you.

79
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:08,368
I don't know how else
to describe that.

80
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,510
My phone just started to buzz.

81
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,011
I'm with your brother,

82
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,447
he's been hurt.

83
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,483
I spoke to the surgeon

84
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,653
and he said that I should
speak to Ed on the phone

85
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,688
because it might be the last
time that I speak to him.

86
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,491
I asked him, "Is he
alive, will he live?"

87
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,660
He said, "I've seen cases

88
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,563
"where people survive
something like this."

89
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:40,167
He said, "But he would have
some significant handicaps."

90
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,503
[Daphne] There is
a lot of maladies

91
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,971
that come out of
an electrocution

92
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,607
because we just don't
know how it affects

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,677
all the other
tissues in the body.

94
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,614
And he just wrote
something like "I love you

95
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,550
and I don't want
to lose my hand."

96
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,487
(rapid breathing)

97
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,923
When Ed first arrived here,

98
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,660
he had several life-
threatening injuries.

99
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:07,695
It was his hand

100
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,129
which is the entrance wound

101
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,766
and then it was the chest
wall area, his ribs.

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,668
He had two areas on his head

103
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,904
which were exit wounds.

104
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,474
He also had a blow out
on his left thigh.

105
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,148
I remember we landed

106
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,550
and the first thing I said

107
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,984
once I woke up
when we landed was,

108
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,488
"So what time are we
going home tonight?"

109
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,856
You know what I mean,

110
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,726
like I just had no
idea how big this was.

111
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,531
[Man] Yeah, the amount of
current that went through you

112
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,565
it's amazing that--

113
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,733
[Woman] You're alive.

114
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,101
[Man] Yeah, so amazing.

115
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,571
[Eduardo] Amazing I'm alive.

116
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,508
[Man] One sec,
we'll clean it off.

117
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,276
[Eduardo] So just
when I look at it,

118
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,512
it just looks gnarly man,

119
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:02,049
black and funky and--
There's exposed tissue there

120
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,251
and there's concern that
maybe you cut the ribs,

121
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,854
maybe not very alive either.

122
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,023
[Jennifer] Baby,
look at me and smile.

123
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,024
Smile.

124
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,737
It made me really sad
to think of Ed waking up

125
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,239
without a hand and
these horrific injuries

126
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,841
in a dark room by himself

127
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,579
with just a bunch of
machines just beeping.

128
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,584
During the day is when
everything's normal

129
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,686
and as soon as
the night comes,

130
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,921
it's kind of when
crazy stuff happens,

131
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,322
nightmares or whatever

132
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,057
like obviously Ed had
a lot of nightmares

133
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,960
so I was really glad
just to be there

134
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,329
so when he did stir in
the night or whatever.

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,200
So really sleeping
there in this chair

136
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,202
was way worth it

137
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,237
and I wouldn't have left.

138
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,308
Yes, he's right here with me.

139
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,943
He's in a little bit of pain

140
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,713
but nothing crazy,
just happy.

141
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,748
That felt so good.

142
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,950
[Man] So that's
you on the CT scanner.

143
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:14,121
It seemed like they really
cared about each other.

144
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,690
I didn't actually know
that they weren't dating

145
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,891
when I first met 'em.

146
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,326
I thought they were.

147
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,165
I could've been sleeping there

148
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,934
but is that what he needed?

149
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,871
My mom could've been there
sleeping for a month.

150
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,674
Is that what he needed?

151
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,109
No, I think he needed
Jen there.

152
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,081
We have to be
supportive of one another

153
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,950
and if you're used
to being the captain

154
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,284
like I was for example,

155
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,319
you have to let go
of certain things

156
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:50,624
'cause it's really not about
you that much at that point.

157
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,134
Being alive with
a few handicaps

158
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,137
is much better
than being dead.

159
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,605
That's for sure,

160
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,141
that's for damn sure.

161
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,745
Yeah.

162
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,818
(slow music)

163
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:22,790
[Kathie] Eduardo and Eugenio
came in on August 4th, 1981,

164
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,192
seven and a half
weeks premature.

165
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,160
We called them the boys.

166
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,265
Indra was two and
a half years old.

167
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,002
We were living in Calabasas
outside of Los Angeles.

168
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,104
Then, when they were
three months old,

169
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,371
their father left

170
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,975
saying he would come back,

171
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,745
that he was gonna
return to Mexico,

172
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,214
he was gonna return to this
little island where he grew up.

173
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,884
I looked at Indra and then I
looked at Eduardo and Eugenio

174
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,955
and I knew that I had
to be there for them

175
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:59,693
and make the best of
a difficult situation.

176
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,262
She's a very spiritual
woman, my mom

177
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:07,300
and she founded a
spiritual community in LA.

178
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,271
(slow music)

179
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,180
Almost the entire
community moved to Montana,

180
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,715
I'm talking hundreds of people.

181
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,383
[Indra] There was
definitely like singing

182
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,219
about being Montana bound.

183
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,722
We welcome you to the heart

184
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,159
and we sing the
song of gratitude.

185
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,862
Here, oh universe,
I am grateful.

186
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,401
[Eduardo] I just kind of
think growing up that way

187
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,070
is a privilege.

188
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,939
There's others that
saw our community,

189
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,175
definitely thought it
was a little weird.

190
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,178
I always tell my mom
that was the best move

191
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,245
she could've ever done

192
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,381
was getting us here.

193
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,516
For me it was
almost like we moved

194
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,453
into the set of a National
Geographic magazine.

195
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:05,092
The mountains had their
own special magical allure

196
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,227
for a child's imagination.

197
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,331
We would spend our summers

198
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,766
fishing in Yellowstone,

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,234
running into the hills.

200
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,038
I definitely took
to that very quickly

201
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,873
and made it my home.

202
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,514
[Jennifer] Hello, Ed.

203
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,851
Hey.

204
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,519
No, we're filming this for

205
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,422
just documenting
my recovery for us.

206
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,456
[Woman] Cool.

207
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,191
Yeah.

208
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:42,996
[Jennifer] It's pretty
hard for a YouTube video.

209
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,300
I saw it as part of the
recovery process to film.

210
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,436
It was really
important to me

211
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,338
that he didn't come
out the other end of it

212
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,941
and be like, why did
you sign that way,

213
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,042
why did you sign this way,

214
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,910
and not really understand.

215
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,445
[Woman] So we would go in

216
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,546
and raise up all
these loose edges

217
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,014
and free them up

218
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,349
so that they can
come together

219
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,886
and allow this hair
to shift to this area.

220
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,855
Okay, and you
think my eyebrows

221
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:08,922
are gonna be all like this?

222
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,123
[Woman] I hope not.

223
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,825
[Jennifer] Also for Ed,

224
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,595
filming actually kind of
gave him something to do.

225
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,333
See you later, I'm going to
get my head wound closed up.

226
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,170
I'm just kind of coming
out of anesthesia.

227
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,305
[Jennifer] You want
to look at me, Ed?

228
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,173
Very cool.

229
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,508
Ready Jennifer?

230
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,010
[Jennifer] I'm ready.

231
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,344
When you're in the hospital,

232
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,545
every day is the same.

233
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,081
Everything's getting better

234
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,949
but it's very slowly
getting better.

235
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,886
Is it video,
filming right now?

236
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,320
[Jennifer] Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,421
You close enough?

238
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,589
-[Jennifer] Yep.
-Are you sure?

239
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,124
I think you should
be closer.

240
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,092
Want to turn the light on more?

241
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,059
[Jennifer] No, I'm good.

242
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:46,927
You're good?

243
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,161
You sure?

244
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,429
[Jennifer] It
just gave a focus

245
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,964
on something other
than just the fact

246
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,999
that we're in a
freaking hospital.

247
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,100
Yes, I got it!

248
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,970
Nailed that sucker!

249
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,073
I've been trying that
for like 10 times.

250
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,143
[Boy]
I'll help you.

251
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,377
[Boy #2] God it's cold.

252
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,246
Hurry up.

253
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,482
I didn't have a dad
growing up.

254
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,452
There was really no one
looking over us saying,

255
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,054
"Don't do that or
don't do this."

256
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,622
It was really our
world to discover

257
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,326
and make our own mistakes
and learn from them.

258
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,596
I just remember that
they were both crazy

259
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,567
and having them both
together was chaos.

260
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,336
Yeah man, what's up with you?

261
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,537
Hey, bitch, come on.

262
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,605
Yeah, you think you're bad.

263
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,442
[Kathie] They had
a lot of energy.

264
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,444
I tried the best I could

265
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,047
to keep Eddie in line.

266
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,582
[Eduardo] I guess
my educational history

267
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,985
is kicked out of nine
different schools

268
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,687
starting with preschool,
disruptive behavior.

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,324
First grade was for
filling condoms with piss

270
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,926
and throwing them
down the hallway.

271
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,395
I started a fire in
the boy's bathroom

272
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,297
so I got kicked
out of that school.

273
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,199
[Eugenio] Got into a fight,

274
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,368
we kind of both got kicked
out in that situation

275
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,005
but I think he was
leading the charge.

276
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,707
Eugene, he was 11 years old,

277
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,676
never even thought about
not having a father

278
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,111
and he goes, "I need
to meet my father."

279
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,947
And she said, "Okay."

280
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,348
And within months,

281
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,517
it was literally that fast.

282
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,320
Where's dad and then
we're in Mexico.

283
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:25,993
All I knew is he was this
incredibly dark, tanned

284
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,327
pirate looking figure

285
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,030
that fished for
sharks and lobster

286
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,533
and lived this crazy
jungle lifestyle.

287
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,635
He was like a hero.

288
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,104
It was idyllic,

289
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,139
me and my twin
brother running around

290
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,008
just having a blast.

291
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,475
Hi, mom.

292
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,310
Hi, guys.

293
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,016
(mariachi music)

294
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,058
We decided to
get together again.

295
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,631
We went through a lot of
changes, a lot of changes,

296
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,401
and then me becoming
pregnant with Ellie

297
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,071
and integrating into a family.

298
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,045
[Eduardo] The first
time my dad's actually

299
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,147
gotten to make a snowball.

300
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,115
I don't know if he
expected himself

301
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,351
to play dad all of a sudden.

302
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,586
Hey, dad, no,
don't throw it!

303
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,424
Say hi.

304
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,759
Hi.

305
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,361
And we're gonna
go say hi to Eduardo

306
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,695
who's having lunch

307
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,066
and he does not know
that dad is here.

308
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,334
(speaking in Spanish)

309
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,535
It's a surprise.

310
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,071
He doesn't know you're here.

311
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,141
No (speaking in
Spanish).

312
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:48,808
[Eugenio] Whistle, whistle.

313
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,543
(whistling)

314
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,414
(speaking in Spanish)

315
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,155
Hey, how you doing?

316
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,223
How you doing?

317
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,326
Thank you, thank you to be here.

318
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,197
(speaking in Spanish)

319
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,744
[Eduardo] For many years,
he wasn't really my dad,

320
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,446
he was a friend.

321
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,082
[Manuel] Watch it,
don't break the line.

322
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,184
Don't break the line.

323
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,120
It's a big fish, wow.

324
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,323
It's big fish.

325
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,491
Ha ha!

326
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,097
[Eduardo] At 13,
I started using drugs

327
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,700
and then I started smoking
cigarettes with my dad

328
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,236
and doing drugs with my dad

329
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,270
and drinking with my dad

330
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,205
and he becomes my best friend

331
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,807
because he's not telling me no.

332
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,377
And I was already
hanging with a crew

333
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,113
that was tripping on
acid and doing coke

334
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,748
and everything else.

335
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,284
[Kathie] When Eduardo was 17,

336
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,119
he sat at the kitchen
table and he said,

337
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,722
"I realize that my habits
were hurting my family."

338
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,192
[Eduardo] So I'm tired of
living in the shadows of lies

339
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,628
and I just want to
level the field here

340
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,398
and me, Euge, Indra, dad,

341
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,668
we've been using drugs for
years behind your back, mom.

342
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,403
I mean, I was livid.

343
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,473
And I think for Eduardo

344
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,875
going straight was essential.

345
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,513
[Eduardo] I decided if I
want to make an impact in life,

346
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,415
I needed to get to business,

347
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,849
I need to get to work,

348
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,353
I need to be
purposeful in my life.

349
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:44,824
I had already been cooking in
restaurants since I was 15.

350
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,926
And then I decided
culinary school

351
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,629
was going to be where
I put all my energy

352
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,731
and through that,

353
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:56,369
I wanted to discover
my potential

354
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,206
on my own without substances.

355
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,940
[Announcer] Eduardo Garcia.

356
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,211
(audience applause)

357
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,385
[Eduardo] Danielle, you
want to see something cool?

358
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,720
Come here.

359
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,587
[Jennifer] Yeah,
this is pretty cool.

360
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:15,955
So, this is lefty,

361
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,823
you now lefty, Danielle?

362
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,325
[Danielle] Yeah.

363
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,959
I can feel all my
fingers still over there

364
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,328
even though they're not there.

365
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,230
That's my thumb moving,

366
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,199
this is my pinky moving.

367
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,404
Maybe I'll be able to
get a prosthetic limb

368
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:35,308
that has like some
kind of sensors.

369
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,610
I don't want the ones that are
supposed to look like hands.

370
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:41,848
I want like cool, custom made
like hardwood cherry hands

371
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,951
or oak or like titanium, I
don't know, something cool.

372
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,386
[Woman] Antler.

373
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,588
Fucking yeah,
antler, like bone,

374
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,325
kinda cool.

375
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,493
[Woman] That's awesome.

376
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,362
That is awesome.

377
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,430
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

378
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,666
Only time I was worried for him

379
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,469
was when he had
his chest operation

380
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:06,439
because they'd never done
anything like it before.

381
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,875
With the rib, you
can't just cut it off

382
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,311
and leave a hole in the chest.

383
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,645
What we have to do

384
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,814
is try to find ways
to cover that up.

385
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,749
[Jennifer] So we had
like the burn team,

386
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,750
the plastic surgeon team,

387
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,552
the cardiothoracic team,

388
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,987
everybody around the bed

389
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,290
just kind of
brainstorming essentially

390
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,991
what muscle they
could take from where.

391
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,659
[Doctor] Everything
that's dead.

392
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,296
-Gotta go.
-[Doctor] Gotta go, yeah.

393
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,832
That may leave you with a
hole on your chest this big.

394
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,601
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,669
[Doctor] Like kind of
stick my head in it kind of.

396
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,438
Yes, sir.

397
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,974
The likelihood of you
doing pull ups again is zero.

398
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,310
Pull ups again

399
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,677
-in a year?
-Ever, ever.

400
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,279
You're gonna have,

401
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,948
your lat's gonna be
turned around to here.

402
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,751
(knives scraping)

403
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:59,326
[Eduardo] I just wrapped
up a very successful year

404
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,460
as a yacht chef,

405
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,994
11 years of hard work.

406
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,999
My way of cooking as a
professional yacht chef

407
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,368
really became: get there,

408
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,069
figure out what's in the market,

409
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,604
what's local, what's in season

410
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,375
and then figure out
how to put it together.

411
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,379
Definitely developing as a chef.

412
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,517
You're going around the world.

413
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,753
There were all
kinds of adventures.

414
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,556
It kickstarted a time of life

415
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,524
where I was accountable
to myself only

416
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:34,594
and myself was interested in
letting loose a little bit.

417
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,064
So that is what
brought me into hey,

418
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,367
been six, seven years
since I've had a beer,

419
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,504
hmm, there's a drink being
passed around, yeah, why not?

420
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,608
I remember sitting on the
couch at the crew house

421
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,642
when Jen walked in

422
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:52,011
and where we connected

423
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,014
was she was game to have fun.

424
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,051
I wanted to go surf five
a.m. and be at work by eight.

425
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,554
Hand went up,
she's like, "I'm in."

426
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,656
[Jennifer] Most people just
wanted to go to the bars.

427
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,025
He was the only
person on the yacht

428
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,427
that liked to surf
and run and skateboard

429
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,962
and all the things I like to do.

430
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,864
And we started hanging out more.

431
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,901
And then we started dating.

432
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,604
[Eduardo] She was
keen to dance, to play,

433
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,439
to express, to live.

434
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,542
(laughing)

435
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,083
[Man] Ed's walking.

436
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,986
[Eduardo] I think I
felt a responsibility

437
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,755
to be tougher than
I should have been

438
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,090
because of how hard everyone
was working around me.

439
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,992
[Woman] Okay ready?
Turn around.

440
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,093
[Eduardo] There's gonna
be someone else out there

441
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,629
that has it worse than you do.

442
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,498
Just be grateful for
what you do have.

443
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,999
[Woman] Everything feel okay?

444
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,502
Yeah, I wish I could
use this sucker.

445
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,503
You can yeah.

446
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,472
Pretend.

447
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,906
Yeah.

448
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,775
[Eduardo] Gotta pretend
he's doing something.

449
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,678
That sucker has no
free rides, man.

450
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:02,715
Thanks.

451
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:03,783
[Nurse] You done?

452
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,017
No, I'm not done.

453
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,619
I'm just saying thanks.

454
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,521
I appreciate it.

455
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,022
[Nurse] No problem.

456
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,159
This is my new
typing attachment.

457
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,927
Gonna help me just
do some simple typing

458
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:18,498
until I get my prosthetic
in, kinda cool.

459
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,169
I never felt a fear for my life.

460
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:27,106
I felt anxiety about
everyday matters of life,

461
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,708
how I'd get back to life.

462
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,477
This is awesome.

463
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,544
That's great.

464
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,116
I think hiking is gonna be

465
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,453
some of the best
therapy I'll ever do.

466
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,056
(exhales)

467
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,768
You know, how am I
going to be me again?

468
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,587
Not to be funny but
this is my first stab

469
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,222
at working with a prosthetic

470
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,625
or any attachment on lefty.

471
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,200
Works.

472
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:31,070
And Jen invented,
show the camera, Jen .

473
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,039
Basically it's
this two foot fork

474
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,808
and one end's for scratching,
one end's for eating,

475
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:37,677
do not confuse the two.

476
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,614
Thank you.
Well done you.

477
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,685
I know it's kind
of weird for you.

478
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:50,122
Not just kind of weird,
very, very messed up

479
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:54,627
but well done you for hanging
in there 37 days with me

480
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:58,631
and not abandoning me
for some other whatever.

481
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:11,277
I wonder if I can just launch
this carrot at my face.

482
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:14,847
Oh, yeah.

483
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,718
[Jennifer] We had this
amazing relationship

484
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,052
but I had two minds,

485
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,688
part of me was telling me

486
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,556
that Eduardo was the
most amazing guy ever

487
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,792
and then the other part of
my brain was just telling me

488
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:29,028
that something was going on,
he was disingenuous.

489
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,163
He just said that
I was paranoid,

490
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,832
that I should shut up,

491
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,702
that all of his friends
thought I was a mean person

492
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,770
for even suggesting
such a thing.

493
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,039
[Eduardo] And I didn't
make the connection

494
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,575
that me cheating on
her would somehow

495
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,912
subconsciously speak to her.

496
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,147
And I don't remember
how I said it,

497
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,652
I remember sitting on the
port side of the yacht

498
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,153
and just spitting it out

499
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,757
like there was this time,
there was that time,

500
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,125
there was this time,
there was that time.

501
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,628
And then I was just
destroyed, I think,

502
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:04,631
because it wasn't this
kind of like one off thing

503
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:08,901
it was actually kind of
two years of complete lies.

504
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,870
He's been cheating
on me basically

505
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,905
for most of our relationship,

506
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,106
that just hurt.

507
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:20,012
[Eduardo] It was a recurrence
of that same time when I was 17

508
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:24,083
like shit, how have my
actions become actions

509
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,053
that are hurting people,

510
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,622
not who I want to be in life.

511
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:33,392
It was time to clean up my act.

512
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,195
I came home for seven months,

513
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:40,700
no drugs, no alcohol, just a
lot of time in the outdoors,

514
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,702
a lot of time working.

515
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,738
I was so depressed,

516
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,206
so physically ill.

517
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,912
I had this cabin in Montana
that was really rough

518
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,947
and I remember fixing
up the interior

519
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:57,950
with a goal that maybe
Jen'll come back to Montana,

520
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,652
no expectations,

521
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:02,789
I don't need you to get
back together with me.

522
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:03,790
[Jennifer] Despite everything,

523
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,991
you love who you love

524
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,226
and I wanted
to be there for him

525
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,196
and help him get
through everything.

526
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,204
[Eduardo] It
was the first time

527
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:21,173
her and I had been in the
same space clean and clear.

528
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,779
[Jennifer] He was
definitely trying to show me

529
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:30,016
that he was somebody that
now did actually care.

530
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,685
So when I have my
ridiculous photo ideas

531
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,020
he was up for that.

532
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,259
[Eduardo] When we start
talking about something

533
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,095
and we're both into it,
it's unstoppable

534
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,898
the amount of ideas
that come out.

535
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,204
I left my full time career as
a yacht chef after a decade

536
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:56,408
and I was ready for
a career change.

537
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,779
Together with Jen,
my brother, my sister,

538
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:05,251
we started a food company
called Montana Mex.

539
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,352
[Jennifer] And on top of that,

540
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,954
we started planning

541
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,489
for Eduardo to have a
outdoor cooking show.

542
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,291
Rolling.

543
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,994
[Jennifer] We're just
on a rampage of creativity

544
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,896
and it was super fun.

545
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,867
[Eduardo] That's when
I got to know Jen ,

546
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,034
like the business part of Jen ,

547
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,803
the intellectual part of Jen ,

548
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:24,837
the creative part of Jen ,

549
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,006
the challenging parts of Jen.

550
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,041
Look how big our ducks are.

551
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:34,847
That was the beginning of
our friendship for sure.

552
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,318
And I put this on it

553
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:46,926
because otherwise
when I'm in bed

554
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,961
it will just keep me up.

555
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,997
You've been doing it
that same way every night?

556
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,964
Yeah.

557
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,332
Really?

558
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,868
Yeah.
I don't know, I don't feel

559
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:56,969
like I need to sleep in
a real bed at all really,

560
00:28:57,003 --> 00:28:57,970
it's fine.

561
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,774
It was a very bizarre situation

562
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,509
'cause you're trying
to care for somebody

563
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,311
who is going through
the pit of hell

564
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,345
but at the same time,

565
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:07,947
I also had all these things

566
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,349
from obviously the relationship

567
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,952
that Ed and I had previously.

568
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,021
Did you make it?

569
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,022
No, it was so close.

570
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,024
It landed right side up.

571
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,525
Try it again, try it again.

572
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,794
Ugh, that's even worse.

573
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,565
Obviously annoys me at times
but I love him,

574
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,968
I've loved him a long time.

575
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,005
I will always love him.

576
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,414
[Man] Please breathe
in and hold your breath.

577
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,122
Start breathing again.

578
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:53,092
[Amalia Cochran] The testicle
that had been damaged

579
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,995
from the electrical
injury was not viable

580
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,130
and there was no way for
us to help it survive.

581
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:01,100
So that's discussion number
one that we're having

582
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,303
with a young healthy guy
and his family

583
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,340
about it is our recommendation
that we do this.

584
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,475
[Jennifer] For
whatever reason,

585
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,043
he chose me to be the signer.

586
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:12,879
Especially because of
the cheating thing,

587
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,380
it's like almost hilarious

588
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,016
this sense that the ex
girlfriend that was cheated on

589
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,985
got to sign away his testicle.

590
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,253
[Doctor] Your charts look good,
your blood looks good,

591
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,890
you kind of went through
the basic and then

592
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,058
but we got some bad news.

593
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,127
The pathology report pops up

594
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,031
and low and behold there's
a testicular cancer.

595
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,002
[Eduardo] Are you kidding me?

596
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:40,039
My focus right now is figuring
out how to be an amputee,

597
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,274
other surgeries
that are ongoing,

598
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,544
picking myself up out of
the ground for the most part

599
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:50,016
and on top of that you're
asking me to deal with cancer?

600
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,117
[Jennifer] And that's
when they realized

601
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,618
it was second stage

602
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,955
because he had a tumor
halfway up his spine as well.

603
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:59,225
[Eduardo] Any chance to
see that tumor clot on my?

604
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:00,292
[Man] Yeah.

605
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,561
That's big, man.

606
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,230
[Jennifer] Basically

607
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,065
they couldn't do all the
reconstructive surgeries

608
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,535
because he needed to get
not chemotherapy immediately

609
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,103
before it went to his brain.

610
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,505
So...

611
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,075
I forgot one.

612
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:19,178
It just became my
norm being in ICU,

613
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,047
you know what I mean?

614
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,314
It became my norm.

615
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,085
[Jennifer] How do you feel?

616
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,586
Mechanical.

617
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,055
[Jennifer] But in a cool way?

618
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,589
Yeah, I think so.

619
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,525
I think I was actually terrified

620
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,327
to leave the hospital.

621
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:41,367
The doctors in the burn unit

622
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,006
decided I was healthy
enough to go home

623
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,008
or leave the hospital today.

624
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,511
So we packed up our stuff

625
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,183
and put it in the truck.

626
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,186
Pretty amazing that
we're out of here,

627
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,191
pretty fucking
glad I didn't die.

628
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:13,099
I don't have my left hand.

629
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,406
But otherwise we're
in really great shape,

630
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,242
really great shape.

631
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,150
I think I got over there

632
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,352
two or three days
after he was discharged

633
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:37,256
and I worried about them both.

634
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,757
Although they were
pulling together,

635
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,327
there was an atmosphere

636
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,996
because they were
both so exhausted,

637
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,264
both so exhausted.

638
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,734
(laughing)

639
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,308
We didn't know what
to do for Christmas

640
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:59,578
and I think I'll
never, ever forget

641
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,649
the fact that we decided to
go to Arches National Park

642
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,555
and it was just unbelievable

643
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,756
when I could see Ed's face

644
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,459
thinking that even he had said

645
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:16,228
he never thought
that would happen.

646
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:17,763
(laughing)

647
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,498
[Eduardo] What's
happening now?

648
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:22,201
Let's check it out,
let's check it out.

649
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,437
Just stay shoulders right
over your feet, okay?

650
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,573
Yeah, you're good,
it's no problem.

651
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,608
Look at Jen and your feet.

652
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,512
[Corinne] Then they got
me across this high thing

653
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,715
that was so steep I didn't
think I'd get across

654
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,217
but he said,
"No, you're scared,

655
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,119
"we'll get you across this."

656
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,387
[Eduardo] Take it like that,

657
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,189
two, three steps
at a time, pause,

658
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,324
two, three, don't think
of it as a big wall,

659
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,359
okay, very good, very good.

660
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:49,828
You did great.

661
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,232
That was, this is
just fear, isn't it?

662
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,336
He'd survived,

663
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,837
nothing else, the fact
that he'd survived through

664
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,439
in a wonderful place.

665
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,776
[Eduardo] She's insane, huh?

666
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,348
Ed was, even at
that very short space

667
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,650
that he'd been out
of hospital,

668
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,219
no one would guess that
he was going through

669
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,620
what he was going through.

670
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:23,262
[Eduardo] I don't remember
the day I arrived home.

671
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,564
It must have been
momentous in that sense

672
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,267
but I don't remember
walking in

673
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,601
to my house
for the first time

674
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,337
and opening the door.

675
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,841
What I remember was
wanting to hide,

676
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,278
I don't even know why.

677
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,547
Locally I live in
a small community.

678
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,616
They knew I had
been electrocuted.

679
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,119
You couldn't hide that
I was missing a hand

680
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,154
but you know what,

681
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,155
I could hide the fact

682
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,590
that I was going through cancer.

683
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:57,763
Today is February the seventh

684
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,567
and it's official,
my hair is falling out.

685
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,501
Bucket.

686
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,739
You see that?

687
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:13,379
Bink, how disgusting.

688
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:18,150
Bink, bink, oh my.

689
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:20,152
Jen, do you want to try this?

690
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:20,852
You might enjoy it.

691
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,321
[Jennifer] I will.

692
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,589
Holy, look at that.

693
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,658
[Jennifer] I can
make a bald patch.

694
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:30,362
Hey, baby, do it
systematically.

695
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:31,797
[Jennifer] I'm
turning you into my dad.

696
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,232
Look at you.

697
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,867
[Jennifer] This
is just like my dad.

698
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,336
Does it not hurt at all?

699
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,471
This is excellent fun.

700
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:42,741
No, if it hurt,
I would ask you to stop.

701
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,177
It hurts a little.

702
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,380
Grab a clump and
just go for it but.

703
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:49,281
Pink.

704
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,619
It's literally
like having a cat.

705
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,222
You've always wanted a cat.

706
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,526
(slow music)

707
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,430
(laughing)

708
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,902
(dramatic music)

709
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,744
[Jennifer] How are you doing?

710
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,612
I'm hanging in there.

711
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,451
It's been a long week.

712
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,722
Pretty nauseous almost
every day this week

713
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,226
but we're hanging in there.

714
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,328
I'm getting my pick
line taken out today

715
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,496
so it'll be nice.

716
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,470
[Jennifer] Happy?

717
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,738
Yeah, thanks.

718
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,776
[Nurse] You're welcome.

719
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,547
Back on Monday,
Monday at noon.

720
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,354
[Jennifer] When he was
going through everything

721
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,324
the priority was get
him rehabilitated

722
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,359
and get him back to life.

723
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,462
But further down the list

724
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:13,565
is what is the deal with
our relationship as a whole?

725
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,035
How are we gonna get
out of this as friends?

726
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,838
What's gonna happen
in the future?

727
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,388
(hens crowing)

728
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,658
The doubt didn't start

729
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:43,495
until I tried actually
getting back to life again.

730
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:50,369
All of a sudden overnight
at 30 years old,

731
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,905
I had to rethink how to do
every single task.

732
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:01,547
Ashes is one of my favorite
place to hike anywhere.

733
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:09,821
You now had my mom, Jen , my
sister, my brother, my dad,

734
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,760
take a bear spray,
don't hike alone.

735
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,496
Really concerned
about my ability

736
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:22,834
to be the guy I was
a few months before.

737
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,775
[Jennifer] Ed losing his hand

738
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,677
is really something
that everybody sees

739
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,779
but not many people know

740
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,448
that he also lost so
much of his muscle mass

741
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,617
from his torso, from
his legs, from his arms.

742
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,118
The fact is that he operates

743
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,422
with way less muscle
than most of us do.

744
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,595
[Eduardo] It's such a
horrible thing, you know,

745
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,363
to have someone care for you

746
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,566
and for you to
think, "Hey back off,

747
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,870
I need a moment to see
if I can do this again.

748
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,707
Give me a second
to fail on my own."

749
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,623
[Jennifer] I think what a
lot of people see with recovery

750
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:22,160
is this grand coming
out of oh I'm recovered

751
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,963
and actually it isn't that.

752
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,165
It's this kind of
never-ending process

753
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,601
of a million little
achievements.

754
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,471
Undoing these knots

755
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,774
is definitely proving to
be a little more difficult

756
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,410
but I don't think undoing knots

757
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:41,413
is ever easy for anybody.

758
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:42,548
There it goes.

759
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,085
That's a deer.

760
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,496
I love to hike for elk antlers

761
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,698
and my goal was I want
to be able to hike

762
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,067
a solid eight miles
into the back country

763
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,102
and feel strong about it.

764
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:11,610
Being outdoors was
my recovery, 110%

765
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,712
and that was where I,

766
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,647
it was my way
of rehabilitating.

767
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,483
That's a heavy pack.

768
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,933
I would get home at 5 p.m.

769
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,469
and there'd be a race.

770
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:40,906
If I couldn't get a meal
under my belt by six,

771
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,743
I would be too sick
to cook a meal,

772
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,678
I would lose all interest.

773
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:49,815
I guess as a bonus,

774
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,617
I don't have to worry

775
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,519
about cutting the fingers

776
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,187
off of my left hand
anymore when I'm chopping.

777
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,824
I'd be pretty crushed if
I couldn't cook anymore,

778
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,091
be pretty crushed.

779
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,798
It was only until
I actually started

780
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,501
getting back into
trying to cook again

781
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:11,102
that it all started to click.

782
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,971
I'm like, "Wait a minute,

783
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,206
my career is built off of
the ability to work quickly,

784
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,075
efficiently with my hands.

785
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:21,580
Fuck, I got one
hand and a forearm."

786
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,588
That's hot.

787
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,704
We knew that my
chemotherapy treatments

788
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,138
would be a three-month ordeal

789
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,807
and we just had to survive that

790
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,712
and the day it ended my
focus immediately shifted

791
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,147
to, "Okay, let's get back
to recovery.

792
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,649
We've got a long
list of things

793
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,851
that still need
to be healed."

794
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,832
[Jennifer] Do you want
to describe what was here

795
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,834
when you were electrocuted?

796
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:24,109
Not a big box with
working locks on it.

797
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:31,783
I'd have probably stumbled
straight down here.

798
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,218
Let's see if it goes
to a road.

799
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,053
[Jennifer] Yeah,
you want to follow it?

800
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,088
-Yeah.
-[Jennifer] Okay.

801
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:39,591
I don't know if I saw
some of these trees.

802
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,662
Incredible, I can't remember.

803
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:53,304
I didn't like being up there
standing next to that box.

804
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:54,272
It was hard.

805
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:01,780
Trying not to feel anger
through this whole event

806
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,249
and then you go back to the
site where you nearly died

807
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,884
and you're looking at it

808
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,987
and it's...

809
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,958
locked up,
posted, sealed,

810
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:17,128
huge padlocks,
shut down, safe.

811
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,396
That's how it should've been

812
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,799
when I was up here hiking.

813
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,634
That's how it should've been.

814
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,770
It angered me to see that.

815
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,178
One tiny event can
rock you so hard.

816
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,353
I didn't feel a need to
stay there for too long,

817
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,388
it turned me.

818
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,246
Hello.

819
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:15,854
(speaking in Spanish)

820
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,024
Dad, you're here
early though, man.

821
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:19,958
[Manuel] Huh?

822
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,794
(speaking in Spanish)

823
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,763
I was totally joking with dad

824
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:27,032
but I guess he's here to work.

825
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,701
That's harder.

826
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:39,377
Isn't that weird?

827
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,880
You see the circulation
missing in that finger?

828
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,716
It just gets,
they get cold.

829
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,719
I think there's nerve
damage or something.

830
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:48,920
The scar's healing nicely.

831
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:50,288
Yeah.

832
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,023
I'm glad it's
got nice and flat.

833
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:52,891
Try to open it up a little bit.

834
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:53,925
That's better,

835
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:54,893
you got some blood to it now.

836
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:55,794
Good job, Indra.

837
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,195
Yeah.

838
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,463
[Jennifer] When we
were in the hospital,

839
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,165
Indra and I,

840
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,467
we'd like shamelessly get
out all of our paperwork

841
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,003
and we'd be running our company.

842
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,505
Let's make sure
that our company

843
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,975
doesn't go completely under.

844
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,409
We've got stuff to do,

845
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,278
we've got stuff that
needs to happen,

846
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:17,415
we have things that need to
not be lost because of this.

847
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:29,327
[Eduardo] That will come off.

848
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,730
[Man] There you go.

849
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,270
[Eduardo] That's pretty cool.

850
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:40,171
[Man] So how you
gonna trigger it?

851
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:41,472
Just bring it up.

852
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:43,241
Oh, just click
it on your cheek.

853
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:44,309
Oh, there you go.

854
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,343
Yeah.

855
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,778
Alright.

856
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:49,080
There was one
online for 1,100 bucks

857
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,049
and I figured
we could make one

858
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,485
so it's like I'm $33
into it right now.

859
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,857
And exactly,
and Montana style.

860
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:35,060
I mean, I think we could tweak
it maybe a little more but,

861
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:39,297
You got this?

862
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,215
Jesus.

863
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:09,895
Alright, step one.

864
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,063
[Eduardo] I like it.

865
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:14,632
Super lightweight, super
strong, it's cleanable.

866
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,134
It's just a--

867
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,368
You guys are doing
this right here?

868
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:18,236
This is what we're
about to build?

869
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,104
Yeah.

870
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,471
That's so neat.

871
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,109
What's going on?

872
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,621
(whirring)

873
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:39,124
(hammering)

874
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,494
It's pretty just phenomenal

875
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,663
to be able to sit in
this shop all day long,

876
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:50,001
make these little changes
almost immediately,

877
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,170
go back and forth,
go back and forth

878
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,973
without having to ship a
product back to the maker

879
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:56,241
and then get it a week later,

880
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:58,143
that kind of a process.

881
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:00,378
That was quick.

882
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,657
I'm ready to take it off.

883
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,292
Yeah, let's do this.

884
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:19,164
That's it, destruction,
it did well, that thing,

885
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:22,500
that thing's done well.

886
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,638
It's pretty cool.

887
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,309
I think I'm gonna have a
hard time beating this up.

888
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,044
It'll be like a new surf board.

889
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:34,679
Once you get the first
ding the it'll be alright

890
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:39,017
but until then, polish it off
at the end of every night.

891
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,288
Crank down.

892
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,355
Crank it down so
you can really just--

893
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,457
Do a pull up.

894
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,627
Yeah, and that's kind of
when it's gonna be necessary.

895
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:06,277
[Woman] Nice, wow, fantastic.

896
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:08,679
Good work.

897
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,083
That's a start.

898
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:16,354
The guy before the injury,

899
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,656
very confident about
where I was in life

900
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:24,195
to overnight being a guy
with one hand instead of two,

901
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:25,463
holes in my ribcage,

902
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:27,732
cancer also on top of that.

903
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,368
A year worth of
surgeries in front of me,

904
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:34,305
no idea what my long term
capacities were gonna be,

905
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:39,244
and no idea if I
could even go back

906
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:43,381
to the career that I'd
worked since I was 15 on.

907
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,449
There you go.

908
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,718
See if you come over here, Sam,

909
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:52,057
see it's almost like the
snow kept it from freezing

910
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,491
on top of something.

911
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,799
Except for the one thing,

912
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,668
never doubting
that I would live.

913
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,304
The second my eyes opened
on that forest floor

914
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,572
and I had a heartbeat,

915
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,440
I'm gonna get myself
out of here

916
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:13,578
and I'm gonna get myself
back to that, back to life.

917
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:39,470
[Jennifer] How
you doing today, Ed?

918
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:40,738
I'm good.

919
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,173
I'm about to fly
out to New Mexico

920
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,441
for this catering gig

921
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,343
so getting my knives sharpened,

922
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,147
feeling a little time
crunched right now.

923
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,282
I was just looking around

924
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:53,284
and it's pretty awesome place
to be sharpening your knives,

925
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:55,420
out in your front yard.

926
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:56,254
I like it.

927
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:04,295
So marinade for the?

928
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:07,332
Yeah, dry, dry rub.

929
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:11,502
Ranga and I are doing
a little at home testing

930
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,139
for this catering gig.

931
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,840
It's quite a big function.

932
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:19,377
It's over the course
of a week, 150 people.

933
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,447
Working with guests

934
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,383
and what are people gonna
think about the crazy hand

935
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,386
and I like the way
this one looks.

936
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,290
I feel more confident
with it, that's for sure.

937
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,342
I haven't put one of
these on in almost a year.

938
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:54,445
That's the longest
time I've ever gone

939
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:58,316
without putting one of
these on since I was 15.

940
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,719
(upbeat music)

941
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,289
Firing it up.

942
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,798
Ranga, these
hors d'oeuvres can go.

943
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,367
Guys how far are you

944
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,203
on having a single platter done?

945
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:20,338
Guess.
Two minutes?

946
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,440
-Uh, three.
-Let's go.

947
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,775
(upbeat music)

948
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,514
Summer squash salad,
thank you.

949
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:32,517
Put that with the vinaigrette,

950
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,620
feel free to splash some
shrimp, send it out.

951
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,787
Thank you.

952
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,523
Hold up, they're calling me.

953
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,925
It's Jen , I'm a little busy.

954
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,398
That's perfect, get it in.

955
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,305
Awesome.

956
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:57,542
Ah.

957
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,612
Nice work, Jeff.

958
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:04,315
[Jeff] You're
working too hard.

959
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,255
It's August 4th,
it's my birthday,

960
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:11,422
I turn 31 today.

961
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,591
I didn't die this last fall.

962
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,994
I've been thinking about
that yesterday and today.

963
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,696
I could not be here.

964
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,865
It could've been game
over but it wasn't.

965
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:24,902
* Happy birthday to you

966
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:28,706
* Happy birthday dear Eduardo

967
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,345
* Happy birthday to you

968
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,581
(clapping)

969
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:40,885
Thanks, guys.

970
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,357
(yelling)

971
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:48,526
Thank you.

972
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,532
[Woman] Have you had
any surgeries or anything

973
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:55,633
since we last saw you?

974
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:56,501
No.

975
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,802
[Woman] Okay.

976
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:04,375
[Eduardo] I have a
check up every six months.

977
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:08,613
I don't know if I'm gonna
get good or bad news.

978
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,317
[Woman] Take a deep
breath in and hold it.

979
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:16,754
I'm happy to say that
today I'm cancer free,

980
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,656
I'm a survivor

981
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:23,628
and I don't know what is gonna
happen six months from now

982
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,696
and that's always
on my mind a little

983
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,334
but I'm not gonna let
that take control of me.

984
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:34,772
Haven't used you since
Costa Rica, have we?

985
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,674
You're gonna be a mess.

986
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,545
University of Utah Burn
Center, Eduardo Garcia,

987
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,813
"Bethany Hamilton
surfboard handle kit.

988
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,549
"The kit and this handle

989
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:45,750
"has enabled her to control
her board underwater

990
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:48,619
"with only hand
while duck diving."

991
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:55,660
I'm not gonna think for
the people around me.

992
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:57,828
I'm not gonna wonder if
they think I look weird

993
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:01,532
or "Oh my God, that guy's got
a fucking hole in his head."

994
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:05,069
It's like an experience
like this teaches you

995
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,607
to be incredibly happy
with who you are,

996
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,643
no matter what
you're going through.

997
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,612
And for that,
I'm grateful.

998
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,081
(happy music)

999
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,922
I want to jump right into it
and them I'm hurting myself.

1000
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,657
I think if I hurt myself,

1001
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,627
there'd be a lot of people
pretty angry at me.

1002
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,896
(upbeat music)

1003
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:41,606
Well, hopefully we'll do
it again, that's for sure.

1004
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:52,983
Half experimental, half
"How do I do this safely?"

1005
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:05,963
There's a bull right down here

1006
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,865
probably in this pocket.

1007
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:10,601
(upbeat music)

1008
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,909
There's two bulls
sparring over there.

1009
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,747
(bulls yelping)

1010
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,581
Love that.

1011
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,618
(upbeat music)

1012
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:16,734
[Katie Couric] Eduardo Garcia
was leading a life

1013
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,503
most people only dream of

1014
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,004
but when he returned
home to Montana,

1015
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:22,473
his life changed forever.

1016
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:26,143
Please welcome the man
known as the bionic chef,

1017
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:27,478
Eduardo Garcia.

1018
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:30,447
(audience applause)

1019
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:34,018
Please welcome
chef Eduardo Garcia.

1020
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,987
Our chef Eduardo Garcia, thank
you so much for joining us.

1021
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:38,856
(speaking in Spanish)

1022
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,257
(audience applause)

1023
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,259
Wow, you're so handsome.

1024
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,794
Oh, Katie.

1025
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:47,632
How do you, tell us,
does this allow you to,

1026
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,634
obviously it allows you to
do everything you need to do?

1027
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:53,037
I mean I got a walnut
crusher down here.

1028
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,806
Did it come like that,
that walnut crusher?

1029
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,274
Did that come like that?
Custom.

1030
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,943
[Man] Custom crusher.

1031
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,178
And if you have to like
grab an apple or something,

1032
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,246
you just go phew?

1033
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:03,681
Whacha!

1034
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,249
That's so funny.

1035
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,184
So you've traveled a
lot around the world.

1036
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,286
What would you say was the most
beautiful place you'd been?

1037
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,955
Montana.

1038
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,723
Montana, well that's
where you live now?

1039
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:14,859
That's why I live there.

1040
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,971
Getting there.

1041
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:29,974
We are getting there.

1042
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,814
[Jennifer] Hello.

1043
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:40,785
-(chicken clucking)
-(rooster crowing)

1044
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,888
Although Eduardo and I

1045
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,190
aren't in a romantic
relationship anymore,

1046
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:50,928
we have one of the strongest
relationships I've known.

1047
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,262
Beyond there's Bing.

1048
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,899
What are you doing
in there Bing?

1049
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,570
[Jennifer] I feel right now

1050
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:01,839
that Ed and I are best friends

1051
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:05,109
and that's kind of the
way it should be, I think,

1052
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:08,078
for us both to be
who we want to be.

1053
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,919
In the moment sitting
there in the hospital,

1054
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,854
I didn't realize
how severe it was

1055
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,322
and I obviously
didn't realize

1056
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:23,060
how impactful it was
on you or my family

1057
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:26,897
or even myself until now
three and a half years later

1058
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,166
and you and I are
trying to get on

1059
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,301
with our businesses
and our projects,

1060
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,103
trying to get on
with our friendship,

1061
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:34,672
with our relationship,

1062
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:39,176
and realizing how
much personal growth,

1063
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,880
how much pain,
how much struggle,

1064
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,015
everybody experienced and
how much was put on hold

1065
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,951
just so that
the focus could be

1066
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,352
on Ed getting
through recovery,

1067
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,020
Ed getting through surgery.

1068
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,889
It takes people like
years and years and years

1069
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,091
to like get out
of where they are.

1070
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,726
Then suddenly you're on TV

1071
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,261
just like oh yeah,
I happen to have this hook,

1072
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:58,863
it's no big deal

1073
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:01,666
and nobody sees that
coming back home.

1074
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:04,401
Sometimes I'm not in the mood.

1075
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,771
I actually don't want
to deal with this.

1076
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:09,907
I don't want to have
to explain...

1077
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,676
any of it.

1078
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:38,035
[Eduardo] I think I
knew the pain that I felt

1079
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:39,937
not having a dad

1080
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,839
has stuck with me
my whole life.

1081
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,910
You know, like I made
peace with my dad

1082
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:49,680
and I have the opportunity
of a lifetime right now.

1083
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:51,916
I get to see his mistakes

1084
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,885
and I get to apply
those to my life.

1085
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:05,295
If you had to say
who you were,

1086
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,365
how do you describe
Manuel at 19?

1087
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:12,236
(speaking in Spanish)

1088
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:39,029
Where were you in your
level of skill as a fisherman?

1089
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:50,140
Not Mexico,

1090
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,442
round trip ticket anywhere
in the world right now.

1091
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:53,510
Cancun.

1092
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,212
No, besides Cancun.

1093
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,281
Nowhere in Mexico,
where would you go?

1094
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,115
Nowhere.

1095
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:02,820
Right here.

1096
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,898
-Empanadas?
-Empanadas.

1097
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:28,145
Do you have any regrets,

1098
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,514
things you would do different?

1099
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,557
[Kathie] How is the
person that you are today

1100
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:17,361
different than the person
that you were before?

1101
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,180
We made it.

1102
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,349
That was good, dad.

1103
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:05,175
It's strange being like
early 30s, no kids,

1104
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:09,279
to think having a pet

1105
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,648
is the first,
it's like a starter kit,

1106
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,217
it's that first step

1107
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,885
to having some type
of responsibility

1108
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:16,253
or some type of thing

1109
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:19,623
that depends on you
at least a little bit.

1110
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:22,259
I think it was the best thing
Jen and I've done in years

1111
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,962
was get this cat.

1112
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:30,267
[Jennifer] Run along, Bing.

1113
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,236
-Did you get that catnip?
-[Jennifer] Yeah.

1114
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,670
Oh, yeah.

1115
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,006
[Jennifer] Oh, she
likes it with you.

1116
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,041
That's 'cause I crushed it,

1117
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:39,143
I got the oils going.

1118
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:40,110
Right, Bings?

1119
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:42,346
Yesterday you were saying

1120
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,115
how you feel

1121
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:48,352
that you can't identify
right now with yourself.

1122
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,121
Well, to be in a relationship

1123
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,328
is the immediate opportunity
to hurt someone else, right?

1124
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:00,597
Or to make their life amazing.

1125
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,599
-Or to make their life--
-That's the point of it.

1126
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,968
But I'm aware of that.

1127
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,003
You're such a pain, man.

1128
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,240
I'm trying to reconvince myself

1129
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:13,410
that I am capable of being in
a relationship with someone

1130
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,545
without fucking them over.

1131
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,016
You know, if it's somebody

1132
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:20,417
who's really supportive
of you and awesome,

1133
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,186
it might actually
make it a bit easier

1134
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,287
'cause then you
know that you have--

1135
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,354
That's funny, that was you.

1136
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,322
Well, yeah.

1137
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:32,396
Yeah, well, hmmph, true.

1138
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,632
My hope is that you and I
continue to be better friends

1139
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,535
than others can really
hope to understand.

1140
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,270
You know how
impactful you've been,

1141
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:43,307
you know that I can't,

1142
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,442
I cannot pay you back

1143
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:49,179
nor can I validate what
you've done for me, like ever.

1144
01:05:49,213 --> 01:05:50,614
[Jennifer] I know.

1145
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:06,430
At some point, I realized that
he didn't need me anymore.

1146
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,132
I didn't need to be there

1147
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:11,235
100% of the time
and the caregiver.

1148
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,003
I chose to put my life on hold

1149
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:16,240
but I've still been
wanting to do things for me

1150
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:17,574
and one of those things

1151
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,977
has been wanting to
do stand up comedy.

1152
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:24,114
Honestly, I think
the stand up thing

1153
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:27,117
came from not being heard.

1154
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:29,186
I'm very confident that
I'm gonna struggle a lot

1155
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,787
just to speak clearly,

1156
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,123
just to not be so nervous

1157
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:36,726
in a room full of people
that are looking at you.

1158
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:42,799
[Eduardo] I'm proud
of us for surviving.

1159
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:47,071
I have an undending amount
of gratitude for Jen .

1160
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,439
Do what you need to do,

1161
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,774
be who you want to be

1162
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:54,444
and tell me how I
can support you.

1163
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,514
My role, I'm a friend, I care.

1164
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:00,184
[Announcer] We've got
two first timers tonight.

1165
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:01,518
Jen.

1166
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,720
(happy music)

1167
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,293
So, I'm on Tinder...

1168
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:16,400
* The favorite parts
are what we'll keep

1169
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:23,840
* Ornamental parts of
love and parts of memories

1170
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,611
* So everything else
has room to grow

1171
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:33,350
* 'Cause in better light,
everything changes

1172
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:38,722
No, I don't think Ed owes me.

1173
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:42,426
I think we did
pretty well together.

1174
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,428
What we've experienced and what
we've been through together

1175
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:48,398
forms a friendship
which is pretty epic.

1176
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:51,135
* There's no race,
there's only a runner

1177
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:53,837
* Just keep one foot
in front of the other

1178
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:58,175
* There's no race,
there's only a runner

1179
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:02,879
* One, two, three,
and then you get tired

1180
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:06,350
* Just keep one foot
in front of the other

1181
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,852
* There's no race,
no ending in sight

1182
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:11,888
* No second too short,
no window too tight

1183
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:16,793
* Turn off the
lights when you leave

1184
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:21,131
* 'Cause we've got
everything we're gonna need

1185
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,871
* We're on the run, we're
on the run, we're on the run

1186
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,779
* Tell our story

1187
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:47,123
* We made something of ourselves

1188
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:58,568
* One day, tell our story

1189
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:11,515
* We made something, we
made something of ourselves.

1190
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:31,635
Okay.

1191
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:36,840
[Eduardo] That is one
of the most unique ones

1192
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,408
we've ever picked.

1193
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:39,243
Whoa.

1194
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:47,684
She knows something's funny.

1195
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,553
I wonder if she's picking up on,

1196
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,755
this is all Jen's stuff.

1197
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:52,956
Hey, come here.

1198
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:59,296
Don't you worry,
Jen is moving out.

1199
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:08,505
She'll come back to us,
Bing, don't you worry.

1200
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:25,822
Don't you worry.

1201
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,927
She's moving out but
she is not leaving.

1202
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:41,571
I told her that you're moving
out but you're not leaving.

1203
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:42,606
[Jennifer] Is he okay?

1204
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:44,641
Look at Bing.

1205
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,376
Bing was trying to
hide in the mattress

1206
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,512
so she could go with you.

1207
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:49,979
[Jennifer] Of course she was.

1208
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:50,947
That's okay.

1209
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,322
(singing in Spanish)

1210
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:41,030
(speaking in Spanish)

1211
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:56,940
I know.

1212
01:12:58,742 --> 01:12:59,576
I know.

1213
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:56,900
[Eduardo] I would say that
my greatest struggle every day

1214
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:01,170
is just being true
to who I want to be.

1215
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,809
My strength has always been

1216
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:08,077
working within the physical.

1217
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:12,115
The emotional challenges,
I'm finding way harder.

1218
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:20,957
A friend of mine recommended
I check out a group

1219
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,792
called the Challenged
Athletes Foundation.

1220
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:23,693
Good to see you, man.

1221
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:24,528
You too.

1222
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,932
At my first CAF event,

1223
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,968
a lower arm amputee
stepped right up to me,

1224
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,237
pointed and said,
"Hey, are you running

1225
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,706
"with your prosthetic on?"

1226
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,677
And that was the first
time I can remember

1227
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:44,047
really being in public
with my nude forearm

1228
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:47,250
without trying to hide it.

1229
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:50,186
There was no denying it,

1230
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,757
it was like boom,
that's your amputation.

1231
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,292
That was my "ah-ha" moment.

1232
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,994
I am an amputee,

1233
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,295
I am missing my left hand.

1234
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,598
It is a part of who I am

1235
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,867
and it doesn't define me,

1236
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,669
I'm not Eduardo
Garcia, the amputee,

1237
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,036
I'm just Eduardo.

1238
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,844
[Starter]
Swimmers set...

1239
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:16,880
(horn blows)

1240
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:22,151
In my every day life,

1241
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,053
I don't have any other amputees

1242
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:25,722
that are in my
close friend group

1243
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,323
or in my community
that I know of

1244
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,893
that I can bounce
my successes,

1245
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,528
my losses,
my hard times off of.

1246
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,800
We inspire and
motivate each other

1247
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,835
by watching what
we're capable of.

1248
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:39,736
It's incredible.

1249
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,942
Disabilities like
what happened to Eduardo

1250
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,644
in a way is like
being born again

1251
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,312
'cause your life gets
flipped upside down

1252
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,747
and you start over

1253
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,082
whether you want
to admit it or not

1254
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:55,051
it's flipped upside down.

1255
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:55,919
[Eduardo] Scoot back a little.

1256
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:56,753
Okay.

1257
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:02,592
[Willie] You ultimately, you
gotta find who you are again.

1258
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,061
[Eduardo] That was so cool,

1259
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:07,263
I watched you catch
that first wave in.

1260
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,665
That was awesome.

1261
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,066
That was awesome.

1262
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:12,335
Up and over.

1263
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:19,008
I've never tried surfing
without my prosthetic on

1264
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,044
so that's gonna be a first.

1265
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,313
I know it's kind of just,

1266
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,949
it's a safe zone to discover

1267
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:29,318
and really be super
vulnerable and super open

1268
01:16:29,352 --> 01:16:32,121
and grow together.

1269
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:46,202
I truly feel
this urgent need

1270
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,237
to say thanks at large

1271
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:52,008
like that asshole kid
that was so selfish

1272
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:53,342
and focused on my own stuff,

1273
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,245
I almost feel guilty

1274
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:59,015
that I got so much given to me.

1275
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,321
I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for others

1276
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,156
so my life moving forward

1277
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:11,127
needs to be in some
dedication to others.

1278
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,863
I've inflicted a lot
of pain in my life.

1279
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:17,066
I've been a class A
beep, I have, I have.

1280
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:25,074
I have been so many
times in my life

1281
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:27,777
just focused on what I want.

1282
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:29,813
I think I've always
been a driven person,

1283
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,214
I think I've always
had more energy

1284
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,182
than anyone knew
what to do with.

1285
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:36,085
You get kicked out of
nine schools, I mean,

1286
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:40,724
but I think this experience
it did a couple of things.

1287
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:45,194
It fortified my interest in
making every moment count

1288
01:17:45,228 --> 01:17:46,796
and it also encouraged me

1289
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,298
that this is a life
worth living

1290
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,135
and it's a life worth living
really, really, really well.

1291
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:57,106
I mean, I have bad days, for
sure, this sucks, it does,

1292
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:00,944
but I'm not gonna live in that.

1293
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:03,179
My choice is I'd
rather wake up and say,

1294
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:05,715
"Hey, I'm gonna put a
stainless steel plate

1295
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:07,951
"on the bottom of that
and now I've got a hammer."

1296
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:10,820
The curiosity that maybe
got me electrocuted

1297
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:13,389
"Oh, what's that?
It's a dead bear,

1298
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:16,425
that's kind of
weird looking." (buzzing)

1299
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:20,163
Maybe that curiosity is
what pushes me through.

1300
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,898
I'm fortunate to
just still be alive

1301
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,067
but it's those mistakes
that you make,

1302
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,201
you learn from 'em,

1303
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:28,337
I'm not touching any more bears.

1304
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,840
But it doesn't mean I'm
not lifting up twigs

1305
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,175
and looking for things

1306
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,477
and seeing where
opportunity lies.

1307
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,179
Here's the thing

1308
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,948
is caregivers kind of get
the blind sight, right,

1309
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,784
like I had the People
magazine write up

1310
01:18:40,817 --> 01:18:41,785
and I was on Good
Morning America

1311
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:43,186
and I got flown to New York

1312
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,289
and there's been a
lot of publicity on me

1313
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:50,093
and absolutely zero on every
single person that helped me

1314
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:51,995
and without them,

1315
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:54,798
I wouldn't have made
it through that.

1316
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,766
So I would encourage,
if you're out there right now

1317
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,434
and you're helping
your best friend,

1318
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,870
your little brother or sister,
your mom, your dad, whoever,

1319
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,306
to get through a hard time

1320
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,842
and you feel like all
the attention's on them,

1321
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:10,146
they can't do it without you
and without your support.

1322
01:19:10,179 --> 01:19:12,415
So I want any number of people

1323
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,484
to join me right here,

1324
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:17,186
grab my left hand,
grab my right hand,

1325
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,221
join it up with that corner,

1326
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,056
join it up with that corner

1327
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:23,159
and I want to see if this
entire room in the next minute

1328
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:25,161
can connect hands, go.

1329
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:37,540
Everybody find your pulse.

1330
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:40,176
That pulse is now going
through every single one of us.

1331
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,344
We are connected.

1332
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,214
[Man] Thanks.

1333
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:47,516
Yeah man, 100%, you too.

1334
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,888
You can just like
hold on to it like.

1335
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:56,192
Just listening to your
story about troubles in school

1336
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,261
is just very inspiring for me

1337
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,230
because everything
that you've said

1338
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:02,565
I could kind of relate to.

1339
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:04,333
Thanks for coming out.

1340
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:08,004
My brother was in the ICU
about the same time as you.

1341
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:10,073
He got hit with a
firework and was burned,

1342
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:14,143
he's seven but it's been tough.

1343
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:15,211
How's he doing?

1344
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,079
He's doing really good.

1345
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,580
Nice.

1346
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:19,515
Sounds like you've been
there for him though?

1347
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:20,349
Yeah.

1348
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:25,288
That's awesome, man.
That's the stuff.

1349
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:29,558
(upbeat music)

1350
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:37,934
I left this parking lot four
years ago today at 10:30.

1351
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:48,477
You look at my experiences
leading into this injury,

1352
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,317
maybe I'm doing myself no favors

1353
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:58,354
by just continuing
to push through

1354
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:01,090
and not stopping to
take a full appraisal

1355
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:02,892
of why I am the way I am

1356
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:05,328
and how much it means to change.

1357
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:13,202
Everyone that has encouraged
me and supported me

1358
01:21:13,236 --> 01:21:16,505
and forgiven me and
held me accountable

1359
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:20,309
has brought me to today

1360
01:21:22,578 --> 01:21:25,448
and how I make my
life moving forward.

1361
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,487
You're damn right
I would go back.

1362
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:34,423
Funny last time I
was here with Jen

1363
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,225
I couldn't even stand here.

1364
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:38,661
I was so pissed, man.

1365
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:41,664
I was so pissed.

1366
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:54,643
It feels like a long time ago.

1367
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:58,214
It feels like more
than four years ago.

1368
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,317
It feels like a lifetime ago.

1369
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,352
You know what I'm saying?

1370
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,925
(dramatic music)

1371
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:23,299
* All my fears are running wild

1372
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:26,569
* Dragging me mile after mile

1373
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:31,340
* Think it's time
I take the reigns

1374
01:23:31,374 --> 01:23:35,278
* Playing a hero for a change

1375
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:39,415
* 'Cause I'm stronger,
I'm stronger than my

1376
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,322
* Fears

1377
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:52,528
* Over fields of doubt I march

1378
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:56,465
* Fighting hard
to frame my heart

1379
01:23:56,499 --> 01:24:00,569
* Still I hear
my old fears call

1380
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:04,573
* Who are you
to stand so tall

1381
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:11,414
* Well I'm stronger,
I'm stronger than my

1382
01:24:13,116 --> 01:24:15,050
* Fears

1383
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:29,432
* Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey

1384
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:38,174
* Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey

1385
01:24:42,845 --> 01:24:47,350
* Every day
we have a choice

1386
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:51,354
* Fear has nothing
but a voice

1387
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:55,624
* It may whisper,
it may scream

1388
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:59,495
* Well I'm no longer listening

1389
01:25:32,728 --> 01:25:36,632
* 'Cause I'm stronger,
I'm stronger than my

1390
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:43,872
* Fears.
