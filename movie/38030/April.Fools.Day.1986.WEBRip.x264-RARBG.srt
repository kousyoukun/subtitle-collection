1
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,576
- Go! Go!
- Oh, um...

2
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:30,988
Hi... My name is
Mary O'Reilly O'Toole O'Shea and...

3
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,672
Don't be nervous.

4
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:38,833
Somewhere out there
is the island my friend Muffy owns.

5
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,632
It's spring break and she's invited us
over there for the weekend.

6
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,427
We're waiting for the ferry
to take us there.

7
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:53,061
- Yes?
- I don't know what else to say.

8
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:58,172
Why don't you tell us
something about yourself?

9
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,642
- All right. Something about myself.
- Yeah.

10
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:07,951
I want to work
with handicapped children.

11
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,103
My parents are my best friends.

12
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:14,993
And I start convent school
next semester.

13
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:19,626
And I fuck on the first date.

14
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,323
April Fool!

15
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:28,129
Nikki, baby, you're outrageous!
Now get out of here, knucklehead.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,695
All right, try Kit.

17
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,641
- How about you?
- I pass.

18
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,366
- Arch?
- Skip.

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,943
Where are you?

20
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:40,087
- Come on, help me out.
- Yeah...

21
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:43,337
Yeah, sure.

22
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,715
I fuck on the first date.

23
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:51,069
We did on the first date.
Didn't we, honey? He's an animal.

24
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:01,963
- Need any help down there?
- No, Clara, thanks.

25
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:07,075
I'm just straightening up. I don't
think I've worked so hard in my life!

26
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:11,022
Sure you don't want me to stay?

27
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:15,174
There'll be nobody to help
till the ferry on Monday.

28
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:18,784
No. Clara, you're a peach.
This one's mine.

29
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:22,246
I told my father I'd do it
and I will, my way.

30
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,469
We don't want him to have any excuses.

31
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:28,646
All right, then. Have a nice party.

32
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,940
Nice? It's going to be better than nice.

33
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,659
It's going to be bloody unforgettable!

34
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:39,939
Good luck!

35
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:32,102
Here comes the ferry.

36
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:49,840
- Is this the ferry to the St John house?
- Yeah, any second now.

37
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:52,753
Good! I didn't know if this was right.

38
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:56,658
- Let me help you. Kit Graham.
- Nan Youngblood.

39
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:58,744
That's Nikki Brashears.

40
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:01,986
Are you planning on staying a while?

41
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:07,075
No, it's just some work for finals
when we get back.

42
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,151
- You don't know how far behind I am.
- Hi! I got it.

43
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:15,299
Hi. Arch Cummings. I've seen you.
Jewett Hall, right?

44
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,515
Chaz Vyshinsky.
You've got great legs.

45
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:21,924
Chaz, Arch already has her bags.

46
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:27,994
I only met Muffy this term.
In Drama Society.

47
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:32,230
I volunteered to do their costumes.
I like to sew.

48
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,024
- Did you see her in "Ghosts"?
- No.

49
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:39,161
She was wonderful.
She's so talented.

50
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:41,486
Yeah, she is.

51
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:07,597
Guy, your fly is open and your
Hostess Twinkie is hanging out.

52
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,581
- Come on if you're coming!
- We're still waiting for someone.

53
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:20,466
This is my last run of the week.
I don't get paid overtime.

54
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,704
But this is the only way over.
If he misses this one, how is he...

55
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,179
Wait up!

56
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:44,428
Go! Go! Go!

57
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:48,053
Sorry, guys. Nik, Chaz, hi.
Rob Ferris.

58
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,157
- Hi.
- Hi.

59
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,896
Hi. Harvey "Hal" Edison Jr.
Call me Hal.

60
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,555
Only my folks call me Harve
and I can't stand it.

61
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,069
- Sure is pretty here, isn't it?
- You're friends with Muffy St John?

62
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,353
Sure am.
We sit together in Econ 3.45.

63
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,302
I let her copy
my marginal utility curves.

64
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,263
- Oh, I get it. That's a joke.
- Harve.

65
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:15,749
Hal... Springsteen! Still the boss!

66
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,281
Let's go. We don't have all day.

67
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,598
- You all buddies?
- Except for Skip and Nan.

68
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:27,890
- Them we just met.
- But we will be.

69
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:30,548
Careful, though. Skip is Muffy's cousin.

70
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:34,609
- No kidding!
- Distant. Over the horizon.

71
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,023
Otherwise
I wouldn't have been invited.

72
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:43,706
- She doesn't mix family with friends.
- True, as long as I've known her.

73
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,315
To protect her family, I guess.

74
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,863
No, to keep her friends.

75
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,511
- Choose your weapons, big guy.
- What's this?

76
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:55,237
- You up for a game of Stretch?
- OK.

77
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,187
- Skip, your fly's open.
- Eat it!

78
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:05,051
Ah, Rob!
Your fly is open.

79
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,131
OK, don't believe me.

80
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,604
Oh, nice.

81
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:16,984
We're off.

82
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,430
Bye.

83
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,425
First round, the Champ!

84
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:07,101
You know what I find amazing?
Muffy's her real name.

85
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:12,099
I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal.
Muffy must stand for something. Muffin?

86
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:16,358
Muff-child, Moffo the Muffster,
Muffin' Stuff...

87
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,785
Muff dive.

88
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,283
- Hi, what are you reading?
- Milton's "Paradise Lost".

89
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:36,166
For Professor Russo's course
on English Epic.

90
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:40,853
- It's a shame. It's a dying form.
- Dying.

91
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:45,407
Not many people read it nowadays,
even in college.

92
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:47,747
Really?

93
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,454
- What about you?
- Oh, er...

94
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,111
"Treasure Island: The History
of Pornography in America".

95
00:10:56,475 --> 00:11:00,991
I don't have the perks
of you private college kids.

96
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,674
Don't give me that.

97
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,768
I'm hoping to interview with her
daddy's company before graduation.

98
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:11,510
He's worth more than 50 million
over the counter.

99
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:15,613
But I don't think
that's why she invited me, do you?

100
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:21,354
We're not going to be sheltered
college kids our whole life.

101
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,701
Wake up!
Smell the bacon, Nan!

102
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,101
It's research I can do all on my own.

103
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:37,462
And this is the best part:
I never get tired of it.

104
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,512
You want to take a look?

105
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:57,745
- Bruce's car was in the shop.
- That's not my point.

106
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,372
Oh, my God.

107
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,087
We're going to spend a weekend there?

108
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,119
- Are you a wimp?
- I'm not interested any more.

109
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,080
Come on! One more.
Double or nothing.

110
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,317
Enough's enough.

111
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:31,451
- What? Are you scared?
- Hey, I said give it a rest.

112
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,854
Oh, fuck!

113
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,233
I'll get him! I'll get him!

114
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,333
Where is he?

115
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:55,025
All right! What you're looking for?

116
00:12:56,936 --> 00:13:00,451
We got them! We got them!
Did we nail them?

117
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,450
Ha ha ha. April Fool's. Very funny.

118
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:07,011
What's wrong with you?
Somebody could have got hurt.

119
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:11,281
At least we don't go in
for this shoe-lace-is-untied crap.

120
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:13,813
You know that.

121
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,280
That was great! Shit!

122
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,305
OK, Buck, come on out.
I'm going to need some help.

123
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,862
I'll just do it from here.
Throw me a line.

124
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:30,339
- This one?
- That's the one. That'll work.

125
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:33,027
Thank you.

126
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:36,937
- Some hero you were.
- I took off my jacket and shoes.

127
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,582
- There were three guys in the water.
- Chaz, I'm only kidding.

128
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:45,332
- Nikki, can we borrow your towel?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:52,822
Hey, you guys have got to admit,
it was a hell of a trick.

130
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,392
- I loved it.
- Animal!

131
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,762
Buck! Look out!

132
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,287
Calm him down!

133
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,082
Calm him down!

134
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,354
I've got to get him to a doctor.

135
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,312
- Cal!
- Get in the boat!

136
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,087
- Cal!
- Get in the boat!

137
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,256
They did it! They did it!

138
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,485
What's going on?
Sam, what happened?

139
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:23,755
Tricks. Pranks.
Ask your friends.

140
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,167
- Is your dad around?
- No, he's in Sutton Place. Why?

141
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,462
- You haven't heard from him?
- No.

142
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,396
I need to borrow your boat
to get back to shore.

143
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:38,004
All the keys are in the kitchen,

144
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:42,346
but I think there's an extra one
under the cushion there.

145
00:15:44,363 --> 00:15:48,242
Look, you people, stay put,
all of you.

146
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,026
If anything else happens,

147
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,801
I want to know
just where to find you.

148
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:06,171
Skip, it's not your fault.
It was an accident. You didn't know.

149
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,807
Sure.
Did you see his face?

150
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:18,142
Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her.

151
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,005
- There's a lot to be done here.
- You sound as if you own it.

152
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,522
I will, if all goes well.

153
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:36,145
Next month when I turn 21,
it's my first stage inheritance.

154
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:39,733
- First stage? What's your second?
- Texas.

155
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,244
You may be talking
to your future boss, Harve.

156
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,048
Nikki, burn my bags, baby!

157
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:50,339
I am home!

158
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,081
Oh, yeah!
I could get really used to this.

159
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:58,111
We spent all our summers here
before my mother died.

160
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:01,752
- It's very special to me.
- It's like a dream.

161
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,459
On a clear day,
you can see the Kennedys.

162
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,812
Wow!
You guys, look at this!

163
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,329
Oh, Muffers,
our very own place settings!

164
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:22,748
With our very own place cards
and here's our own little dolly!

165
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:26,524
- It's just like an Agatha Christie.
- And sporks!

166
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,442
- Sporks?
- And napkins with bunnies on them.

167
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:34,806
- Muffy, you spared no expense.
- How do you think Dad made money?

168
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,342
The old fashioned way.
He inherited it.

169
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,678
I used to have all her outfits.

170
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:42,139
Hold it! Don't anybody move!

171
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:47,923
But before this night is over,
somebody in this room...

172
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,319
...will pull his wang.

173
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,788
"My first experience was:
A) Painful and degrading;"

174
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,724
"B) Not so hot,
but I really cared about him;"

175
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:04,603
"C) I was ready to try again
or D)"

176
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:08,399
"Wildly exciting. I had an orgasm."

177
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,813
A and part of B.

178
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:19,475
A and B: "Painful and degrading; not
so hot, but I really cared about him."

179
00:18:20,653 --> 00:18:23,213
That's so sweet.

180
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,707
I'll take B.

181
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:30,183
"Not so hot, but I really cared
about him." Was it Rob?

182
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:34,922
- No, it wasn't Rob.
- What about you, Nikki?

183
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:41,706
A and D: "Painful and degrading.
Wildly exciting. I had an orgasm."

184
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:48,774
Anyway, "The one thing I haven't tried
yet but am intensely curious about is:"

185
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,445
"A) Oral sex;"

186
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:55,846
"B) Anal entry;"

187
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,617
"C) S&M;
D) Group sex;"

188
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,177
"E) Lesbian sex;"

189
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,405
"or F) All of the above."

190
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,643
What was C?

191
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:12,754
Hi, my name is
Mary O'Toole O'Reilly O'Shea.

192
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,759
I want to go to convent school,
and things like that.

193
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:19,682
Welcome.
Welcome to my home

194
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:23,003
and "Lifestyles of the Rich
and Undeserving".

195
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:26,932
My name's Arch Cummings
and I'm on a mission here

196
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,463
to bed as many women
as humanly possible.

197
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,298
Nan's out, to be honest.

198
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:38,410
She likes the theatre...
You know what I'm saying.

199
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:41,648
She's out in the first round.

200
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:59,363
A poor boy can say,
"Fuck you, Dad."

201
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:01,767
"I'm my own person."

202
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:06,420
What's his father going to do?
Kick him out?

203
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,101
Disinherit him?

204
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,658
His life won't have changed much.

205
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,638
He's got nothing to lose.

206
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:19,118
His father's love.

207
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:27,863
That was lost a long, long time ago.

208
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:34,636
Skip, blaming yourself
won't make Buck any better.

209
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,862
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,857
Muffy, you sure know how to make
a guy look forward to... dessert.

211
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,957
Please God, let it be ding dongs.

212
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,643
St John hospitality,
taken to the extreme.

213
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,680
It's real friendly.
Makes me feel at home.

214
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:59,355
How are we going to feel
after these beans?

215
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:07,814
You guys!

216
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:12,823
Nan, do you want some beans?

217
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:50,208
- I wonder how Buck's doing.
- Should we call?

218
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:55,198
- I'll call later.
- I'm sure he's getting the best care.

219
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,789
Let's change the subject.

220
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,144
Well...

221
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,959
Harve's got his job interview
all figured out.

222
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,522
What about the rest of us? Anyone know
what they're doing after graduation?

223
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:21,988
- Good choice, Arch.
- This is incredible.

224
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:27,736
Here we are, privileged, independent,
the hope for the future.

225
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:31,694
Not one of us knows
what we're doing with our lives.

226
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:34,141
- Rob knows.
- Kit, come on.

227
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:38,190
- He's going to medical school.
- You got early acceptance?

228
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:42,444
- Let's talk some other time.
- But you've met your counsellor.

229
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:46,062
I don't think
he wants to talk about it.

230
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:49,843
- No, no, I don't mind.
- We're all friends here, right?

231
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,421
Sort of.

232
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,901
He said to forget it.

233
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,796
He said that my grades might be OK,

234
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:04,408
but basically I possess
an essential lack of seriousness.

235
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:08,760
- And that's what they look for.
- That's what my guy said.

236
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:10,743
I said you've got to be kidding.

237
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:15,612
How can anyone be serious
when some moron can push a button

238
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,786
and nuke us all
until our shadows glow?

239
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,793
He wasn't impressed with that...

240
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:26,746
Oh, what's this?
Dom Perignon sparkling rosé?

241
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:31,352
- Smells like Ripple.
- Outdone yourself again, St John.

242
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,821
Can I make a toast?

243
00:24:36,217 --> 00:24:38,208
Well...

244
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,919
Someone once said to me to cherish
the friends you make in college.

245
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:47,142
I try to cherish
all the friends I make.

246
00:24:47,438 --> 00:24:49,713
- Stop it!
- Because...

247
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:55,102
Because they'll be the friends you
cherish most for the rest of your life.

248
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:58,480
So, well, here's to us.

249
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,469
And here's to my life,
because I'm very glad to be here

250
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:05,301
and to be a part of all of you.

251
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:09,146
Muffy, anything you want to add?

252
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,730
- Why me?
- Because you're the hostess.

253
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,485
OK.

254
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:28,083
In his "Life of Johnson",
James Boswell said,

255
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:34,253
"We cannot predict the precise moment
when friendships are formed."

256
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:38,477
"As in filling a vessel
drop by drop,"

257
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:42,538
"there is at last one
which makes it run over..."

258
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:45,442
"...so in a series..."

259
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:49,098
"...so in a series of kindnesses,"

260
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:54,478
"there is at last one
which makes the heart run over."

261
00:25:56,386 --> 00:26:00,538
So, with this toast,
may our hearts run over

262
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,245
and our friendships be formed.

263
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,790
- All right.
- Cheers!

264
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,262
- Going down!
- OK.

265
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:11,265
All over myself!

266
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,121
Muffy!

267
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,974
April Fool!

268
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,938
- Wow! Is this the bridal suite?
- You like it?

269
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,226
- I thought you needed the room.
- I'll find a use for it.

270
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,159
Muffy?

271
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:54,792
I know you and Arch had something
going before I met him.

272
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:58,148
Arch is sweet,
but he only has two expressions:

273
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,683
- Collar up and collar down.
- Yeah, I found that out.

274
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,688
I guess what I'm trying to say now is...

275
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,772
You always get there first,
but Chaz is mine, OK?

276
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:16,846
- What about Hal?
- Harvey? Mr Junior Achievement?

277
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,418
Oh, please!
Yuck!

278
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:27,964
Don't try to tell me you hadn't
thought of me in that way, Muffy.

279
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:33,310
Why, I felt a spark between us the
first time we laid eyes on each other

280
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:36,131
in Econ 3.45.

281
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:40,772
Just think of it, Muffy.

282
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,348
With my... my talent

283
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,942
and your...

284
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,401
...money. No.

285
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:58,629
All right.

286
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,011
We're going to have some privacy.

287
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:07,983
You've got to be kidding.

288
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:12,385
Unless Muffy knows something about us
we don't.

289
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:17,596
- Hold me, big fella! Hold me!
- Just holster it, cowboy!

290
00:28:17,952 --> 00:28:20,546
Let's play "Hide the Sausage".

291
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,787
Pick it up!

292
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:26,761
Hold me like a man
can hold another man!

293
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:30,173
Why, just think of it, Muffers.

294
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:34,344
With my raw, driving talent...

295
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:41,215
...and your...

296
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,276
...your...

297
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,432
Wrong room.

298
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:27,514
Shit.

299
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:12,380
Come on!

300
00:32:06,152 --> 00:32:08,143
Rob?

301
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:11,790
Are you still angry with me?

302
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:15,347
About dinner?

303
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,770
No.

304
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,156
I'm sorry. I'm not angry at you.
I'm just...

305
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,451
...just angry.

306
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,228
Jesus!

307
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:28,102
Very funny.

308
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,234
Muffy!

309
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,472
Arch!

310
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,744
Hi, Muff! Hi.

311
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,495
Do you know what time it is, love?

312
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,780
Goodnight.

313
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,731
Real funny, you guys!

314
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:33,613
Better ride than you could give me.

315
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,281
Hello?

316
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,389
Shit.

317
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,801
Who's there?

318
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:25,353
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

319
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,981
Fucking cat!

320
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,072
Oh, God.

321
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,303
Morning.

322
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,696
...a nightmare about Buck
and I don't know...

323
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,954
Good morning.

324
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,080
I was just hungry.
I must look a mess.

325
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,182
- Morning, Muff.
- I forgot to get dressed.

326
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:55,096
- So who made her night?
- I don't know.

327
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,832
- Where's Skip?
- That depends what he's on.

328
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:04,169
- You guys have got to be kidding.
- Have fun.

329
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,029
Hey, Nan, what about it?
Come on.

330
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,297
No, thanks.

331
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:13,551
Besides, I thought I'd wait
to see what Muffy wanted to do.

332
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,858
Chaz comes down...

333
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:33,299
He comes down with it...
That's my bad knee!

334
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,510
I've got Nikki, you get the ball.

335
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:44,181
I'm covering Nikki.
I've got her.

336
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,189
- She's covered.
- Harvey, Harvey!

337
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,127
Good one, Harve!
Good one!

338
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:29,431
Hey, Rob, what's wrong?

339
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,116
I'm just thinking...

340
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,628
...about that meeting
I had with my advisor.

341
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:43,351
- I feel like I'm going nowhere.
- He only said you weren't serious.

342
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:49,444
Kit, maybe it's crazy
you investing so much energy in me.

343
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:53,926
Sure, you feel this way about me now.

344
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,088
What about when I'm a TV repairman

345
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,214
- and all those other guys are...
- Rob, you're right.

346
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:03,940
I know. I told you. I'm right.

347
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,173
- You're right.
- I know. I'm right. I said I'm right.

348
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:12,870
- There's no question.
- I'm right.

349
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:15,138
You're a jerk.

350
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:19,381
Oh, God! I am.

351
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:39,766
Come here, baby.

352
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:24,442
Skip, you son-of-a-bitch!

353
00:42:25,473 --> 00:42:26,792
Skip!

354
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:33,425
Respectable Quaker couple

355
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:36,763
returning from an afternoon
of non-violent sex.

356
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,778
- So how was it?
- Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?

357
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:45,267
- Who wants to know?
- Damn it, give me a straight answer!

358
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,532
We saw him at the boat house,
drifting in a boat.

359
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,302
He wasn't moving.
He looked dead, unless he was joking.

360
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:54,857
- If it was Skip...
- I saw his face.

361
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,600
Look, has anybody seen him
since last night?

362
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:05,125
Jesus Christ!

363
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:08,986
- We'll look for him. Come on.
- I'm coming, too.

364
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,152
What's happening?

365
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:17,210
Is something wrong?

366
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,839
Skip! Hey, arsehole!

367
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,561
- Hey, Skip!
- Wait a minute.

368
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,611
Look at this.

369
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,698
Skip's knife.

370
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:36,055
Think it was that guy on the ferry?

371
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,298
I don't know.
I don't know what to think.

372
00:43:39,594 --> 00:43:43,223
I say we look for them.
One of them's got to be around.

373
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:46,354
- You mean split up?
- Yeah.

374
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:49,032
No sucker's taking me yet.

375
00:44:18,593 --> 00:44:21,107
I know why you're avoiding me.

376
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:24,447
This is your idea of a joke.

377
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,490
That's why you invited me here,
isn't it?

378
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:32,009
How did you find out?
From his preppy friends?

379
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:35,706
I don't know
what you're talking about.

380
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,774
You mean the tape just got there?
Just appeared?

381
00:44:40,992 --> 00:44:44,189
You know, I thought you wanted
to be friends.

382
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,394
Skip!

383
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:20,613
Skip?

384
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,432
Skip?

385
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:14,226
Any sign of Skip?

386
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:17,146
No luck here.

387
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:20,650
- Where's Arch?
- He was with you.

388
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,567
- Shit! That's it!
- I don't like this.

389
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:29,664
- I definitely don't think I like this.
- It's time to call the police.

390
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:34,039
8248. Constable Potter
has an office at his home.

391
00:47:34,926 --> 00:47:36,917
Who wants tea?

392
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:40,116
Lt'll relax our nerves.

393
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,121
Is she kidding?

394
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,466
I didn't know what kind anybody
would like so I brought them all.

395
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:48,030
Here, let me help you.
I'll get some water.

396
00:48:52,007 --> 00:48:57,001
- Has he reached the constable?
- We haven't reached the mainland yet.

397
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,507
Oh, the main.

398
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:05,886
- It's probably broken.
- There's no water?

399
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:09,465
- What's happening?
- There's no water!

400
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:11,971
It happens sometimes.

401
00:49:12,738 --> 00:49:14,808
But there's still the well.

402
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:18,349
I'll go. Point me in the right direction.

403
00:49:18,661 --> 00:49:20,652
Not without me.

404
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,786
I'm not worried...

405
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:29,000
...about those two.

406
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:31,007
Skip and Art.

407
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:35,808
They're probably playing
some kind of stupid trick.

408
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:41,670
Yeah. Probably.

409
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:52,268
Is that it?

410
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:56,284
When she said well,
she really meant well.

411
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,851
Who dug this? Pocahontas?

412
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,636
Let me do that. I've probably
had more experience than you.

413
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,436
You mean back home on the farm?

414
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:16,082
I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd
like to change your mind about that.

415
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,428
Why?

416
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:26,646
Because I would really like
to plough your field.

417
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,178
Draw me some water.

418
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,305
- Oh, crap!
- What happened?

419
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:40,410
- I lost the bucket.
- Harve.

420
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:44,702
Hal! The rope was rotten.
Any fool could have seen that.

421
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:48,878
- You didn't.
- Would you shine the light down there.

422
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:56,689
- Nice going.
- So I spazzed out. Now we're even.

423
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,006
What do we do now?

424
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:07,048
- Look, there are rungs down the side.
- So?

425
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,912
- So get a move on.
- Are you crazy?

426
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:14,586
I don't relish the idea
of a weekend without water.

427
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,503
Well, I'm not going down there.

428
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,076
OK, fine.

429
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:23,960
- Wait! What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

430
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:27,922
I don't think you ought to do this.
Nikki...

431
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:30,247
Harvey, I'm a big girl now.

432
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:33,306
I can handle
a few spiders and frogs.

433
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:38,115
Be careful down there.
Watch what you're doing.

434
00:51:38,433 --> 00:51:43,063
Watch what I'm doing? That's
a hot one! I can barely see a thing.

435
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:47,413
Well just...
just watch out anyway, OK?

436
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:50,143
Just be careful.

437
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:53,730
Nikki!

438
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:57,143
Nikki! Nikki! Hey, answer me!

439
00:51:57,704 --> 00:51:59,774
I'm fine. I'm fine.

440
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:07,183
Nikki! Nikki!

441
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:15,996
Answer me!

442
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,147
Nikki!

443
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:22,947
Help! Nikki!

444
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:25,586
Nikki! Answer me!

445
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:29,719
Help! Rob, Kit! Help!

446
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:34,223
Nikki, damn it, answer me!

447
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:39,965
Shit!

448
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:50,863
Oh, my God!

449
00:52:56,808 --> 00:52:58,685
Come on!

450
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:02,811
Come on, reach!
Damn it, come on!

451
00:53:16,913 --> 00:53:21,191
It's OK now.
With the others, they were outside,

452
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:24,295
but we're inside, so we're safe.

453
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:28,083
It's because of what happened
on the ferry, isn't it?

454
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:31,978
It was an accident.
Christ, don't they know that?

455
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:35,721
Muffy, where do you keep your guns?

456
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,729
Guns?
We don't keep guns in this house.

457
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,999
- Here.
- God, not the water!

458
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:51,794
- It's all right. It's Perrier.
- Here.

459
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,609
Hello.

460
00:53:57,622 --> 00:54:02,298
Constable Potter, you've got to help us.
Arch, Skip and Nan...

461
00:54:02,794 --> 00:54:06,150
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

462
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,791
That ain't possible.

463
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:13,328
I'm at the hospital right now
visiting Buck.

464
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,641
With Muffy?

465
00:54:31,408 --> 00:54:33,399
What are you saying?

466
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:36,322
Yeah, all right.

467
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,538
Just please, please get here, OK?

468
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,757
He's on his way.

469
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:48,965
He wants us to wait here
and stay together.

470
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,535
- And the ferryman?
- Wasn't him.

471
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:54,524
- They've been together all day.
- What?

472
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:58,517
- I don't understand.
- I don't, either.

473
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:04,034
He'll send up a flare
when he's nearing the dock.

474
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,477
Then we go down as a group
to meet him there.

475
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,772
In the meantime, we just wait here.

476
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:24,501
It's my father's study.

477
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:30,709
I just came in to make sure
everything was secure.

478
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:33,708
I had to lock those windows.

479
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:35,987
Good idea.

480
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:39,051
Sometimes, with the tides,

481
00:56:39,335 --> 00:56:43,169
it could take all night
to get here from the mainland.

482
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:47,499
Even then, sometimes...
they don't make it.

483
00:56:57,813 --> 00:57:00,088
Yeah.

484
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:32,967
What is taking him so long?

485
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:36,129
Maybe it's the tides.

486
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:39,888
Wait. Aren't we supposed
to stay together?

487
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:42,068
What about Rob and Muffy?

488
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,391
- Rob's out back checking the doors.
- What about Muffy?

489
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,891
- She's acting abnormal.
- What do you mean?

490
00:57:50,202 --> 00:57:52,796
- You haven't noticed?
- Who isn't?

491
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,913
- Those nurse's shoes.
- What?

492
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:59,883
The clodhoppers she's been wearing.
Crêpe soles?

493
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:04,505
She was arguing with Nan in the hall

494
00:58:05,593 --> 00:58:09,586
before you and Rob came back alone
from the woods.

495
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:15,061
About something Nan found in her room.
Something...

496
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:18,910
- What?
- Something about an abortion.

497
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:24,700
I found something in my room, too.

498
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,510
But I don't think
it was intended for me.

499
00:58:27,783 --> 00:58:30,217
- Really?
- Oh, fuck you, Chaz.

500
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:34,965
- What did you find?
- I didn't find anything.

501
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,403
We're supposed to believe that?

502
00:58:37,669 --> 00:58:41,901
That's right. I spent the night
with Nikki. What about you?

503
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:45,169
- What about me?
- What's your secret?

504
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:49,875
- I don't know what you mean.
- I came into your room last night.

505
00:58:50,223 --> 00:58:52,339
It was like your arse was on fire.

506
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:56,389
Nothing! Just some clippings
of some car accidents.

507
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:00,689
- Nothing personal in that?
- No! Who hasn't had a car accident?

508
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:03,825
- I haven't.
- Oh, knock it off, Chaz!

509
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,702
How did Muffy find this out
and why...

510
00:59:17,002 --> 00:59:20,995
Stop it! Just stop it, you guys!
What's wrong with us?

511
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,777
What happened to our talk
about friendship and undying loyalty?

512
00:59:26,136 --> 00:59:30,015
Do you know what we're saying?
We're discussing the possibility

513
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:34,900
that Muffy, a good friend of ours,
has invited us here this weekend to...

514
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:43,772
I'm going upstairs.

515
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,703
Muffy, we should all stay together.

516
00:59:47,743 --> 00:59:49,938
This is my home!

517
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:52,399
I'll be in my room.

518
01:00:07,472 --> 01:00:11,511
She has a point. We're starting
to get on each other's nerves.

519
01:00:11,852 --> 01:00:16,243
As long as we all stay within
shouting distance of each other.

520
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,962
Are you coming?

521
01:00:26,242 --> 01:00:28,802
- I'm going up to the attic.
- Why?

522
01:00:29,078 --> 01:00:32,070
I can probably see the constable
better from there.

523
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:35,729
It's all right.
I can keep watch on the stairs.

524
01:01:12,207 --> 01:01:14,801
- Nikki, come on!
- "Nikki, come on!"

525
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:18,236
Don't give me
any of this "Nikki, come on".

526
01:01:19,006 --> 01:01:21,804
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

527
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:26,131
Look, stay if you like.
Lock your door, dig a trench, hang out.

528
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:30,021
But once I leave this place,
I'm never coming back.

529
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:34,390
- We're supposed to stay together.
- That's been real effective.

530
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:39,043
What are you going to do?
Waltz down to the pier by yourself?

531
01:01:39,402 --> 01:01:44,840
Check your bags with the porter and
wait for a stray liner to pick you up?

532
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:53,167
I can't stay here any more.

533
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,034
What if the constable never shows?

534
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,571
I'll swim to the mainland if I have to.

535
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,169
OK, you relax.

536
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,385
Three people are dead
and you tell me to relax.

537
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,608
Nikki, wait a minute. Look at me.

538
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,928
Nikki, look at me!

539
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:18,725
Now, I know you've been through a lot.
We've all been through a lot.

540
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:21,579
Am I nervous? Yes.
Am I scared? Yes.

541
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:25,174
But am I running around
like a headless chicken?

542
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,688
- Nice image.
- No!

543
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:31,663
I mean...
You've got to lighten up a little bit.

544
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:36,630
Come on.

545
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,713
Would the birdman of S&M worry?

546
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:42,094
Very funny, Chaz.

547
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:46,383
Look at the bright side.
Everything's going to be OK.

548
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,682
Would you take that thing off?

549
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:53,128
OK, OK. Ah! How about this one?

550
01:02:58,236 --> 01:03:02,514
- You are such a jerk.
- This is turning you on, I can tell.

551
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:05,255
Kiss me, you savage she-devil!

552
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,844
Get away from me!

553
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:11,318
Ooh, some more!
I love it when you're rough.

554
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:15,379
Of course, it would help
if I could breathe in here.

555
01:03:15,713 --> 01:03:17,704
Nikki?

556
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,650
Come and get it!

557
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,055
Nikki?

558
01:03:45,202 --> 01:03:47,432
Oh, very subtle, Chaz.

559
01:03:47,705 --> 01:03:52,654
What am I supposed to do? Just throw
off my clothes and jump on top of you?

560
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:55,842
Just wind her up and watch her go!

561
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:59,042
You have a lot to learn, buddy.

562
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:07,522
Is this show and tell? You show me
yours and then I show you mine?

563
01:04:07,893 --> 01:04:09,884
Forget it!

564
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:15,901
You can take that thing and shove it
right back in your pants, kiddo.

565
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:20,610
Chaz...

566
01:04:22,575 --> 01:04:24,372
Chaz!

567
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:28,581
Oh, come on, Chaz.
Just say something.

568
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:54,412
No one's been up here in years.

569
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:08,184
- Do you see him?
- No.

570
01:05:08,457 --> 01:05:10,812
He must not have a light on his boat.

571
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:13,883
Or maybe he's chosen not to use it.

572
01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:18,411
Kit, he said something else
about Muffy, on the phone.

573
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:20,556
What?

574
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:23,954
He said not to trust anyone.

575
01:05:24,265 --> 01:05:27,257
No one was to be left alone
with anyone else.

576
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,279
And he said especially not with Muffy.

577
01:05:30,564 --> 01:05:33,283
- What did he mean?
- He wouldn't explain.

578
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:36,001
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

579
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:39,475
He's known her a lot longer
than we have.

580
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:48,811
Wait, wait, Rob.

581
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,119
What's that?

582
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,661
Just the dolls.

583
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:58,518
- Rob, she's been up here.
- So?

584
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:14,269
Rob!

585
01:06:21,868 --> 01:06:24,177
Jesus!

586
01:06:27,457 --> 01:06:30,415
- Rob!
- It's Arch, Skip and Nan.

587
01:06:30,711 --> 01:06:33,669
What are the two over there?

588
01:06:41,889 --> 01:06:44,278
He's here. Come on.

589
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:48,403
Harvey!

590
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:52,279
Nikki!

591
01:06:53,652 --> 01:06:55,643
Nikki!

592
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,525
Harvey!

593
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,122
Harvey!

594
01:08:45,645 --> 01:08:47,761
- Rob!
- I can't find Harvey.

595
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:50,014
I can't find anyone.

596
01:08:52,277 --> 01:08:54,393
Nikki's door is locked.

597
01:08:58,325 --> 01:09:00,361
Rob, it was locked.

598
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:09,154
- What about Muffy?
- Forget her!

599
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,297
She's my friend! Muffy!

600
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,185
Muffy!

601
01:09:13,424 --> 01:09:15,813
Muffy, open the door!

602
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:26,886
Come on!

603
01:09:39,994 --> 01:09:41,985
Constable Potter?

604
01:09:54,468 --> 01:09:56,459
Constable Potter?

605
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:59,504
Constable Potter?

606
01:10:15,281 --> 01:10:18,353
Hey, wait, Rob. Don't go in there.

607
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:25,831
If there's another flare, we can signal.

608
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:31,397
Maybe he already went back
up to the house.

609
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:49,871
- Shit, there's no key.
- Oh, damn!

610
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,032
Wait, wait, Rob.

611
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:05,278
"State Hospital.
Pursuant to our last letters,"

612
01:11:05,585 --> 01:11:09,021
"be advised that the patient
has still not been found"

613
01:11:09,339 --> 01:11:13,890
"and is now believed to be attempting
to return to her home."

614
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:18,300
"If encountered, exercise caution
and notify us immediately"

615
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,030
"as Miss St John has been
a patient here for three years"

616
01:11:22,352 --> 01:11:26,186
"and is considered
extremely dangerous."

617
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:31,620
Miss St John? Muffy hasn't been
in an institution for three years.

618
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,979
She's been at Vassar.

619
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:37,949
- We've got to get this boat started.
- How?

620
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:45,752
The house. Didn't Muffy say
there was a key in the kitchen?

621
01:11:46,086 --> 01:11:48,554
Rob, I can't go back there.
I can't.

622
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:52,388
Kit, we've got no choice.
We've got to go back.

623
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:03,768
Rob, look. The doors.
They've been closed.

624
01:12:14,658 --> 01:12:16,614
There.

625
01:12:18,328 --> 01:12:20,603
That's how we're going in.

626
01:12:24,543 --> 01:12:26,534
Here, hold this.

627
01:12:36,806 --> 01:12:38,797
Where are the stairs?

628
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:41,348
What's that?

629
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:48,064
Rob, look.

630
01:13:16,473 --> 01:13:20,625
- Oh, my God! It's Muffy's clothes!
- I don't get it.

631
01:13:26,859 --> 01:13:28,656
- Whoa!
- What?

632
01:13:28,903 --> 01:13:31,576
- What's that?
- I don't know.

633
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,457
Oh, my God!

634
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:47,748
The picture of the girls
in the study,

635
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:50,039
that letter,

636
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,895
and what the constable
was trying to tell you!

637
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:57,252
It's not Muffy! It's Buffy!
She's got a twin sister!

638
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,956
Rob, don't you see? Rob!

639
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,931
Oh, my God!

640
01:14:13,242 --> 01:14:15,358
Pull it away.

641
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,890
- Rob, I can't...
- Pull it away!

642
01:14:47,903 --> 01:14:51,691
- The boat key? It's got to be here.
- Where is it?

643
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:54,122
The wall! The key board?

644
01:14:56,788 --> 01:14:59,427
Jesus! Look in the cupboards!

645
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:02,175
I can't find it!

646
01:15:09,217 --> 01:15:11,412
Damn it! Where is it?

647
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:17,454
Kit!

648
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,471
Let me out, Kit!

649
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:25,716
No!

650
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:28,536
Rob!

651
01:15:33,285 --> 01:15:35,162
Buffy!

652
01:15:35,996 --> 01:15:37,987
Run, Kit, run!

653
01:15:41,126 --> 01:15:43,924
Please, just leave us alone, OK?

654
01:15:44,797 --> 01:15:48,153
Please, we're just going to go home.

655
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,672
Enough!

656
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:09,682
- Stop!
- Babe!

657
01:16:09,907 --> 01:16:12,262
Please just let us leave.

658
01:16:13,744 --> 01:16:16,861
Buffy, you can stop now.

659
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,467
Stop!

660
01:16:21,752 --> 01:16:23,708
No, Buffy, no!

661
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:26,602
- I love you, Kit!
- Please...

662
01:16:27,842 --> 01:16:30,436
No. Please, just leave us alone!

663
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,581
Please. Just let us go, please.

664
01:16:42,358 --> 01:16:44,508
No!

665
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:46,688
No! No!

666
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:32,335
Oh, ha ha! Ha ha ha!

667
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:35,380
That's really funny, you guys!

668
01:17:36,331 --> 01:17:38,606
Really funny! Fuck you!

669
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:46,725
Kit, I love you!

670
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:50,210
Kit! I love you!

671
01:17:50,847 --> 01:17:52,838
I love you, too, babe.

672
01:18:01,942 --> 01:18:04,137
April Fool!

673
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:43,103
You guys are so terrific.
I love you all.

674
01:18:43,444 --> 01:18:47,517
I want to thank you
for being such good sports.

675
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:51,016
Oh yeah, sure.
Quite welcome. Any time.

676
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:55,545
Rob, you and Kit,
you two were the best.

677
01:18:55,874 --> 01:18:57,865
You figured it all out.

678
01:18:58,126 --> 01:19:00,481
The clues. They really worked.

679
01:19:00,754 --> 01:19:03,552
- What clues?
- What's this all about?

680
01:19:03,841 --> 01:19:07,754
Don't anyone say April Fool's
or I'll rip them apart.

681
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:09,892
April Fool.

682
01:19:10,806 --> 01:19:15,880
It's a script for a weekend special.
It's going to help me keep the house.

683
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:21,264
Next month I get the house as part
of my mother's inheritance. It's true.

684
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,087
But only if I could show my father
it could carry itself,

685
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:27,760
what with taxes and expenses.

686
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:29,864
Otherwise, he would sell it.

687
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:33,269
So I decided to turn it
into a country inn.

688
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,334
But not just a stuffy old,
run-of-the-mill country inn.

689
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:40,546
One that specialises in offering

690
01:19:40,838 --> 01:19:44,467
a once-in-a-lifetime
whodunnit weekend.

691
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:48,289
I needed a rehearsal.

692
01:19:48,847 --> 01:19:51,407
I had to try my idea out on somebody.

693
01:19:53,643 --> 01:19:56,953
- You all had a part in this?
- Don't look at me.

694
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:59,945
We got sucked in as badly as you.

695
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:01,951
Once you were all killed off, yes.

696
01:20:02,194 --> 01:20:05,425
But everybody had to co-operate
or none of it would have worked.

697
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:08,811
So I guess
there's no twin sister, Buffy?

698
01:20:09,118 --> 01:20:11,951
There is a crazy twin,
but his name isn't Buffy.

699
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:14,157
- His name?
- Skip?

700
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:18,852
- He's your brother?
- You bastard! You were in on it!

701
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:22,602
Muffy only told me
to pull the prank on the ferry.

702
01:20:22,924 --> 01:20:25,233
I had no idea
what would happen to Buck.

703
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:29,583
Buck Williams,
make-up artist par excellence.

704
01:20:29,932 --> 01:20:33,129
I've got something for you, big guy.
Here, catch!

705
01:20:35,104 --> 01:20:38,301
These were just old props
that I redressed.

706
01:20:38,608 --> 01:20:42,567
- Sure fooled me.
- I take it this isn't the constable.

707
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:46,055
Kit Graham,
meet my uncle, Frank St John,

708
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:48,641
of St John et Frères, Wall Street.

709
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:52,664
Hi. Harvey "Hal" Edison Jr.
Pleased to meet you, sir.

710
01:20:53,373 --> 01:20:57,048
How did I do?
I've never done no acting before.

711
01:20:57,377 --> 01:20:59,368
I was really shaking!

712
01:21:00,506 --> 01:21:04,863
Cal is our regular ferryman
between the mainland and the islands.

713
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:08,894
But I thought he was
up to the dramatic challenge.

714
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:14,160
Muff, you were so lucky.
You could have been killed.

715
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,472
Well, I nearly did with Harve
over there.

716
01:21:18,817 --> 01:21:22,605
And who could have known
about the snake with Arch?

717
01:21:22,946 --> 01:21:26,143
But the paying guests
will know what they're in for

718
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:28,918
and the scenario
won't be so extreme.

719
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:33,852
I do regret some of the fake clues
that I put into the bedrooms

720
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:38,281
were taken a bit too seriously,
and I'm sorry about that.

721
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:42,702
But we had fun, didn't we?
Come on!

722
01:21:43,009 --> 01:21:46,524
I'll never forget this weekend
as long as I live.

723
01:21:46,846 --> 01:21:50,725
You're telling me. In the woods,
I nearly crapped my pants!

724
01:21:51,059 --> 01:21:54,654
What do you mean, nearly?
I was there, remember?

725
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,114
Arch, you browned your trousers?

726
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:03,227
Well, you know, I was...

727
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:07,285
It's all right, Arch.
They'll be out of the dryer soon.

728
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,911
Come here, you maniac.

729
01:22:23,802 --> 01:22:26,316
- What are you doing?
- Oh, sorry!

730
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,884
April Fool!
