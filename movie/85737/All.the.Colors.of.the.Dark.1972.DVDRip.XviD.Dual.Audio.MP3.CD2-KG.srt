1
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:31,212
Now you're one of us, Jane.

2
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:34,022
You can't turn your back on us any more!

3
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:42,996
Come, he's waiting for you.

4
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:53,027
No, this can't be real! It's horrible!

5
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,231
Careful what you say!

6
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:02,239
What have I done?

7
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:06,408
Did you drug me?

8
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,178
Or is it just a nightmare...

9
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:17,026
It's all a nightmare.

10
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,064
Where's Mary?

11
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:40,309
With us you won't be alone any
more! You belong to us forever, Jane.

12
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:43,980
Where is Mary? I want to see her!

13
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:48,556
As you wish. Mary wanted to be free.

14
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,728
Anyone who wants to go away
has to bring a new adept.

15
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:57,162
Mary brought you and now she's free.

16
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:00,632
Permanently.

17
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,835
Take care of her.

18
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,123
You were sleeping so soundly
that I didn't want to wake you.

19
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,100
See you tonight. I love
you very much. Richard.

20
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:57,603
Mary! It's not possible!
It couldn't be real!

21
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,096
Where's Mary?

22
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,334
She lives here! She must be here!

23
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,003
Sorry? How dare you barge into my home!

24
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,204
A woman named Mary
lives here... Where is she?

25
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:37,144
Look, I don't know who you are and
what you want, but I won't answer

26
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:42,523
anyone who barges into my house
like this! But... Are you all right?

27
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:53,794
It's OK... it's over. I'm sorry,
but I was here with a woman...

28
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:58,633
The same furniture... Everything... I
couldn't have dreamt it!

29
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,173
I had the furniture put in last
week, but I got here just last night.

30
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:10,910
Maybe you met a person from the
agency... they took care of everything...

31
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,821
Wait!

32
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:22,898
Here's the address, you can ask them.

33
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:28,227
Thanks. Sorry for my behavior
but... I had no way of knowing...

34
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:32,170
You can stay here a while if
you want until you feel better...

35
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,875
No thanks. I've bothered you enough.

36
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:23,550
Hi, love, how are you?
Unfortunately we went on until late.

37
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:31,967
I'll be there tomorrow morning... Hello?
It's me, Richard... What's going on?

38
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:36,529
Oh Richard! Come home!

39
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,300
Jane? What happened to you?

40
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,209
Come back Richard!

41
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:48,908
Sure, sure, with the first train... are
you listening? Say something!

42
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:55,249
I can't now... but everything will
be all right if you come back!

43
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:58,561
Stay home, don't move. Wait for me!

44
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:03,430
Ok, but hurry!

45
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,829
Doctor's Burton's office?

46
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,232
Sorry. I'm Barbara's sister. Is she in?
I tried her house but nobody's there.

47
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:23,246
Barbara's out of town. The Doctor
sent her to take care of a patient.

48
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,344
Wait! Don't hang up!

49
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:29,249
I'd like to speak with Dr. Burton.

50
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,276
Call tomorrow morning after 8 a.m.

51
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:38,454
It's very urgent... please! I'm Dr. Burton's
patient. I'm not well, I need help.

52
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,460
Ok, hold on.

53
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,760
Yes, can I help you?

54
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:50,073
A man like the one in my dream is
following me! But it's not a nightmare.

55
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,735
He's really here!
Please help me, doctor!

56
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:57,345
Calm down, Miss. Come to my office.
You can explain everything in person.

57
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,374
I'm scared, I'm scared to death!

58
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,409
Well, I'll send the nurse with my
car. She'll be there in ten minutes.

59
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,849
Now calm down and wait for her.

60
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,586
OK, but hurry up!

61
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:13,527
Ten minutes, Jane.

62
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:29,856
It looks like a cabalistic symbol; like
that used by the Jews to indicate God.

63
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,156
It was used in the Middle Ages

64
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:35,095
by the witches and charlatans
for their black magic rituals.

65
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:39,132
In that castle that
symbol was everywhere...

66
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,094
So I wasn't dreaming... I
really killed that woman!

67
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:48,199
Don't be in such a hurry!
Everything could be just a nightmare...

68
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:53,715
Like what happened tonight. You're
in a clear state of emotional shock

69
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,582
so it's impossible to judge how much
is just a figment of your imagination.

70
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:59,712
So this is just a hallucination as well?

71
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:07,991
No, Miss, believe me! The only
thing you need is dreamless sleep.

72
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:15,530
Take two of these pills and tomorrow
we can talk about all this calmly.

73
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:22,437
But I am calm, Doctor! OK, I'm not
calm, but I have no intention of sleeping.

74
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:26,077
You treat me like a
mythomaniac, like a madwoman!

75
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:32,678
No, don't say that! Trust me and
I'll get you out of this. I promise.

76
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:39,259
Don't send me away! I don't
want to go home without Richard!

77
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:42,793
No, sure. I'll bring
you to somewhere quiet.

78
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:54,374
Are you cold?

79
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,933
Yes, a little bit.

80
00:15:57,246 --> 00:16:00,113
Why does your husband
leave you alone so often?

81
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:06,485
You know... he works. He's a
salesman. He has to be on the road.

82
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:11,186
Any other problems between you and
him other than what you've said?

83
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:21,496
I don't know, money problems... sorry,
but indiscretion is part of my job.

84
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:46,325
This is my country house. It's closed
in winter. We're here in the summer.

85
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,489
Only the keepers are there now.

86
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,701
Good evening.

87
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:58,931
Let me introduce you to Mr. May. He
and his wife will be glad to help you.

88
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,202
It's my fault we're coming so late...

89
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,636
Don't worry Miss! You can get used to
it. I don't know if the Doctor told you.

90
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:12,553
Yes, don't worry about it. I think
you can find a room for tonight.

91
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,282
You're safe here. Unfortunately I
have to get back to my office now.

92
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:22,053
I have to check my notes for
a convention I'm going to.

93
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,426
Thanks, Doctor.

94
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:28,196
Call me tomorrow as soon as you wake
up. Tonight I'll be at my office.

95
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:33,432
OK, Goodnight.

96
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:18,612
There's a letter for you!

97
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,518
Nobody writes me...

98
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,921
To me neither! It's for my wife.

99
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,893
Stop it Boo Boo. We don't have
a chance with that man anyway!

100
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,354
Barbara? Is Jane with you?

101
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:59,817
Jane? No, I was out of town. I got
back at dawn. Why? What happened?

102
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:04,355
Last night I called and she was upset.
I don't know why. She wouldn't say.

103
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:08,697
You shouldn't leave her alone... Since
you don't believe in psychiatrists!

104
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:12,263
For God's sake Barbara! This is
no the time to make an issue of it!

105
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,468
Call your doctor and let me know as
soon as possible if he has any news!

106
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:16,443
OK. Don't worry.

107
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:34,322
Miss May?

108
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:50,585
He's here! He killed them!

109
00:23:51,186 --> 00:24:02,723
What are you saying, Miss? OK, I'm
on my way. Calm down... Right away!

110
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:08,900
Sorry, I have to go.

111
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:10,335
Doctor... if you know anything...

112
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:15,844
I don't, but there's nothing
to be worried about yet.

113
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:19,473
Maybe she left early this
morning... She'll be back soon.

114
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,647
Wait a second...

115
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,284
It was your sister on the phone.

116
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,054
I understood that. What did she want?

117
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:36,126
She was scared. She's afraid
of being killed. I thought

118
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:39,965
it was better not to tell him
the truth. I don't like that man.

119
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,797
Maybe it's just a feeling,
but I don't trust him at all.

120
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:49,100
When Jane was with me she was
fine. Maybe he's the one who...

121
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:55,713
I don't know. Let me get to your sister.
After, we'll see what can be done.

122
00:24:56,785 --> 00:25:00,687
But he has a right to know.
Try to make up something.

123
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:26,604
You can't repudiate us Jane! You
should have understood that by now!

124
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:36,313
Look at this knife... You recognize it?
It's the one that killed your mother...

125
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,251
Your mother tried to leave us years
ago. It's the one you killed Mary with!

126
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:52,527
No it's not true!

127
00:26:55,337 --> 00:27:01,503
You've crossed the borders of
reality, Jane. You can't go back.

128
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:04,036
Now the truth is within you!

129
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:06,672
Go away, damn you! Go away!

130
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:17,682
So you have to die! It's the only
way to leave us... And you know it.

131
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:36,233
There's no escape now! You belong to us!

132
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:29,554
Doctor! Doctor Burton!

133
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:51,641
You have a mark on your skin... but
you've a deeper mark on your heart

134
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:58,715
in your flesh and in your
blood... like your mother!

135
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:02,391
Stop!

136
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,943
Who is it?

137
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:37,576
It's me.

138
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:50,220
What do you want?

139
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:55,366
So you know!

140
00:31:55,837 --> 00:31:57,304
Yes.

141
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,698
How?

142
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:02,537
You shouldn't have shown
yourself naked that day.

143
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,006
What do you mean?

144
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:10,550
People marked like you shouldn't
ever show their naked bodies...

145
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:19,022
I wanted you to see me! I couldn't
allow that hysterical woman to take you!

146
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:29,560
You don't need that woman, you
need me! Look at me Richard!

147
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:41,873
I'm yours Richard... and you've always
known it. Don't worry about Jane...

148
00:32:42,217 --> 00:32:50,022
She'll understand someday... She never
gave you anything... she couldn't.

149
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:58,756
She had to pay for
our mother's betrayal.

150
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:05,805
The roots of our faith lie far away.

151
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:09,275
You can be part of us if you want.

152
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:14,045
You won't be a useless salesman
going traveling from door to door.

153
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:21,616
You'll become whatever you want.
We're much stronger than you imagine.

154
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,512
This explains why you
wanted to get rid of Jane.

155
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:25,112
I'd like to have a word with that woman...

156
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:27,754
I'm sorry, Officer, but they're
administrating a sedative.

157
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,015
Just few seconds...

158
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:32,356
It's better she rests... She
can't listen to you now.

159
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,672
Jane? Do you hear me?

160
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,012
They didn't want me
to come in but I did.

161
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:03,716
We must escape Richard!
That man came back!

162
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:08,491
He's here, I've seen him!
Oh Richard... take me away!

163
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:15,499
OK, hold on to me. We'll go out
the main door... Nobody will stop us.

164
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:18,538
Get dressed!

165
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,284
C'mon... hold onto me.

166
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:50,766
Damn! They must have left
the door open. Wait here.

167
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:28,128
Help that woman.

168
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:38,671
You take care of the body.

169
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,545
What happened?

170
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:42,913
That woman... it seems
she killed her husband.

171
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,288
Make way...

172
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:51,414
A mysterious case...

173
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,085
Officer! Is that woman the killer?

174
00:37:55,063 --> 00:37:57,031
Just some info...

175
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:48,608
Jane? Do you hear me? Answer me!

176
00:38:57,825 --> 00:39:01,625
At last! The officer let me see you.

177
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,763
I don't know what's
real any more! Richard...

178
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:18,242
Maybe I'm dreaming right now and
you're not here... You're not here!

179
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:22,848
No Miss, you weren't dreaming.
But it's all over now!

180
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:31,551
George Harris, Glenda Scott, David
Means, Mark Corgan, Recognize 'em?

181
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:41,265
Betty Ryan, Sylvester Cole,
Clelia Morgan, also known as Mary.

182
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:47,197
Ex actress, but most of
all drug pusher and addict.

183
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:51,575
We thought she was dead years
ago but her body's been found

184
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:54,740
in the cellar of the castle
with the other victims.

185
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,782
What happened to the others?

186
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:03,117
In jail, except, of course, for the
dead ones, the story turns your stomach.

187
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:09,662
Unfortunately we're still missing
Gerald McBrian, the High Priest

188
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:13,232
a regular at all the asylums
for the criminally insane...

189
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:15,196
But don't worry, we'll catch him!

190
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:16,463
What about Barbara?

191
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:21,031
Barbara committed suicide. She was
the diabolical mind behind the sect.

192
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,875
She exploited their rites
for her own criminal purposes.

193
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:27,772
Send Clay in.

194
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:31,679
It seems the man who killed your
mother died months ago in New Zealand

195
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:35,620
and named you and your sister
heirs to a decent fortune.

196
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:38,924
The lawyer will tell you the details.

197
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:47,630
Good morning. I called you, Miss,
but you didn't come to the meeting.

198
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:53,236
I have also written to you... it was
easier to get in touch with your sister

199
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:56,737
but I also needed your consent.

200
00:40:56,944 --> 00:41:01,813
We're talking about 300,000
pounds. Here's the will.

201
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:07,251
Now that my sister's committed
suicide... Do I get her share?

202
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:09,186
Of course.

203
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:13,151
So... lf I were dead...

204
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:15,252
Everything would have
gone to your sister.

205
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:30,207
Today we begin to look for another
house. What about Buckingham Palace?

206
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:59,833
Elevator! Damn! They left
the door open. Wait for me here.

207
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:24,560
Oh my God! I've already lived
this moment... Richard, stop!

208
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:43,110
You killed Barbara! You must die!

209
00:44:29,457 --> 00:44:34,451
You killed Barbara... l've always
known that... I don't know why...

210
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:42,401
Like now, when I knew that man would
try to kill you in the elevator.

211
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:52,675
Oh Richard! I'm scared of not
being myself any more... Help me!
