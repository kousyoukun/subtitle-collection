1
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,147
Jane!

2
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,070
You didn't take your pills again...

3
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,818
C'mon... be a good girl... drink up.

4
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,241
And now try and get some sleep.

5
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,440
Please, Richard, stay here with me.

6
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,038
I have to be in Oxford
at 10 in the morning.

7
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,279
I have to check out all the
forms... l'll be busy for a while.

8
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,815
No Richard! Please, don't leave, please!

9
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,901
Ok, I'll wait here
until you fall asleep.

10
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,840
I can't! I can't!

11
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,149
Jane! Please Jane, look at me!

12
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,725
Oh Richard, help me, please!

13
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,023
C'mon Jane... calm down!

14
00:08:55,368 --> 00:09:01,796
No thanks... Oh damn, it's late!
I'm missing the 8:40 train.

15
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,341
I'm very sorry to leave you alone.

16
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,241
Barbara's supposed to call me later...

17
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,613
I bet she'll tell you about
her psychiatrist again!

18
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,776
She thinks he could help me...

19
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,224
Sure! He's a quack like all the
others, always spouting Freud.

20
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,090
Trying to pull you in
with the same old nonsense!

21
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,495
You shouldn't talk like
that about Dr. Burton.

22
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:33,597
After all Barbara works with him and
if she appreciates him, it means that...

23
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,731
Oh, sure. I have no
problems with your sister

24
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:41,777
but please Jane, leave
psychoanalysis out of it!

25
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,077
But Richard... you don't know what
happens to me when I'm sleeping!

26
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:51,746
It's just weakness. Your body is
still weak after the operation.

27
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:57,195
You don't think I know how you
feel about losing your baby?

28
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:07,998
The baby was also mine
and I suffered too!

29
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,809
Goodbye dear... come back soon!

30
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:33,459
Goodnight, love. It
was a fantastic evening.

31
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,294
All the same Richard should be grateful
to you. If you hadn't helped him

32
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:09,562
with that psycho-technical exam,
he would never have got his job.

33
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,438
Obviously he holds me responsible
for what happened after that...

34
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,938
What do you mean?

35
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,373
Having introduced him to you.
What's the stuff he gives to you?

36
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,841
A concentration of vitamins. I
feel sick when I take them but...

37
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,944
I think Richard takes
himself too seriously.

38
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,916
After all he's just a pharmaceutical
salesman, not a doctor.

39
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,017
Don't judge him badly.
He just wants to help me.

40
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,925
Giving you all those vitamins?

41
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:42,396
Taking so many vitamins without
medical supervision could be dangerous.

42
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:49,731
I don't know what to do... I know he
loves me, but he can't understand me.

43
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:55,306
Day after day, it's like
I'm falling into a pit.

44
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:59,783
This is nonsense, Jane! You
need a good psychiatrist.

45
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,583
That's why I set up an
appointment with Dr. Burton

46
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,860
Sit down dear, he'll
see you in a minute.

47
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,314
Jane, come in.

48
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,530
That woman was your mother?

49
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,497
Yes.

50
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,195
How old were you?

51
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,897
Five.

52
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,771
I don't know if you know
this, but you began treatment

53
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,539
right where it usually ends.

54
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,015
That is, from the trauma you
suffered during childhood.

55
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,142
Don't you think this is a good sign?

56
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,847
I'd like to believe you,
but is that really the case?

57
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:22,157
It's only an interview. Ever spoken
with your husband about this problem?

58
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,364
Well... Richard isn't... Richard
and I aren't married yet.

59
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:31,262
And that stops you
from confiding in him?

60
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:36,098
No but... you see, he wouldn't understand.

61
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,506
In his opinion everything comes
from the car accident that...

62
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,877
...where I lost my baby.

63
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,743
Stillborn?

64
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,043
Yes.

65
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:53,089
And from that moment you couldn't
have full sexual relations, right?

66
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:59,588
Yes, that's right, but it isn't
the car accident, or even the memory

67
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:04,194
of the baby that stops
me. It's the other thing.

68
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,669
The man with the knife?

69
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:11,438
Yes, but how can I tell that to Richard?

70
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:17,607
He'd probably end up hating me. His
life with me is already so difficult...

71
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,650
and I don't want to lose
him. I have to get better.

72
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,957
Are you afraid of the dark?

73
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,662
No.

74
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:35,430
Tell me, have you ever felt
you were living out your dreams?

75
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:42,539
Yes. In the waiting room, there
was a man... your patient I suppose.

76
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,748
He looked at me with the same
eyes that are in my nightmare.

77
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,681
Are you really sure?

78
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,683
He was sitting in the other room!

79
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:02,785
I'm sorry to contradict you, but I
never have my patients wait together.

80
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,959
Come with me please.

81
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:16,639
But... he was here. I'm
sure of that. He's gone.

82
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,405
Apparently.

83
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,307
You saw him, right? He was
here, sitting in this armchair.

84
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:28,153
Yes, sure. He asked for you, but
he wasn't one of your patients.

85
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,452
I told him to wait. Maybe
he was tired of waiting.

86
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,227
I must apologize, Miss. You
were right, there was someone.

87
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,492
However, the point is that, whoever
he was, you were scared of him.

88
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,125
In our next meeting we must
find out why that happened.

89
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,302
When can I come back, Doctor?

90
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,701
Barbara will take care
of the appointment.

91
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:52,470
For the moment I suggest that you
stop taking your husband's vitamins.

92
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,704
You are not ill by any means. You
must convince yourself of that.

93
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,908
Your worst enemy is loneliness.

94
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,614
Consider yourself neither crazy
nor someone who's seeing things.

95
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,452
Real madmen never think
of themselves as crazy.

96
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:21,012
What do you want from me!

97
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,749
Excuse me.

98
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,687
I can open the door if you want.

99
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,499
After you. I live on
the top floor, and you?

100
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:16,700
I live on the third floor, thanks. I've
only been here a few days. I'm Mary.

101
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,710
I'm Jane. Nice to meet you.

102
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,313
I've been living here for three
months and I hardly know anyone.

103
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,482
Here in the city it's
hard to make friends.

104
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,314
We people from the suburbs
haven't learned not to be nosy yet.

105
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,818
Would you like some tea? Tea
for me is still a social ritual

106
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,518
I hate having it alone.

107
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,290
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't.

108
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,888
Waiting for someone?

109
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,593
You're very kind, but my husband
is tired when he gets home from work

110
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,896
and I have to make dinner.

111
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,929
Well I don't want to force you,
but it's early. It's only 5 o'clock!

112
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,168
Ok, I'll have some tea.

113
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,413
Make yourself at home.

114
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,616
Don't stand there, come in.

115
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,719
At the door you seemed
very scared, am I right?

116
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,126
It's true. Someone
was following me here.

117
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,395
Me, I'm scared of the time when
men won't follow me any more!

118
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,336
How do you know he was a man?

119
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,433
Men have been following
women since the world began.

120
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,506
With or without a club.

121
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,548
It's very nice here. How
did you fix it up so quickly?

122
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:39,354
It was already like this. I prefer them
already furnished. I just add the mess.

123
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,288
More cookies?

124
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,054
No thanks, I have to go.

125
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,860
I'd like to prepare something fro
Richard that's not out of a can.

126
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,730
Mary, why don't you come have
dinner with us? I'd like that.

127
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,870
Absolutely not! I don't want to
come between a couple of newlyweds.

128
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,437
Ok. See you tomorrow. Richard
goes to work and I'm all alone.

129
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,908
Would you like have lunch together?

130
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,503
Sure. Here at my place.

131
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:06,306
I can even make something
that's not out of a can.

132
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,476
We could go shopping together... OK?

133
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,457
Right. So... l'll see you
at 10 tomorrow morning.

134
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,817
Yes, thanks. Bye, Mary.

135
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,602
Hello?

136
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,645
Miss Jane Harrison?

137
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,179
Yes, who's speaking?

138
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,777
I'm Franciscus Clay, a
lawyer. I must see you.

139
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:41,978
See me?

140
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:48,650
Yes. Can you come to my
office tomorrow at 3:30?

141
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,752
Wait a second...

142
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:54,230
The address is Rolands House 5

143
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,459
So I'll expect you.

144
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,263
But... what about? Hello?

145
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,205
The eggs!

146
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,558
Jane! What's going on?

147
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,399
Good evening.

148
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:29,749
I would have preferred you ask my
advice before taking her to Dr. Burton.

149
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:34,157
I don't believe in psychoanalysis.
I've never seen anybody come out cured.

150
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,486
On the contrary I think it's just a way

151
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,623
of convincing people that the
world is populated only by madmen.

152
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,791
Go on... your logic is amusing.

153
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,442
You should take less care of Jane
and more of yourself, Barbara.

154
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,383
Sorry, could you pass me the
dress on the chair please?

155
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,316
Why do you hide yourself
under this stuff?

156
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,522
You surprise me, Richard. Think I can
still take your compliments seriously?

157
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,601
This time it's not even so you can get

158
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,899
a good recommendation
for a lousy salesman job.

159
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,062
You've never forgiven
me for that, have you?

160
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,035
Janet will continue with Dr. Burton
with or without your permission.

161
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,405
Have you ever asked yourself why
Janet hasn't agreed to marry you yet?

162
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,709
I've thought about it for a long time.

163
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,414
And I'm sure it's partly your
fault too. You treat her like a baby

164
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,582
who still can't make
a decision on her own.

165
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:47,793
Jane is still a slave to her
childhood. Maybe that's also my fault

166
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,699
but at the moment you don't give her
the reassurance she's looking for.

167
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,865
You and your stupid
psychoanalysis books!

168
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,767
Why are you blaming other
people for what's your fault?

169
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,070
It's all your fault even
according to your own crude logic!

170
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:06,041
If you hadn't hit that tree with your
car, Janet wouldn't have problems now!

171
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:15,221
I often walk in this
park. I like the solitude.

172
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,491
Hear the birds? They are
complaining about our being here.

173
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,198
They're very resentful, you know.

174
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:29,097
Not as much as men are. This
might sound strange to you, Mary

175
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,139
but I'm sure that someone is
chasing me. Someone coming very deep

176
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:38,809
from my childhood. Do you
believe in that sort of thing?

177
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,449
I believe in a lot more.

178
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,229
Don't worry about it... c'mon!

179
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,831
I had my problems too, not like
yours, but maybe more serious.

180
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,869
But I got rid of them.

181
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,373
How?

182
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,273
Do you know what a Black Mass is?

183
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,134
You're scaring me...

184
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,545
It makes sense to be afraid
sometimes. You have to find it

185
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:15,643
and it'll disappear.
But... what do you want from me?

186
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,382
Me?

187
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,884
See? You look like a scared
little baby without her mom.

188
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,289
Do you really want to get well?

189
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,424
It's all I want.

190
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:34,503
Don't think about psychiatrists
anymore. I know the right person for you.

191
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,301
Who?

192
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:42,268
My friends don't like questions. The
just want trust. They're waiting for you.

193
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,709
When?

194
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,980
Do you really want to come?

195
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,478
When?

196
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,618
Even tonight if you want...

197
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,956
I have a meeting with a
lawyer who called me yesterday.

198
00:29:55,326 --> 00:30:00,229
Make sure to be back home at
5.30. I'll be out at the door.

199
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:38,683
Why so late? What happened? We
can't be so late getting there.

200
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,320
But... what's the matter?

201
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:47,159
That man I was talking
about... he tried to...

202
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,656
Rape you?

203
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,366
Kill me!

204
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:56,061
I think it's better put off for
another time... let's go to my house.

205
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,976
No... l'm afraid I'm going crazy!
Let's go where you wanted, right now.

206
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,809
But you drive. I couldn't.

207
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,440
Ok.

208
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,383
Oh Richard, my love, my dear love!

209
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,157
Now everything's like before, Jane.

210
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,363
Yes but... I don't know... lt
doesn't seem real to me...

211
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,874
And me? Do you think I'm real?

212
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:55,191
Tomorrow I'll take the day off. We'll
go out to lunch. Would you like that?

213
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,720
When I told Barbara that I'm not
going to Burton anymore she hung up.

214
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:03,156
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Sorry, I have to phone a client.

215
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:45,281
You're here! Can you tell
me what happened to you?

216
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:56,830
What are you hiding behind you?
So now you rummage in my books...

217
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,960
And you? You read this stuff now?

218
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:04,905
I bought it in a used bookstore. Could
you explain why you ran away like that?

219
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,170
And where were you?

220
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,613
The phone was broken. I had a phone
meeting with a client in Liverpool.

221
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,879
I had to call him from another phone
nearby... what's so odd about that?

222
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,318
Nothing... nothing...

223
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:45,340
Welcome back, Jane.
We were expecting you.

224
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:54,583
She offers herself to you!
Free from her fears... forever!

225
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,004
You're free Jane.

226
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:04,778
Now that woman doesn't exist
any more. She gave you to us.

227
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,449
Now she's free not to exist.

228
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,248
No, Mary!

229
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:54,061
It's time to say goodbye Jane. Be happy!

230
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:59,037
No, Mary, I don't want to!

231
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,433
Now you're one of us, Jane.

232
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,243
You can't turn your back on us any more!

233
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,217
Come, he's waiting for you.

234
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:27,248
No, this can't be real! It's horrible!

235
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:31,452
Careful what you say!

236
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,460
What have I done?

237
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,629
Did you drug me?

238
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,399
Or is it just a nightmare...

239
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:51,247
It's all a nightmare.

240
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,285
Where's Mary?

241
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:14,530
With us you won't be alone any
more! You belong to us forever, Jane.

242
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,201
Where is Mary? I want to see her!

243
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,777
As you wish. Mary wanted to be free.

244
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,949
Anyone who wants to go away
has to bring a new adept.

245
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:31,383
Mary brought you and now she's free.

246
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,853
Permanently.

247
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,056
Take care of her.

248
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,344
You were sleeping so soundly
that I didn't want to wake you.

249
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,321
See you tonight. I love
you very much. Richard.

250
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:31,824
Mary! It's not possible!
It couldn't be real!

251
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,317
Where's Mary?

252
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,555
She lives here! She must be here!

253
00:54:54,991 --> 00:55:00,224
Sorry? How dare you barge into my home!

254
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,425
A woman named Mary
lives here... Where is she?

255
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:11,365
Look, I don't know who you are and
what you want, but I won't answer

256
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:16,744
anyone who barges into my house
like this! But... Are you all right?

257
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:28,015
It's OK... it's over. I'm sorry,
but I was here with a woman...

258
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:32,854
The same furniture... Everything... I
couldn't have dreamt it!

259
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,394
I had the furniture put in last
week, but I got here just last night.

260
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:45,131
Maybe you met a person from the
agency... they took care of everything...

261
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,042
Wait!

262
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,119
Here's the address, you can ask them.

263
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:02,448
Thanks. Sorry for my behavior
but... I had no way of knowing...

264
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:06,391
You can stay here a while if
you want until you feel better...

265
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,096
No thanks. I've bothered you enough.

266
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,771
Hi, love, how are you?
Unfortunately we went on until late.

267
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:06,188
I'll be there tomorrow morning... Hello?
It's me, Richard... What's going on?

268
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:10,750
Oh Richard! Come home!

269
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,521
Jane? What happened to you?

270
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,430
Come back Richard!

271
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:23,129
Sure, sure, with the first train... are
you listening? Say something!

272
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:29,470
I can't now... but everything will
be all right if you come back!

273
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,782
Stay home, don't move. Wait for me!

274
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:37,651
Ok, but hurry!

275
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,050
Doctor's Burton's office?

276
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:51,453
Sorry. I'm Barbara's sister. Is she in?
I tried her house but nobody's there.

277
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:57,467
Barbara's out of town. The Doctor
sent her to take care of a patient.

278
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,565
Wait! Don't hang up!

279
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:03,470
I'd like to speak with Dr. Burton.

280
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,497
Call tomorrow morning after 8 a.m.

281
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:12,675
It's very urgent... please! I'm Dr. Burton's
patient. I'm not well, I need help.

282
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,681
Ok, hold on.

283
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,981
Yes, can I help you?

284
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:24,294
A man like the one in my dream is
following me! But it's not a nightmare.

285
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,956
He's really here!
Please help me, doctor!

286
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:31,566
Calm down, Miss. Come to my office.
You can explain everything in person.

287
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,595
I'm scared, I'm scared to death!

288
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,630
Well, I'll send the nurse with my
car. She'll be there in ten minutes.

289
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,070
Now calm down and wait for her.

290
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,807
OK, but hurry up!

291
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:47,748
Ten minutes, Jane.

292
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:04,077
It looks like a cabalistic symbol; like
that used by the Jews to indicate God.

293
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,377
It was used in the Middle Ages

294
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,316
by the witches and charlatans
for their black magic rituals.

295
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,353
In that castle that
symbol was everywhere...

296
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:17,315
So I wasn't dreaming... I
really killed that woman!

297
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:22,420
Don't be in such a hurry!
Everything could be just a nightmare...

298
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:27,936
Like what happened tonight. You're
in a clear state of emotional shock

299
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,803
so it's impossible to judge how much
is just a figment of your imagination.

300
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,933
So this is just a hallucination as well?

301
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:42,212
No, Miss, believe me! The only
thing you need is dreamless sleep.

302
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:49,751
Take two of these pills and tomorrow
we can talk about all this calmly.

303
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:56,658
But I am calm, Doctor! OK, I'm not
calm, but I have no intention of sleeping.

304
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,298
You treat me like a
mythomaniac, like a madwoman!

305
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:06,899
No, don't say that! Trust me and
I'll get you out of this. I promise.

306
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:13,480
Don't send me away! I don't
want to go home without Richard!

307
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:17,014
No, sure. I'll bring
you to somewhere quiet.

308
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,595
Are you cold?

309
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,154
Yes, a little bit.

310
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,334
Why does your husband
leave you alone so often?

311
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:40,706
You know... he works. He's a
salesman. He has to be on the road.

312
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:45,407
Any other problems between you and
him other than what you've said?

313
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:55,717
I don't know, money problems... sorry,
but indiscretion is part of my job.

314
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:20,546
This is my country house. It's closed
in winter. We're here in the summer.

315
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,710
Only the keepers are there now.

316
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,922
Good evening.

317
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:33,152
Let me introduce you to Mr. May. He
and his wife will be glad to help you.

318
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,423
It's my fault we're coming so late...

319
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,857
Don't worry Miss! You can get used to
it. I don't know if the Doctor told you.

320
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:46,774
Yes, don't worry about it. I think
you can find a room for tonight.

321
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:51,503
You're safe here. Unfortunately I
have to get back to my office now.

322
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:56,274
I have to check my notes for
a convention I'm going to.

323
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,647
Thanks, Doctor.

324
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:02,417
Call me tomorrow as soon as you wake
up. Tonight I'll be at my office.

325
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,653
OK, Goodnight.

326
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,833
There's a letter for you!

327
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,739
Nobody writes me...

328
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,142
To me neither! It's for my wife.

329
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:05,114
Stop it Boo Boo. We don't have
a chance with that man anyway!

330
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,575
Barbara? Is Jane with you?

331
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:34,038
Jane? No, I was out of town. I got
back at dawn. Why? What happened?

332
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:38,576
Last night I called and she was upset.
I don't know why. She wouldn't say.

333
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:42,918
You shouldn't leave her alone... Since
you don't believe in psychiatrists!

334
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:46,484
For God's sake Barbara! This is
no the time to make an issue of it!

335
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,689
Call your doctor and let me know as
soon as possible if he has any news!

336
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,664
OK. Don't worry.

337
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:08,543
Miss May?

338
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,806
He's here! He killed them!

339
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:36,944
What are you saying, Miss? OK, I'm
on my way. Calm down... Right away!

340
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,121
Sorry, I have to go.

341
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,556
Doctor... if you know anything...

342
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:50,065
I don't, but there's nothing
to be worried about yet.

343
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:53,694
Maybe she left early this
morning... She'll be back soon.

344
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,868
Wait a second...

345
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,505
It was your sister on the phone.

346
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,275
I understood that. What did she want?

347
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,347
She was scared. She's afraid
of being killed. I thought

348
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:14,186
it was better not to tell him
the truth. I don't like that man.

349
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:19,018
Maybe it's just a feeling,
but I don't trust him at all.

350
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:23,321
When Jane was with me she was
fine. Maybe he's the one who...

351
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:29,934
I don't know. Let me get to your sister.
After, we'll see what can be done.

352
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:34,908
But he has a right to know.
Try to make up something.

353
01:14:54,022 --> 01:15:00,825
You can't repudiate us Jane! You
should have understood that by now!

354
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:10,534
Look at this knife... You recognize it?
It's the one that killed your mother...

355
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:17,472
Your mother tried to leave us years
ago. It's the one you killed Mary with!

356
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:26,748
No it's not true!

357
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:35,724
You've crossed the borders of
reality, Jane. You can't go back.

358
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,257
Now the truth is within you!

359
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,893
Go away, damn you! Go away!

360
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:51,903
So you have to die! It's the only
way to leave us... And you know it.

361
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:10,454
There's no escape now! You belong to us!

362
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:03,775
Doctor! Doctor Burton!

363
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:25,862
You have a mark on your skin... but
you've a deeper mark on your heart

364
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:32,936
in your flesh and in your
blood... like your mother!

365
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,612
Stop!

366
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:10,164
Who is it?

367
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,797
It's me.

368
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,441
What do you want?

369
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,587
So you know!

370
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,525
Yes.

371
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:33,919
How?

372
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,758
You shouldn't have shown
yourself naked that day.

373
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,227
What do you mean?

374
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:44,771
People marked like you shouldn't
ever show their naked bodies...

375
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:53,243
I wanted you to see me! I couldn't
allow that hysterical woman to take you!

376
01:20:56,284 --> 01:21:03,781
You don't need that woman, you
need me! Look at me Richard!

377
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:16,094
I'm yours Richard... and you've always
known it. Don't worry about Jane...

378
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:24,243
She'll understand someday... She never
gave you anything... she couldn't.

379
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:32,977
She had to pay for
our mother's betrayal.

380
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:40,026
The roots of our faith lie far away.

381
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:43,496
You can be part of us if you want.

382
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:48,266
You won't be a useless salesman
going traveling from door to door.

383
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:55,837
You'll become whatever you want.
We're much stronger than you imagine.

384
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,733
This explains why you
wanted to get rid of Jane.

385
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,333
I'd like to have a word with that woman...

386
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,975
I'm sorry, Officer, but they're
administrating a sedative.

387
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,236
Just few seconds...

388
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:06,577
It's better she rests... She
can't listen to you now.

389
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,893
Jane? Do you hear me?

390
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:34,233
They didn't want me
to come in but I did.

391
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,937
We must escape Richard!
That man came back!

392
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:42,712
He's here, I've seen him!
Oh Richard... take me away!

393
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:49,720
OK, hold on to me. We'll go out
the main door... Nobody will stop us.

394
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,759
Get dressed!

395
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:09,505
C'mon... hold onto me.

396
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,987
Damn! They must have left
the door open. Wait here.

397
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:02,349
Help that woman.

398
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,892
You take care of the body.

399
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,766
What happened?

400
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,134
That woman... it seems
she killed her husband.

401
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,509
Make way...

402
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,635
A mysterious case...

403
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:28,306
Officer! Is that woman the killer?

404
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,252
Just some info...

405
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,829
Jane? Do you hear me? Answer me!

406
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:35,846
At last! The officer let me see you.

407
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:43,984
I don't know what's
real any more! Richard...

408
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:52,463
Maybe I'm dreaming right now and
you're not here... You're not here!

409
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:57,069
No Miss, you weren't dreaming.
But it's all over now!

410
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:05,772
George Harris, Glenda Scott, David
Means, Mark Corgan, Recognize 'em?

411
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:15,486
Betty Ryan, Sylvester Cole,
Clelia Morgan, also known as Mary.

412
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:21,418
Ex actress, but most of
all drug pusher and addict.

413
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,796
We thought she was dead years
ago but her body's been found

414
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,961
in the cellar of the castle
with the other victims.

415
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,003
What happened to the others?

416
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:37,338
In jail, except, of course, for the
dead ones, the story turns your stomach.

417
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:43,883
Unfortunately we're still missing
Gerald McBrian, the High Priest

418
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:47,453
a regular at all the asylums
for the criminally insane...

419
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:49,417
But don't worry, we'll catch him!

420
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,684
What about Barbara?

421
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:55,252
Barbara committed suicide. She was
the diabolical mind behind the sect.

422
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:59,096
She exploited their rites
for her own criminal purposes.

423
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:01,993
Send Clay in.

424
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:05,900
It seems the man who killed your
mother died months ago in New Zealand

425
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:09,841
and named you and your sister
heirs to a decent fortune.

426
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:13,145
The lawyer will tell you the details.

427
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:21,851
Good morning. I called you, Miss,
but you didn't come to the meeting.

428
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:27,457
I have also written to you... it was
easier to get in touch with your sister

429
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,958
but I also needed your consent.

430
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:36,034
We're talking about 300,000
pounds. Here's the will.

431
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:41,472
Now that my sister's committed
suicide... Do I get her share?

432
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:43,407
Of course.

433
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,372
So... lf I were dead...

434
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,473
Everything would have
gone to your sister.

435
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:04,428
Today we begin to look for another
house. What about Buckingham Palace?

436
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:34,054
Elevator! Damn! They left
the door open. Wait for me here.

437
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:58,781
Oh my God! I've already lived
this moment... Richard, stop!

438
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:17,331
You killed Barbara! You must die!

439
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:08,672
You killed Barbara... l've always
known that... I don't know why...

440
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:16,622
Like now, when I knew that man would
try to kill you in the elevator.

441
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:26,896
Oh Richard! I'm scared of not
being myself any more... Help me!
