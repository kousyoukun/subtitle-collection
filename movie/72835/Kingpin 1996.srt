1
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,022
All set, Charlie.

2
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,399
Hey, Pa!

3
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,699
Whoa.

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,800
Hey, Pa, you got time for
a game before supper?

5
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,045
Go get your ball.
I'll meet you out back.

6
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,055
Okay, Roy.

7
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,551
Come on, I want to see
some smoke on this one.

8
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,475
- Whoa! Okay!
- Yeah!

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,658
Son, you put that in a bottle,

10
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,232
you got something
sweeter than Yoo-hoo.

11
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,741
Whoa! Beauty!

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,751
You got a great gift, Son.

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,296
It's as if angels
came down from heaven

14
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:31,549
and put a blessing on your
three bowling digits.

15
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,386
You can apply everything that
I've taught you about bowling

16
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,346
to your daily life.

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,725
And if you do that,
you're gonna be decent,

18
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,685
you're gonna be moral,

19
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,339
you're gonna be a good man.

20
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,415
Well, all set, guys.

21
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,641
Can you believe this?

22
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,894
Me on the professional bowling tour?

23
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,218
It's your calling, Son.

24
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,484
One day, when people
say the name "Munson,"

25
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,320
they're gonna think "winner."

26
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,323
Just like DiMaggio is to baseball,

27
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,567
or Unitas is to football.

28
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,578
That's what Munson
will be to bowling.

29
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,621
- That's right, Roy.
- Yeah, Roy.

30
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,571
I hope so, Dad.
I want to make you proud.

31
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,085
Hey, Roy.

32
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,506
Maybe you can get this
old piece of crap working,

33
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,384
or if you get in a pinch,

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,664
maybe you'll get a
couple of bucks for it.

35
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,007
Thanks, Dad.

36
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,607
You go get them, Son.

37
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,260
I will.

38
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,089
It all comes down to this roll.

39
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,550
Roy Munson, a man-child,

40
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,137
with a dream to topple bowling
giant, Ernie McCracken.

41
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,088
If he strikes, he's the
1979 Odor-Eaters champion.

42
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,728
He's got one foot in the frying pan
and one in the pressure cooker.

43
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,647
Believe me, as a bowler, I know,

44
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,902
that right about now your bladder feels
like an overstuffed vacuum cleaner bag,

45
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,281
and your butt is kind of like
an about-to-explode bratwurst.

46
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,811
Hey! Do you mind? I wasn't
talking when you were bowling.

47
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,280
Was I talking out loud?

48
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,574
Was I?

49
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,285
Sorry.

50
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,198
Good luck.

51
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,455
Yeah!

52
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,570
Munson! Munson!

53
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:06,225
Munson! Munson! Munson! Munson!

54
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,529
Big problem, my friend.

55
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,661
- Engine blown.
- Engine blown?

56
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,007
Someone put sugar in your tank.

57
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,760
- Sugar? That's impossible.
- Here. Here. Sugar.

58
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,847
Maybe it's the bad kids around here.

59
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,851
- How much is it gonna cost to fix?
- $2,000.

60
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,880
$2,000? That's gonna wipe me out.

61
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,484
I'm sorry. Did I wake you, Fatima?

62
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,889
- Ethyl supreme. Top it off, please.
- Right away.

63
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,991
Watch the door.

64
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,077
Hey, pinhead, juice the
tires for me, will you?

65
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,823
Today. Oh, Roy.
Didn't expect to see you so soon.

66
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:01,238
- Hi, Mr. McCracken.
- Hey, call me Ernie or Big Ern, huh?

67
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,508
For a young bowler like yourself,
the tour can be very difficult.

68
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,093
Very expensive.

69
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,178
Tanqueray and Tab.

70
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,472
Keep them coming, sweets.
I got a long drive.

71
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,307
Do me a favor, will you?

72
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,516
Would you mind washing
off that perfume

73
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,811
before you come back to our table?

74
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:23,264
A little bad luck, like you had here today,
all of your dreams can go up in smoke.

75
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,487
That's why even we veteran bowlers,

76
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,114
we work our way,
tournament to tournament.

77
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,859
We need the supplemental income.

78
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,411
Supplemental income?

79
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,622
- Supplemental.
- Supplemental.

80
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,742
Yeah, it's extra.
That's what it means.

81
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,627
You interested?

82
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,712
- Interested?
- Interested.

83
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,117
Would you be interested
in some extra income?

84
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,760
Extra income?

85
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,129
Want to make more money?

86
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,795
Okay.

87
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,888
Why don't you go eat that outside
and then come on back in?

88
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,111
- Hi.
- Hello.

89
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,764
Not you.

90
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,231
- Hi.
- Hi.

91
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,211
God, do people actually bowl here?

92
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,840
They live here. They die here.
They get their mail here.

93
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,496
I don't know about this, Mr. McCracken.
Something doesn't seem right.

94
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,336
Well, it takes guts to say no, kid.
You got a lot of courage.

95
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,644
I don't think I could
call my mommy and daddy

96
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,273
and tell them I didn't have what
it takes to make it on the tour.

97
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,442
All right, let's get going.

98
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,778
Better call them before they
go to sleep. Come on, hurry up.

99
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,353
- All right.
- Nice flip-flop. Way to go.

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,751
Two more for me and my friend here.

101
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,794
I got it in the nose.

102
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,448
Here, just take it out of that.

103
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,299
Say there, buddy,

104
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,203
you gonna buy the beers
or the whole place?

105
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,970
No, I...

106
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,264
This is just my bonus.
I had a good month.

107
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,640
A good month.

108
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,311
This punk shattered
my monthly record.

109
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,147
I had the entire company
record, 21%. Just shattered.

110
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,815
Look at this bonus they gave him.

111
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,763
What do you fellows sell?

112
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,069
- Dictionaries.
- Dictionaries.

113
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,222
Yeah. Door to door.

114
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,744
Hey, what do you say,
we play a couple of games?

115
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,662
- Maybe 20 bucks a game?
- Oh, no.

116
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,332
No, you're not gonna
bowl drunk again.

117
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,750
But I insist.

118
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,377
What do you want to risk?
You have everything going for you.

119
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,130
You're on a gravy train
with biscuit wheels.

120
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,175
You've just shattered my record.
What do you want to go and lose it for?

121
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,250
This is a Gran Torino
looking at you here.

122
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,763
Don't do it, okay?

123
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,043
Let's just have six or
seven drinks and go.

124
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,637
Hey, buddy boy.

125
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,190
You looking for a
little friendly action,

126
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,936
I just might know somebody
to accommodate you.

127
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,948
Speak of the devil, and he appears.

128
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,976
I'm gonna play the jukebox.

129
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,699
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

130
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,597
God!

131
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,375
God!

132
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,602
- Oh, yeah.
- He was robbed and you know it.

133
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,938
Game, set, match, fellas.

134
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:52,970
Yeah, and I believe you
owe us another $100.

135
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,363
Well, we're not getting
much mercy here tonight.

136
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,532
Well, you guys got to forgive me.

137
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,937
You see, bowling for money,
it's my only vice.

138
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,527
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks, sugar.

139
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,420
Okay, two vices.

140
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,744
That's still very good.

141
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,341
All right, let's go.

142
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,385
Thank you for the
education, gentlemen.

143
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,431
We've just received a Ph.D.
in stupidity. Doctor, shall we?

144
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,726
Give us a chance to
win our money back.

145
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,270
Are you crazy?

146
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,148
Padre, how much are you
into us for already?

147
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,641
$350.

148
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,026
$350.

149
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,362
That's a landau roof and power
steering, down the drain.

150
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,032
It could be in your pocket
right now. Let's go.

151
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,992
Double or nothing,
I can pick up that spare.

152
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,786
- I can... I think I can do it.
- That's the six, seven, ten.

153
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,873
You'll pick up that spare the same
day my hair starts falling out.

154
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,708
Come on, let's get out of here.

155
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,586
- I can do this.
- For $700? No way.

156
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,298
No. No way. No, not for $700.

157
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,967
What have you got here?
1,500. For $1,500.

158
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,678
Guys, you want some of the
"action," as he calls it?

159
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,430
Come on, you chickenshits.
I'm good for the money.

160
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,514
Put up my share.

161
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,974
Now, Mr. Big Shot.

162
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,309
Mr. I-wear-my-pants-high

163
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,770
and-I-pick-up-every-spare
drunk-or-sober.

164
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,063
Come on, guys.

165
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,773
All right, we'll take that bet.

166
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,650
Fine, my friend, my so-called friend.

167
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,320
Take your silly little ball and
make your silly little spare,

168
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,064
or miss it!

169
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,809
Come on, boy. Bowl!

170
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,119
The name's not boy.

171
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,817
It's Roy.

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,617
Roy Munson.

173
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,337
How did he do that?

174
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,585
What did I tell you? What did
I tell you? What did I tell you?

175
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,715
This feels weird.
Are you sure this is legal?

176
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,097
I don't know. It's fun,
though, isn't it?

177
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,775
What do you have sugar
for, Mr. McCracken?

178
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,237
Didn't I tell you to call
me Ernie or Big Ern?

179
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,948
It's for my morning coffee.

180
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,998
Get out of the car, wise guy!

181
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,590
What do we do?

182
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,165
Sometimes a bowler just
has to face the music.

183
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,212
Come on. There you are. Let's go.

184
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,504
And that bowler is you, Roy.

185
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,068
You're in deep shit, kid!

186
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,071
Look, look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

187
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,270
Let me see that hand.

188
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,328
Yeah, I thought I
recognized that name.

189
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,955
- Father, please do something.
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm a priest like you're
a dictionary salesman,

191
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,960
you piece of shit.
Come on, get him inside.

192
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,588
Come on. No, don't do this.

193
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,964
No!

194
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,674
No!

195
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,718
What are you doing?

196
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,096
I'll pay you back,
I swear to God. I swear.

197
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,057
- Get him up there.
- No, no, no!

198
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,183
No!

199
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,642
No!

200
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,853
- No!
- Do it!

201
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,271
No!

202
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,673
God! No!

203
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,524
No!

204
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,768
- Do it.
- No!

205
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,616
Hey, Herb, how's life?

206
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,043
Taking forever.

207
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,163
Morning, Mike.

208
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,759
Roy, can you get sick drinking piss?

209
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,845
I think you can.

210
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,762
Even if it's your own?

211
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,932
Hey, Captain Hook, wait up.

212
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,935
Hey!

213
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,982
I want that rent by tomorrow,
or you are out of here!

214
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,376
Okay, I got you down for a
50-gallon drum of lane oil

215
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,253
and a case of bowler's tape...

216
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,214
Every week I tell you the same thing,

217
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,208
we don't need nothing.

218
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,387
What about a gross of
fluorescent condoms

219
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,097
for the novelty machine
in the men's room?

220
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,934
I mean, those are fun
even when you're alone.

221
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,101
- Yeah.
- You get it?

222
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,937
- Yeah.
- This is like the hula-hoop of the '90s.

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,063
- People go nuts...
- No!

224
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,398
Look, we don't even
have a novelty machine

225
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,847
in the men's room anymore.

226
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,347
And you call this a bowling alley?

227
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,256
You stroke a hell of a ball,

228
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,926
but I bet when you're off,
you leave a lot of buckets.

229
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,135
Excuse me.

230
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,805
Buckets, three, five, six and nine.

231
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,515
It's from coming in too
light in the pocket

232
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,795
and sending the head
pin around the three.

233
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,469
You could tell all that from
just seeing me throw one strike?

234
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,805
I didn't see it. I heard it.

235
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,145
Try moving a couple
of boards to the left.

236
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,122
Would you look at that?

237
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,916
Sweeter than Yoo-hoo.

238
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,546
How come you know so
much about bowling?

239
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,016
Well, maybe this'll
help explain it to you.

240
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,795
Oh, wow. That's really something.

241
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,771
- What's that made out of?
- 14-karat gold.

242
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,220
Really? Looks like rubber.

243
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,474
No, the ring, not the hand.

244
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,062
Wow, state champion.

245
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,234
- You the state champion?
- Was. Iowa, '79.

246
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,080
Name's Roy Munson.

247
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,983
Ishmael Boorg.

248
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,254
You know, you've got as powerful
a stroke as I've ever seen, Ishmael.

249
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,883
You could lose a little off the
backswing, but you're not bad.

250
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:59,554
- What's your average?
- I don't know. 265, 270.

251
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,848
Well, I got to go.

252
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,226
- Bye.
- Whoa. Hey, easy does it.

253
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,729
What's your hurry?
We're just getting acquainted.

254
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,733
You're wasting your time, Munson.
He's from way out in Brimfield.

255
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,068
So?

256
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,570
Brimfield's an Amish community.

257
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,099
- He's Amish?
- No fooling you.

258
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,439
Hey!

259
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,124
Hey, wait up. I want to
talk to you for a second.

260
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,902
About what?

261
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,046
You got something special.

262
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,549
With your talent and my knowledge,
you could be a champion.

263
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,926
I mean that.

264
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,581
And I know talent because
I manage bowlers.

265
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,917
Bowling manager?

266
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,753
Why would a bowler need a manager?

267
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:53,138
"Why would a bowler need a manager?"

268
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:57,570
Well, don't you need a coach,

269
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,315
a friend, a brother,

270
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,577
someone who's gonna stick by
your side through thick and thin,

271
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,913
someone who will be a loyal friend,

272
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:12,286
and never, ever, ever turn
on you, no matter what?

273
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,371
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm
just not interested.

274
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,555
I hope you rot in hell, you loser!

275
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,208
You suck!

276
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,384
You don't deserve a car!

277
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,444
Where's the milk for the coffee?

278
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,392
We're all out.

279
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,897
Well, what do you call
that in the cooler?

280
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,247
Well, if you want to buy
some, help yourself,

281
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,499
but the freebies are all out.

282
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,001
Buy some?

283
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,030
What, I got to pay for
mustard if I get a hotdog?

284
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,243
If the freebies are out, yeah.

285
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,506
Can you break a 20?

286
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,926
And give me a box of Marlboros.

287
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,358
Do I got to pay for matches?

288
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,387
Five, five's ten. Here's 20.

289
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,642
If you ever need to
just talk, call me.

290
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,748
- Can I help you here?
- Thanks.

291
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,526
Come on up.

292
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,116
- Absolutely precious.
- Yeah.

293
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,716
That will come out.

294
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,302
Treasure these special times.

295
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,252
Look at you.

296
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,460
Did you burn your little fingers?

297
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,465
- Adorable.
- Thanks.

298
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,017
Charge me for milk, will you?
You lowlife.

299
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,067
- Give me the pocketbook, lady.
- No.

300
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,664
- Give me it.
- No.

301
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,374
- Hey!
- Give me it!

302
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,901
Okay.

303
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,420
Give it back. What are you,
a sissy? You need a purse?

304
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,744
I'll slice your throat.

305
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,842
Shit!

306
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,427
You burned me, you bastard.

307
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,180
Go ahead, you chickenshit.
Run home to mommy.

308
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,753
Pussy!

309
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,184
Here you go.

310
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,978
You okay?

311
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,722
I'm fine.

312
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,883
I am fine.

313
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,320
That was a very brave thing
that you did, Munson.

314
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,614
You are a hero,

315
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,324
a genuine hero.

316
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,702
I'm no hero. I don't
even know what happened.

317
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,858
Nine out of 10 times, I'd be
running in the other direction.

318
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,376
You know, about the rent...

319
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,628
No, no, no, don't you
worry about that, Roy.

320
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,088
You pay me the money
whenever you get it,

321
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,958
'cause I know you are good for it.

322
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. You thank you.

323
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,264
What 50? We said 25.

324
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,891
I think I deserve a little extra

325
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,602
after getting third-degree
burns on my pupils.

326
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,854
Hey, look, I didn't know you
were gonna use a knife.

327
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,857
I'm just trying to buy a little extra time.
I don't want to give her a coronary.

328
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,026
I had to make it look real, didn't I?

329
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,351
Look, besides,
that coffee wasn't even hot.

330
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,699
- Now that's hot.
- Where's your newspaper?

331
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,701
- I got to take a dump.
- I don't have a paper.

332
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:36,331
- I got to crap. I need something to read.
- Here, use this shampoo.

333
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,916
"New and improved."
I read this already.

334
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,752
You got any of that new Mentadent?

335
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:45,784
Roy, I know how you like to drink,
so I brought you some...

336
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:53,723
Why, you no good son of a bitch!

337
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,893
You crazy bastard! Well,
how the hell did you get in here?

338
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,313
- Now get out!
- That'll be 100 now, you prick!

339
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,941
And don't come back!

340
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,734
- Munson!
- Some people never learn. I...

341
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,486
You are history!

342
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,764
I am calling the cops!

343
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,326
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Hey.

344
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,079
Now, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

345
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,415
You have every right
to be angry, okay?

346
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,284
Just take a deep breath.

347
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,754
No.

348
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,048
There's got to be some
way I can work this off.

349
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,170
- Some way I can make it up to you.
- No, no, no, no, no! No!

350
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,677
Well...

351
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,598
Stop it, you. It wasn't that bad.

352
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,686
My little Roy-toy.

353
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,700
What is it about good sex
that makes me have to crap?

354
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,571
Guess it's all that pumping.

355
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,868
Pump and dump.

356
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,420
You really jarred
something loose, tiger.

357
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,841
Oh, boy.

358
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:25,106
I got two bits of
advice for you, Munson.

359
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,026
Number one, why don't you forget
about this bowling business

360
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,600
and get yourself a real job?

361
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,743
Number two, you still owe
me another month's rent.

362
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,869
So if I were you,

363
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,865
I would start doing some tongue
exercises before Friday.

364
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,890
Top of the morning to you.
I'm Hezakiah Munson.

365
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,684
I'm passing through
on my way to Ohio.

366
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,009
Any shingling or butter
churning need doing?

367
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,449
Lucas, you know better than that.

368
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,445
We're waiting on your brother
to come in from the fields.

369
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,619
How many children do you
have, Brother Hezakiah?

370
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,165
None that I know of.

371
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,886
What I mean to say is I was...

372
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,639
We... I'm unable to have children.

373
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,840
Nasty cheese grating
accident as a young man.

374
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,983
Why are you late this time, Ishmael?

375
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:36,154
Sorry, Pa. I was out in the cornfield,
and the stalks were broken,

376
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,197
and so I thought I could fix it.

377
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,020
Hi, Grandma.

378
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:49,823
Ishmael, please meet our friend
from Ohio, Brother Hezakiah.

379
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,991
Hello, Ishmael.

380
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,555
Why did you come here?

381
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,724
We didn't get a chance
to finish talking.

382
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,560
You're only gonna
make trouble for me.

383
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,383
Have a seat.

384
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,443
Look, my grandfather took
me bowling when I was a kid.

385
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,236
It was our secret.

386
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,780
If anyone around here found out that
I went down to that bowling alley,

387
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,033
I don't know what would happen.

388
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,689
Ishmael, there's a tournament
in Reno, Nevada in a few weeks.

389
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,498
The best bowlers in the
country are gonna be there.

390
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:33,904
With my help, I think you
can beat them. You hear me?

391
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,797
First prize is $1 million.

392
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,371
We split everything
right down the middle.

393
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,638
No, sir. I think it's
best that you go.

394
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,724
By tomorrow, they'll surely
find out that you're a fraud.

395
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,344
We Amish, we demand
more of ourselves.

396
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,979
You people work 8-hour days.
We work 12.

397
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,107
We do whatever you people do
plus a half. That's how we survive.

398
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,682
Believe me, keeping up is
not gonna be a problem.

399
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,578
Pa, his bed's made,
but he isn't in there.

400
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,026
He must've left.

401
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,334
Guess Brother Hezakiah was afraid
of getting his fingers dirty.

402
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,419
Morning! I hope you don't mind.

403
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,382
I got up a little early, so I took the
liberty of milking your cow for you.

404
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,509
Yeah, it took a little while
to get her warmed up.

405
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,039
She sure is a stubborn one.
Then, pow! All at once.

406
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,641
We don't have a cow.

407
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,589
We have a bull.

408
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,969
I'll brush my teeth.

409
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,677
Ishmael, you take Lucas down
with the other children.

410
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,721
Keep an eye on them for us, please.

411
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,307
Brother Hezakiah, you come with us.

412
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,643
The children? But I wanted
to help with the barn.

413
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,547
You can help after lunch. Go ahead.

414
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,185
Grab your tools. Follow me.

415
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,429
I don't know how a
barn-raising's done in Ohio,

416
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,223
but here in Pennsylvania,

417
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,974
no one runs for the dinner bell

418
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,049
in the middle of lifting
a 2,000 pound wall!

419
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,135
Okay, all right. I mean...

420
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,652
Brother Thomas, you know
what it says in the Bible

421
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,851
about not forgiving people.

422
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,146
Why don't you tell us all what
it says, Brother Hezakiah?

423
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,946
Well, it's against it.

424
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,590
Yeah, sure, Thomas can raise a barn,
but can he pick up a 7-10 split?

425
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,087
God blessed my brother to be
a good carpenter. It's okay.

426
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,348
Yeah, well, he blessed you, too,
and I'll give you a clue what it is.

427
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,351
It's round, it has three holes,
and you stick your fingers into it.

428
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,895
You leave Rebecca
out of this, mister!

429
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,015
I'm talking about
bowling, your future.

430
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,693
Well, just drop it, Mr. Munson.

431
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,155
Right now, the only future I
have is re-shoeing Buttercup.

432
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,615
Holy cow.

433
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,659
Yeah, this is Buttercup.

434
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,358
Biggest, strongest
horse in the county.

435
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,123
Ishmael, like a word with you.

436
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,026
Okay, Pa.

437
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,465
Brother Hezakiah,
take the horse's shoes off.

438
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,994
Ishmael will be right back.

439
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,044
Don't be angry with
your brother, Thomas.

440
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,564
He's been under a lot of pressure
dealing with those bankers.

441
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,387
Is everything okay, Pa?

442
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,110
No, Son.

443
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,605
The community's in trouble.

444
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,782
They've threatened to
foreclose on the land.

445
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,452
Is there anything I can do?

446
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:20,608
Not unless you can figure out a way
to come up with a half million dollars.

447
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,910
Well, there's a storm on the horizon.

448
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,076
I guess the angels are bowling.

449
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,918
Maybe they're gonna
bring us a messenger.

450
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,478
It took some doing,
but I finally got them off.

451
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,722
Where do you keep the new shoes?

452
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,526
What, I got a...

453
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,350
I got a booger hanging? Huh?

454
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:58,994
Tell my parents that God spoke to me
to go on a mission with Brother Munson.

455
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,080
If the good Lord sees fit,

456
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,833
I'll be back with enough
money to save the land.

457
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,835
Ishmael, promise me

458
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,547
that you'll be careful when
you're out among the English.

459
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,246
Do not allow yourself
to be corrupted.

460
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,470
Don't worry, Miss Rebecca,
your goodness gives me strength.

461
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,965
Nothing can make me stray.

462
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,069
Buckle up, my friend.

463
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,349
You're about to embark
on a great adventure.

464
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,492
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

465
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,754
You really should try
to quit, Mr. Munson.

466
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,674
They say it's bad for
your heart, your lungs,

467
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,551
quickens the aging process.

468
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:58,095
Is that right? Who's done
more research on the subject

469
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,515
than the good people at the
American tobacco industry?

470
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,267
They say it's harmless.
Why would they lie?

471
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,012
If you're dead, you can't smoke.

472
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,778
You get warmed up.
I'll grab us a couple coffees.

473
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,197
I don't drink coffee.

474
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,021
- Why not?
- Because it's a stimulant.

475
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,068
What the hell do you
think cigarettes are?

476
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,490
They are?

477
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,080
All right. Make it extra-large,
two sugars, lots of cream.

478
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,036
Lots of cream.

479
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,514
Mr. Munson, you all right?

480
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,520
Ish, what happened in there?

481
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,448
Well, I don't know.
I thought I played pretty good.

482
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,785
You know, he's just a little
better than me, that's all.

483
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,156
Pretty good, huh? 186.

484
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,527
You lost to a club player!

485
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,089
What... That's not supposed to happen!
You're carrying a 270 average!

486
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:19,415
Well, what do you expect?
I mean, you guys with your 10 frames.

487
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,013
What do you mean
"you guys with your 10 frames"?

488
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,225
My grandpa always taught
me to bowl 15 frames.

489
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,559
It's like I told you before,

490
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,688
we Amish, we do everything
half again as hard as you do.

491
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,523
Ten frames?

492
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,801
That's for Quakers.

493
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,432
I ain't going home.

494
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,778
Look, there's no way you'd stand
a chance against those guys.

495
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,707
But you said I was the best
prospect you'd ever seen.

496
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,625
You said you could
make me a champion.

497
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,748
I've been liquored up for 17 years.
My judgment's not what it once was.

498
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,095
Pull the car over.
I want to get out here.

499
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,306
- I'll drive you home.
- I don't want to go home!

500
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,434
I want to go to Reno!

501
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,463
Now, pull the car over
and let me out of here!

502
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,734
You know, this is silly.

503
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,571
You've only been gone a couple
of days. They'll forgive you.

504
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,098
Yeah.

505
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,269
Yeah, you're right, Mr. Munson.
They'll probably forgive me.

506
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,996
They expect me to come home
with my tail between my legs,

507
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,873
but I won't do it.

508
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,917
I'd sooner get munsoned out
here in the middle of nowhere

509
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,462
than lose face in front of
my friends and family again.

510
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,588
What'd you just say?

511
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,132
I said I don't want to lose face
in front of my friends and family.

512
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,534
No, before that.

513
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:46,221
I said I'd sooner get munsoned
out here in the middle of nowhere.

514
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,874
"Munsoned"?

515
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,019
- What the hell is that?
- You know, munsoned.

516
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,854
To be up a creek without a paddle.

517
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,689
To have the whole world
in the palm of your hand

518
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,435
and then blow it, you know.
It's a figure of speech.

519
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,266
"Munsoned."

520
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,163
Congratulations, my friend.
You passed the test.

521
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,997
A true champion doesn't
quit, and neither did you.

522
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,967
- You mean, you were just testing me?
- A little Roy 101.

523
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,052
You were just testing me.

524
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,488
Mr. Munson.

525
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,232
Whoa!

526
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,236
Come on, hop in.

527
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,613
I got to watch you.

528
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,168
So, I did good, huh?

529
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,288
You did great,
but school's just beginning.

530
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,559
I'm telling you,
a bowler's two worst enemies

531
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,644
are his eyes and his ears.

532
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:19,640
You shut these, you close those,
and you just feel it.

533
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,259
Hey. Hey, coach, listen to this.

534
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,710
"English bulldog,
one testicle, $500."

535
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,935
Wow. For that kind of money,
you think you'd get two testicles.

536
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,436
Don't you think?

537
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,313
How the hell should I know, Ishmael?

538
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,357
I'm tired of all your questions.

539
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,985
I'm not here to teach you everything
about everything in the world.

540
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,572
I'm here to teach you about
bowling, and that's it.

541
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,943
Okay, okay, keep your shirt on.

542
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,360
I mean, I can figure some
things out for myself.

543
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,469
Wait a minute. Hold it.
I'm gonna bet?

544
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,763
Yeah, well, if we're gonna make
enough dough to get to Reno,

545
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,837
we're gonna bet. Yeah.

546
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,478
Ish, you can't have it both ways.

547
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,148
If you want to earn half a million dollars
and save that small town of yours,

548
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,526
you're gonna have to
bend the rules a little.

549
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,821
No way. There's no way I can bet.

550
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,322
It's against my religion.

551
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,034
I was raised to not be a gambler,
and there's no way I'm gonna bet.

552
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,495
- Hey. Hey! Ish. Ish!
- No. No!

553
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,913
- Hey!
- No way.

554
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,790
Listen, you stupid banana head.

555
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,418
You don't have to bet!
I'll bet for you.

556
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,336
That's cool.

557
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,866
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen, huh?

558
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,797
So, you two are dictionary salesmen.

559
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,590
You would be punctilious
in assuming that.

560
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,520
Yeah, your buddy tells me
you're the best salesman

561
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,188
in the whole company.

562
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,092
You must be a pretty smooth talker.

563
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,061
Yeah. Yep.

564
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,772
You don't have to read them
to sell them, you know.

565
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,656
So, Steve, what do you say
we bowl a couple games?

566
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,279
Steve?

567
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,612
Yo, Steve-arino.

568
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,365
Right.

569
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,959
Okay, you want to bowl
for some big money, hey?

570
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,710
But I'll lose my entire bonus
check 'cause I'm so bombed.

571
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,303
You get that way when
you drink ginger ale?

572
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,175
Oh, no. He was sniffing
glue in the parking lot.

573
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,361
I haven't heard this one in a while.

574
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,390
How does the rest
of this hustle work?

575
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,619
Nice going, De Niro.

576
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,237
It's Steve.

577
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,399
What, you want to
blow the whole thing?

578
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,544
Look, if you guys want a
straight-up money game,

579
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,838
you show up at this address tonight.

580
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,007
At midnight.

581
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,206
And bring some money.

582
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,381
Wow. Look at that.

583
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,092
Are you all right, sir?

584
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,273
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just make sure you win.

585
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,566
We can't lose.

586
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,312
It's the centurion's faith
that wins him divine favor.

587
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,074
Got you!

588
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,649
Okay, park the shitbox and
come with me. Come on.

589
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,196
He seems like a real cutup, huh?

590
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,710
You know, Stanley,

591
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,798
I don't necessarily feel like we
need to play for money, you know.

592
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,633
Why don't we just play for fun?

593
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,677
- Every once in a while...
- Cut the bullshit, Munson.

594
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,627
I know you're a hustler.
Now, can your kid play or not?

595
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,546
He can play.

596
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,519
Fine.

597
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,718
Then it's $1,000 a game.

598
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,305
Claudia, why don't you show us
the way to the bowling alley?

599
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:24,233
Isn't she the most incredible
woman you've ever seen?

600
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,538
She's hot.

601
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,486
And those babies are real.

602
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,571
Twice.

603
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,577
What's so funny?

604
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,890
I didn't want to be the one to tell
him, but with those narrow hips,

605
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,340
that girl couldn't have more
than six or seven children.

606
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,567
An open frame in the tenth.
I was robbed, god damn it!

607
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,901
He's got a 228.
You need three strikes, Ish.

608
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,373
Okay, stay focused.

609
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,948
Snap it. Pull.
Pull that string. All right.

610
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,634
Hey, Munson, now it's
getting interesting, huh?

611
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,460
Bottom of the ninth.
Two-minute warning. Last frame.

612
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,942
There's no question farmer
boy's a fine bowler,

613
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,890
but competing under pressure?

614
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,111
One more, Ish. One more.

615
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,738
Boy, it's hot in here.
I need something to cool down.

616
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,769
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

617
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,604
Does anyone else want one?

618
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,482
Yeah, I'll take a
couple jugs... Mugs.

619
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,931
Bottle. One... One bottle.

620
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,723
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.
I'll get that.

621
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,316
- What kind do you want, Mr. Munson?
- Whatever.

622
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,866
Here you go, sir.

623
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,995
- Come on, buddy, bowl.
- I'm kind of nippy.

624
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,390
Yes!

625
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,579
What can I say?

626
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,233
Good game. My hat's off to you.

627
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:21,573
The great Stanley got beaten by
the farm boy on his own track.

628
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,578
Could I have a word with you
in the other room, dear?

629
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,527
Don't ever pull that shit with me!

630
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,237
What do you mean?
I wasn't doing anything.

631
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,515
What's wrong with you?

632
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,531
Anyway, I owe you guys
a little bit of money.

633
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,289
Let's play another game.

634
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,341
Oh, no. Not tonight.

635
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:10,178
We got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow,
and it's a school night, so...

636
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,752
- What the hell is that?
- What?

637
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,380
This.

638
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,132
One hundred-dollar bill
wrapped in Monopoly money.

639
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,942
You look like you want to hit me.

640
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,017
We don't raise our hands
in anger against others.

641
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,740
Well, we do!

642
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,283
Unbelievable!

643
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,910
You disgrace my home,

644
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,247
dishonor the game by betting
with money you don't even have!

645
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,499
You piece of garbage!

646
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,292
I want you to take them out back,

647
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:46,089
and I want you to make his left
hand look just like his right hand!

648
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,757
- Mr. Munson...
- What the hell?

649
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,592
- Get them! Don't let them get out!
- I got them!

650
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,428
- Hit the lights!
- I got the punk!

651
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,054
Where's the door?

652
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,390
You bald bastard,
I'll gouge your eyes out!

653
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,169
You son of a... Oh, shit!

654
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,900
- Give me the keys.
- Why?

655
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,527
Give me the goddamn keys.

656
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,896
Hey, nobody drives my car.

657
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,700
- Come on, Mr. Munson.
- Wait, wait, wait.

658
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,899
Come on, Mr. Munson.

659
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,446
Shit! Look at this.

660
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,843
Hey, hey. Slow down, all right?
You're gonna get us all killed.

661
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,270
Shit!

662
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,048
Shit! Shit!

663
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,066
I don't know why I did this.

664
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,651
I don't know where I'm going.

665
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,225
I don't have a clue what I'm
gonna do when I get there.

666
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,607
Why couldn't this have worked out?

667
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:59,238
He hit me, the bastard,
and hitting I don't take!

668
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:04,125
Look, just calm down, all right?
Take it easy. Calm.

669
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,995
Just like the kid
back there. Look how...

670
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,243
Ish.

671
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,452
Ish?

672
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,171
Pull it over. Pull it over.

673
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:23,269
Ishmael always was a strange boy,
but he means well, and we love him.

674
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,771
Please bring him back home.

675
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,272
I will, Father.

676
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,597
I promise you, I will
not return without him.

677
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:41,538
I walked past them
all just like I say

678
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:46,417
And I felt this hurt
that would not go home

679
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:50,296
I can't expect you all
to see this my way

680
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,843
But you might not remember
the trees that I'd known

681
00:50:55,844 --> 00:51:01,171
And I want them to bring
back my old corner store

682
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,008
Damn this hand!

683
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,981
Where do you get something like that?

684
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:11,977
Prosthetics-R-Us, aisle 6.
Right next to the glass eyeballs.

685
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,813
Must be tough when you're
spanking your monkey.

686
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,687
You have a monkey?

687
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,436
Hey, handsome, how about a dance?

688
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,915
Yeah, well, thank you, young lovely,

689
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,084
but to tell you the truth
I'm a little bit worn out.

690
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,877
I wasn't asking you.

691
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,422
She said handsome, not handless.

692
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,132
So, how about it?

693
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,593
Dance? I don't know how to dance.

694
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,497
Well, it's about time you learned.

695
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:54,569
When there's things to do
and not because you gotta

696
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:59,191
When you run for love
not because you ought to

697
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,743
Listen.

698
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:04,996
We appreciate your help with
your boyfriend and everything.

699
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:08,196
- But...
- You look. I did it for the kid.

700
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,293
A cheap hustler like you,

701
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,288
I couldn't have cared if they
put a bullet in your head.

702
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,215
You care about the kid, huh?

703
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,718
Well, I got a newsflash
for you, Mother Teresa.

704
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,471
Just because you spend most of
your time in the missionary position

705
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,125
doesn't make you a missionary.

706
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,477
- This is gonna work out fine.
- What?

707
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,187
Well, it's better that we
don't like each other,

708
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,897
since we're gonna be
business partners.

709
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,925
You know, checks and balances.

710
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,486
- Business partners?
- Yeah.

711
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,112
That's precious.

712
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:41,324
Look, I saw your phony roll.

713
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,602
You don't have enough
money to get to Reno.

714
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,830
Why don't you just
eat your chili fries

715
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,791
and drink your shake
and go blow lunch,

716
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,669
or do whatever it is you do to keep
that ass of yours in business?

717
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,087
Look, Mr. Munster,

718
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,173
you're not exactly the smartest
guy I ever ran across.

719
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,077
Oh, yeah? And who are you,
Alfred Einstein?

720
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,082
So, this is rock 'n' roll.

721
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,634
I like it.

722
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,715
God.

723
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:13,022
- It's my boyfriend, Skidmark.
- I'd like to meet him.

724
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,191
I don't think you want to meet him.

725
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,567
Hi, Mr. Skidmark.

726
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,196
Look, your act is about as
fresh as a Foghat concert.

727
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,315
It really bites, Roy.

728
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,908
You don't have to worry about us.

729
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,618
I know a little something
about this racket.

730
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,286
I learned it the hard way.

731
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:31,457
Yeah, well, I've got
stake money. 500 bucks.

732
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,376
And I'll tell you something else.

733
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,628
Ishmael likes me.

734
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,714
I promise you, you're not his type.

735
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,426
I'm his type. I'm every guy's type.

736
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,927
You trying to pick up my woman?

737
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,345
Hey, you crazy or something?

738
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,293
Hey! Come here!

739
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,391
- Get him, Skid.
- She was just teaching me to dance.

740
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,477
I didn't know how to dance, and...
You want to dance?

741
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,438
What are you trying to say?
You want me to dance?

742
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,690
Well, no. No, not if you don't
want to. I mean, I just...

743
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,151
I can't believe you're in here
trying to move in on my squirrel.

744
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,153
I ought to stoot slap
your ass right now!

745
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,405
We're gonna drill you
another asshole, shithead!

746
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,434
You want to kiss somebody,
Goldilocks? Kiss these!

747
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,168
Take that, you freaky piece of shit!

748
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:19,164
- You don't mow another guy's lawn!
- All right! All right!

749
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,539
That was really heroic, Munson.

750
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,970
Hey, I did Ish a favor.

751
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,766
If I hadn't knocked him out,
those animals would've torn him apart.

752
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,142
That's the thanks I get?

753
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:34,843
You didn't have to have
beers with them afterwards.

754
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,346
Well, I didn't want them to
think that we were in cahoots.

755
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:42,308
Well, I think you cleared that up
when you rubbed Tabasco in his eyes.

756
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:48,398
Could you move that seat up
so I can stretch my feet out?

757
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,497
Thanks, Miss Claudia.

758
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,664
Here.

759
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,543
I had them wrap up your food 'cause
this'll probably be your last meal.

760
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,213
Seeing as you don't
have any more money.

761
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:03,037
You're the greatest, Miss Claudia.

762
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,417
Ishmael, I just had a thought. I...

763
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:16,797
Seeing as how Claudia
has been so kind to us,

764
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:22,227
I thought maybe she could join us
till she gets back on her feet.

765
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,642
Yeah?

766
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:29,231
Mr. Munson, if I could
see you, I'd kiss you.

767
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:35,400
Isn't he the best? I mean,
you're the best, Mr. Munson.

768
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:05,349
- What you doing there, Mr. Munson?
- Flossing.

769
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,180
Flossing?

770
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,304
Where did I get "munson" from?

771
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,574
The name's Munson.
What I'm doing is flossing.

772
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,368
This is called floss.
It cleans your teeth.

773
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,413
You ought to try it sometime.
You'd be amazed what you'd find.

774
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:24,068
I guess I don't know much
about life outside of Brimfield.

775
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,004
I was never in a car before.

776
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,840
I never stayed in a
fancy hotel before.

777
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:34,586
Never saw a man pick his
nose with a hook before.

778
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:39,921
When I stop and think about
it all, it can get pretty scary.

779
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,566
Mr. Munson!

780
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,985
It's an emergency. We got
to get the hell out of here.

781
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,987
- But what are we gonna...
- No if, ands or buts.

782
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,072
- You just get moving.
- I'll go get Miss Claudia.

783
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,701
No. Don't get Claudia.
I'll explain it all later.

784
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,730
- Just be quiet.
- Okay.

785
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,459
I think I tore my sack.

786
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,364
- Are you okay, Mr. Munson?
- What did I just say?

787
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:14,508
- "I think I tore my sack"?
- No! "Be quiet!"

788
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,001
Okay.

789
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,641
- The Army evacuated everybody.
- Evacuated?

790
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,061
Yeah. A big military train derailed,

791
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,646
and this whole area is in
danger of being contaminated

792
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,066
by a huge cloud of... Shit!

793
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,346
A huge cloud of shit? Wow!

794
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,863
God! I think I smell it!
Come on, let's go!

795
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,687
Come on, Mr. Munson. Miss Claudia.

796
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,647
Roy, could we go have a little chat?

797
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,317
- Surely.
- Great.

798
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,882
Hey, everybody,
there's a shit cloud coming!

799
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,956
Run for your lives!

800
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,720
$60-a-night motel room,
and you're sleeping in the car?

801
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,930
That makes a lot of sense.

802
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,598
Yeah. Don't I feel like a fool?

803
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,799
I know what you're thinking, all right?
So just let me explain here.

804
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,731
Mommy.

805
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,276
You must have a really wide foot.
You got both of them.

806
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,738
I can't believe you were gonna ditch
out and go to Reno without me!

807
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,281
I thought we were partners!

808
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,952
Hey! Spare me the
indignant routine, all right?

809
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,121
You've been rubbing your
tits in that kid's face

810
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:28,415
from the moment we hooked up,
so that you could steal him from me.

811
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,793
- What?
- Don't give me that "what" crap.

812
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,504
Half the dresses you got,
you need two hairdos to wear.

813
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:37,133
Admit it! You've been planning on
taking him from me and leaving me flat.

814
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,717
I just beat you to the punch.

815
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,679
How dare you accuse me of anything?

816
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,306
Ish worships you, and all you've
done is feed him a load of bullshit

817
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,808
so you can line your own pockets!

818
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:49,353
Come on. Right now. You and me, bud.

819
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:52,773
What? Hey, look. Listen, lady,

820
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,484
I've done a lot of creepy
things in my life,

821
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:59,059
but I'm not gonna lower myself
into having a fistfight with a girl.

822
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,309
Stop that!

823
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,432
Ishmael! Where is he?

824
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,441
- Ishmael!
- Great.

825
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,116
"I thought you were my friends.
Good-bye, Ishmael."

826
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,648
I hope Ishmael has
enough street smarts

827
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,900
to get to Reno by himself.

828
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,610
Poor guy.

829
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:22,139
He's like a baby out there.

830
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:28,228
I hope he doesn't get munsoned
out in the middle of nowhere.

831
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,874
Oh, shit!

832
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:39,076
You know, I didn't realize it,
but we're near where I grew up.

833
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,038
What time are the tours
to your boyhood home?

834
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,088
Yeah.

835
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,886
You know, it's been 17 years since
I showed my face around here.

836
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,481
How do I look?

837
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,713
You look good, Roy.

838
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,457
Real sharp.

839
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,790
All right.

840
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,837
You okay?

841
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,931
It's just not what I expected.

842
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:30,024
What's taken you so
long to come back, Roy?

843
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,659
Guess I was ashamed, you know.

844
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,609
Everybody expected so much from me.

845
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,699
Everyone believed in me.

846
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,449
At least my dad did.

847
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,741
He gave me this when I left.

848
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,954
I never could get the
damn thing running.

849
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:57,844
It's funny. It's like time stopped
for me when I left this town.

850
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,723
Yeah, he taught me a lot out here.

851
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,018
Got word he died about 10 years ago.

852
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,656
Didn't even have the nerve
to come back for the funeral.

853
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,467
Well, your old man would be proud.

854
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:34,338
I mean, here you are, passing all
that bowling knowledge on to Ishmael.

855
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:38,964
No, he wouldn't be proud.

856
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,349
Let's go find that kid.

857
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:09,047
You know, Ishmael, I sure hope you
make enough money out in Reno

858
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,716
to save that town of yours.

859
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,790
Thanks, Miss Tabitha.

860
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,549
Time to settle up.

861
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,470
Is that eight hours already?

862
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,635
This shift just flew by.

863
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,027
This lap dance is so much fun.

864
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:33,477
I feel like I should be
the one paying you.

865
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,410
- Gee, mister. I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

866
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,704
No! Please, sir, please.

867
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,206
I can work it off.

868
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,208
I'm pretty good with
a needle and thread.

869
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:47,753
I can knit. I can sew the girls'
costumes when they get frayed.

870
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:52,007
No, sir! Please!
I'll do anything, anything, please.

871
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,660
Anything?

872
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,254
Come here.

873
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,559
What do you think
about new beginnings?

874
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,979
What is that,
the feminine hygiene spray?

875
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,678
You and me, starting over.

876
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,520
Yeah.

877
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,520
I'd like that.

878
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,162
- Longish hair.
- Weird guy.

879
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,081
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Down that way.

880
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,734
Uncle Willee's Snake Farm.

881
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,585
Yeah, he was here.

882
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,879
I offered him a job, a good job.

883
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,032
You think that guy took it?

884
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,639
He didn't take it.
The wimp is afraid of snakes.

885
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,634
You son of a bitch.
You're going in my stew.

886
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,592
Thank you.

887
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,767
Take it off, girl!

888
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:11,086
Hi. You seen a big Amish
guy come through here?

889
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,005
Fortyish, stocky.

890
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,909
- Sort of friendly.
- Kind of stupid?

891
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,128
Well, naive.

892
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,794
Feast your eyes.

893
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,912
Get in! Come on! Get a move on!

894
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,123
Hey! Nobody quits in
the middle of a show!

895
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,992
Sons of bitches!

896
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,921
Ish, I don't understand how
you can still be mad at us.

897
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,715
We just saved your butt.

898
01:08:56,716 --> 01:09:01,094
I heard what you were saying
about me, about each other.

899
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,840
I thought we were partners,
but I guess I was wrong.

900
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,961
Ish, it's tough out there, all right?

901
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,564
I mean, the world can kick your ass.

902
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:16,936
I only have a vague recollection
of when it wasn't kicking mine.

903
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,030
I guess that's why Claudia
and I were fighting.

904
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:24,785
We both had a rotten run of it for
a while, and I don't know, you...

905
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,912
You get hurt over and over again,

906
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:30,692
you stop trusting people so
you don't get hurt again.

907
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,254
Look, Ish, if you really
want to call an end to this,

908
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,578
we'll drop you off wherever you want.

909
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,051
But if you want to go on,

910
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,302
from here on out,

911
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,638
we're all gonna work
together as a team.

912
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,712
And no more bullshitting.

913
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,051
I promise.

914
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,299
Ish, you remember what it says in
the Bible about not forgiving, right?

915
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,389
I know exactly what it says.

916
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,071
It's against it.

917
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,439
Right?

918
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:56,053
"Jeffersons on Ice!" Look at that!
I love Sherman Hemsley!

919
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,201
- What's this?
- What?

920
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,007
- What is that?
- It's a tattoo. Relax.

921
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,342
Tattoo!

922
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,428
How could you let me do this, Roy?
How could you?

923
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:35,255
I don't know. I don't remember a thing.
The whole night's a blur to me, all right?

924
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,431
I've committed a sin.

925
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,985
I've desecrated my body.

926
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:48,154
Can't go home now. No, can't go home!

927
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:52,276
It'll come right off.
They'll just burn it off in a jiffy.

928
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,115
Hey, this isn't so bad.

929
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,864
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

930
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,933
You are gonna give me
$100,000 on the line

931
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,687
and a $50,000-yell, okay?

932
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:24,816
Hey, top heavy. Bring me a Tiparillo
and a sake and seltzer, s'il vous plaît.

933
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,469
Okay, here we go.

934
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,726
Come on, do it to me!

935
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,033
- Yeah. Right.
- Overshot...

936
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,911
Overshot. All right.
No, it is. It's okay.

937
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:41,113
It's okay because I am
going to bet $800,000

938
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,362
on the line. Okay?

939
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,422
Here we go.

940
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,592
Hey, doll face. How about bringing
me a little lady luck, huh?

941
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,667
- Sure thing.
- No, not you.

942
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,791
It's a winner!

943
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,644
Go, Ish.

944
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,062
Well, that's something.

945
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,885
All right!

946
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,489
Yeah.

947
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,907
Okay, here we go.

948
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,855
Two number 64s

949
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,855
and a 41.

950
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:23,166
You know, their 64 is supposed
to be the best in the city.

951
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,961
Yeah? That 41 doesn't look bad.

952
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,171
You can go to the potato bar
whenever you're ready.

953
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,632
So, which opponent poses the biggest
threat to you in the tournament?

954
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,343
Me. If I get drunk, and fall down
and hurt myself, I might lose.

955
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:34,678
Sure, babe.

956
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,763
- What's your name?
- Darlene.

957
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,098
I'm in 1103.

958
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,643
Excuse me. What's the story behind
this pending paternity suit against you?

959
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:44,229
That's not a case at all.
The woman's a stone-faced liar.

960
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,480
Let's not even talk about that.

961
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,066
I pulled out of her
really early on that one.

962
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,276
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

963
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,769
Hey!

964
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,765
The Munson!

965
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,767
Big Ern.

966
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:58,827
Long time.

967
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,872
I'll say. Probably a year for
every topping on the table.

968
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:05,275
I heard a horrible rumor.

969
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,246
Creepy!

970
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,339
I'm sorry.

971
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,135
You know, for the first couple years,

972
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,538
I felt responsible.

973
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:20,999
How you been otherwise?

974
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,145
You know, in the last 17 years,
a day hasn't gone by

975
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:29,176
that I haven't thought about what I'd
say to you if I ever ran into you again.

976
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,265
I bet. Hello.

977
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,981
Oh, my God. Claudia?

978
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,034
You two know each other?

979
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,735
It's a small world when you've
got unbelievable tits, Roy.

980
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,665
Baby, we had some
good times in Chicago.

981
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,819
I remember. I know
you haven't forgotten.

982
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,713
- Him and you?
- Why didn't you quit slumming?

983
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,881
The two of you together?

984
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,050
Come back to me.
Let's try to make it work.

985
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,455
Let's try, really try. How about it?

986
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,965
I'd rather mop the
floors at a peepshow.

987
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,101
Girl, you still got your great stuff.

988
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,396
Why don't you get the hell out
of here? You ruined my life!

989
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:13,151
Are you still holding on to all the anger?
I said I was sorry. I meant it.

990
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,444
Hey.

991
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:18,073
I remember that night, too, and I don't
remember anybody twisting your arm.

992
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,242
Oh, God! I just said "twisting
your arm" to Munson!

993
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,661
I can't wait to tell people. Hey!

994
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:27,082
Don't do it, Mr. Munson. He's just
trying to lower you to his level.

995
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,875
Let me give you some advice.

996
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:32,655
Stay away from this guy, huh?
Give him a wide berth.

997
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:38,837
He's what is called a born
loser, a real Munson.

998
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,292
- You...
- Hey!

999
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:45,050
- Hey!
- You just shut up, mister!

1000
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,185
I don't know who the
heck you think you are,

1001
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,521
but if you don't wiggle
those childbearing hips

1002
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,064
out that door in five seconds,

1003
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:54,309
you're gonna find your nose
sniffing my big Amish ass!

1004
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,558
Claudia, I'm in 1103.

1005
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,190
Thanks, Ish. You okay?

1006
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,239
Ish?

1007
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:14,120
Listen, I'm gonna go after
him and talk to him.

1008
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,048
Boo.

1009
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,131
Stan!

1010
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,409
You shouldn't have quit me, baby.

1011
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,484
Yeah? Well,
you shouldn't have hit me.

1012
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,857
You think that hurt?

1013
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,869
You wait and see what I
do to your two friends.

1014
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,340
Look, we both made mistakes.

1015
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,585
I've got 42 grand right there.
We can just take off right now.

1016
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,668
I mean, those guys are
bugging me anyway.

1017
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,392
I want to see those
guys one more time.

1018
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,812
They're not worth it.
They're a couple of losers.

1019
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:16,217
Now, come on. We can
just take off right now.

1020
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,015
I missed you.

1021
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,024
L$h, you okay?

1022
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,696
You're not taking a crap
in the sink, are you?

1023
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:47,256
It's over, Mr. Munson. It's broken.

1024
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,599
No.

1025
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,185
I think it's just sprained.

1026
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:55,305
Okay, it's broke. It's broke.

1027
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,488
Excuse me. Where's the
lady who's staying here?

1028
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:07,367
- She checked out already.
- She left with a couple of guys.

1029
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,745
Couple of guys? No. You mean
you saw her with us, right?

1030
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:13,569
No, these guys were good-looking.

1031
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,505
- You got the bag, right?
- Bag?

1032
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,424
The bag. The bag.
Tell me you got the bag.

1033
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:24,676
- Oh, yeah.
- You got the bag?

1034
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,221
Yeah. Okay, relax. The bag, yeah.
The bag's fine.

1035
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:31,045
I gave it to Miss Claudia to hold.

1036
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,972
Who you calling a psycho?

1037
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,985
I didn't say anything to you.

1038
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,033
Are you okay, Mr. Munson?

1039
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,465
Hi. How are you?

1040
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,467
Remember me?

1041
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,553
Yeah, from the crap table.

1042
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,681
That's right, from the crap table.

1043
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:15,552
And you're the big guy with
the lucky dice, aren't you?

1044
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,088
Jeez.

1045
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:21,149
Boy, the two of you
kind of look a little...

1046
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,319
- Well, a little down on your luck, huh?
- If you only knew.

1047
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,571
Jeez, that's tough.

1048
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,323
Look at George and Weezy go.

1049
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:31,022
What did that fat-ass Lionel
do with my lottery ticket?

1050
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:37,108
Well, look, I've got a
little proposition for you.

1051
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,985
I'm all ears.

1052
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:45,089
I will pay you $1 million to
sleep with your friend here.

1053
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,460
$1 million. One night. Cash.

1054
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,096
Just throw that out.

1055
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:56,047
You two mull it over,
get back to me. I'll be back here.

1056
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,980
What's there to mull over?

1057
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,227
I mean, are you gonna set that
creep straight or should I?

1058
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,513
I'll handle this.

1059
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,348
Yeah?

1060
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,369
I said, are you all right,
Mr. Munson?

1061
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,436
I wish I'd have never trusted her.
What was I thinking?

1062
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,010
42 grand down the drain.

1063
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,651
She'll be back.

1064
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,736
You're never gonna see
her again, all right?

1065
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,739
Well, I happen to think
you're wrong, Mr. Munson.

1066
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,408
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1067
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,577
The money we came here to
win is right here in Reno,

1068
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,496
at a legitimate sporting contest

1069
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:00,498
where the best player wins
because he's the best player,

1070
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:03,543
and we have the best player.

1071
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:04,961
Okay, I'm listening.

1072
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:07,338
We are going to do
what we set out to do.

1073
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,756
We're gonna win that tournament.

1074
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,425
Yes! I knew it.

1075
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:14,956
I knew you were a champion the
minute I saw you bowl, Ish.

1076
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,432
I'm not gonna bowl.

1077
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,880
You are.

1078
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:23,604
You are such a loser.
You're a bona fide schmuck.

1079
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,382
Look at me.

1080
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,569
Mr. Munson, I know you
can win that tournament.

1081
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,196
You're a champion,
and that never goes away.

1082
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,657
I'm sure that if you made it
through the first few rounds,

1083
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,856
you'd find your touch again.

1084
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,412
I'm Ernie McCracken.

1085
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,790
When I found out little Billy here
was growing up without a daddy,

1086
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,000
I had to do something.

1087
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,835
When Big Ern saw our
picture in the paper,

1088
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:48,212
he called the Unified
Fund and got involved.

1089
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,672
I had to.

1090
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,507
I couldn't help myself.

1091
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,676
But little Billy's not the only one.

1092
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,928
There's also little Jason here.

1093
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:59,182
Once again this year, I'll be
sponsoring a fatherless family

1094
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:02,006
in every city I bowl in.

1095
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,769
Sometimes when I wake
up in the morning,

1096
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,423
Mr. McCracken's already there.

1097
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:10,598
Jonathan, run a fly pattern
all the way to the goal line.

1098
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,197
Tennessee.

1099
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,191
Kentucky.

1100
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,773
Fonda Beach!

1101
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,447
Deeper, Jonathan.

1102
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,208
It's a tough world.

1103
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:29,489
These kids nearly got munsoned,
but they're back now.

1104
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:35,510
Through the Unified Fund,
I found out that if you give a little,

1105
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:39,791
you can get back a whole lot more.

1106
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:04,318
Hey! Give me that.
What are you doing?

1107
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,995
Well, it's a young crowd.
I don't recognize a single soul.

1108
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,706
Ishmael, welcome to my church.

1109
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,259
Wow.

1110
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:21,257
It's kind of intimidating to be in the
presence of so many great athletes.

1111
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,836
Hi. What's your name?

1112
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,589
Munson, Roy E.

1113
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:34,352
- Seriously.
- Munson, Roy E.

1114
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,348
Amateur or professional?

1115
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,608
Professional.

1116
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,565
We have a problem here.

1117
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:52,659
Your dues are in arrears.
You haven't paid them since 1979.

1118
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:58,209
How much is that gonna cost me?

1119
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,804
Dues times 16 years,

1120
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:06,381
plus penalties, plus interest equals

1121
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,591
$38.

1122
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:15,067
- Well, let's go. That's it.
- No, hold on.

1123
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:19,723
Would you be willing to hold on
to this till after the tournament?

1124
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,855
Come on. What are we gonna
do with a rubber hand?

1125
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,940
The ring.

1126
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:31,905
Okay.

1127
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,837
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1128
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,672
The National Bowling Stadium

1129
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,675
in conjunction with the Silver
Legacy Hotel and Casino

1130
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:43,971
would like to welcome everyone
to the $1 million, winner-take-all

1131
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,216
Brunswick-Reno Open!

1132
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:51,020
Please enjoy your stay here at our
fabulous facility, and remember,

1133
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:53,522
the Silver Legacy is still
the talk of the Strip

1134
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:56,359
with our 22-topping potato bar.

1135
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,058
Let's start the tournament.

1136
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,613
I can't.

1137
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,463
That's the way, Mr. Munson!

1138
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:32,879
All right! Yeah!

1139
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:36,524
You wouldn't happen to have a
Phillips-head screwdriver, would you?

1140
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:38,017
No.

1141
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,731
Never mind.

1142
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:22,183
All right, Mr. Munson.

1143
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:25,758
You know, Ish, I'm starting
to feel like a winner again.

1144
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:29,789
Okay, you scumbags. Now turn
around and face the wall.

1145
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,617
We have a Cinderella
story shaping up here.

1146
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:18,454
Roy Munson, the 1979 Iowa
state amateur champion,

1147
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:21,373
has suddenly come out of
nowhere with his bowling ball.

1148
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:24,277
He is a major contender
in this competition.

1149
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:25,419
So, Roy, let me ask you.

1150
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,539
What have you been
doing all these years?

1151
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:33,374
Well, the... After the hand, I...

1152
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,847
There... No, there was... The '80s...

1153
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,501
You know, for a while, I...

1154
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,176
Drinking.

1155
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,475
Yeah. A lot of drinking.

1156
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,196
Are you still drinking?

1157
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:56,075
No, no, no. I don't...
That's behind me now. I just...

1158
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,604
Why, are you buying?

1159
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,083
...as the early favorite for
Coach of the Year honors.

1160
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,837
And now, we're going live to
the National Bowling Stadium

1161
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:53,048
in the biggest little city
in the world, Reno, Nevada,

1162
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,801
where ESPN is set to bring
you final-round coverage

1163
01:31:55,802 --> 01:32:00,014
of the $1 million, winner-take-all
Silver Legacy Reno Open.

1164
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:04,184
What an incredible championship match
we have in store for you today.

1165
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,813
Ernie McCracken, a crafty veteran,
and, you know, a heck of a nice guy,

1166
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:12,890
goes against Roy Munson, a promising
young talent in the 1970s.

1167
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,526
- What you doing in there, Mr. Munson?
- Barfing.

1168
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,028
Barfing?

1169
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:26,957
Where do I keep
getting "munson" from?

1170
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,032
Please rise for the national anthem.

1171
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:37,536
Oh, say can you see

1172
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:42,924
By the dawn's early light

1173
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:48,383
Have you been drinking again?

1174
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,428
I don't puke when I drink.

1175
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,056
I puke when I don't.

1176
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,147
I'm scared, Ish.

1177
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:05,864
Let's get ready to bowl!

1178
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:08,040
And here they come,
our two finalists.

1179
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:11,460
Roy Munson has one of the most
intimidating hooks in all of bowling,

1180
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:13,796
quite literally, Chris. In fact,
the fans here in Reno

1181
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:15,547
have started calling him
"The Rubber Man,"

1182
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,841
because he bowls with a
rubber prosthetic hand.

1183
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,802
And take a look at that
focus on Roy's face.

1184
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:21,750
He is ready for this match.

1185
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,348
A nasty spill.

1186
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:27,518
That's kind of embarrassing,
in front of an audience like this.

1187
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,061
Look at Ernie McCracken.

1188
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,313
A guy like Big Ern,
with his panache and style,

1189
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:35,275
has clearly done for bowling what
Muhammad Ali did for boxing.

1190
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:38,529
Wow. Take a look at that.

1191
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,698
Have you, in 34 years of
covering bowling, Chris,

1192
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,158
ever seen a ball like that?

1193
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:47,280
- What is that, a rose?
- It appears to be. Clearly custom-made.

1194
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:51,083
Ernie's got a heart of gold,
but what an intimidator.

1195
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:52,668
Go, Big Ern!

1196
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:55,921
You know, he goes to his spot.
On the approach.

1197
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,798
Ernie McCracken.

1198
01:33:57,799 --> 01:34:00,748
How about one more title, sweetness?

1199
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,804
Look at that form.

1200
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,833
That left arm way out
is an unusual style.

1201
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:12,938
- Wow. Right off the bat.
- Beautiful. What a hit!

1202
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:17,185
He delivers on the goods.
Look at him pump up this crowd.

1203
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,571
Roy looks a little nervous,
a little unsettled.

1204
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:23,448
It is his first final
in nearly 20 years.

1205
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:25,951
The Rubber Man takes the ball
from his good left hand,

1206
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,871
and then notice how carefully he
places it in the prosthetic hand.

1207
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,080
You have no idea the pressure this...

1208
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,624
- Time out! Time out!
- Look at that.

1209
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,868
Give me that handsome cheek.

1210
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,590
- Wait, let me get Ernie, too.
- Give us a break.

1211
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:43,093
Look. Look at Big Ern, Chris.
Look at Big Ern.

1212
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,292
Calls her back.

1213
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,557
How gallant is that?

1214
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:52,728
This man's gonna win a lot of political
offices when his career's over.

1215
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,757
A great role model
for America's kids.

1216
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,767
Attaboy, Luther!

1217
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:09,119
Yes, a solid pocket hit.

1218
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,195
Munson answers right
back in Big Ern's face.

1219
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,885
Hey, sport, Coca-Cola.

1220
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,629
You betcha.

1221
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,967
I got to make a phone call.

1222
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,359
Could you put on ESPN, please?

1223
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,886
Sure thing.

1224
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,479
Come on, Roy.

1225
01:37:19,042 --> 01:37:20,417
Yes.

1226
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:21,819
Nice action.

1227
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:32,220
This $1 million, winner-take-all
championship match

1228
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,264
has reached the tenth frame.

1229
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:38,268
Leading by nine pins, Roy Munson,
shooting first on the right lane.

1230
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:41,513
A strike here provides
some breathing room.

1231
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:53,450
The dreaded 7-10 split.

1232
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:55,786
You know, Roy Munson has two chances

1233
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,037
to win this tournament now,

1234
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,498
slim and none, and slim
may have just left town.

1235
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:00,874
How true.

1236
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:04,795
You know, in bowling,
there are 1,022 spare leaves,

1237
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:08,131
and this, the 7-10,
is by far the most difficult.

1238
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,300
Virtually impossible to convert.

1239
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:14,054
There's no way you could slide the
10 pin into the 7 or vice versa.

1240
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:15,456
You're the man, Roy!

1241
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:19,252
Please. I can't look. I can't look.

1242
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,896
Thomas, what are you doing here?

1243
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:35,283
- Ishmael, it's time to go home.
- I can't go home now.

1244
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:36,952
This is the tenth frame,
and if he makes this,

1245
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,663
he's gonna win $1 million,
and we can save the farm,

1246
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:42,791
and I have a half a beer left,
and there's no way I'm going home.

1247
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,535
Over my dead body.

1248
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:47,254
It's time to go home now.

1249
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:48,907
Okay.

1250
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,925
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

1251
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:54,469
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

1252
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:56,972
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

1253
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,501
Rubber Man! Rubber Man!

1254
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,358
Yeah!

1255
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:12,070
Oh, my God! He has done it!
He has done it!

1256
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:15,240
Now, if Roy can pick
up one final strike,

1257
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:18,201
he'll force Big Ern to roll
three consecutive strikes

1258
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,730
in order to win this match.

1259
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:26,042
With that spare, he's not
slammed the door on Big Ern,

1260
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:29,242
but he's put on quite
a lot of pressure.

1261
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,918
Where'd he go?

1262
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:45,562
Yes.

1263
01:39:45,563 --> 01:39:47,230
The Rubber Man has gotten it done,

1264
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,650
and now the pressure is
squarely on Big Ern McCracken.

1265
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:52,736
Trailing by 29 pins,

1266
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:56,687
he needs three consecutive
strikes to win it all.

1267
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:00,243
I need you now.
More than ever, I need you.

1268
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,521
Ernie, you're the man!

1269
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,183
One strike down. Two to go.

1270
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:25,552
You can cut this pressure
with a knife, Chris.

1271
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:40,685
That's two. There's two. His second.

1272
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:56,205
Roy Munson now is
forced to sit and watch.

1273
01:41:03,849 --> 01:41:05,725
It has come down to this.

1274
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:07,435
One ball.

1275
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:09,187
One strike.

1276
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:11,273
$1 million.

1277
01:41:11,274 --> 01:41:13,802
And the loser gets nothing.

1278
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:57,986
I'm the greatest.

1279
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:00,014
I'm the greatest.

1280
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:03,158
I'm Big Ern. I'm the greatest.

1281
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:05,994
A one-pin victory for
Ernie McCracken.

1282
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:07,120
I'm Big Ern!

1283
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:11,321
Put it in the record
books, 226 to 225.

1284
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,920
Some lucky fan has a souvenir.

1285
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:38,473
Big Ern, $1 million.

1286
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,404
What are you gonna do with it?

1287
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:42,572
I don't know.

1288
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,825
All I know is I finally
got enough money.

1289
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:48,703
I can buy my way out of anything.

1290
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:52,123
I can do anything I want.
Now I can get myself a lawyer.

1291
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:54,250
And I'll walk!

1292
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:57,921
Finally, Big Ern is above the law!

1293
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:59,255
It's a great feeling.

1294
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,174
You were so cool. Any pressure?

1295
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,760
Where are those girls?
Get those girls over here.

1296
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:05,178
Yeah, there was pressure.

1297
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:08,390
I didn't want to get beat by
a guy with a hook, you know.

1298
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:10,600
Does this mean you're
against the handicapped?

1299
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:14,255
I don't know. I'm rich.
What do I care? Come on!

1300
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:33,073
Tough luck, Mr. Munson.

1301
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,032
- Hey, hey.
- Hey! You bastard, I'll...

1302
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:09,617
Where the hell is she?

1303
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:11,661
How the hell should I know?
I thought she was with you.

1304
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:14,781
- She stole my money!
- Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

1305
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,419
I checked my phone
records at the hotel.

1306
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,921
She called that bastard
Ernie McCracken 14 times

1307
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,339
in the last three days.

1308
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:26,243
Now what the hell is your
relationship to him?

1309
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:32,417
All right, stop it! Stop it!

1310
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:39,189
I'll tell you what my
relationship is to him.

1311
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:41,024
He's the guy who gave me that.

1312
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:44,778
- Nice. Is that solid gold?
- The hand.

1313
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:48,103
- Big Ern is responsible for that?
- Yeah.

1314
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,685
No, I...

1315
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:53,286
I don't know.

1316
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,735
I used to think he was.

1317
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,875
Now it's like you and Claudia.

1318
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:02,530
You probably blame McCracken
for screwing that up,

1319
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:07,034
but I'll bet it's
your own damn fault.

1320
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:14,549
Let's go find McCracken.

1321
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,687
Hey! What are you looking at?

1322
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:22,386
Hey! You suck!

1323
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:31,938
Go away! You'll get your
rent money tomorrow!

1324
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,491
Hey, Roy.

1325
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:44,746
Claudia.

1326
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:48,747
I got the money, Roy.

1327
01:46:07,278 --> 01:46:09,529
You left us flat, Claudia.

1328
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,782
You dumped us when we
needed you the most.

1329
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:14,200
You tricked us.

1330
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:15,693
I...

1331
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:18,955
Look, if I'd stuck with you,
Stanley would've hurt you,

1332
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:21,529
and he would've hurt Ishmael.

1333
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,491
What happened to McCracken?

1334
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:27,281
I never went with him.

1335
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:32,302
I just made those phone calls
to throw Stanley off my scent.

1336
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:35,502
And maybe give Big
Ern a little payback.

1337
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,294
84 grand.

1338
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:42,887
We can split it three ways.

1339
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,469
We only had half that.

1340
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:48,185
Yeah. Well,

1341
01:46:49,361 --> 01:46:51,263
we doubled it.

1342
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:54,270
Stanley.

1343
01:46:55,117 --> 01:46:57,269
He bet against you.

1344
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:05,201
But I'm ready to start
betting on you, Roy.

1345
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,630
Yeah, well, too late.

1346
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,853
What?

1347
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,676
Half a mil?

1348
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:30,932
Trojan condoms.
You know, "Rubber Man."

1349
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:35,198
All I have to do is a commercial,
show up at a couple of trade shows

1350
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:39,979
and pharmacies, and give a little
talk at Vassar College orientation.

1351
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:44,445
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1352
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:50,076
It is great. And this is only
getting divided one way.

1353
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:04,090
I can't face them.

1354
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:08,064
I wanted to be the hero for once.

1355
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:11,184
I wanted to be the
one to save the day.

1356
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:16,724
Brother,

1357
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:20,732
everyone knows you meant well.

1358
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,351
Mr. Munson!

1359
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,220
Miss Claudia!

1360
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:50,091
What are you two doing here?

1361
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:55,111
I'll tell you what
they're doing here.

1362
01:48:55,112 --> 01:48:58,686
They came to tell us the
truth about your trip.

1363
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:05,985
They tell you everything?

1364
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,485
Yes, Roy told us everything.

1365
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:13,588
He told us about the booze,

1366
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:15,715
and the lusting,

1367
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:17,789
the late nights,

1368
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,332
the lying.

1369
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:23,123
And the gambling.

1370
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,711
And he told us how you
got him to quit all that.

1371
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:33,649
How you got Roy to
straighten his life out.

1372
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:39,272
And how you got Claudia to quit being
so much of the whore that she is.

1373
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:45,578
And Roy also told us how every time
he wanted to quit, you wouldn't let him.

1374
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:48,732
How you quoted the scriptures
to give him strength.

1375
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:52,448
Yes, Son, he's told us everything.

1376
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:57,953
And we're mighty proud of you.

1377
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:07,391
But what about the bank
and the foreclosure?

1378
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:12,355
That's all been taken care of by
Brother Roy and Sister Claudia.

1379
01:50:12,356 --> 01:50:15,885
They put $500,000 in the bank.

1380
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,361
Our troubles are over!

1381
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,605
Our troubles are over!

1382
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,563
You guys!

1383
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,704
I'm gonna have to watch you two.

1384
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:32,530
Miss Claudia, I knew you'd come back.

1385
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:40,625
Thanks, Mr. Munson.
Thanks for everything.

1386
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:47,295
Hey, Ish, you know that
old centurion's faith thing,

1387
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,965
about you saving the Amish people?

1388
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:56,383
Well...

1389
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,694
It wasn't...

1390
01:50:59,695 --> 01:51:04,692
That was baloney. It wasn't them
you were saving. It was me.

1391
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:13,658
You lost me. What?

1392
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:23,551
Come on, Ishmael.
Everyone's waiting at the party.

1393
01:51:23,552 --> 01:51:26,596
They want to hear all about the missionary
work you did with Brother Munson.

1394
01:51:26,597 --> 01:51:28,514
Okay, Miss Rebecca.

1395
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:31,338
- Bye, Miss Claudia.
- Bye, Ishmael.

1396
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:35,971
Bye, Ish.

1397
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:40,844
Hey, Roy.

1398
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:44,272
I have something for you.

1399
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:48,272
Wow.

1400
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:52,622
You got it working.

1401
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:54,866
Yeah. I wound it.

1402
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,656
There's a winder.

1403
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:04,084
- Well, look at that, a little ladybug.
- You should make a wish.

1404
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:07,041
All right.

1405
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:13,589
You know what I wished for?

1406
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,046
What?

1407
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:34,648
Bye, Brother Munson. Bye, whore.

1408
01:56:45,665 --> 01:56:47,362
Action!

1409
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:04,251
Cut!
