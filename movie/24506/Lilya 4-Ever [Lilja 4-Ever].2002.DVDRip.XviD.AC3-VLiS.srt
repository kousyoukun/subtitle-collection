1
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:07,340
THREE MONTHS EARLIER.
SOMEWHERE IN WHAT WAS ONCE
THE SOVIET UNION

2
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,616
- Hi.
- Hi, come in.

3
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,296
- Shall we go?
- Sure, I just have to pack my things.

4
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,578
- What things?
- My things. I'm moving!

5
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,014
- Where?
- The States!

6
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:56,209
- What?! The States?
- It's true! You know mom’s boyfriend?

7
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,651
He lives in America.
Mom's moving there and I'm going with.

8
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:05,332
- What you gonna do there?
- I don’t know. We leave on Friday.

9
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:07,170
- You're kidding!
- It's true!

10
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,815
- It's a dumb joke.
- It's true. What am I gonna do here?

11
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:16,769
- I can’t believe you're moving.
- Believe it, I'm going...

12
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:23,974
- Can I pay for a pack of Marlboro later?
- No, you can't.

13
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,966
- Wall Street, then?
- I said no.

14
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:31,687
- We always can with the other cashier.
- Don’t lie, girls.

15
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,575
- We're not lying. We can...
- I said no!

16
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,412
- Bitch!
- What?!

17
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,851
- What you doing!
- Doesn’t matter, I'm off to America!

18
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:55,971
How come
you decided to go to America?

19
00:04:56,134 --> 00:05:01,049
Mom met her boyfriend
through one of those dating agencies.

20
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:05,047
He's Russian,
but he lives in America.

21
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,124
It's incredible!

22
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:12,885
- Shit... I'd also like to go away.
- You can visit me in America!

23
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:26,485
What's this about “America, America"?
What's she shouting about?

24
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:30,690
- She's going there.
- You're just lying. Really?

25
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,965
- Can't I come with?
- No.

26
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,362
Take me with you. I speak English.

27
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,686
<i>Hello, my name Is Volodya.</i>

28
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,768
Fool...

29
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,128
Listen... there was something
your mother wanted to say to you.

30
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,401
Go on.

31
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:07,407
Well...
Sergei and I have discussed it-

32
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,207
- And decided it's best
if we go over first.

33
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,398
We'll go first
and you'll come a little later.

34
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:21,559
- You're big now.
- What!? I'm going to live here alone?

35
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:26,083
That's just how it is.

36
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:30,877
If it doesn't suit you...
then you don't need to come at all!

37
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,923
It's just me and you.
Just the two of us.

38
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:27,520
- I’ll just say goodbye. Be right back.
- Fine.

39
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,235
Honey... I have to go now.

40
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:41,396
I left some money.
I'll send more when I get there.

41
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,868
Aunt Anna will be here soon.

42
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Can’t you at least give me a hug?
I'm leaving.

43
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:10,866
Fine...

44
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,798
- Goodbye...
- Bye.

45
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,905
Wait, mom!

46
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,747
Mom! Don't go!

47
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:06,145
- My little daughter...
- Don’t leave me, please!

48
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,589
Don’t leave me, mom!

49
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:12,870
Don't go, stay with me,
I won't make it!

50
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:15,229
Don't go, mom!

51
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,822
If we don’t leave now...

52
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:22,269
- I'll call. I'll call you!
- Mom!

53
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:24,588
I'll call when I get there!

54
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,779
- Who is it?
- Anna.

55
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:23,894
- So... Has she left?
- Yes.

56
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,495
- Get dressed.
- What?

57
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:31,655
- Let's go, we're off to your new flat.
- What new flat?

58
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:36,452
- You're going to live in another flat.
- What?

59
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:40,774
This flat's too big for you.
I told you to get dressed.

60
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,934
- I'm not going. This is my flat!
- You must obey me.

61
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,415
Let's go.

62
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,215
Here it is.

63
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,329
The old man that lived here died a few
weeks ago. These are his things.

64
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,134
- Are you crazy? I'm gonna live here?
- Yes, you will.

65
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,051
As long as your mother isn’t here,
I decide.

66
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:25,290
Everything's here: fridge, windows,
it's warm...

67
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:30,054
- Why can't I live in my flat?
- No one can pay for it.

68
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,492
I can't and you can't.

69
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:34,773
- If you don't...
- No way I'm living here!

70
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:38,054
If you don't want to live here,
live on the street.

71
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:42,733
- You bitch!
- It's the streets or an orphanage!

72
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,805
- Hi, Lilya.
- Hi.

73
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:07,054
VOLODYA

74
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,603
Our Father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy Name.

75
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,079
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done.

76
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,926
On earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread

77
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,126
And forgive us our trespasses. As we
forgive those that trespass against us.

78
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,087
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

79
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:21,288
For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

80
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:57,114
Very good.

81
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,595
You could do better.

82
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,762
Are you still here?
I thought you'd gone to America.

83
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,760
You did really well in the test.

84
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:15,041
- A golden future awaits you.
- What?

85
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,955
I was kidding.

86
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:29,482
Go to hell, bitch! You can be sure
I have a golden future ahead of me.

87
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:40,520
Hello!

88
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,476
Where are you going?

89
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:51,034
- Can I come with?
- No, you can't.

90
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,319
- You can have glue if I can come.
- Let's see.

91
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,834
Wow, are those Nikes? Real ones?

92
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,960
<i>My little sun, rise up...</i>

93
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,600
- Look at all the medicine I found.
- Wow...

94
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,114
- Where did you find it?
- The toilet.

95
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,747
- It's not mine.
- Whose is it?

96
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,832
- Maybe the old man that lived here.
- What's this?

97
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,637
Give it here!

98
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,518
What you doing! Kids shouldn't drink!

99
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:31,913
Hey, look what I found!

100
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:38,553
- Let's play war.
- Put one on him.

101
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:40,753
The old man was a war hero.

102
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:45,434
- Check out the war hero!
- Salute him!

103
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:56,028
- Volodya, sit down. Sit down!
- Relax!

104
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:03,307
What's all this noise?
Could you keep it quiet?

105
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:07,514
Come in, don’t be angry. We've got
cough medicine. You can have some.

106
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:11,793
- I don’t have a cough.
- It's good for everything. Come in.

107
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:17,234
If you don't calm down, I'll call the
police. And I'm calling your aunt.

108
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,674
That's enough. Hey, that's enough.

109
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:33,669
- Come on, I'll turn the light out.
- You're too young. Cut it out.

110
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,788
Calm yourself, you're too young.
Find yourself another girl.

111
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:49,670
- Cut it out.
- Go away.

112
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,101
What's going on here?!

113
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,701
What's going on?!

114
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,986
I like it here. Are you nuts, or what?!

115
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,985
Get out!

116
00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:41,347
Trash!

117
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:46,304
Go on! Get out of here now!

118
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:50,382
Out!

119
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,855
Don’t touch me!

120
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:16,223
Go to hell! Just you remember
that I decide around here.

121
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:19,104
Watch yourself, or it'll get worse!

122
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:26,014
<i>Get out of the house.</i>

123
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:30,541
Get out of here! You runt!
You fucking son of a bitch!

124
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:06,017
Volodya!

125
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,376
Volodya, what are you doing?

126
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,849
- I'm just sitting here.
- Come down.

127
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,739
- I'm just sitting here.
- Come down, please.

128
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,699
- Come down!
- I don’t want to.

129
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,169
- Come down.
- No, I won’t.

130
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,979
- Come down.
- Alright, alright...

131
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:24,098
Hey, you want to go for a ride?

132
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,819
- No.
- 100 crowns.

133
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,698
- Piss off!
- 200.

134
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,498
- Go to hell!
- You're not that pretty...

135
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:35,411
- Fuck off, you asshole!
- I can ask, can't I?

136
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:43,057
I must get out of here.
Anything, but not this.

137
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,568
- Good night.
- Are you going home?

138
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:52,015
- I'm tired, I'm going home.
- Can't I stay over at your place?

139
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:56,455
- No.
- Why not? It's so cold outside.

140
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,527
I can't go home. I've been thrown out.

141
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:05,170
Dad went crazy. I don't know why.

142
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:08,373
Please... Lilya.

143
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,855
I can sleep on the floor.

144
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:19,205
You can sleep on the sofa. But
no funny stuff or I'll throw you out.

145
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,331
You know what I'm thinking?

146
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:29,885
That we’re like a real family.
We're sitting having dinner...

147
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,763
...I come home from work
and you've baked bread.

148
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:44,249
Lilya...? What do you think would have
happened if I'd been two years older?

149
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:47,052
Cut it out...

150
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,443
Seriously...

151
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:54,563
Don't talk like that... it's stupid.

152
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:59,084
You know what?
I did think of jumping.

153
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,970
- Really?
- Yeah.

154
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:04,521
- Why?
- 'Cause all of this is bullshit.

155
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,125
I don’t want to live anymore.

156
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,804
Yeah, you do!

157
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,202
Course you want to!

158
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,524
You saved my life.
Now I'm gonna save yours.

159
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,083
A packet of Wall Street, please.

160
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,726
27, please.

161
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,127
I'll just have the potato chips
and cigarettes.

162
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:01,879
Put the juice back where it belongs.

163
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:08,685
Come back!

164
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:19,963
You didn't get any letters today.
I think your mother's forgotten you.

165
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:39,035
No, I want to sit here...

166
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:43,516
It just takes a few minutes.

167
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:48,632
Okay if they're young guys,
but if they're disgusting old men...

168
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,079
On the other hand it's much quicker.
One, two and it's over!

169
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:55,757
Then you get the money
and can buy a dress or something.

170
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:59,401
No, never. It's horrible!

171
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:07,276
Let's go!

172
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,863
- How was it?
- Okay.

173
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:43,027
I'm freezing! Tell me how it was.

174
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:46,344
Forget it. Let's get home, it's so cold!

175
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:06,024
- Who is it?
- Natasha.

176
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:21,789
I came to give you the money back.
I don’t need it.

177
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,067
Okay... Bye.

178
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,302
Natasha!

179
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:37,858
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:43,749
- Tell me what the hell's going on?
- Let's go over there and I'll explain.

181
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:47,019
So. What's happening?

182
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:50,780
Like... my dad found the money...

183
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:54,179
And I thought it didn't make
any difference to you.

184
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:57,786
What doesn't make
any difference to me?

185
00:26:57,947 --> 00:27:01,940
You don’t have any parents.
I mean, your mom's in the States.

186
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:05,782
What doesn’t make
any difference to me?

187
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,623
Like... I told dad
that it was your money.

188
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:14,984
- That you did what I did.
- You said that I did it?

189
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:22,378
Yeah, you know. If my dad
had known, he would have killed me!

190
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:26,333
- You've got a screw loose!
- What difference does it make to you?!

191
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:29,975
- You're moving to the States...
- I thought you were my friend!

192
00:27:30,145 --> 00:27:33,854
- Then you say things like that!
- Natasha...

193
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:39,694
Let's go... Come on.

194
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:42,498
I don’t need your money.

195
00:27:42,664 --> 00:27:45,258
Keep your money! Whore!

196
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:07,614
LILYA

197
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:15,054
Guys, let's have fun.

198
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:19,460
It's our little whore!
Fucking slut! What you doing here?

199
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:23,011
Get the fuck out of here. You rat!

200
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,137
You selling yourself to kids?

201
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,576
- Forget them. Let's go.
- That's just what I'm doing.

202
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,971
Cunt! What are you doing there?
Come here!

203
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,732
- How's business?
- The little guy, is he a new client?

204
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:41,208
- Let's go.
- I'm not finished yet.

205
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:43,574
She's a dumb ass, she doesn't get it...

206
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:47,618
- Come, let's get out of here.
- I haven't finished writing yet.

207
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,814
Get out of our yard,
we don't wanna see your face!

208
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:57,735
LILYA4-EVER

209
00:28:58,898 --> 00:29:00,570
Now, I'm done. Let's go...

210
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,014
Stay there!

211
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,896
Where the hell are you going?!

212
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:12,085
You fucking piece of trash,
go slit your throat, you cunt!

213
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:24,530
- You won't eat anything warm today.
- What?

214
00:29:24,736 --> 00:29:30,652
- The Electricity Board cut you off.
- What?!

215
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,330
Damn...

216
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,086
Anna!

217
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:52,485
- No one's there. Your aunt has moved.
- She's moved?

218
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:56,164
Yes. My God, you've grown.

219
00:30:56,328 --> 00:31:00,401
- I remember when you were this small.
- What? Where's she moved?

220
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,440
Open up, I know you’re in there!

221
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,444
How are you? You happy here?

222
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:25,275
I'm an old and sick woman.
I need a comfortable home.

223
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,357
You understand?

224
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:35,401
- Have you spoken to mom?
- No.

225
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:43,161
- Has she written or called?
- She hasn’t written or called.

226
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:46,316
Let me watch TV in peace...

227
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:53,482
- I don’t have any money.
- Neither do I.

228
00:31:54,404 --> 00:31:58,522
They've cut off the electricity
and I've got nothing to eat.

229
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,198
- Get a job.
- How can I, I'm in school?

230
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:05,514
So, do what your mother did.

231
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:11,201
Go into town and spread your legs.
Now leave me in peace.

232
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,918
<i>Shut the door!</i>

233
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,393
- You know what?
- What?

234
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,188
I read in a magazine-

235
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:00,275
- About when different stars are born.
I'm born the same day as Britney Spears.

236
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:05,228
- Really?
- Yeah... but four years apart.

237
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:08,356
- But you have the same birthday?
- Yeah...

238
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:14,708
Imagine if you were mixed up in hospital,
then you'd be Britney Spears.

239
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:20,115
But we’re not born in the same year
and she lives in the States.

240
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:23,155
But think how cool it would have been...

241
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,634
Yeah, sure...

242
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:31,147
- You know when my birthday is?
- No.

243
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:34,069
- Today.
- Really?

244
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:37,269
- You're not kidding?
- No...

245
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,505
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

246
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:42,269
Did you get any presents?

247
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:47,828
I promise I'll get you a nice present.

248
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,713
I swear... But not today.

249
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:54,105
I didn't know it was your birthday
and I've got no money.

250
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:58,023
- But you’ll get a real present from me.
- You don’t have to.

251
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,344
Yeah, I'm giving you a present.

252
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:22,305
- Are you going to school?
- No... and you?

253
00:34:22,552 --> 00:34:23,541
No.

254
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:27,462
- What you gonna do?
- I have to do laundry.

255
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:29,508
I've got no clean clothes.

256
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:34,146
But I don’t have any washing powder.
I don’t know.

257
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,068
Look...

258
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,549
- Shall we try some?
- Volodya, stop it.

259
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,901
- Let's try them.
- Volodya, you can't...

260
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,947
Volodya, put it back. Don’t touch it.

261
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:59,707
Put it away.

262
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:01,979
Volodya! Stop it!

263
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:05,697
Did you swallow them?

264
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,979
Volodya, did you swallow them?

265
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:13,702
What is it?

266
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:18,500
What is it? Volodya!

267
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:26,863
Don’t leave! Volodya... Volodya!

268
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,745
Don't die, please, Volodya!

269
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:34,700
A kiss?

270
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,097
I must have been in heaven...

271
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:44,414
- I've turned into an angel.
- Get out, go to hell, you moron!

272
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:48,175
- Go to hell!
- Sorry...

273
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:51,064
Idiot! Get out!

274
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,102
- Get out!
- Sorry...

275
00:36:11,623 --> 00:36:14,183
FOR SALE

276
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:23,973
- Do you want to buy anything?
- There's nothing to buy here!

277
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,450
Hi...

278
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,374
Are you still angry?

279
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,736
Forgive me, I'll never do it again...

280
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,008
How's it going?

281
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,409
Have you sold anything?

282
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:07,130
Not a bloody thing. Fucking crap!

283
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:12,694
You do that again
and I'll really kill you!

284
00:37:14,138 --> 00:37:16,447
- Shall we go to the Pentagon?
- The Pentagon?

285
00:37:16,618 --> 00:37:21,214
- The submarine base.
- I know. What shall we do there?

286
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:24,096
I've got some glue there.

287
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:27,292
- I live there.
- You live there?

288
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:30,415
Well, when they throw me
out of the house.

289
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:39,409
My dad worked here.
He was in the army.

290
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:42,044
My mom also worked here.

291
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:56,446
- My mom worked in this kitchen.
- Your mother cooked food?

292
00:37:57,894 --> 00:37:59,964
And your dad?

293
00:38:00,134 --> 00:38:04,286
He was in the army
and came here for a little while...

294
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:07,574
He probably just wanted
to sleep with my mom.

295
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:11,773
Then she got pregnant
and he moved to Moscow.

296
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:16,532
She wrote to him, but he didn't answer.
I've never seen him.

297
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:22,124
Come on, I'm freezing.

298
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:36,402
"Speech given by the General
Secretary, Comrade Brezhnev..."

299
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:42,441
"Comrade members of the Central
Committee, comrade delegates..."

300
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,286
"Comrades. 50 years ago an event of
great historical importance took place."

301
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,119
"Prolonged and thundering applause.
Everyone stands up."

302
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,638
I live here. Look, this is my room.

303
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,646
See, I've got glue.

304
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:13,927
Take it.

305
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,758
I'm freezing...

306
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,399
We can build a hut.

307
00:40:30,522 --> 00:40:32,956
What hut?

308
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:36,880
To get warm.

309
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,389
It's warmer, isn’t it?

310
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,069
It's like lying in a coffin.

311
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,951
Let's pretend we’re dead.

312
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,474
No, thanks...

313
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,035
What do you think happens
when someone dies?

314
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:22,067
Does he go to paradise,
to God and Jesus and all of that?

315
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:26,308
I don’t know...

316
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:32,315
I believe that.
I think you become an angel in heaven.

317
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:39,307
You can play basketball all daylong
and score as many points as you like.

318
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:43,025
And be a million times better
than Michael Jordan.

319
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:47,150
That's bullshit...

320
00:41:47,356 --> 00:41:50,985
That's not the only thing
you can do there.

321
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:53,386
You can do what you like in paradise.

322
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:57,912
Dance, play computer games,
go to parties...

323
00:41:58,075 --> 00:42:02,512
That's stupid. I'm not going to die,
I'm going to America.

324
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:06,148
I'd play basketball.

325
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:13,151
- Cut it out.
- What are you doing?

326
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:18,950
- I feel sick...
- Where you going?

327
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:20,228
Stop it...

328
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:25,662
I don’t want to be here anymore.
I'm tired of this...

329
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:45,340
SUMMONS TO SOCIAL WELFARE

330
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:50,347
So you've had no contact with your
mother since she moved to America?

331
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:54,026
- No.
- And she hasn't called?

332
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,346
I don’t have a telephone.

333
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,707
- She hasn’t written?
- No.

334
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:06,541
We've received a letter from her.
Do you know anything about this?

335
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,745
No. Why?

336
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,184
In the letter she writes...

337
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:15,468
Of course it's not legally binding.

338
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:18,018
You can’t formally do this...

339
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:22,546
But she writes
that she renounces her parenthood.

340
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:29,424
This means that she no longer wishes
to be your guardian.

341
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:32,703
Guardian? What are you talking about?

342
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:38,066
Look, I really feel sorry for you,
but here she writes...

343
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:39,455
I can read it to you.

344
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:42,346
"Lilya has always been
an unwanted child"-

345
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:46,659
- "and therefore
I no longer wish to be her guardian."

346
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:50,102
"I hereby hand her over
to the care of the Social Services."

347
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:52,940
It's awful, I understand...

348
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:55,097
It's awful.

349
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,599
And cigarettes, please.

350
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,802
That'll be 160,40.

351
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:21,001
Thanks.

352
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:24,808
- Close your eyes.
- What?

353
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:26,118
Close your eyes.

354
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:31,042
- What for?
- Please, close your eyes.

355
00:47:31,128 --> 00:47:34,564
- What you going to do?
- Nothing special, just do it.

356
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:40,476
What you going to do?
Are you going to hit me?

357
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:44,118
- Don’t be silly. Just close your eyes.
- You promise?

358
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:46,924
Lilya, where you going?

359
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:52,878
Keep them closed... Now you can look.

360
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:57,758
- There you are. For your birthday.
- Is it really for me?

361
00:47:58,566 --> 00:48:02,684
- Take it!
- Really? You're kidding...

362
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,837
- You're jerking me around...
- No.

363
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:08,953
- It's mine? You're sure? Mine? Yeah?
- Yeah...

364
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:17,834
- Thanks...
- I promised you.

365
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:21,441
I never got anything as nice.

366
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:39,477
- Where did you get the money?
- I found it on the street.

367
00:48:39,643 --> 00:48:43,636
- No... really?
- Doesn’t matter. Mom sent money.

368
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,600
It's mine! Mine!

369
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:58,035
Try to take it if you can.

370
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,144
Hello.

371
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:38,505
- How you doing?
- Go to hell!

372
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,389
What happened?

373
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:49,827
You're freezing, it's cold...

374
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:54,865
- Where do you live? You want a lift?
- Go away!

375
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:58,668
Don’t be afraid, I won't touch you.
I'll just take you home.

376
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:02,221
You can’t walk around here at night,
it's a dangerous area.

377
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,184
Don’t be afraid, I won’t touch you.

378
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:08,541
I'm just a normal guy.

379
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:31,662
By the way, my name’s Andrei.

380
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,500
I'm Lilya.

381
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:37,822
Pleased to meet you.

382
00:51:42,388 --> 00:51:45,460
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

383
00:51:59,107 --> 00:52:03,225
What were you doing so late
in such a dangerous neighborhood?

384
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,385
- Doesn’t matter...
- Okay, doesn’t matter.

385
00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:12,061
- How old are you?
- 16.

386
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:15,855
Then you're a big girl,
but it’s still dangerous.

387
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:18,334
I'd advise you not to walk there.

388
00:52:25,864 --> 00:52:28,776
Well...
you going to get into my bed now?

389
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:32,459
What are you on about?
I'm not going to sleep with you.

390
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:36,858
Why'd you give me a lift?

391
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:39,697
- I just did.
- You think I'm stupid?

392
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:42,855
No, I don't. I just wanted to be nice.

393
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,336
I saw you and just wanted to help.

394
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:49,336
So you think I'm ugly?

395
00:52:49,782 --> 00:52:52,774
I don't think you're ugly...

396
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:55,297
You're really pretty.

397
00:52:56,462 --> 00:52:59,613
But I'm not going to sleep with you.

398
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,817
That wasn't why I...

399
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:09,696
Okay. Sorry... Thanks for the lift.

400
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,049
Take care...

401
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,414
Wait!

402
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,979
Wait...

403
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:35,167
I thought may be...
maybe we could meet sometime?

404
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:38,897
Just meet...

405
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:43,018
We could go somewhere... see a movie...
I don’t know. But no funny stuff.

406
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:45,130
No funny stuff?

407
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:49,456
Exactly...
Just don't get any ideas.

408
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:55,966
Okay.

409
00:53:56,257 --> 00:53:59,215
Great. Cool...

410
00:54:08,056 --> 00:54:09,808
Hi.

411
00:54:10,256 --> 00:54:13,612
What are you doing here?
Hell, you scared me!

412
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:16,892
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

413
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:19,771
Sorry, I scared you.

414
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:25,133
Could I... sleep over at your place?

415
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:27,646
Okay.

416
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:30,695
Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.

417
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:37,813
He just wants to sleep with you.

418
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,249
No he doesn't.

419
00:54:40,414 --> 00:54:43,406
Course he wants to.

420
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:47,122
No he doesn't. He's nice.

421
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,563
Don’t believe it.

422
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:54,043
- You're just jealous.
- Not at all.

423
00:54:54,212 --> 00:54:57,090
- Course you are.
- Not at all.

424
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:01,688
- But of course you are.
- No, I'm not.

425
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:09,289
He just wants to sleep with you.

426
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:20,329
He just wants to sleep with you.

427
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,365
Mom!

428
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:36,558
No!

429
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:38,684
Shit!

430
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:42,284
Shit!

431
00:56:42,244 --> 00:56:45,395
- You want some more?
- Yes.

432
00:56:45,564 --> 00:56:47,919
- Pie or ice-cream?
- Ice-cream.

433
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:51,120
Ice-cream? I'll get it.

434
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,558
- There you go.
- Thanks.

435
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,593
Total fucking shit!

436
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,197
Now I can understand
why my mother left.

437
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,474
There's nothing to do here.

438
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:42,229
- Let's go to Sweden.
- What?

439
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,711
We take our things and go... now!
Don’t you believe me?

440
00:57:48,078 --> 00:57:52,037
- You're kidding.
- Of course I am. Not now. In a week.

441
00:57:52,878 --> 00:57:57,508
I live in Sweden, I work there.
I'm only here on holiday.

442
00:57:57,878 --> 00:58:01,234
I leave in a week.
You can come with me.

443
00:58:03,477 --> 00:58:07,231
I can get a job and a flat
for you there.

444
00:58:07,397 --> 00:58:11,788
It'd be cool... Haven’t you ever
thought of leaving here?

445
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:15,786
This country is shit.
There's nothing to do here.

446
00:58:16,636 --> 00:58:21,630
Sweden is a paradise compared
to here. You can really relax there.

447
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:24,954
And the people...
Even the people are different.

448
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,873
They're kind, not like here.

449
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:33,106
Besides, you can earn
really good money.

450
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:38,231
You know, in one month you can earn
what a doctor makes here in a year.

451
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:42,468
- That can’t be true!
- Yes it is, really!

452
00:58:42,634 --> 00:58:46,468
Look at it here... People are crazy!

453
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:49,273
You know what my cousin did?

454
00:58:50,633 --> 00:58:53,989
He sold one of his kidneys
because he didn't have money.

455
00:58:55,113 --> 00:58:57,707
Would you sell a kidney?

456
00:58:59,713 --> 00:59:02,671
You don't deserve a life like that.

457
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:17,791
- What happened to the ball?
- Dad broke it.

458
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:21,939
- Broke it?
- Just punctured it.

459
00:59:23,431 --> 00:59:26,389
- Why?
- With scissors.

460
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:31,341
- Why?
- I don’t know. He went crazy.

461
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,983
I'll fix it...

462
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,621
<i>Open up! It's the police!</i>

463
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,424
Is it really the police?

464
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:48,342
<i>Open or we'll break the door r down!</i>

465
00:59:52,268 --> 00:59:55,305
- Hi there! How are things?
- What do you want?

466
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:57,499
- Come here!
- What do you want?

467
00:59:57,668 --> 01:00:00,228
- Get out!
- Stop it!

468
01:00:42,904 --> 01:00:45,976
I don't give a shit about them.
They're assholes.

469
01:00:46,304 --> 01:00:48,818
I'm getting out of here soon anyway.

470
01:00:52,744 --> 01:00:54,780
You want some glue?

471
01:01:02,823 --> 01:01:05,815
- You know what?
- No.

472
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:08,816
I'm going to get you a job in Sweden.

473
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:14,452
Really, I swear.
I don’t want to leave you here alone.

474
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:17,657
I'll talk to Andrei.

475
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,734
I'm so glad you're coming to Sweden.

476
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,137
We'll get a really big flat...
with an enormous bathroom...

477
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,970
Everything you want.

478
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,454
There's something
I want to ask you.

479
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:09,287
I have a friend
and I wanted to ask you whether...

480
01:02:10,377 --> 01:02:13,016
Later, later...
We'll talk about it later.

481
01:02:14,017 --> 01:02:16,326
Later, later...

482
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:45,973
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid?

483
01:02:46,134 --> 01:02:48,011
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid?

484
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:52,087
- Yes, you are!
- You can leave if I'm stupid.

485
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:56,447
- And why am I stupid?
- 'Cause that guy's tricking you.

486
01:02:56,614 --> 01:02:59,606
- Tricking me?
- Yes, he really is...

487
01:02:59,893 --> 01:03:02,930
- No way!
- Course he is.

488
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:05,653
In what way?

489
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:09,886
He talks about jobs in Sweden,
but he just wants to sleep with you.

490
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:14,041
- In reality, there'll be no job.
- Course there will be!

491
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:18,491
I promise I'll get you a job
in Sweden. I’ll talk to Andrei.

492
01:03:18,892 --> 01:03:22,043
Haven’t you talked to him yet?

493
01:03:22,772 --> 01:03:26,526
- I forgot.
- You said you'd talk to him.

494
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:29,728
Sorry, I forgot!
I’ll talk to him, I promise.

495
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:33,201
- Were you doing something else?
- Stop it, I’ll talk to him.

496
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:38,847
- What job is it?
- Something with vegetables.

497
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:43,083
- Vegetables?
- Picking them or something...

498
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:46,925
Picking? In winter?
Vegetables don't grow in winter.

499
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,445
So?
Maybe it's warmer in Sweden.

500
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:52,999
- You know where Sweden is?
- Roughly.

501
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:57,560
- Where?
- I don't know exactly...

502
01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:01,725
...but somewhere in the EU...
or whatever it's called.

503
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:06,006
And you, what do you know?!

504
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:11,238
- You're just jealous.
- Of him? Jealous? No.

505
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:14,206
- You're jealous. Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

506
01:04:14,367 --> 01:04:16,756
- Course you are.
- No...

507
01:04:16,927 --> 01:04:18,679
- Yes.
- No.

508
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,717
Course I'm not.

509
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:46,873
- Is it for me?
- Yes, who else?

510
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:50,117
- What is it?
- Open it, you'll see.

511
01:04:52,364 --> 01:04:54,594
A passport?

512
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:57,278
- Look at the last page.
- What's there?

513
01:04:59,164 --> 01:05:01,678
Now your name is Katya.

514
01:05:02,803 --> 01:05:06,034
- Why?
- There could be problems at the border.

515
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:08,592
You're not 18 yet.

516
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:12,240
It's so they won't ask
unnecessary questions.

517
01:05:14,763 --> 01:05:18,073
By the way, I rang my boss.

518
01:05:18,242 --> 01:05:21,678
He said you could start on Monday.

519
01:05:21,842 --> 01:05:25,630
- Monday? This Monday?
- Yes, this Monday.

520
01:05:25,962 --> 01:05:28,430
We go on Sunday.

521
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:41,437
I have... to ask you something.

522
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,593
Could you get a job for another person?

523
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,633
I don’t know.

524
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,191
It's for my friend,
a friend that means a lot to me.

525
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,475
I don't want him to be here alone.

526
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:01,235
I'll ask... I'll look into it...

527
01:06:01,399 --> 01:06:04,550
It's not entirely out of the question.

528
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,313
You're too good!

529
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:13,476
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Natasha? This is Lilya.</i>

530
01:06:13,878 --> 01:06:16,597
I'm moving
with my boyfriend to Sweden.

531
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:20,546
You'll be left in this shithole.
That's how it goes, sweetie.

532
01:06:21,197 --> 01:06:23,711
We're going into a tunnel,
we might be cut off...

533
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:27,074
<i>I'm calling
from my boyfriend's mobile.</i>

534
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:53,268
Volodya! Volodya, please!

535
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:41,221
Bye, potato-hag!

536
01:07:42,871 --> 01:07:45,339
- Hi.
- Hi.

537
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,826
Jump in.

538
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,709
Volodya! Volodya...

539
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,100
- Where are you going?
- I must say goodbye.

540
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:58,941
We're in a hurry.

541
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:19,660
Listen, there's something...
a little problem.

542
01:08:20,748 --> 01:08:25,503
My grandmother's ill, and I have
to visit her before I go to Sweden.

543
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:30,498
- Aren't we going to Sweden, then?
- You go alone and I'll join you later.

544
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:36,056
I'm sorry, but it's my grandmother.
It might be the last time I see her.

545
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:38,703
- So, I'll fly alone?
- Yeah.

546
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:43,822
I talked to my boss, he'll meet you,
take you home and show you around.

547
01:08:54,905 --> 01:08:58,693
- It's time to go.
- Yes.

548
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:05,183
- We'll see each other soon?
- I told you I'll be there in two days.

549
01:09:05,344 --> 01:09:08,177
- Really?
- Really.

550
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,936
- It's time to go...
- Bye.

551
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:17,610
Getup. Getup, I said!

552
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,969
Look at him just lying here.

553
01:12:07,329 --> 01:12:10,844
Jekatarina Menyova. Katya...

554
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:18,082
19th of June 1982.

555
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,686
Good morning.

556
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,868
- Hi!
- Hello.

557
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:30,794
Come in.

558
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,068
One hour.

559
01:22:53,277 --> 01:22:56,314
Perhaps you want
to take off your jacket?

560
01:22:58,997 --> 01:23:01,306
I'll help you.

561
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:40,905
Thanks.

562
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:54,222
...but deliver us from evil.

563
01:25:54,383 --> 01:26:02,176
For thine is the Kingdom, and the power,
and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

564
01:27:03,137 --> 01:27:06,015
I want to have a doll...

565
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:11,410
...pencils to draw with,
and a pink school bag.

566
01:27:15,536 --> 01:27:17,527
Hello.

567
01:27:22,736 --> 01:27:25,534
Hello.

568
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:30,486
Sorry...

569
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:37,688
- Sorry I just left you like that.
- It doesn't matter.

570
01:27:38,174 --> 01:27:41,769
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

571
01:27:42,374 --> 01:27:45,252
You're my only friend.

572
01:27:48,254 --> 01:27:51,485
- The ball? Is it fixed?
- Yeah.

573
01:27:55,253 --> 01:27:57,972
- How are you?
- Good.

574
01:27:58,133 --> 01:28:01,205
I play basketball all day long.

575
01:28:03,372 --> 01:28:05,727
- You want to play a bit?
- No.

576
01:28:06,812 --> 01:28:10,646
- By the way, merry Christmas!
- Is it Christmas?

577
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:13,451
- Yes.
- I didn't know.

578
01:28:13,611 --> 01:28:16,000
- I've got a Christmas present for you.
- Really?

579
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:18,321
- Yeah...
- What?

580
01:28:18,491 --> 01:28:20,288
- Come.
- What? Where?

581
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:21,440
Look.

582
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:30,965
What's this?

583
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:44,084
It's your Christmas present.

584
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:47,766
- What is?
- All this. The whole world.

585
01:28:47,929 --> 01:28:52,366
The houses, cars, streets, the wind...
it's all yours.

586
01:28:52,688 --> 01:28:54,679
You can do what you like.

587
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:58,407
Sorry, but I'm not sure
it's a good present.

588
01:28:58,928 --> 01:29:00,839
It's windy...

589
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:04,000
...there's a mist. It's so cold.

590
01:29:04,487 --> 01:29:06,717
And this world isn't that good.

591
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:12,880
Now I’m jumping... and flying...

592
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:17,923
No, you can't...

593
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,554
Why not? It's up to me.

594
01:29:20,726 --> 01:29:24,002
I've had it with this life.
It's complete shit.

595
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:26,964
- No, it's not.
- Course it is. It's shit.

596
01:29:27,126 --> 01:29:30,562
- No, it's not.
- Course it is.

597
01:29:30,725 --> 01:29:35,958
But it's the only one you've got.
This life is the only one you've got.

598
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:40,164
I don't want this life.
I'm not interested.

599
01:29:42,404 --> 01:29:43,757
Look at me.

600
01:29:43,924 --> 01:29:48,600
I killed myself and went to heaven
and yeah, it's really good in heaven.

601
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:53,838
But I regret it, 'cause I wanted to live
on earth a little longer.

602
01:29:54,723 --> 01:30:00,400
You remain dead for all eternity, but
you're alive only for a brief moment.

603
01:30:02,323 --> 01:30:06,077
- I wasn't ready yet.
- Not ready?

604
01:30:06,242 --> 01:30:10,394
Remember that time
when we sat on the bench -

605
01:30:10,562 --> 01:30:12,553
- And you wrote "Lilya 4-ever"?

606
01:30:12,722 --> 01:30:16,271
And those assholes
that spat at us?

607
01:30:16,442 --> 01:30:19,514
I said that we should leave-

608
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:24,436
- But you said that you weren't ready.

609
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:29,231
You wanted to finish writing first.
Do you remember?

610
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,955
That's how it is now.

611
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,908
Everyone's spitting at you,
but you're not ready.

612
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:45,435
Jump if you want. It's not dangerous.
I'll catch you.

613
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:50,627
But then you lose. And the assholes
that spit at you win. You see?

614
01:33:50,864 --> 01:33:54,698
Hello, sweetheart.
Are you back from school already?

615
01:33:55,904 --> 01:33:58,338
Have you got homework?

616
01:33:58,544 --> 01:34:01,342
How was school today?

617
01:34:03,463 --> 01:34:05,931
I hate you.

618
01:34:09,863 --> 01:34:11,774
You think I'm your property?

619
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:14,503
I'm not your property.

620
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:18,940
You think you can buy me?

621
01:34:20,062 --> 01:34:21,893
You can't.

622
01:34:23,422 --> 01:34:25,856
You can't buy my heart and soul.

623
01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:58,416
Stop! Stop god dammit!

624
01:35:27,897 --> 01:35:29,694
Mom...

625
01:35:30,576 --> 01:35:32,726
Mom...

626
01:35:43,135 --> 01:35:45,251
Hello...

627
01:35:54,614 --> 01:35:56,844
Poor little thing...

628
01:35:58,694 --> 01:36:00,969
I've got a surprise for you.

629
01:36:01,134 --> 01:36:03,694
I don't want anymore surprises.

630
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:07,733
- The door's open.
- What?

631
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:12,045
He forgot to lock it when he left.
The door's open.

632
01:36:12,493 --> 01:36:15,530
Come on. Getup.

633
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,088
- I can't...
- Come on.

634
01:36:20,252 --> 01:36:23,881
- I just want to sleep.
- The door's open.

635
01:36:31,131 --> 01:36:34,362
You see? He forgot to lock the door.

636
01:36:34,691 --> 01:36:35,840
Go!

637
01:36:36,731 --> 01:36:39,199
Where shall I go?

638
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,595
Lilya, wait! Don't jump!

639
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,029
Don't jump! Don't do it! No!

640
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:00,909
No, please Lilya! No! I beg you!

641
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:03,035
Lilya! No!

642
01:39:13,398 --> 01:39:17,232
Girl, about 16 years old.
Fall from a height.

643
01:39:17,878 --> 01:39:19,197
One, two, three...

644
01:39:19,358 --> 01:39:23,590
General circulatory arrest.
No further details. Within five minutes.

645
01:40:04,714 --> 01:40:07,786
Can I touch you? Are you real?!

646
01:40:07,954 --> 01:40:09,706
You're real!

647
01:40:13,034 --> 01:40:16,709
I'm not going. You don't pick vegetables
in the winter, I'm no fool.

648
01:40:16,873 --> 01:40:18,306
Bye!

649
01:40:19,593 --> 01:40:23,632
You dropped your potatoes.
Let me help you.

650
01:44:28,413 --> 01:44:34,488
