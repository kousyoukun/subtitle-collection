1
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,651
Here come the wolves.

2
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,274
Uh-oh. Bottleneck.
Mr. Roosevelt
should hear of this.

3
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,361
I'm sorry. Hope you
didn't hurt yourself.

4
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,029
My friend says he's sorry.

5
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,572
Okay.

6
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,121
That just goes
to show you what
a little blonde can do

7
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,915
to hold up
national defense.

8
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,917
Nice, pleasant guy.

9
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,836
Man!

10
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,170
Gee, 100 bucks.

11
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,173
So that's
what they look like.

12
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,341
Where'd he go?

13
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,509
I don't know.

14
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,261
I wonder what his name is.

15
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,139
Wait a minute.
I saw it on the envelope.
Fry. That's it. Fry.

16
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,729
Fry.

17
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,691
How do you know
my name?

18
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,943
What do you care
how I know your name?

19
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,612
I saw it on
one of the envelopes
you dropped.

20
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,407
Here's something
that belongs to you.

21
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,248
The paint shop!
It'll go up
like dynamite!

22
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,416
Here, take this one.

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,709
What about me?
Don't I get to play, too?

24
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,210
You get another one.
All right.

25
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,515
So, I see
these two kids, see.

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,684
And I yell at them,
"The sprinklers are busted,

27
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,187
"the whole shooting
match will go up."

28
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,940
And they run right in,
the both of them.

29
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,609
And the last thing
I saw when I looked back

30
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,904
was one kid give
the extinguisher
to the other kid,

31
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,032
and then it was just
like all hell comes up.

32
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,700
That's all I see.

33
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,036
Was there
anybody else around?

34
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,038
No. Just the two kids.

35
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,083
The poor kid with
the extinguisher,

36
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,210
and the one who
gave it to him.

37
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,713
Thank you, Rogers.
We appreciate
all you've done.

38
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,548
We needn't keep you
any longer now.

39
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,468
You'd better go
and take care of
those hands.

40
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,553
Who've you got next?

41
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,847
We have a fellow,
Barry Kane, waiting.

42
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,307
Send Barry Kane in!

43
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,850
Barry Kane!

44
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,567
All right.
Just take it easy.

45
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,569
We only want to ask you
a couple of questions,

46
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,279
a matter of
a routine check-up.

47
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,156
Well, I want to do
anything I can to help.

48
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,158
Sure.

49
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,911
Now, suppose you tell us
where you were
when the fire started.

50
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,164
Well, I was one of
the first to rush in.

51
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,417
The sprinkler systems
weren't working.

52
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,002
Who else was with you?

53
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,924
There were just myself,
a fellow named Fry,
and my friend Ken Mason.

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,093
Go on.

55
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,012
Fry handed me
an extinguisher,

56
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,347
and I started running
toward the fire.

57
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,349
I gave it to Ken.

58
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,770
And then he...

59
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,690
Okay. Take it easy.
That's all.

60
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,234
Just stick around
for a while.
We may need you.

61
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,530
Send for Fry.

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,453
Get hold of
a fellow called Fry.

63
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,622
What'd they do?
Ask you a lot
of questions?

64
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,999
No. Hardly any.

65
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,045
Gee, it's awful tough going,
seeing it happen
in front of you.

66
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,379
Yeah, it is tough.

67
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,257
Ken Mason was your pal,
too, wasn't he?

68
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,259
Yeah.

69
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,054
Was he married?

70
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,597
No. He was living
with his mother.

71
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,308
Must be pretty tough on her.

72
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,727
Sorry, fellows.
I'll see you later.

73
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,506
Hello, Mrs. Mason.

74
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,135
They... They wouldn't
let me see him.

75
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,264
It's awful hard to believe.
It happened so quick.

76
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,557
Why, only this morning...

77
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,892
Please...

78
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,687
Please don't
talk about it now.

79
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,775
Anything I can do?
Could I get you something?

80
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,278
No. No, thank you.
Not now.

81
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,155
Maybe some brandy.

82
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,624
How is the poor,
dear soul?

83
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,377
If you mean Mrs. Mason,
she's feeling bad.

84
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh, well,
she has every reason to.

85
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,966
Do you know what?
They wouldn't even
let her see him.

86
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,259
Her only son.

87
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,385
Yes, I know.

88
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,804
I told her
she'd every right to
insist on seeing him.

89
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,057
I told her I would,
and she as good as
told me to get out.

90
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,477
Me that was
only trying to help
the poor, dear soul.

91
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,813
I think you can help,
if you'd tell me where
I could get some brandy.

92
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,481
It doesn't seem to be
in here.

93
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,941
You come with me,
young man.

94
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,652
It just happens that
I have a little
in the house.

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,337
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Mason,

96
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,840
but we're looking for
a guy named Barry Kane.

97
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,008
Do you know him?

98
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,467
He isn't here
right now, is he?

99
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,138
They told us at the plant
we might be able
to find him here.

100
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,932
Well, what do you
want to see him about?

101
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,726
He's in pretty
bad trouble, lady.

102
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,853
What is it?
I'd like to know.

103
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,688
He was mixed up with
that fire at the factory.

104
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,525
I... I don't understand.

105
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,695
There are a lot of things
we don't understand, either.

106
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,447
But how is Barry
involved in it?

107
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,201
That fire extinguisher.
It seems it wasn't
just an accident.

108
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,869
It turns out that
the extinguisher

109
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,871
Barry Kane handed your son
was filled with gasoline.

110
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,333
You ought to be
able to help us.

111
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,709
Give us a lead
on this guy Kane.

112
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,711
Yeah. That's why we
want to look around.

113
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,962
Well...

114
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,797
Why...

115
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,134
I can't talk about it now.

116
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,221
Yeah. Sorry,
but, you see,
there was a...

117
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,139
I wouldn't give her
too much of that
if I were you,

118
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,891
because it very often
makes people weepy.

119
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,226
I know it affected me
like that...

120
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,727
Yes, Mrs. Moore,
I've got to hurry back.

121
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,811
Thank you very much.

122
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,759
Try some of this, Mrs. Mason.
It'll make you feel better.

123
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,431
There were two
detectives just here.

124
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,016
They were looking for you.

125
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,518
For me?

126
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,603
I guess they want to ask me
some more questions.

127
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,272
I said that I'd do
anything I could to help.

128
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,856
Here. Try, please.
No.

129
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,900
That wasn't it.

130
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,486
They wanted to arrest you.

131
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,697
They said that
the fire extinguisher

132
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,241
that you handed to Kenneth
was filled with gasoline,

133
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,159
that you killed him.

134
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,871
That I killed...
Why, are they crazy?

135
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,790
Why would I want
to do a thing...

136
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,667
Why, Ken was my best friend!
Haven't they talked to Fry?

137
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,420
Haven't they asked him
about the extinguisher?

138
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,257
They said that
there was no such man
employed at the plant as Fry.

139
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,801
Why, I saw him!
I saw him twice!

140
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,637
Ken saw him, too!
He was right there
with us at the fire.

141
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,640
He handed me
the extinguisher. Ken said,
"Don't I get to play, too?"

142
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,351
He was kidding.
I handed it to him.

143
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,521
Fry was right there with us.
I'm sure!

144
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,650
Why, he must have known
there was gasoline in it.

145
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,696
He must have known!
He stood right there
with us and watched, the...

146
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,413
Please go.

147
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,627
Don't you believe me?

148
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,504
Do you think
I had something
to do with this?

149
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,966
I didn't tell
the police anything.

150
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,719
Oh, I don't know!

151
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,473
It's all so confused
and so terrible.

152
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,682
I don't know what
they're talking about!

153
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,267
Why don't they
get this fellow Fry?

154
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,562
You'd better go.

155
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,107
All right, I'll go.

156
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,611
I've got to get Fry.
I've got to find him,

157
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,613
or Ken won't be
the last one to die.

158
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,244
He must be in there.
I saw him go in the back way.

159
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,021
Catchy.

160
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,648
What?

161
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,857
That tune
you're whistling.

162
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,487
Oh, I didn't even know
I was whistling.

163
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,239
That's a sign
you must be pretty happy.

164
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,449
Easy to see there's
nothing on your mind.

165
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,412
Oops. That must
have been Junior.
It felt like him.

166
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,914
Junior?
Yeah, that rock we just got.

167
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,376
I know every one on the road
from Los Angeles to Reno.

168
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,211
Tough job, driving a truck.

169
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,547
Got any other
hot news tonight?

170
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,924
I guess I never realized
how tough it was before.

171
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,093
The tough part,
you can take that.

172
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,636
It's the monotony
that gets you.

173
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,929
I've been thinking
for a long time

174
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,389
I'm gonna get out of
this trucking game.

175
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,557
Why don't you?

176
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,850
One of the neighbors
told my wife

177
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,144
it's stylish to
eat three meals a day.

178
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,520
You married?

179
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,105
Nope.

180
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,815
Go ahead and whistle.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,777
That thing bother you?

182
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,237
What's doing it?

183
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,159
Here, stick
this wad of paper
in there, will you?

184
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,786
It's a pretty good thing
to have around
one of these extinguishers.

185
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,831
I wouldn't be without one.
Now, take the other day.

186
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,083
A big lettuce truck
turns over right down
the road here.

187
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,878
The gasoline catches
and she goes up
like a matchbox.

188
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,505
A fellow riding,
a friend of the driver's,
gets caught in it.

189
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,132
If the driver hadn't
had an extinguisher,

190
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,177
his pal would've
been fried alive
right in front of his eyes.

191
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,305
I didn't see it happen.
I never see anything happen.

192
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,140
I don't even
hear about anything,

193
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,893
except what my wife
tells me what she sees
in the moving pictures.

194
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,062
That's the way
she spends the money,
moving pictures and new hats.

195
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,148
Buys a new hat
so she can put it on
to go to the picture shows,

196
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,192
so she can take it off.

197
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,570
No, sir.
I haven't got anything
to whistle about.

198
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,822
Where're you from, bud?

199
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,157
Los Angeles.

200
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,034
Tough. You work down there?

201
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,494
Yeah. Well, I did.

202
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,745
What doing?

203
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
I was working in
an airplane factory.

204
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,998
They say that's
pretty good.

205
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,708
I was wondering
why you weren't
in the army.

206
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,834
Yeah.

207
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,169
I understand that
they all go particular

208
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,588
about the fellows they hire
in those big defense plants.

209
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,340
Well, that's
no more than right.

210
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,008
They got to be careful
they don't get blown up.

211
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,385
Yeah.

212
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,595
I understand if
a fellow would've had

213
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,847
any kind of
police record, no job.

214
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,973
Is that right?

215
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,266
Oh, I don't know.

216
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,021
Hey, buddy,
hold the wheel
a while, will you?

217
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,441
While I animate this thing.
I'm a nicotine addict.

218
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,867
Hey, watch it, bud,
will you?

219
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,954
Stay on this side of
the white line.

220
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,748
Where do you wanna get off
when we get to Springville?

221
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,375
It doesn't matter.
Just drop me in
the middle of town,

222
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,543
anywhere, when we get there.

223
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,919
Listen, the minute
you get to Springville,

224
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,295
you're in
the middle of the town.

225
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,548
And the next minute,
the place is just a memory.

226
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,384
Whole town isn't
a city block long.

227
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,302
You going to one of
those big ranches,
outside, aren't you?

228
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,512
Yeah.

229
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,681
I'd be glad to drop you off
at whatever one you want.

230
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,577
That's it!
Deep Springs Ranch.

231
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,414
Hey! Say, that's
a whale of a big place.
Got a chance of a job there?

232
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,584
Yeah.

233
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,460
I think so.

234
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,296
You ought to like it.
Nice climate.

235
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,510
The police!
Maybe something's happened!

236
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,772
I'd like to have
a little talk
with you out here.

237
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,067
Yeah, sure, sure, Officer.
Stay here a minute, buddy.
I'll be right back.

238
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,089
Hey, bud! Come on.
Everything's fixed.

239
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,304
Good night, Officer.
Can you imagine
a thing like that?

240
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,222
Cop chasing,
the sirens,
the whole works!

241
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,642
And what it's
all about is one of
my taillights went out.

242
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,144
That's the trucking game
for you in a nutshell.

243
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,821
Calling all highway patrolmen.
Calling all highway patrolmen.

244
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,532
Be on lookout for
a man named Barry Kane.

245
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:37,162
Last seen on Highway 99.
He has dark brown hair,
blue eyes,

246
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,333
height about 6'2", no hat,
around 25 years old.

247
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,337
Calling all highway patrolmen.
Calling all highway patrolmen.

248
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,884
How do you do?
Is Mr. Frank Fry here?

249
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,512
No, this is
Mr. Tobin's ranch.

250
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,766
Oh. Could I speak
to Mr. Tobin?

251
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,353
Well, I'll see.
Just a minute.
You wait here, please.

252
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,316
There.
We've got the ball.

253
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,235
Now, throw it to me.

254
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,486
A young man
to see you, sir.

255
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,072
Throw it to me.
Where is Daddy's girl?

256
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,951
What did you say, Adele?
Who wants to see me?

257
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,204
A young man, sir.
He came to ask
for a Mr. Fry.

258
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,330
Oh.

259
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,542
Well, have him come
out here, will you?

260
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,752
Yes, sir.

261
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,628
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.

262
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,297
Here comes your granddaddy.

263
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,261
Mr. Tobin will see you.
Follow me, please.

264
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,596
Hi.

265
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,602
Here we are.
The ball.

266
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,064
How do you do?
I'm Charles Tobin.

267
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,108
This is my daughter,
Mrs. Brown.

268
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,234
How do you do?
How do you do?

269
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,864
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
to excuse the informality
of this costume.

270
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,408
We're all informal out here
at Deep Springs Ranch.

271
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,368
That's one of
the rules of the place.
I see.

272
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,454
Do you want me
to take Susie with me
so you won't be disturbed?

273
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,081
No, Susie isn't gonna
disturb us at all.

274
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,500
You just let her
play right here,

275
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,918
and I'll see she
doesn't fall in the pool.

276
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,753
All right.

277
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,296
Well, shall
we sit out here?

278
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,798
Yes, sir.

279
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,051
It seems a shame
to go indoors
on such a beautiful day.

280
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,511
Yes, it does.

281
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,888
You wanted to see me
about something, huh?

282
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,475
Yes, sir. I'm looking
for a man named Fry,
Frank Fry.

283
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,103
I met him up in Los Angeles.
I understand he lives here.

284
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,190
Oh, no, no. Fry, huh?

285
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,192
Frank Fry?

286
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,362
I'm afraid I don't know
anybody by that name.

287
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,656
Wait a minute. Fry.

288
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,784
No, no. I've heard
that name somewhere.

289
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,661
I just don't seem to
be able to place it.

290
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,787
Uh-huh.

291
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,582
There used to be
a fellow with a name
something like that,

292
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,417
worked around here.

293
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,672
No. No. It wasn't Fry.

294
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,715
Well, I'm afraid
you found
the wrong address.

295
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,133
It couldn't be
one of the cowhands,

296
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,510
or maybe somebody
who is working...

297
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,596
No. No. I know
the names of all my men.

298
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,641
Wait a minute.
My next door neighbor...

299
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,562
Well, next door neighbor,
he lives 20 miles from here.

300
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,772
But he may know your friend.
I'll telephone him.

301
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,232
Oh, no, please don't.
No! Not at all.

302
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,776
You look as though
you've had
a hard journey.

303
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,320
It's just too bad
you had to come
all this way for nothing.

304
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,489
Now, if you'll just
wait a minute,
at least we can find out.

305
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:03,118
Will you see that Susie
doesn't fall into the pool?

306
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,202
Yes, sir.

307
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,328
Thank you.

308
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,169
Hey. Come here.

309
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,630
Come over here.

310
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,971
Oh, so you're
a ballplayer, are you?
Wanna throw me the ball?

311
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,974
Let me have it.
Come on. Throw me the ball.

312
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,768
That's right. Throw me
the other one. Come on.

313
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:32,022
Throw it to me.
Come on. Give me the ball.

314
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,902
That's fine. Fine!
Now, I'll throw it back.

315
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,779
Where are you going?
Uh-oh. Don't do that.

316
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,241
Leave those where they are.
Leave them right there.

317
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,102
You wanna be a good girl?
Put these back
where you found them.

318
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,063
No, no, Susie.
The gentleman says

319
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,023
put them back
where you found them.

320
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,193
The gentleman knows
that you must be
very careful with letters

321
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,570
that don't belong to you.

322
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,281
Probably I'm prejudiced,
but it seems to me

323
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,201
that Susie is
a pretty cute
young lady.

324
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,288
Yeah, she's great.
Where's Frank Fry?

325
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, really, you must
do something about
that memory of yours.

326
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,835
You know that
it wasn't a minute ago

327
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,129
that you read
a telegram that
Fry sent me.

328
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,424
And it said that
he was on his way
to Soda City.

329
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,968
Don't you remember that?

330
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,469
Where's Soda City?

331
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,472
Well, I haven't
given it much thought,
but I wouldn't imagine

332
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,433
there'd be an overabundance
of Soda Citys on the map.

333
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,560
I suppose there's some
way of finding out...

334
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,729
...bringing you
last-minute headlines.

335
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,649
Los Angeles. The fire in
the Stewart Aircraft Works,

336
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,734
in which one man was killed,
many injured,

337
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,153
and half a million dollars
worth of damage caused,

338
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,031
has been definitely
set down to sabotage.

339
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,367
Police have traced
the incendiary origin
of the blaze

340
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,953
to Barry Kane,
former aircraft...

341
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,038
Don't want
any more of that.

342
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,000
You'd think you'd be
rather bored with
descriptions of yourself.

343
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,419
Or maybe you'll never
get tired of them.

344
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,586
Well, I am, by this time.

345
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,631
I've been listening
to those radio reports
all morning.

346
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,425
All right, you knew me.
What about it?

347
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,553
Oh, quite a lot
about it, Mr. Kane.
You ought to know that.

348
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:30,140
You've become too famous
to remain so modest.

349
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,310
Tell me one thing.
Why are you
covering up Frank Fry?

350
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,521
What's a man like you
in this for?

351
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,857
Well, young man,
I don't know what
you're talking about.

352
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,525
I think maybe you do!

353
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,362
Frank Fry is
a saboteur who doesn't mind
killing Americans for money.

354
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,990
You must watch
yourself, Mr. Kane.

355
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,034
I'm telling you this
for your own benefit,

356
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,746
but you have the makings
of an outstanding bore.

357
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,997
You can't get away
with this, Tobin!

358
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,207
Even if I don't stop you,
there'll be others who will.

359
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,502
A man like you can't last
in a country like this.

360
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,381
Very pretty speech.
Youthful, passionate,
idealistic.

361
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,594
You see, I've already
sent for the police.

362
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,346
You can't bluff me.
You're hooked,
and you know it.

363
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,976
Must I remind you that
you are the fugitive
from justice, and not I?

364
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,812
I'm a prominent citizen,
widely respected.

365
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,522
You are an obscure
young workman,

366
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:23,526
wanted for the committing
of an extremely
unpopular crime.

367
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,362
Now, which of us do you think
the police will believe, hmm?

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,910
Oh, you must think me
a very poor host, Mr. Kane.

369
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,997
Now, don't you feel
that a long cold drink
is indicated?

370
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,541
Well, I guess
I've found out everything
you're gonna tell me.

371
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,960
I'll have to go on now
and do the rest by myself.

372
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,837
You mean you wish
to leave us?

373
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,423
Adele, Adele!
Mr. Kane is going!

374
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,845
I'm sorry.
You'll stop, please.

375
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,138
What does that shoot? Water?

376
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,431
Bullets, I'm afraid.

377
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,059
You shouldn't be
so anxious
to leave us, Mr. Kane.

378
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,519
You'll hurt our feelings.

379
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,355
You make it very hard for me
to refuse your invitations.

380
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,774
Susie, come on.

381
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,067
No, no, Susie!
Come here.

382
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,028
Hello, Susie.
You know where
we're going?

383
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,446
We're going for
a piggyback ride.

384
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,740
That's right.
You like piggyback rides?

385
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:23,837
Dick, Joe! Get after him!
Hurry up! Get him!
Get after him! Hurry up!

386
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,399
Come on. Get going.

387
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,733
Wait a minute.
You can't take me
away like this!

388
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,319
Don't tell us what
we can't do, chum.
Go on, get started.

389
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,029
I tell you,
you've got to
get him!

390
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,823
Just because
he's got a big ranch
and a fancy pool

391
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,449
and a lovely house
doesn't mean
he's a nice guy.

392
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,201
Why don't you find out
the kind of things
he's been doing?

393
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,371
Sure, sure.
We know all about that.
Just come on along.

394
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,081
The baby had the letters,
I tell you.

395
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,500
Oh, of course,
Susie would be only
too glad to cooperate,

396
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,960
but, you see, it'll
be quite a few months

397
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,712
before she'll be
of any assistance.

398
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,343
No, no, Susie.

399
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,305
Those are not for Susie.
Those are for the gentleman.

400
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,223
All right, let's go.

401
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,898
Where're we going?

402
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,610
We're gonna let you
get a little idea
of the county jail.

403
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,570
You won't find it
the best in the West.

404
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,614
But it won't
hurt you to rough it
for a couple of days

405
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,282
till they come up
from Los Angeles for you.

406
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,491
You can't hold me
without a warrant.

407
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,452
Chum, do I have to
keep asking you

408
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,204
not to tell us
what we can't do?

409
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,247
I'm trying to explain!
You give me a break.
There isn't time!

410
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,250
Time's the one thing
you don't need to
worry about.

411
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,211
You'll have it to burn.

412
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:50,006
You'll have 20 years,
nice and quiet,
if you get the right lawyer.

413
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,509
And if you don't,
you'll have
all the time there is.

414
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,764
What's wrong, Mac?
What's holding us up?

415
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,724
Truck ahead,
blocking the whole road.

416
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,101
Looks like they're
changing a tire.

417
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,396
Got a cigarette?

418
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,273
Sure. All you want.

419
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,113
Hiya, bud!
Hey, what's the matter?

420
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,535
He went behind
those rocks!

421
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,415
Not over here.

422
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,923
There he goes!

423
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,259
There he is!

424
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,819
Hello there.

425
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,864
Hello.
I got caught in this storm.
I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid.

426
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,242
Maybe you'd like to
come inside and get dry.

427
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,244
Did you leave your car
down on the road?

428
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,246
Why don't you bring it up
and put it in the shed?

429
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,748
I'm afraid
it won't do it any good
standing in the rain.

430
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:15,086
I don't have any car.
You might say
I'm traveling by thumb.

431
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
By thumb?
Yeah, I'm a hitchhiker.

432
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh, I see.

433
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,258
I've always
thought that,

434
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,552
that was the best way to
learn about this country

435
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,054
and the surest test
of the American heart.

436
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,764
Yes, I guess it is.

437
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,766
Will you go to the fire
and dry your clothes?

438
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,934
Thanks. Thanks.

439
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,562
I think that
they'd dry more quickly
if you hung them up

440
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,021
and put on
something of mine.

441
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,773
Oh, no, thanks!
This is fine.

442
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,025
We could do with
another log on the fire.

443
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,318
Would you?

444
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,864
Why, sure.

445
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,199
You must stay
until this blows over.

446
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:49,537
It won't detain you long.
These autumn storms
are short.

447
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,874
They yield to none
in wetness,
but they are short.

448
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,333
Yes, I...

449
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,462
I'm sorry,
I should have warned you.

450
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,964
Those logs are
heavier than you'd think.

451
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,591
I drop them constantly.

452
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,305
Yes, they are heavy.

453
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,099
I guess I was too smart
trying to pick it up
with one hand.

454
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:14,228
Good job it didn't
land on your foot.
That often happens to me.

455
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,813
You're lucky.

456
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,484
Yeah. I'm lucky.

457
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,153
Oh, I was forgetting.
My name is Phillip Martin.

458
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,239
Oh, I'm Barry... Mason.

459
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,658
I'm glad you found
yourself near here,
Mr. Mason,

460
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,452
when the storm came.

461
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,996
It's a pleasant thing
to have a guest
sharing the fire

462
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,498
when the rain
is beating on the roof.

463
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,249
You live here alone,
do you, sir?

464
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,503
Yes. Except
I really don't think of it
in that way.

465
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,839
You see, sounds are
my light and my colors.

466
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,761
My music, for example.
I compose a little.

467
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,513
And there's nobody
to tell me that

468
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,015
the results are
anything but brilliant,

469
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,186
so I live in
a comfortable glow
of self-appreciation.

470
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,982
I'm afraid I prefer
playing the works
of other composers.

471
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,527
Undoubtedly, you'd prefer
listening to them.

472
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,196
I used to play the triangle
in our high school band.

473
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,697
Of course that was
a long time ago.

474
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,282
Oh, that's too bad.

475
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,368
It's unfortunate
when you let yourself

476
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,787
get out of practice
on the triangle.

477
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,540
The piano is a boon to me.

478
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,209
The piano can't know
that you're blind,

479
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,713
so it doesn't embarrass you
by trying to make things
easier for you.

480
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,967
It does you
the compliment
to trust you.

481
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,512
Delius,
the British composer,
was blind too.

482
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,973
That's our only resemblance.

483
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,809
This is his Summer
Night on the River.

484
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,984
A very interesting effect,
obligato on an apple.

485
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,194
Oh, I apologize, Mr. Mason.

486
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,322
I forgot how
hungry you must be
after your long walk.

487
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,907
Just a moment.
I'll get something.

488
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,828
Oh, no. Thanks.
This is fine.
I like apples.

489
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,123
So do I.
We'll save them for dessert.

490
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,843
It was all ready, you see.

491
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,680
All I needed was a reminder
that I was hungry, too.

492
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,973
Are you dry enough?

493
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,349
Just about, sir.

494
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,269
It stopped raining.

495
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,774
Is that a car coming?

496
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,359
Two cars, I think.

497
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,944
Excuse me.

498
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:36,287
One car is my niece's.
I'd know the sound of
that motor anywhere.

499
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,622
The other is
a stranger to me.

500
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,789
There's a couple
of men in it.

501
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,499
The girl's standing
beside it, pointing
down the road.

502
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,751
They must've
asked her where to go.

503
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,254
This is an easy country
to lose your way in.
That's one of its charms.

504
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,465
The car is moving.
It's starting off
down the road now.

505
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,591
The girl's coming
up the path.

506
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,842
That's my niece.

507
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,552
She's been
staying with me.

508
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:55,348
She comes from New York
to spend a month
with me every year.

509
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,308
It's one of
my greatest pleasures.

510
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,144
Unhappily for me,
she can't stay longer.

511
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,938
After a month she finds
the quiet deafening.

512
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,316
Oh, Uncle Phillip.
Hello, old boy.

513
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,777
Uncle Phillip,
what do you think happened?

514
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,279
You didn't know
we had a guest.

515
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,240
You turned your back
and see what happens.

516
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,868
My niece, Patricia Martin,
Mr. Mason.

517
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,079
How do you do?

518
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,248
Uncle Phillip,
there was a car full of
detectives down the road.

519
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,084
They wanted to know
the way to town.

520
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,252
They're searching for a man
that got away from them.

521
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,837
It was on all the radios
and everything.

522
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,589
They said he's a really
dangerous criminal. He...

523
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,425
My dear, the police
are always
on the alarmist side.

524
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,302
But they said this man
is really dangerous.

525
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,762
I'm sure they did.

526
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,640
How could they be heroes
if he were harmless?

527
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,392
Pat, dear,
would you mind not having

528
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,435
any further quotations
from the police?

529
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:46,065
Their remarks are
always so expected.
They kill conversation.

530
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,361
You've probably seen
the face of my niece
before, Mr. Mason.

531
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,698
Why, yes.
I was wondering
where I'd seen...

532
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,826
As a matter of fact,
you've seen her
practically everywhere.

533
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,911
I'm told that
billboards she adorns

534
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,705
would reach
across the continent,

535
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,289
if placed end to end.

536
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,710
But I can't imagine
who's going to place
them end to end,

537
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,713
nor why they
should consider it
the thing to do.

538
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,256
Uncle Phillip
never has really been

539
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,550
enthusiastic over
my career as a model.

540
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,052
Oh, well,
relatives are like that.

541
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:18,139
My, aren't you two mean,
going ahead and
eating without me.

542
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,598
I'm starving.

543
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,059
Would you pass me
one of those plates,
please, Mr. Mason?

544
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh!
What's the matter, Pat?

545
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,289
Have you just
seen his handcuffs?

546
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,167
I heard them
as soon as he came in.

547
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,712
Uncle Phillip,
he must be the man
they're looking for!

548
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,881
Yes, very probably.

549
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,549
But you should have
given him to the police.

550
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,677
Are you frightened, Pat?
Is that what
makes you so cruel?

551
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,221
But you've got to!
He's a dangerous man.

552
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,098
Oh, Pat, come on.

553
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:05,352
Mr. Mason may be
many things, but he's
certainly not dangerous.

554
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,105
In fact,
I'm not at all convinced
that he's guilty.

555
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,524
Uncle Phillip,
it's your duty as
an American citizen.

556
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,152
It is my duty as
an American citizen

557
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,906
to believe a man
innocent until he's
been proved guilty.

558
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,202
Pat, don't tell me
about my duty. It makes
you sound so stuffy.

559
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,997
Besides, I have
my own ideas about
my duties as a citizen.

560
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,917
They sometimes involve
disregarding the law.

561
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,085
But what are you going
to do? What are you
going to do with him?

562
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,671
I'm going to turn him
over to you, my dear.

563
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,758
And you're going
to drive him down
to Tim, the blacksmith,

564
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:40,387
and have those
preposterous contraptions
removed from his wrists.

565
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,598
Oh, Uncle Phillip,
how could I do
a thing like that?

566
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,101
Because, you know,
I can see a great deal
farther than you can.

567
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:51,065
I can see intangible things.
For example, innocence.

568
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,983
Will you go with
my niece, Mr. Mason?

569
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,403
Oh, yes, sir!
If you don't mind?

570
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,863
But what'll I tell
the blacksmith?

571
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:01,075
Tell him Mr. Mason is
my friend and my guest.

572
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,661
He won't ask
any other questions.

573
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,415
Go ahead, Pat.

574
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,379
Go with her, Barry.
Barry, I know,
is your name.

575
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,340
Your voice explained
to me that Mason isn't.

576
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,636
But as I told you before,
names are of such
little importance.

577
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,264
I don't know how to
thank you, Mr. Martin.

578
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,516
Go ahead, Barry.
Go ahead.

579
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,978
And do the things
I wish I could do.

580
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,944
Good luck, Barry,
and for heaven's sake,

581
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,446
get back in practice
on that triangle!

582
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,121
Is the blacksmith's
shop very far?

583
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,206
Not very, right along here.

584
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,377
And is he...
Is he really all right?

585
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,546
He and my uncle
are great friends.

586
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,797
Oh.

587
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,133
I guess he's all right, then.

588
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,179
You needn't worry.
He's all right.
He's a darling blacksmith.

589
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:08,017
Only I'm not quite sure
how much experience
he's had with handcuffs.

590
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,894
Do you mind if I see them?

591
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,604
I wonder what
he'll have to do
to get them off.

592
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,316
I can't quite see.
Could you hold them
a little nearer?

593
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,652
Now I feel better.

594
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,154
I'll bet you do.

595
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,031
I'll bet this just
makes you feel great,
doesn't it?

596
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,366
In case you're interested,
the blacksmith's shop
is two miles back.

597
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,910
We're on our way
to the police.

598
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,703
Your uncle's certainly
gonna be proud of you!

599
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,830
The world isn't full of
kind old gentlemen,
like my uncle.

600
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,206
You're gonna find that out.

601
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,251
Even my uncle wouldn't
have been so kind if
he'd known more about you.

602
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,755
All right, go ahead.
What did I do?
I'd be kind of happy to know.

603
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,423
If it had been any
other sort of crime,

604
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,258
if a man had stolen
because he was starving,

605
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,260
even if a man
committed murder
to defend himself,

606
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,929
maybe I wouldn't
tell the police.

607
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,431
But there's only one reason
why a man commits sabotage.

608
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,891
That's worse than murder.

609
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,225
Surprise for you,
Miss Martin,

610
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,644
I agree with
every word you say.

611
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,895
Please don't
talk to me anymore.

612
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,271
That will be my pleasure.

613
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,819
Well! I'll see that
she doesn't!

614
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,966
Never try driving this way.
It hurts.

615
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,301
I'm stopping
the first car I see.

616
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,577
Help!

617
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,245
Come on.
I can't get along
without you.

618
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,000
Let go of me!
Help! Help!
Get the police!

619
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,337
Help!

620
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,092
My, they must be
terribly in love.

621
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,367
Looks as though
this car has been
overheated.

622
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,910
Fan's broken.

623
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,127
I'm cold.

624
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,795
Yeah, I know.
And you're hungry.

625
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,713
Now mostly I'm cold.

626
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,301
Look, if you'd stop
trying to be a hero and
decide to be on my side,

627
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,138
maybe we could do
something about
your being cold.

628
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,681
Build a fire?

629
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,643
No, I wasn't exactly
thinking of that.

630
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,356
Well, I didn't
want to insult you
by not even trying.

631
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,983
What do you want
to turn me in for?

632
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,777
Haven't you got
your picture stuck up
in enough places now?

633
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,947
I just want to do my duty.
That's hard for you
to understand.

634
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,323
Why won't you believe
I'm all right?

635
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,658
'Cause you still
don't make sense.

636
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,660
If you really hadn't
done it, you would've
gone to the police.

637
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,828
I've told you
it's a question of time!

638
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,164
If I go to the police,
it'd take me weeks
to convince them.

639
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,000
If they're as dumb
as you are,
it'll take me months.

640
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,794
Do you think we're
very far from Soda City?

641
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:50,048
I don't know.
We'll ask at the next town,
if there's a next town.

642
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,052
Well, anyway,
I don't believe
that part about Tobin.

643
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,762
You don't believe it

644
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,182
because he's got
a big ranch and
a beautiful pool and...

645
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,393
No. It's just
hard to believe that
about any American.

646
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,812
Well, you believe it
about me!

647
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,900
Well, you're different.
You look like a saboteur.

648
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,569
You have
a saboteur's disposition.

649
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,745
Don't tell me
you've decided
to be on my side.

650
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,496
No, I'm cold.

651
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,334
Say, aren't you wasting
your very valuable time,

652
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,212
sitting up here
admiring the scenery?

653
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,005
Hey, look at that.

654
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,966
Looks like
we've got company.

655
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,261
What do you suppose
all that's doing way up here?

656
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,139
They aren't moving
very fast, are they?

657
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,266
You know what we can do?

658
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,019
Oh, no, you won't.

659
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,902
Sorry, honey,
I can't take a chance.

660
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,614
You're right. I'd turn you in
at the first opportunity I get.

661
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,242
Let go of me!

662
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,826
Let me go!
Ouch!

663
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,996
Help! Help!

664
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:09,503
Won't you give me one break?
Won't you wait till
we get to Soda City?

665
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,714
All right. I'm sorry
I've got to
leave you here alone.

666
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,008
But I told you
what I've got to do,
and I'm gonna do it.

667
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,594
There's only one thing I want
to warn you about, snakes.

668
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,929
There're a lot of them
out here.

669
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,931
Of course, there's only
five or six poisonous kinds,

670
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:25,143
but there are a lot of
the long, squirmy,
slippery, slimy ones.

671
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,317
Barry!

672
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,443
I'm coming up
in the world.

673
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,820
Now I'm better
than the snakes.

674
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,154
Barry, please!

675
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,572
Are you with me?

676
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,199
Yes, yes!

677
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,291
Now, what made you
change your mind?

678
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,793
I can't turn you in
if I'm stuck out there.

679
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,045
Oh, so that's it.
Go back with the reptiles.

680
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,630
Let me go!

681
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,132
Who's there?

682
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,634
You've got no right here!
Stop it and get off!

683
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,761
Now, now, Major.

684
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,680
Ah, stowaways.

685
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,140
In the middle
of this desert sea,

686
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,183
we acquire
two more vagabonds.

687
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,477
Bedouins like ourselves,
eh, Esmeralda?

688
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,062
Why, they're just
a couple of kids.

689
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
Our car broke down
a way back,
and we walked for miles.

690
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,651
We saw your bus and
hopped on. We didn't want
to wake you at this hour.

691
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,946
Broke down, eh?
We didn't pass no
wrecks on the highway.

692
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,032
The whole thing
sounds like
a pack of lies.

693
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,159
You see,
we were off
on a side road.

694
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,455
I know. A moonlight night
and a parked car.
That's nice.

695
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,998
Oh, no, really,
we were just...

696
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,543
Esmeralda! Everywhere
you search for sex.

697
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,629
Get your eyes out of the mud
and look up at the stars.

698
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,090
Oh, I beg your pardon.
My name is Bones.

699
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,633
I am also known as
the human skeleton.

700
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,177
How do you do?

701
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,055
And this is Esmeralda,
our bearded lady.

702
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,016
Naturally,
we're very proud to have her
as a member of our group.

703
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,603
You poor kids must be tired.
Come on in and sit down,
have a little rest.

704
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,897
We're trying to
get to a place
called Soda City,

705
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,231
a couple of hundred
miles north, I think.

706
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,025
Well, then, you won't
get there till morning,

707
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,818
so make yourselves
comfortable.

708
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,321
You must meet
our other co-worker,

709
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,823
Tatania, our little
human mountain.

710
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,367
A very great lady, indeed.

711
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,951
How do you do?

712
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,036
What goes on there?

713
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,038
Oh, did we wake you, honey?
That's too bad.

714
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,539
Oh, I was awake.

715
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,916
I wish you'd tell
Mignonette to do

716
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,501
something about
that insomnia of hers.

717
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,419
I've been tossing
and turning all night.

718
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,713
I wish you'd tell
Marigold to shut
her silly old face.

719
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,841
Are you girls not
speaking to each other
again? Dear, dear.

720
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,551
Marigold's mad because
I got her beau away

721
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,261
from her back in
the last town we played.

722
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,597
Kindly tell Mignonette
I heard that last remark,

723
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,891
that I wouldn't
have the gentleman
in question as a gift.

724
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,476
Nothing but a common
novelty-seeker.

725
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,396
Girls, girls!
What will our guests think?

726
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,398
Hey, he's cute!

727
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,733
You hear that?
There she goes again.

728
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,902
Stop your squabbling.
They are tired.

729
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,445
They've been
walking for miles!

730
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,240
Nobody gave you a lift?
I know.

731
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,076
The normal are
normally cold-hearted.

732
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,078
Stop gabbing and
get these tramps off!

733
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,081
A cold heart,
partly reduced in size.

734
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,250
I won't take no insults.
Get them off.

735
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,334
Aw, Major, honey...

736
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,585
Don't "honey" me!

737
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,588
I've got a contract.
It provides for
safe transportation,

738
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,091
and it don't say nothing
about picking up hobos.

739
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,138
That's the police,
all right.

740
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,764
They must be
looking for somebody.

741
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,391
Who could they want?

742
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,855
Me, I guess.
Oh!

743
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:20,235
The carefree youth,
and he has handcuffs on.
What do they want you for?

744
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,570
For something
somebody else did.

745
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,698
I don't believe
he's done anything wrong!

746
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,324
I'll go to bat
for him anytime.

747
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,368
I've always told Mignonette
she'd get mixed up
with the police

748
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,078
if she wasn't careful.

749
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,761
They're starting to
search at the front.

750
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,431
Well, what are you
waiting for? Hand him
over to the police.

751
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,266
He's perfectly right.
He's a little stinker.

752
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,684
Seems like a terrible
thing to do,

753
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,394
but it'd be terrible, too,
if we got into trouble...

754
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,313
All right, Bones,
call the cops!

755
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,939
Just a minute, Major.

756
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,233
In this situation,
I find a parallel

757
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,152
for the present world predicament.

758
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,654
We stand defeated
at the outset.

759
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,239
You, Esmeralda,
have sympathy,

760
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,741
and yet you're willing
to remain passive

761
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,743
and let the
inevitable happen.

762
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,661
I have a belief,
and yet I'm tempted

763
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,997
to let myself be
over-ridden by force.

764
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,667
The rest of you,
with the exception
of this malignant jerk,

765
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,378
are ignorant of the facts,
and, therefore, confused.

766
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,672
Thank heaven
we're still members
of a democracy.

767
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,132
We'll put the matter
to a vote.

768
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,675
No vote.
I'm against voting!

769
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,927
Fascist!

770
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,012
You know how we stand so far.

771
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:33,850
The twins, as usual,
are on opposite sides,
and so their votes pair.

772
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,021
Tatania's on
both sides at once
and therefore neutral.

773
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,358
The Major is for
delivering these young
people to the police,

774
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,527
and I, frankly,
am against it.

775
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,196
Esmeralda,
the decision is up to you.

776
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,783
Well, I don't want
any trouble any more
than anybody else,

777
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,536
but while you've been
talking, I've been
looking at something,

778
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,788
something pretty fine, too.

779
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,290
I've been looking at
that little girl there

780
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,834
standing right beside
that poor young man.

781
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,004
Never a word.
Never a question.

782
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,965
Taking everything
he's had to take,

783
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,884
stringing along with him,
whatever happens.

784
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,386
And I've been thinking,

785
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:13,515
it's the good people
that stick when
anybody's in trouble,

786
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,392
and there aren't
many good people
in the world.

787
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,979
I think that we, all of us,
know that better than most.

788
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,981
And, well, it isn't
something you see

789
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,899
every day of the week,
so I vote...

790
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,735
We don't give them up.
Good girl, Esmeralda.

791
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,529
This is subversive!
I won't stand for it!

792
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,824
Oh, no, you don't, cuddles!
You'll abide by
the will of the majority.

793
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,784
Back into your places
and pretend to be asleep.

794
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,160
That's all
you have to do.

795
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,996
Here, honey, you sit
right down here.

796
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,831
Come on, young man,
we've got to hide you.

797
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,004
Turn all the lights off.
Here. Take off your
coat and put this on.

798
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,096
Come on.
Wake up in there!

799
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,181
Hey, what is this?
Halloween?

800
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,266
Police.

801
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,018
Oh, is that so?

802
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,728
Haven't you got
anything better to do

803
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,772
than waking up
law-abiding citizens
in the middle of the night?

804
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,941
We're looking for
a young man and
his woman companion.

805
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,278
He's got dark hair,
between the age
of 20 and 25.

806
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,614
The dame's supposed
to be good-looking.
Have you seen them?

807
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,992
Now, where would I see
anybody as normal as that?

808
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,711
Who's this? Doesn't look like
one of your troop.

809
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,048
Sure, she's one of us. She's
our little snake charmer.

810
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:32,886
Right now she's sitting
on a box of snakes
so they don't get lonesome.

811
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,972
Can you imagine that?
And a good-looking gal, too.

812
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,392
Well, I guess you can all go back
to sleep now.

813
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,478
A snake charmer!
Well, well.

814
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,396
You never can tell
about women.

815
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,156
It's all right.
You can come out now.

816
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,162
Wait, justice,
come back!

817
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,706
Sit down here!
We're on our way.

818
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,377
I don't know how
I can thank you, sir.

819
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,753
It's all right, my boy.

820
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,713
It gives you a good feeling
when you can help somebody.

821
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,340
You people have
a right to know
what this is all about.

822
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,508
It's all right, son.

823
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,511
If that little girl
of yours can trust you,
I guess we can.

824
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,181
The baby!
She's had
a tough time.

825
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,016
Poor little girl.
She's worn out.

826
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,726
I'll take care of her.

827
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,561
Come on. Let's go.

828
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,192
Better let the snakes
get some sleep.

829
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,027
They have to
look good tomorrow.

830
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,922
I'm sorry.

831
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,049
What for?

832
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,344
For being such a dope.
I was scared.

833
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,724
You'd have been a dope
if you hadn't been scared.

834
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,476
You're tired,
that's all that's
the matter with you.

835
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,729
Get some sleep.
You'll be fine.

836
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:09,899
I can go to sleep,
all right. I'm so tired.

837
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,364
I want to tell you
something.
I believe you.

838
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,827
Do you, Pat?

839
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,038
You didn't, you know.

840
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:28,001
It's a free country.
A girl can change
her mind, can't she?

841
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,919
Sure, she can.

842
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,839
Thank you, Pat.

843
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,176
They made me so ashamed.

844
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,137
They're so nice
and trusting.

845
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,264
They're wonderful people,

846
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,727
all except that
nasty little Major
and the mean twin.

847
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:52,609
I don't suppose
you can really blame
the fat lady though,

848
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,612
when a woman has lost
her figure that way.

849
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,415
Welcome to Soda City.

850
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,252
The heart of
the bicarbonate belt.

851
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,926
Well, we might as well
do the town.

852
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,785
There's nothing here.
Come on.

853
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,537
I suppose we are
a little late.

854
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,874
I'm sorry, darling.

855
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,792
I knew I shouldn't
have brought you here.

856
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,711
I'm not complaining.

857
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,424
This is great, isn't it?
Solution to all my problems.

858
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,260
I was counting on
this place.

859
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,513
A dump like this,
5,000 miles from nowhere.

860
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,631
Look at this.
It's been in use.

861
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,302
Let's go around
to the window.

862
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,978
Careful!
Don't cut yourself.

863
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,790
Hello? Hello?

864
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,417
Hung up.

865
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:57,919
What sort of
phone is that?

866
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,046
It's a field telephone.

867
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,936
Well, a room with a view.

868
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,646
What do you suppose
they cut that for?

869
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,231
I don't know.

870
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,900
Say, look.

871
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,069
Tripod.

872
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:29,075
Looks like it's
the right height. Yeah.

873
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,870
Something else
goes with this.

874
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:35,999
There!

875
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,045
That's it.

876
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:54,934
See anything?

877
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,060
Not yet.

878
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,312
Uh-oh.

879
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,690
Let me see!

880
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,197
Why, that's a...
Why, Barry!

881
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,782
Yeah.

882
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,369
We better put this away.
Take that.

883
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,334
Say! The wood.

884
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,836
What about it?

885
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,046
They wouldn't
burn that in a stove.

886
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,172
Why not?

887
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:25,381
The smoke would show.

888
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,186
That's a car.

889
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,482
You better hide.
No, not here.

890
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:06,255
Hey. What do you think
you're doing around here?

891
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,175
Hiya. I was wondering
when you'd get here.

892
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,095
Where are you from?
What are you
sniffing around here for?

893
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,389
Excuse me.

894
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:36,869
Funny, you knowing
about this place.
I don't quite get it.

895
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,664
You might have
thought it over
more carefully.

896
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,707
Your coming here
doesn't help us a bit.

897
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,168
The heat's on this guy
and he shows up here.

898
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,753
Tobin sent me.

899
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,381
The old man
must be off his nut
sending him up here.

900
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,341
Be a little more
careful, Neilson.

901
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,552
Your criticisms
in front of other people.

902
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,930
Yeah. Don't talk that way
about the old guy.

903
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,723
I'll watch out
for myself, Doc.

904
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,433
Me, too.
Don't forget about me.

905
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,102
That's why Tobin
sent me up here.

906
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,520
He said you'd know
how to take care of me.

907
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,524
I guess that makes it
pretty clear, Neilson.

908
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,650
I don't know.

909
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,318
A guy walks in
out of the desert,

910
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:10,862
and right away
I get orders.

911
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,029
It ain't so clear to me.

912
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,489
I'm a little better
than a stranger, friend,

913
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:14,907
if you'll remember
my press clippings.

914
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,495
Yes. Mr. Kane has done
pretty well down South.

915
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,332
His accomplishments
can't be disregarded,
at least I hope not.

916
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,959
A man that has served
as well as he has

917
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,586
is entitled at least
to recognition.

918
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,671
I'm entitled to
more than that.
Protection, too.

919
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,173
You guys have got
to take care of me.

920
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:31,883
I'm sure the firm
will do its best.

921
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,093
They're known
to be quite loyal
to their employees.

922
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,679
Neilson will see to it
that the firm's
record is maintained.

923
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,224
You got it easy,
you guys from back East.

924
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,186
You give orders.
You do that, all right.

925
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,522
The big boys
with the desk jobs.

926
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,691
All you got to do is
reach for a telephone,

927
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,109
sit back in
a big leather chair,

928
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,862
and us guys out here
have got to take the rap.

929
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,448
You know,
I think I'll go back East
and work for a while.

930
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,867
You're not a very
good example of
loyalty to the firm.

931
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,370
Yeah? Well,
I'm getting just
a little bit tired, see.

932
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,874
So am I! I'm getting
tired of all this talk.
Let's get going!

933
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,042
The trip up here
was no pushover.

934
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,210
I had to hoof it
most of the way.

935
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,129
I got no place
to hide you out.
That ain't my line.

936
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,132
That ain't your line, huh?

937
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,468
What about you?
You don't seem
so interested, either!

938
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,844
Or I suppose you're
just the big brains!

939
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,971
Or maybe you take
a chance now and then
just for laughs.

940
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,723
Or maybe it doesn't
work that way.

941
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,225
Maybe I'm
the only guy that
sticks his neck out.

942
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:23,559
Well, get this,
both of you!

943
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,269
I pulled a big job
and they're after me.

944
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,979
And you guys are
gonna take care of me
and do it right,

945
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,064
or you're gonna have
trouble on your hands.

946
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,732
I've got to get
out of this part
of the country!

947
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,652
The ground's
burning up under my feet!
I've got to get back East!

948
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,861
It's a little more
crowded back there.

949
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:35,404
A guy doesn't stand out
like he does here.

950
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,949
Hey, take it easy.
Hang on to your nerve.

951
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,533
I've been
hanging on to my nerves!

952
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,743
I've been hanging on
long enough!

953
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,745
I understand
your difficulties.

954
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,080
I'm sorry about
all the talk.

955
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,999
But in this business,
we always
have to make sure.

956
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,168
I think I know him now.

957
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,672
I'm driving back East,
you know.
You'd better come with me.

958
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,091
All right,
let's get going.

959
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,217
Get all the things
together.

960
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,094
After we leave,
I want this place
cleaned up.

961
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,470
You won't be
coming back here.

962
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,097
Why not? You think
they got the place spotted?

963
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,598
I'm making sure.

964
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,101
You'll have to
find another place
and store all this stuff.

965
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,186
Well, it's not
gonna be easy.

966
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,689
It's your job. If you
can't handle it, I'll have
to get someone else.

967
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,607
All right.
I'll handle it.

968
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,025
You'll need some clothes.

969
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,610
Size 42.

970
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,821
What'll we do about these?

971
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,614
Hmm. How did you
manage to break them?

972
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,116
On an automobile fan.

973
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,201
That's very bright of you.

974
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,996
I think we can even
take care of that,
but let's get started now.

975
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,458
Did you hear something?

976
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,501
Where does that lead to?

977
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,752
Just another room.

978
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,129
The way out.

979
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,779
You see,
we figure that Kane
and the other fellows

980
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:01,115
are probably
heading for New York.

981
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,242
If there's anything
I can do...

982
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,077
We sure appreciate that.

983
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,955
Why, anyone
would have done
the same thing.

984
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,999
That's right,
this war sure
makes a difference.

985
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,501
Everybody wants to
get in and pitch.

986
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,587
Now, if you'll just
give me your address
in New York, Miss Martin,

987
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,797
we can contact you
back there.

988
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,675
Or maybe you could
wire me about
which plane you're taking.

989
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,677
We may want to get
a hold of you fast.

990
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,096
Well, I can do that
when I get back to my uncle.

991
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,931
Okay, Miss Martin,
just keep in touch.

992
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,478
I'm glad
we came this way.

993
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,104
It adds a few miles
to our trip,

994
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,940
but somehow I've become
a little sentimental.

995
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,109
I want to take
a last look at it.

996
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,028
Beautiful, isn't it?

997
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,822
A great monument
to man's unceasing industry

998
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,950
and his stubborn
faith in the future.

999
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:46,702
You'll be moving along soon.

1000
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,954
Are you carrying
any cameras
or firearms at all?

1001
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,664
Nothing at all, Officer.

1002
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,500
You, sir?
No, sir.

1003
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:56,128
They must get a lot of
power from this dam.

1004
01:01:56,588 --> 01:02:00,216
I think it supplies
about 75% for the
Los Angeles district,

1005
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,886
naturally including
most of the power for
the defense plants there.

1006
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,388
Well, do you think
there's any...

1007
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,223
Do you know Tobin
very well?

1008
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,600
No, not very well.
I met him just
that once at his ranch.

1009
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,893
Did he have
the child with him?

1010
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,103
His grandchild? Yes.

1011
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:14,021
He seemed to be
very fond of her.

1012
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,982
Yes. That's one of the things
I like about old Tobin,

1013
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,235
his love for
that little girl.

1014
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,529
Evidence of a good heart.

1015
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,739
I have children,
too, you know.

1016
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:24,824
Oh?

1017
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:28,494
Two boys.
Nice little fellows.
Aged two and four.

1018
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:32,832
The four-year-old
is naughty at times.
He's quite a problem.

1019
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:38,003
We get him a new toy
and within half an hour
it's smashed to bits.

1020
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:41,841
And then, sometimes,
after it's all over,

1021
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,718
he seems almost sorry.

1022
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,598
Sometimes I wish
my younger child
had been a girl.

1023
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,267
In fact, my wife
and I often argue

1024
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,352
over a little idiosyncrasy
I have.

1025
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,605
I don't want
his hair cut short
until he's much older.

1026
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,399
Do you think
it'd be bad for him?

1027
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,775
Well, I don't know,
it might be.

1028
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,237
When I was a child,
I had long golden curls.

1029
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,656
People used to stop
on the street to admire me.

1030
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,824
Things are different
nowadays.

1031
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,034
If you gave the kid
a haircut, it might
save him a lot of grief.

1032
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,080
Ah, we're on our way.

1033
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,426
Drive to 401
instead of the office.

1034
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,761
Okay.

1035
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:15,476
Anything wrong?

1036
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,061
Plenty. I've just
called the office.

1037
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,896
They've disconnected
the phone.

1038
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,023
Same old phone company.
Should have paid the bill.

1039
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,691
This is no time
for jokes.

1040
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,527
The police.
They're watching
the office.

1041
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,695
The disconnected phone,
it's our signal.

1042
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,030
You think they're
watching for me?

1043
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,740
I don't know.

1044
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,700
Who'd know
you were in New York?

1045
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,203
Oh, yeah.
I guess you're right.

1046
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:43,420
How about Brooklyn tomorrow?
Do you want me on the job?

1047
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,881
When are you going to learn
to keep your mouth shut?

1048
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:47,216
Sorry. I thought
he was in on it.

1049
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,717
Shut up!

1050
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,928
It's all right.
I'm good at
keeping secrets.

1051
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,346
Let's go.

1052
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,651
Good evening,
Mr. Freeman.

1053
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:28,632
Hi, Mr. Freeman.

1054
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,717
Hello.

1055
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,971
Ah, pleased to see you,
Mr. Freeman.
Have a good trip?

1056
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,306
Yes. Thank you,
Robert.

1057
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,933
Madam is upstairs.
She's waiting
anxiously for you.

1058
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,269
Oh, thank you, Robert.
We'll go right up.

1059
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,687
This way.

1060
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,524
Who's that?

1061
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,364
Hey, is this a hotel?
What's the festivity?

1062
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,991
It's for a very
worthy cause.

1063
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,286
Mrs. Sutton often
gives her house over
to charity affairs.

1064
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,579
She's a very
generous woman.

1065
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,623
I have an idea
she isn't going
to be really pleased

1066
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,833
to see us
on a night like this.

1067
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,214
Idiots, all of you.

1068
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,676
Stupid, inefficient idiots.
Everything is left to me.

1069
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,845
I have to hover
over all of you
like an old hen.

1070
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:15,971
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Sutton.

1071
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,641
The guests
downstairs expect me
to put in an appearance.

1072
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:21,810
After all, as you say,
they want something
for their $25!

1073
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,688
I will not have
my benevolence abused.

1074
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:28,734
My life, my position,
they're important to me.

1075
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,194
I'll do my best,
Mrs. Sutton.

1076
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,113
I only wish your best
were a little better.

1077
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,200
Oh. Mr. Freeman,
I'm glad you've
come at this time.

1078
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:39,536
I was just telling Edward...
Is this the young man?

1079
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,330
Must you bring him
here, as well?

1080
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,248
I certainly can't
furnish him with sanctuary.

1081
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,669
This house is
full of guests,
important people!

1082
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,629
Don't you understand
my position, Mr. Freeman,

1083
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:49,838
with this young man here?

1084
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,007
The police are already
watching your office.

1085
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,009
Thank goodness
they'll never come here.

1086
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:56,512
But a little more of
your stupid behavior

1087
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:59,014
and even
the respectability of
my house won't shield you.

1088
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,182
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.

1089
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,558
We can't leave
any loose ends.

1090
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:02,893
All right! All right!

1091
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,896
But for heaven's sake,
stop playing the conspirator.

1092
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,608
Now tell me
all you know about
the girl or ask him.

1093
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:13,696
Why didn't you tell me
about the young lady
back in Soda City?

1094
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,573
Oh. Well, I didn't
think it was important.

1095
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:18,909
She was just a girl,
like anybody else.

1096
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,203
She picked me up,
she was pretty.

1097
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,080
I guess it was
kind of risky.

1098
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,541
Well, there you are.

1099
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,669
I'm so sorry to
have exposed you
to any risk.

1100
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,754
What's she doing here?

1101
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,465
You're surprised
to see me again.

1102
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,384
How did you get here?

1103
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,719
It doesn't matter
how she got here.

1104
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,221
The point is
there was no reason
to bring her here at all!

1105
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,264
You see, Mr. Kane,

1106
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,141
I just learned
on the telephone
at the gas station

1107
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,144
that she was most indiscreet
after she left you
at Soda City.

1108
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,604
She went straight
to the local sheriff,
who, fortunately,

1109
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,606
happened to be
a particularly
good friend of ours.

1110
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,608
Oh, don't waste time
in explanations,
Mr. Freeman.

1111
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,153
You've got to get
the girl out of
this house, all of you.

1112
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,156
I will not have
my benevolence abused!

1113
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,992
So you played smart.
That's great.

1114
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,493
That's a big help
to all of us.

1115
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:06,623
No, I wasn't smart at all.
I haven't been smart
for four days.

1116
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,376
Even when I went to
the sheriff I hesitated.

1117
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,587
I hated to do
anything that might
get you into trouble.

1118
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:12,838
Yeah, I sympathize.

1119
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,048
The mistake I made
was not leaving you
back there with the snakes!

1120
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,508
You might have at least
learned to rattle.

1121
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,177
I was right about you
in the first place.

1122
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,512
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

1123
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,892
I didn't know
you were a bookworm.

1124
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,852
You must let me
choose something
appropriate for you.

1125
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,022
Something not too difficult
for you to understand.

1126
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,607
Let me see.

1127
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,447
Here we are.
This will do admirably.

1128
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,742
Remarkable work.
Somehow prophetic.

1129
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,955
Why are you here, Charles?
And what's all this
nonsense about books?

1130
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,707
I am a refugee.

1131
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,920
I have at last joined
that revolting group
of world travelers.

1132
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:56,632
One ultimately
turns into the thing
one despises most.

1133
01:08:57,217 --> 01:09:00,469
And whom have I
to thank for it?
You, Mr. Freeman.

1134
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,638
The girl was allowed
to escape unobserved.

1135
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,973
She left Mr. Kane,
went straight to her uncle.

1136
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,352
And that charming old man
went to the police.

1137
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:11,772
As a result,
a whole hoard of officers
came to my house.

1138
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,483
Luckily, I was leaving
when they arrived.

1139
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,486
And the others,
the very loyal ones,

1140
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,363
well, they're paying
for their loyalty.

1141
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:23,867
How appalling!
Your charming house.
I'm so sorry, Charles.

1142
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:27,037
It's rather lucky.
You might have been sorrier.

1143
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,206
And you might have been
a little more efficient

1144
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,415
in this whole matter,
Mr. Freeman!

1145
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,501
What good is it
going to do you
to insult me?

1146
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,794
We're in trouble now.

1147
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,337
And so the most
important thing

1148
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,631
is to make sure of
everyone around us.

1149
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:38,924
Of Mr. Kane?

1150
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,343
I'm just not sure.
I want to know that he's all right.

1151
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,054
All right?
What an understatement.

1152
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,473
He's much more than that!

1153
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,560
He's noble and fine and pure.

1154
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,061
And so he pays the penalty

1155
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:54,189
that the noble and
the fine and the pure
must pay in this world.

1156
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,358
He's misjudged by everyone.

1157
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,487
Why, even the police
have a completely
erroneous impression of him.

1158
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:04,032
I can assure you
that contrary to
what is supposed

1159
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,785
and to what he may
himself have told you,

1160
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,830
that young man is
certainly not one of
his country's enemies.

1161
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,707
Charles, you're joking!

1162
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,667
I mean exactly what I say.

1163
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:17,170
Mr. Kane is definitely
no part of our
little organization.

1164
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:20,090
Your protg. Well,
you've done splendidly.

1165
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,800
You bring him here,
you idiot.

1166
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,011
Now what in heaven's name
are we going to do with him?

1167
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:26,680
That's a very
appropriate question.

1168
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,348
Not much
we can do with him.

1169
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:31,810
I made the mistake
once of turning him
over to the police.

1170
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,813
That's even more
impossible at the moment.

1171
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:39,067
I'm afraid there's
only one thing we can do.

1172
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:46,825
You see, the new law
threatens all of us
with the death penalty.

1173
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,579
So, I'm afraid
we'll have to apply
the ancient axiom.

1174
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,665
Tooth for a tooth.
Kane for a Tobin.

1175
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,667
Please don't discuss things
of that sort here.

1176
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,879
It's rather nauseating
and quite out of place.

1177
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,509
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.
We must take all precaution.

1178
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,470
Of course. We must also
continue with our work.

1179
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:09,139
It's too risky now.
We're already
abandoning the dam.

1180
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,682
We must remain
inactive for a while.

1181
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,768
Inactive? You are
utterly mistaken.

1182
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:15,103
Once we do that,
our organization
is finished.

1183
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,271
We must carry on
at all costs.

1184
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,439
What about tomorrow's work?

1185
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,942
Tomorrow's work?
You can't abandon that
after all your preparations.

1186
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,360
But, Charles, the risk...

1187
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,070
Is great. I know that.

1188
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:27,115
Unfortunately,
we will have to
carry out our orders.

1189
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,119
I am leaving for
the Caribbean now.

1190
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,082
My position here
is more impossible
than all of yours.

1191
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,210
Of course I'm rather
looking forward to
Central America.

1192
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,004
Havana will be
very gay this season.

1193
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:45,133
You know, somehow
I've suddenly had
enough of this country.

1194
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,969
The war has made it grim.

1195
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,179
You're leaving us here
to face everything,

1196
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,306
and you'll be on
a boat sailing along.

1197
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:52,641
It all sounds idyllic.

1198
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,937
Oh, Charles, Charles,
this whole thing,
it's impossible.

1199
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,814
It's panicky.

1200
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,608
I'm deeply sorry.

1201
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,110
There you are,
darling!

1202
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,946
How unbecoming
for a hostess to
hide herself away.

1203
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,781
Am I intruding?
I am so sorry,

1204
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,533
but I just must
kidnap Henrietta.

1205
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,535
She'll be back.
I've had some trouble
with these people.

1206
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,787
They're doing the catering
and making rather
a horrid mess of it.

1207
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,998
Our boy will appear
any minute with
the caviar! I assure you.

1208
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,457
I'll stake
my reputation on it.

1209
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,418
Don't be a fool!
Get to the house phone.

1210
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,877
How'd you get here?
They met me at the airport.

1211
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,754
I thought they were
the police, then
they brought me here.

1212
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,258
Wait a minute.
No use trying
the way I came in.

1213
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,845
Let's walk right out
through the front door!
Might as well.

1214
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,889
Yes, sir.
We'll watch the back exit.
They won't get out.

1215
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,442
No good.

1216
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,152
See the one on
the other side? I met
him on the way in.

1217
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,237
He's one of them.
We'll never
get out that way.

1218
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,156
What can they do to us?
Plenty.

1219
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,699
They'd grab us.
We wouldn't have a chance.

1220
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,159
But these people
would see them do it.

1221
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,618
Of course.
And if anyone
had a question,

1222
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,162
we're a couple
of gatecrashers.

1223
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:58,206
Barry, this is awful.
It's like a bad dream.

1224
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,584
All these people here.
Isn't there anyone
we can trust?

1225
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,378
Sure there is.
All of them.
Only which one?

1226
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:14,014
Excuse me.
This may sound
sort of crazy.

1227
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,767
In fact,
I don't even
know how to start.

1228
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,687
But this whole house
is a hotbed of
spies and saboteurs.

1229
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,440
I'm not being silly.
I assure you. Even
our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.

1230
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,276
What's the matter
with you, sir?
You're drunk!

1231
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,779
You're not even dressed.

1232
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:32,741
What'd he say?

1233
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,534
Oh, he thinks
I'm drunk.

1234
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,455
When I read in the papers what
those Japs are doing...

1235
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:39,581
Beat it out! Beat it out.

1236
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,209
Keep it natural.
Eight to the bar.

1237
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:44,878
Yeah, man.
Stay in that pitch.

1238
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,715
Pardon me.
Did you pay $25 to
get in here tonight?

1239
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,884
No, not exactly.
My boss gave me
a ticket. Why?

1240
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,260
I need your help very badly.

1241
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,595
We're in the middle of
the biggest bunch of

1242
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,763
fifth columnists
in the country.

1243
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,223
Are you kidding?
What's the gag?

1244
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,307
No, I'm on the level.
This is it.

1245
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,434
Aw, you're kidding.
We got a wag
on the joint.

1246
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:00,602
The guy's trying to rib me.

1247
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,562
Aw, sling him
your curve.

1248
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,481
Beat it out, son.
Beat it out.

1249
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,660
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to
talk to you

1250
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:17,953
about something
very important.

1251
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,413
What is it, Mr. Kane?

1252
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,332
You know it's hopeless.

1253
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:26,086
Why don't you join
Mr. Tobin upstairs
for a little supper?

1254
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,921
I'll show you the way.

1255
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,867
Barry, before
they get to us,

1256
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,994
go out and stop the music
and tell them! Tell them all!

1257
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,287
Honey, this is
the Sutton mansion.

1258
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,914
I'm just a guy from
Glendale, California,
wanted by the police.

1259
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,916
They'll grab me
as soon as I open my mouth.

1260
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,918
What are you gonna do?
We can't just stand here.

1261
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,087
I know where we'll be safe.

1262
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,844
Barry, I'm scared.

1263
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:19,347
It's so unreal,
all these people dancing
and having a good time.

1264
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,433
Yeah. And when you
try to warn them,
they laugh at you.

1265
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,976
They think you're drunk.

1266
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,519
That gray-haired man
you spoke to,

1267
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,229
he seemed like such
an honest citizen.

1268
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:27,439
Hmm.

1269
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,276
Just a friend of the family.
I guess the room's
well sprinkled with them.

1270
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,361
They're so smart.
That's what frightens me.

1271
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,031
Yeah, they're smart,
that's because
they're ruthless.

1272
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:39,367
It's easy to win
when you forget
about the rules.

1273
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,912
A man named Fry
drops a wallet
in California

1274
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,997
and we wind up here,
you and me.

1275
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,041
That's the only
good part of it,
I'm with you.

1276
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,168
I wish it were
somewhere else.

1277
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,711
The North Pole,
I wouldn't care.

1278
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,922
We might wind up
there yet, too,

1279
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,382
chasing Fry over
the old glacier!

1280
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:58,803
Fry. He seems so small now.
I'd forgotten about him.

1281
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,305
So had I.

1282
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,641
Well, we can't just
go on dancing

1283
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:04,684
like it's Saturday night
at The Palladium.

1284
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,395
We can't just wait
till they come and get us.

1285
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,481
What do you think
they'll really do?

1286
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:10,982
Oh, right now
they're probably haggling

1287
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,567
over the price with
Murder Incorporated.

1288
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,069
Oh, Barry, please!

1289
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,906
Sorry, Pat. I hate to
be out of it now there's
still so much to do.

1290
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,908
If ever there was a time
when staying alive
was important,

1291
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,076
you heard what they said.

1292
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,411
Something about a job
they are going to do
tomorrow in Brooklyn.

1293
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:24,537
The Navy Yard.

1294
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,373
One of us has got
to get out of here.

1295
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,583
Maybe if I start something,
you can make a break for it.

1296
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:29,751
Well, what about you?

1297
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,254
You can't worry about me.
We got to take a chance.

1298
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,507
Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have
met you 100 years ago

1299
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,467
on a beach somewhere?

1300
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,805
Bathing suits looked awfully funny
100 years ago.

1301
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,141
I'll bet you'd look
beautiful, though.

1302
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,026
Afraid we're not
behaving very well.

1303
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,363
What's the difference?
We weren't invited anyway.

1304
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,539
Pat, this moment
belongs to me.

1305
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,960
No matter what happens,
they can never
take it away from me.

1306
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,212
Oh, pardon me.
Do you mind?

1307
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,600
Oh, excuse me.
Would you care to dance?

1308
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,519
Why, yes. Certainly.

1309
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,732
Oh, you're really
a much better dancer.

1310
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,234
Thanks. Who was the man
you were dancing with?

1311
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,695
I have no idea.
I never saw him before.

1312
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,780
No, I mean the man
that just left you.

1313
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,324
I know. That's who
I'm talking about.

1314
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,659
I never saw him
before in my life.

1315
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,627
Oh, what a pity.
That was lovely.

1316
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,004
I hope you will
ask me again.

1317
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,423
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1318
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,804
Well, young man,
you seem to be
enjoying yourself.

1319
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:06,264
Charming party, isn't it?

1320
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,599
Where is she?

1321
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,310
You mean your young lady?
I thought you were
taking care of her.

1322
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,938
Perhaps she has a headache
and lying down somewhere.

1323
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:17,275
Would you like to
come with me
and look for her?

1324
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,277
Hold on.

1325
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,789
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen!

1326
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,916
Your attention, please.

1327
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,045
I have something
to tell you.

1328
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:41,466
Something you ought to
know about this house
and about your hostess.

1329
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,599
I beg your pardon, sir,
but before you go on,

1330
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:53,853
I think you might like
to take a look at
the curtain on the balcony.

1331
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:13,706
I'm not much of a public speaker,
ladies and gentlemen,

1332
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:18,211
and some of you are
probably wondering
how I can tell you anything

1333
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:22,757
about your hostess
that you don't already know.

1334
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:28,763
Her graciousness,
her kindness,
her many charities.

1335
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,724
Well, I want to tell you

1336
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,726
that you have
a big surprise coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

1337
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,941
Tonight, in this house,
for the benefit
of this great cause

1338
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,610
for which she's
already done so much,

1339
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:45,572
our hostess, Mrs. Sutton,
is putting up for auction

1340
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,116
one of her most
treasured possessions,

1341
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,076
one of the famous
Sutton jewels.

1342
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,051
Mrs. Sutton, would you
kindly step forward?

1343
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,270
Thank you.

1344
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,981
Mr. Kane,
the young lady is
asking to see you.

1345
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,149
Are you sure?

1346
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,527
I wouldn't keep her
waiting if I were you, sir.

1347
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,072
Yes.

1348
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,075
Will someone please...

1349
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:35,121
Admiral, how about you?
Would you take over
for me, please?

1350
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,247
Excuse me, please.

1351
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,957
I'm wanted on the phone.

1352
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,542
Delighted, sir.

1353
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,710
Thank you.

1354
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:45,048
Ladies and gentlemen,

1355
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,675
I will entertain
your bids for this
beautiful bracelet,

1356
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,512
which has been donated
by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.

1357
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,679
What am I bid?

1358
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,056
$1,000.

1359
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,850
$1,000 has been bid.
Do I hear any more?

1360
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:57,143
$1,500.

1361
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,687
$1,500 has been bid.
Do I hear?

1362
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,690
$1,750.

1363
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:03,858
$2,000.

1364
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:06,277
$2,000 has been bid
for this beautiful bracelet.

1365
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,243
Where is she?

1366
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,538
You seem to have a soft spot
for that young lady.

1367
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,915
You can't afford
to make yourself
that vulnerable,

1368
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,834
not when you're out trying
to save your country.

1369
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:25,171
Why is it that
you sneer every time
you refer to this country?

1370
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,839
You've done pretty well here.
I don't get it.

1371
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,883
No, you wouldn't.
You're one of
the ardent believers,

1372
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,219
the good American.
Oh, there are
millions like you.

1373
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:34,847
People that plod along
without asking questions.

1374
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:39,185
I hate to use the word
stupid, but it seems to be
the only one that applies.

1375
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:42,814
The great masses,
the moron millions.

1376
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:47,193
Well, there are a few of us
who are unwilling
to just troop along.

1377
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,028
A few of us who are
clever enough to see

1378
01:21:49,113 --> 01:21:50,613
that there's
much more to be done

1379
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:53,491
than just live small,
complacent lives.

1380
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,411
A few of us in America
who desire

1381
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:58,663
a more profitable
type of government.

1382
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:02,292
When you think
about it, Mr. Kane,

1383
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,546
the competence of
totalitarian nations
is much higher than ours.

1384
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,506
They get things done.

1385
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,384
Yeah.
They get things done.

1386
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,429
They bomb cities, sink ships,
torture and murder,

1387
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,598
so you and your friends
can eat off a gold plate.

1388
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,765
It's a great philosophy.

1389
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,561
I neither intend to be
bombed nor sunk, Mr. Kane.

1390
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,813
That's why I'm leaving now.

1391
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:28,776
And if things
don't go right for you,
if we should win,

1392
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,862
then I'll come back.

1393
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:34,032
Perhaps I can get
what I want then, power.

1394
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:37,952
Yes. I want that
as much as you
want your comfort,

1395
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:40,830
or your job, or that girl.

1396
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:45,001
We all have different tastes,
as you can see.

1397
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:49,964
Only I'm willing
to back my tastes
with the necessary force.

1398
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,134
You certainly make it
sound smooth and easy.

1399
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,053
Well, that's a trick.

1400
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,097
I know the results of
that power you believe in.

1401
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:01,476
It killed my friend,
and it's killing
thousands like him.

1402
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,353
That's what you're aiming at.

1403
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,064
But it doesn't bother you,
I can see that.

1404
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,149
Because you really
hate all people.

1405
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,276
Let me tell you something.

1406
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:13,279
The last four, five days
I've learned a lot.

1407
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,823
I've met guys like you
and I've met others,

1408
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,660
people that are helpful
and eager to do
the right thing,

1409
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:22,830
people that get a kick
out of helping each other
fight the bad guys.

1410
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:24,832
Love and hate.

1411
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:26,000
The world's
choosing up sides.

1412
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,877
I know who I'm with.

1413
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,504
And there are a lot
of people on my side,

1414
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,506
millions of us
in every country.

1415
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,966
And we're not soft.
We're plenty strong.

1416
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,010
And we'll fight
standing up on our
two feet, and we'll win.

1417
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,931
Remember that, Mr. Tobin.
We'll win, no matter
what you guys do.

1418
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,767
We'll win if it takes
from now until
the cows come home.

1419
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,979
Mr. Kane, I think
we've discussed

1420
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,107
the rights of man
sufficiently.

1421
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:54,612
I'm feeling a little tired.
You must be, too.

1422
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,198
Robert, do you think
you can arrange

1423
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,659
for Mr. Kane to sleep
somewhere tonight?

1424
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,828
Yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.

1425
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,166
That's enough, Robert.

1426
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:08,960
Very good, sir.

1427
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,050
Think you can
take care of this?

1428
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,301
Yes, sir.

1429
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:19,679
Will that be all, sir?

1430
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:20,930
Yes, thank you.

1431
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:44,245
It doesn't matter
what arrangements we've made,
to what trouble we've gone.

1432
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:46,456
This whole job hangs
on one thing, timing.

1433
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,416
If the section of
the slipway goes up

1434
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,876
before the actual
moment of launching,

1435
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,294
then all our efforts
have been wasted.

1436
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,589
If you blow her too late,
well, then you
just scare the crowd.

1437
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:57,258
Timing, timing, timing.

1438
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,094
That button must not
be pressed until
the ship starts to move.

1439
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,097
What arrangements
have been made
for getting out of there?

1440
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:05,725
As soon as the camera
cables are unhooked,
this truck goes.

1441
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,769
We got a fix at the gate
to get through
without failing.

1442
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,604
Who's handling the camera
near the slipway?

1443
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,774
I am. The wires
to the explosives
were laid last night.

1444
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,525
All I have to do
is hook them up
to the camera.

1445
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,612
Too bad we have to
lose a good camera.

1446
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,447
Well, everything
seems to be taken care of.

1447
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:23,117
I'll be waiting for you
at the newsreel office.
Good luck.

1448
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,748
Have they gone?
Yes.

1449
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:32,835
How is she?

1450
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,046
Okay. She's having
her breakfast.

1451
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,049
Any trouble
keeping her quiet?

1452
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,092
No. I made
a deal with her.

1453
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:42,637
You see,
she got tired of having
that adhesive tape

1454
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,722
over her eyes and mouth.

1455
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,850
Well, I hope we
get rid of her soon.

1456
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:51,437
I promised to
take my kid sister
to the Philharmonic.

1457
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,815
Give me the key.

1458
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,024
There it is.

1459
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,409
I'm sorry we couldn't
keep you at the house
last night,

1460
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,745
but Mrs. Sutton has
a limited number of
guest rooms,

1461
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,331
and I suppose
Mr. Kane was first in line.

1462
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:11,374
Where am I?

1463
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:12,917
Oh, that's a trade secret.

1464
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,671
I only hope it isn't
too high for you here.

1465
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,506
Mr. Kane's quarters
are nearer the ground,

1466
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,174
but he's being
well looked after,

1467
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:23,177
and, like you, is probably
enjoying a hearty breakfast.

1468
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:35,750
Somebody
get the fire hose!

1469
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,498
Whose place is that?

1470
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:16,958
That's Mrs. Sutton's house.

1471
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,709
Oh, who's she?

1472
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,378
Some rich dame.

1473
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:23,965
Saw something
in the paper about her
doing things for charity.

1474
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,175
Right here somewhere.
Here.

1475
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:30,930
What about
tomorrow's work?

1476
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,516
Tomorrow's work?
You can't abandon that
after all your preparations.

1477
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,725
But, Charles, the risk...

1478
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,143
Is great.
I know that.

1479
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,772
Unfortunately,
we will have to
carry out our orders.

1480
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,861
What's the time?

1481
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,321
10:50.

1482
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,698
Thanks.

1483
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,826
Brooklyn Navy Yard, quick!

1484
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:54,930
How much?

1485
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,057
15.

1486
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,147
Got change?
Yes.

1487
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,556
Courtesy of
the Navy Department,

1488
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,934
we are now able to
take you to the
Brooklyn Navy Yard,

1489
01:30:40,018 --> 01:30:41,310
where over
a national hook-up

1490
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,812
we will endeavor to
bring you a description

1491
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,438
of the actual
launching ceremony

1492
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:46,982
of the Navy's capital ship,
the USS Alaska.

1493
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:48,567
And so without further ado,

1494
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:51,028
we switch you now to
the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

1495
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:52,613
Here we are at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

1496
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,948
It's rather a windy
autumn day,

1497
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:56,033
but still it's a pretty
good day for a launching.

1498
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:59,161
I guess any day
is a good day for
a launching in these times.

1499
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:01,831
Our microphones are located
in several key spots,

1500
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:02,957
so we'll be able
to bring you...

1501
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,125
What's holding us up?

1502
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,043
Traffic, buddy.
What do you think?

1503
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:09,421
Here. I'll walk.

1504
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:10,589
Okay.

1505
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:13,217
Well, I guess the main speaker
is about to begin.

1506
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,053
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am now turning you
over to Bill Donnan,

1507
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,222
who is located on
the actual platform.

1508
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,932
Go ahead, Bill.

1509
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,393
This is Bill Donnan,
ladies and gentlemen.

1510
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,936
We're located up here
on the platform,

1511
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,896
right below the bow
of the great ship.

1512
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,274
It towers over us
like some enormous monster.

1513
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:29,984
This platform
on which we have...

1514
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:33,445
Take me to
the guy in charge!

1515
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,905
Okay.
I'll take care of this.
What do you want?

1516
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,365
Something's gonna happen
at the launching, sabotage.

1517
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,575
Where'd you get
your information?

1518
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:38,909
I can't say now.
There isn't time.

1519
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,995
What can I do?
We got to have a little
more than that to go on.

1520
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,329
Better come in the office
and talk to the chief.

1521
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,206
I tell you there isn't time!
What do you expect me to do?

1522
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:45,416
Take me to the guy
in charge of the launching.

1523
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,502
No, you got to go
through the office first.
That's all.

1524
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,588
Towley, 1050.

1525
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:51,839
Very crowded at the moment

1526
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,674
with all kinds of
Navy officers...
Wait here.

1527
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,092
...and Navy personnel.

1528
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:57,011
I can see
in the group to my left

1529
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:59,305
Rear Admiral Pierce
and Mrs. Pierce.

1530
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,848
It is Mrs. Pierce
who will perform

1531
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,766
the actual
bottle breaking today.

1532
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,769
She is shaking hands with
a great many people
down there right now.

1533
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:07,271
Just a second,
ladies and gentlemen.

1534
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,857
I see Rear Admiral Pierce
moving toward the microphone.

1535
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,901
Yes. I think
he's going to begin
his speech now.

1536
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:14,069
We'll switch you over
to the speaker's microphone.

1537
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:19,867
The launching of a ship in a time of war
is always a solemn occasion.

1538
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,786
Today, when our fleet
is fighting
on all the seven seas,

1539
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,747
this ceremony
gains magnitude

1540
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:27,208
for it represents,
for the American people,
a victory.

1541
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,375
Where'd that guy go?

1542
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,377
I don't know.
He just stepped outside.

1543
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:37,843
...by the strong,
diligent of hands
of American workmen.

1544
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:44,516
Let us rejoice,
then, at this moment.
Let us be confident...

1545
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,604
...working for
this great country

1546
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,190
to show the world
what America can do.

1547
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,693
Our American soldiers,
who are freely
giving their lives,

1548
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,946
so that we
in this country
can live in decency,

1549
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:59,615
security and peace.

1550
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,742
This is Bill Donnan again,
ladies and gentlemen.

1551
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,410
You've just heard
Rear Admiral Pierce

1552
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,079
speaking from
the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

1553
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:06,747
His speech is being received
with great applause...

1554
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,832
Lock the back doors, quick!
I can handle this!

1555
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,918
Be ready to pull out
as soon as she goes.

1556
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,254
The naval officer is handing her
a bottle of champagne

1557
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,922
that is tied
somewhere above it.

1558
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:25,766
The crowd is tense.
It is indeed
a solemn occasion.

1559
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,686
I switch you over
to our microphone
near the bow of the ship

1560
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,105
so that you may hear
the actual launching.

1561
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:35,025
Now I can see that
Mrs. Pierce is moving
towards the bow of the ship.

1562
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:38,404
I'll switch you over
now to Mrs. Pierce.

1563
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:41,031
In the name of the people
of the United States,

1564
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,033
I christen thee Alaska.

1565
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:09,810
What's the trouble?

1566
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,520
Don't know.
An explosion somewhere.

1567
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,204
George!

1568
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,043
Everything okay?

1569
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,086
No, give us a hand.
We got a guy.

1570
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,863
Better scatter.
Go down the corridor
and through the iron door.

1571
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:05,366
It will take you
to the music hall.
We'll go this way.

1572
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,390
You must go,
go at once, before
Henry catches you here.

1573
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,809
See here, I thought
you wanted to make
the old boy jealous.

1574
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,479
Not anymore.
He's threatened to
kill you on sight.

1575
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,940
Oh, I say, you don't think
he'd go that far, do you?

1576
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,984
Of course he will.
Oh, will you go
before it's too late,

1577
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:42,403
before he shoots you
to death?

1578
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,322
See here, are you
trying to tell me

1579
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:47,616
Old Henry's got a gun,
a real gun?

1580
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:51,412
Oh!

1581
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:52,913
What do you
think this is?

1582
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,332
I've caught you at last,
you rat in the grass!

1583
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,584
Stop that!

1584
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,254
Run, Wilbur, run!
Before he gets your range!

1585
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:03,757
I think I got it now.
Get out before I shoot again!

1586
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,760
Run, Wilbur, run!
Quick!

1587
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:08,220
It never touched me!

1588
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:09,805
I'll get you this time.

1589
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:13,225
My husband! He's shot!

1590
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,270
I'll kill the rat
if it's the last thing I do!

1591
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,941
He was only kidding.
I swear!

1592
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,901
And I'm only kidding, too!

1593
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,363
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1594
01:36:26,448 --> 01:36:28,073
He's gone mad! Mad!

1595
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:30,325
Go on.
Get out! Get out!

1596
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,287
Not that way!
He'll kill you!

1597
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,788
Stop him! Help!

1598
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:36,748
Murder! Help!

1599
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,751
Run, for heaven's sake!
Run for your life!

1600
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,136
There he goes!

1601
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:51,221
He's the one you're after.

1602
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:52,473
You're the one
we're after. Come on!

1603
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:53,974
I tell you, he's the one.
He'll get away!
Come on!

1604
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:55,309
Pat, grab a cab
and go after him

1605
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,727
and don't lose him.
It's our only chance.

1606
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:57,895
Taxi!

1607
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,155
Downtown.

1608
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,323
Whereabouts?

1609
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,408
Anywhere.
Just keep going downtown.

1610
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,425
May I have change
for the telephone,
please?

1611
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:52,884
Yes, ma'am.

1612
01:38:56,848 --> 01:38:58,473
There you are.

1613
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:11,361
Operator? Give me
the FBI headquarters, please.

1614
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:14,072
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

1615
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:16,199
Hold on,
I'll put you through.

1616
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,955
Make sure he doesn't
leave by the next boat.
Talk to him, follow him.

1617
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,083
Do your best to
keep him there until
our men come along.

1618
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:27,419
A girl says she thinks
she's traced Fry
to Bedloe Island.

1619
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,879
She's crazy.
He'd never go there.

1620
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,380
Where did you pick
up Schultz last month?

1621
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,007
In that museum,
that modern art place.

1622
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,216
And Renaldo?
You caught him

1623
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:34,885
looking at the fish
in the aquarium,
didn't you?

1624
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,428
Yeah, but the statue's
a dead end.

1625
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:38,013
That's why he's smart.
You better get going.

1626
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,473
Let me take him along
in any case,

1627
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:41,308
just to make sure the girl
hasn't made a mistake.

1628
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:44,102
Burke, you're one of
the most obstinate men
I've ever met! Get going.

1629
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:45,270
Come on.

1630
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:52,629
Pardon me.
Could you tell me
which is Brooklyn?

1631
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,970
I've seen you before,
haven't I?

1632
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,014
Sure.

1633
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,310
On that boat
coming over.

1634
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:11,148
What'd you ask me?

1635
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:12,983
About Brooklyn,
I was wondering
where it was.

1636
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,318
I've heard so much about it.

1637
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:16,820
Over there.

1638
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:19,948
Where are you from?
New York.

1639
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:21,825
What are you handing me?

1640
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,661
Oh, no. You see,
I work in a store downtown.

1641
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:26,955
Now, I never get
a chance to get out.

1642
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:29,791
I just sit around all day,
and I never see anything.

1643
01:41:29,876 --> 01:41:32,335
So I said to myself,
the first vacation I get,

1644
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,463
I'm going to see
the Statue of Liberty.

1645
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,757
This must be a big
moment for you, huh?

1646
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:38,383
Oh, it is.

1647
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,094
And it means
so much to us now.

1648
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,972
Why, I was just
reading here
in this booklet.

1649
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:47,017
Did you know
this statue was given
to us by the French?

1650
01:41:47,101 --> 01:41:49,811
Do you know what
they had written on it?

1651
01:41:49,896 --> 01:41:54,024
"Give me your tired,
your poor,
your huddled masses,

1652
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:55,859
"yearning to breathe free,

1653
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,653
"the wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

1654
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,240
"Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me."

1655
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,743
And just look at
the French.
Isn't it sad?

1656
01:42:05,203 --> 01:42:07,370
Yeah. Very sad.

1657
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:11,958
Oh, it's such
a beautiful statue.

1658
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:13,376
I could just
sit up here all day

1659
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:14,878
thinking about it.
Couldn't you?

1660
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:18,465
Some other day, maybe.
Not right now.

1661
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:21,092
Right now I got to
catch that boat back.

1662
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:24,012
You coming?

1663
01:42:24,096 --> 01:42:28,266
Well, there's another boat in 15 minutes.
Couldn't we wait?

1664
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:33,063
All the people have gone,
and we'd be alone,
just you and me.

1665
01:42:34,941 --> 01:42:36,441
Sounds cozy.

1666
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,155
But I...
I haven't got the time.

1667
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,033
Oh, on a nice
autumn day like this,

1668
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,327
you couldn't spare
15 minutes for me?

1669
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:49,287
I don't like autumn.

1670
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,667
You're not being
very nice to a lonely girl.

1671
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:56,920
You look as though
you might be lonely, too.

1672
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,338
Yeah.

1673
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:03,176
I got to catch that boat.

1674
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:09,975
Fifteen minutes
shouldn't make such
a big difference, Mr. Fry.

1675
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,153
Who are you?

1676
01:43:25,283 --> 01:43:27,909
Come on.
Quit stalling.
Who are you?

1677
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:30,787
I think I told you.
A working girl
on her day off.

1678
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,414
Don't kid me!

1679
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:36,710
What are you doing here?

1680
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,462
It's rather
a long story, Mr. Fry.

1681
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:41,506
It all started with
an unknown blonde,

1682
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:43,842
an aircraft worker
at a factory
in Glendale, California.

1683
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,218
I get it.

1684
01:43:48,264 --> 01:43:51,141
Little Miss Liberty,
carrying the torch.

1685
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:54,644
Why'd you follow me?

1686
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,271
Why do you think?

1687
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,106
Take a look down there.

1688
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:01,276
If you can't figure
it out for yourself,
they're coming for you.

1689
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:26,509
Do you see him
in this bunch?

1690
01:44:26,594 --> 01:44:27,761
No.

1691
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:31,932
Barnes, you stay here
and watch this end.

1692
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:33,683
The rest of you fellows,
come with me.

1693
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:45,070
You two,
watch that side.

1694
01:44:51,494 --> 01:44:52,619
I'm going up.

1695
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:58,500
Barry!
Pat, where is he?

1696
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:00,001
He started down!
Are you sure?

1697
01:45:00,086 --> 01:45:01,419
Yeah.

1698
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,939
He's up here! Come on!

1699
01:45:43,838 --> 01:45:45,171
Come on, Fry!

1700
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:29,174
I'll get your sleeve.

1701
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:42,395
Don't you go over.
If you slip,
that will be three gone.

1702
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,064
Quick! Get a rope.

1703
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:48,651
Can you get a grip
with your feet?

1704
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:50,779
I can't.

1705
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,947
Kane, I'm getting a rope!

1706
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:55,200
They're getting a rope.
Hold on, Fry.

1707
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:57,786
I'll clear you.

1708
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:00,997
I swear I will.

1709
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:03,958
I'll clear you.

1710
01:47:04,043 --> 01:47:05,418
Hurry up with the rope!

1711
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:42,705
Tell them quick.
The sleeve. Sleeve!

1712
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:55,468
Kane!
