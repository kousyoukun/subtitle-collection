海角擒兇

5
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,070
狼來了
Here come the wolves.

6
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,130
哦  瓶頸路段  羅斯福應該聽說過這里
Uh-oh. Bottleneck. Mr. Roosevelt should hear of this.

7
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,130
對不起  希望你沒受傷
I'm sorry. Hope you didn't hurt yourself.

8
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,130
我朋友已說對不起
My friend says he's sorry.

9
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,130
好的
Okay.

10
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,150
這顯示金發女郎可影響國家安危
That shows what a blonde can do to hold up national defense.

11
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,720
好小子
Nice, pleasant guy.

12
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
是一百塊
Man ! Gee, a hundred bucks.

13
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,160
他們總是這樣的
So that's what they look like.

14
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,160
他去了哪里  
Where'd he go ?

15
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,230
不知道  不知他叫什么名字
I don't know. Uh-- I wonder what his name is.

16
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,170
且慢  我在信封上見到
I saw it on the envelope. Uh...

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,170
富禮  對了  是福禮
Fry. That's it. Fry.

18
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,260
富禮你怎知道我的名字  
Fry. How do you know my name ?

19
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,190
你何需介懷我如何知你的名字  
What do you care how I know your name ?

20
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,260
我在你丟的信封上看見
I saw it on one of the envelopes you dropped.

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,200
這是屬于你的
Here's something that belongs to you.

22
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,260
是油漆房
The paint shop !

23
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,270
會像炸藥爆炸
It'll go up like dynamite! Here. Take this one.

24
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,870
我也要救火  拿個滅火筒給我
What about me ? Don't I get to play too ? You get another. Right!

25
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,290
我看見那兩個小伙子
So I see these two kids.

26
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,300
我對他們呼叫  滅火花灑失靈
And I yell at them, ''The sprinklers are busted.

27
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,300
慘劇隨即發生
The whole shootin' match will go up.''

28
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,300
他倆沖入火場
And they run right in, the both of them.

29
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,300
當我回頭望時  最后目睹的  
And the last thing I saw when I looked back...

30
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,310
是其中一人將滅火筒交給另一人
was one kid give the extinguisher to the other kid,

31
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,320
然后更是一片火海
and then it was just like all hell comes up.

32
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,320
這是我目睹的一切
That's all I see.

33
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,320
附近有其他人嗎  
Was there anybody else around?

34
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,330
沒有  只有那兩人  
No. Just the two kids:

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,330
那拿著滅火筒及遞筒給他的人
the poor kid with the extinguisher and the one who give it to him.

36
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,330
謝謝你  羅渣士  多謝你幫忙
Thank you, Rogers. We appreciate all you've done.

37
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,340
我們不再耽誤你的時間了
We needn't keep you any longer now.

38
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,340
快去醫治你的手傷吧
Take care of those hands.

39
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,350
下一位是誰  
Who've you got next ?

40
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,350
有一位叫巴利堅尼的人在等候
There's a fellow Barry Kane waiting.

41
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,350
召巴利堅尼進來
Send Barry Kane in.

42
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,360
巴利堅尼
Barry Kane !

43
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,360
你不必緊張
All right. Just take it easy.

44
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,370
我們只是問你幾個問題
We only want to ask you a couple of questions.

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,370
是例行的查問
A routine checkup.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,370
我會盡我所能去幫你
Well, I want to do anything I can to help.

47
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,380
好極  可否告訴我們
Sure. Now, suppose you tell us

48
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,460
火警發生時你身在何處  
where you were when the fire started.

49
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,390
我是最先沖入火場的人
Well, I was one of the first to rush in.

50
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,390
當時滅火系統失靈
The sprinkler systems weren't working.

51
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,390
有誰跟你一起入火場  
Who else was with you ?

52
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,400
只有我和一個叫富禮的人
There was just myself, a fellow named Fry and my friend...

53
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,370
還有我朋友簡美臣繼續
Ken Mason.

54
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,400
富禮將滅火筒遞給我
Go on. Fry handed me an extinguisher.

55
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,410
我沖向火團
and I started running toward the fire.

56
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,420
我將滅火筒交給簡
I gave it to Ken.

57
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,420
然后  他  
And then he--

58
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,430
你輕松點  問完了
Okay. Take it easy. That's all.

59
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,430
你到外面稍候  我們會再需要你
Just stick around for a while. We may need you.

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,430
去找富禮
Send for Fry.

61
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,440
去找一個叫富禮的男子
Get hold of a fellow called Fry.

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,450
他們怎樣做  問你很多問題  
What'd they do, ask you a lot of questions ?

63
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,460
你目睹一切  實在很難過
Hardly any. Gee, it's awful tough going. seeing it happen in front of you.

64
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,460
對  很難過
Yeah, it is tough.

65
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,460
簡美臣是你的好友嗎  
Ken Mason was your pal, too. wasn't he ?

66
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,460
是
Yeah.

67
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,470
他已婚嗎  不  他跟母親同住
Was he married ? No. He was living with his mother.

68
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,470
她一定會很難過了
Must be pretty tough on her.

69
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,490
對不起  我遲些再找你
Sorry, fellows. I'll see you later.

70
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,520
美臣太太
Hello, Mrs. Mason.

71
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,530
他們  他們不讓我見他
They-- They wouldn't let me see him.

72
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,530
實在很難相信  事情發生得很快
It's awful hard to believe. It happened so quick.

73
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,530
為什么  只是今晨  
Why, only this morning-- Please !

74
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,970
請你別再提此事
Please don't talk about it now.

75
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,550
我有什么可以幫你  
Anything I can do ? Could I get you something ?

76
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,550
不  多謝你  暫時不必了
No. No, thank you. Not now.

77
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,560
或許喝點拔蘭地吧
Maybe some brandy.

78
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,570
那可憐的心靈怎么了  
How is the poor, dear soul ?

79
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,570
你是指美臣太太  她很傷心
If you mean Mrs. Mason, she's feeling bad.

80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,580
她當然會傷心  你知嗎  
Ah, well. She's every reason to.

81
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,580
他們竟不讓她見他
Do you know what ? They wouldn't even let her see him.

82
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,580
是她的獨子啊  
Her only son.

83
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,590
對  我知道
Yes. I know.

84
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,590
我告訴她  她有權堅持要見兒子
I told her to insist on seeing him.

85
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,590
我說我會堅持  她叫我滾
I told her I would, and she as good as told me to get out !

86
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,600
我只不過想幫她  可憐的心靈
Me ! That was only tryin' to help. The poor, dear soul.

87
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,600
可否告訴我何處可找到拔蘭地  
I think you can help,

88
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,600
喝點酒可幫她解憂愁
if you'll get some brandy.

89
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,600
年青人  你跟我來
You come with me, young man.

90
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,600
我家里存放著一點酒
I have a little in the house.

91
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,630
美臣太太  對不起  打擾你了
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Mason,

92
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,700
我們正在找尋巴利堅尼  他  
but we're looking for Barry Kane. Do you know him ?

93
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,650
他目前不在這里嗎  
He isn't here right now. is he ?

94
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,650
工廠的人說可在這里找到他
They told us at the plant we might be able to find him here.

95
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,650
他不在  你要找他是關于什么  
Well... what do you want to see him about ?

96
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,650
他惹上天大的麻煩
He's in pretty bad trouble,

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,660
是什么  我想知道
lady. What ? I'd like to know.

98
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,660
他涉及工廠的火警
He was mixed up with that fire at the factory.

99
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,660
我  我不明白
I-- I don't understand.

100
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,670
我們有也很多事情不明白
There are a lot of things we don't understand either.

101
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,670
巴利為何會牽涉此事  
But how is Barry involved in it ?

102
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,680
那滅火筒  似乎并非是意外
That fire extinguisher. Seems it wasn't just an accident.

103
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,020
巴利遞交的
It turns out that the extinguisher Barry Kane handed

104
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,210
滅火筒裝滿電油
your son... was filled with gasoline. Oh !

105
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,690
你一定可以幫到我們
You ought to be able to help us.

106
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,690
請提供線索  讓我們找到堅尼
Give us a lead on this guy Kane.

107
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,760
太太  這是我們到來搜查的原因
Yeah. That's why we want to look around. Well-- Why--

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,700
我目前未能說些什么
I can't talk about it now. I--

109
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,700
對不起  但你應知道  
Yeah. Sorry, but, you see, there was--

110
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,720
若我是你  便不會給她太大壓力
I wouldn't give her too much of that. It often makes people weepy.

111
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,720
若再提起便會令她泣不成聲  
I know it affects me-- Yes, I've got to hurr back.

112
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,720
摩亞太太  我要回去了  謝謝你
Thank you very much.

113
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,760
試一口吧  會令你舒服些的
Try some of this, Mrs. Mason. It'll make you feel better.

114
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,770
剛才有兩位探員到來
There were two detectives just here.

115
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,770
他們在找你
They were looking for you. For me ?

116
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,850
我猜他們要問我一些問題
I guess they wanted to ask more questions.

117
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,780
我說我幫不了忙  來  試試看
I said I'd help.Here. Try this.

118
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,850
不  他們是要拘捕你
No. That wasn't it. They wanted to arrest you.

119
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,320
他們說你遞交的
They said that the fire extinguisher that you handed to Kenneth...

120
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,790
滅火筒裝滿電油
was filled with gasoline.

121
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,800
是你殺死他
That you killed him.

122
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,800
我殺死他  
That I killed--

123
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,800
他們瘋了嗎  我怎會這樣做  
Why, are they crazy ? Why would I want to do a thing--

124
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,810
我怎會  簡是我最好的朋友
Ken was my best friend !

125
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,820
他們有否問過富禮關于那滅火筒
Haven't they talked to Fry about the extinguisher ?

126
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,820
他們說工廠沒有雇用這個人
They said that there was no such man employed at the plant.

127
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,820
但我見過他  見過兩次
Why, I saw him ! I saw him twice !

128
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,830
簡見過他  我們在火場見過面
Ken saw him too ! He was with us at the fire.

129
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,830
他將滅火筒遞給我  簡在開玩笑
He handed me the extinguisher. Ken said,

130
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,830
說要幫忙
''Don't I get to play too ?''

131
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,830
于是我將滅炎筒交給他
He was kidding. I handed it to him.

132
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,830
我肯定富禮當時和我們一起
Fry was right there with us, I'm sure !

133
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,850
他一定知道里面有電油的
Why, he must have known there was gasoline in it.

134
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,850
他一定會知道
He must have known !

135
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,850
他跟我們一起站著觀看
He stood right there with us and watched, that--

136
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,860
請你走吧
Please go.

137
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,870
你不相信我嗎  
Don't you believe me ?

138
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,880
你認為我有份參與此事  
Do you think I had something to do with this ?

139
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,950
我沒有對警方講任何說話
I didn't tell the police anything.

140
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:21,960
我不知  實在太混淆及可怕了
Oh, I don't know ! It's all so confused and so terrible.

141
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,590
我不明他們
I don't know what they're talking about !

142
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,890
為何不去找富禮
Why don't they get this fellow Fry ?

143
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,200
你最好快走
You'd better go.

144
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,900
好的  我會走
All right. I'll go.

145
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,940
我要去找富禮  定要找到他
I've got to find Fry,

146
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,920
否則簡不會是最后一個犧牲者
or Ken won't be the last one to die.

147
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,920
他一定在里面  我看見他走進去
I saw him go in the back way.

148
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,960
很悅耳什么  
Catchy.

149
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,960
你吹的那調子  
What ? That tune you're whistling.

150
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,960
我根本不知自己在吹口哨
Oh, I didn't even know I was whistling.

151
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,970
這表示你很快樂
You must be pretty happy.

152
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,980
顯而易見  你無憂無慮
Easy to see there's nothin' on your mind.

153
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,980
一定是我"小兒"我感覺到是他
Oops. That must have been Junior.Felt like him.

154
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,980
"小兒"
Junior ?

155
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,980
對  剛才那些敲打聲
Yeah. that rock.

156
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,060
我從羅省至連奴治路認識所有人
I know every one from Los Angeles to Reno.

157
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,990
駕駛貨車實在是艱苦的工作
Tough job, driving a truck.

158
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,990
今晚有其他最新消息嗎  
Got any other hot news tonight ?

159
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,990
我從未想過會如此艱辛
I never realized how tough it was before.

160
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,000
艱辛  你應可忍受
The tough part, you can take that.

161
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,000
你只不過感到無聊
It's the monotony that gets you.

162
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,370
我一直希望脫離這駕車生涯  
I been thinking I'm gonna get out of this trucking game.

163
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,080
為何不
Why don't you ?

164
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,020
我鄰居對我妻說每天要吃?餐
One of the neighbors told my wife it's stylish to eat three meals a day.

165
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,020
你結了婚嗎  
- You married ?

166
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,020
沒有
- Nope.

167
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,020
你繼續吹口哨吧
Go ahead and whistle.

168
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,020
什么事令你困擾  
That thing bother you ?

169
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,030
為何會這樣  
What's doin' it ?

170
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,100
用這疊報紙墊著它
Here. Stick this wad of paper in there, will you ?

171
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,030
滅火筒實在很有用
It's a pretty good thing to have around,

172
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,050
是駕車必備的設施
one of these extinguishers.

173
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,050
早幾天  有部運菜的貨車  
I wouldn't be without one. Now, take the other day.

174
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,050
在這里翻車  就在這里
A big truck turns over right down here.

175
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
瀉出的電油會令貨車著火
The gasoline catches, and she goes up like a matchbox.

176
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,050
司機女友被困車內若沒有滅火筒
A friend of the driver's gets caught in her.

177
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,170
司機將要送
If the driver hadn't had an extinguisher,

178
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,060
女友葬身火海了
his pal would have been fried alive.

179
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,060
我沒眼見到意外
I didn't see it happen. I never see anything happen.

180
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,060
亦未聽到任何消息
I don't even hear about anything, e

181
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,070
我妻只會跟我說棒球賽
xcept when my wife tells me the moving pictures.

182
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,080
她喜歡花這些錢
That's the way she spends the money:

183
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,080
看棒球和買新帽
moving pictures and new hats.

184
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:38,080
她愛買新帽然后戴著去看棒球
Buys a hat so she can go to the picture show so she can take it off.

185
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,090
而我卻無從反對
No, sir. I haven't got anything to whistle about.

186
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,090
老友  你來自何地  
Where are you from, bud ?

187
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,090
洛杉磯
Uh, Los Angeles.

188
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,090
你在那里工作  
Tough. You work down there ?

189
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,090
對  以前是
Yeah. Well, I did.

190
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,090
是什么工作  
What doin' ?

191
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,100
我是在飛機制造工作的
I was workin' in an airplane factory.

192
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,100
人們說那是一份優差
They say that's pretty good.

193
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,110
你不屬于軍部的嗎  
I was wondering why you weren't in the army.

194
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,110
是
Yeah.

195
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,180
事關國防  他們對雇員要求嚴格
They're particular about the fellows they hire in those defense plants.

196
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,120
這亦算正確
That's no more than right.

197
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,120
若雇員不小心便會令工廠爆炸
They gotta be careful they don't get blown up.

198
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,120
對
Yeah.

199
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,120
我知道若雇員有案底
I understand if a fellow had any police record,

200
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,130
便不會被錄用  是嗎  
no job. Is that right ?

201
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,130
我不知道
Oh. I don't know.

202
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,130
老友  可否代我控制方向盤  
Hey, buddy. Hold the wheel a while, will you,

203
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,440
我要點煙  我是個煙鬼
while I animate this thing. I'm a nicotine addict.

204
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,220
小心啊  別越過白線
Hey, watch it, bud ! Stay on this side of the white line.

205
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,160
到了史比維后  你在何處下車  
Where do you wanna get off when we get to Springville ?

206
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,230
到了市中心  隨時讓我下車吧
It doesn't matter. Drop me in the middle of town.

207
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,180
史比維便是市中心了
The minute you get to Springville, you're in the middle of the town.

208
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,180
那是個小鎮  很快便駛過
The next minute, the place is a memory.

209
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,180
整個鎮沒有什么建筑物
Whole town isn't a city block long.

210
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,180
你要到那個農場嗎  
You're goin' to one of those big ranches outside, aren't you ?

211
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,180
是
- Yeah.

212
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,190
你要到那里  我便送你到門口
- I'd be glad to drop you off at whatever one you want.

213
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,220
到了  春天農場  
That's it ! Deep Springs Ranch.

214
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,220
唏  那農場很大
Hey ! Say, that's a whale of a big place.

215
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,220
你要去那里找工作嗎  
Got a chance of a job there ?

216
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,230
是  我看是的
Yeah. I think so.

217
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,240
你定會喜歡  天氣怡人
You ought to like it. Nice climate.

218
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,250
警察  可能有事發生
The police ! Maybe something's happened !

219
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,260
我有話跟你說  下車
I'd like to talk with you out here. Yeah. Sure. officer !

220
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,260
好的  你留在這里  我一會兒回來
Stay here. I'll be right back.

221
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,290
老朋友  上車吧  已經行了
Hey, bud ! Come on. Everything's fixed.

222
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,300
晚安  警官
Good night, Officer.

223
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,310
你會料到如此嗎  
Can you imagine a thing like that ?

224
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,310
那警察響起警號追截  
Cop, sirens, the whole works !

225
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,310
原因是我的車尾燈壞了
One of my taillights went out.

226
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,320
這是駕車生涯的悲歌
That's the trucking game for you in a nutshell.

227
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,330
通知各公路巡警  
Calling all highway patrolmen.

228
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,330
請留意一個叫巴利堅尼的男子
Be on lookout for a man named Barry Kane.

229

How do you do ? Is, uh, Mr. Frank Fry here ?

235
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,420
這是杜賓的農場
No, this is Mr. Tobin's ranch.

236
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,430
我可否跟杜賓先生談談  
Oh. Uh, could I speak to Mr. Tobin ?

237
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,400
請稍后  你在這里等我
Well, I'll see. Just a minute. You wait here, please.

238
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,450
我們接你的球
There. We've got the ball.

239
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,450
主人  有位先生要見你
Throw it to me. Ayoung man to see you. sir.

240
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,250
拋給我  乖女孩
Throw it to me. Where is Daddy's girl ?

241
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,450
艾黛  你說什么  
What did you say, Adele ?

242
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,730
有位年青男士要找富禮先生
Who wants to see me ? Ayoung man, sir. He came to ask for a Mr. Fr.

243
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,460
請你叫他來
Oh. Well. Have him come out here, will you ?

244
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,470
將球拋給我
Yes, sir. Throw me the ball. Throw me the ball.

245
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,480
爺爺來了
Here comes your granddaddy.

246
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,490
杜賓先生會見你  請跟我來

你好嗎  你好
How do you do ?Well,

250
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,510
別介意我衣著隨便
I'm not gonna ask you to excuse the informality of this costume.

251
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,510
我們春天農場是很隨便的
We're all informal out here at Deep Springs Ranch.

252
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,520
是我們這里的規矩
That's one of the rules. I see.

253
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,520
我帶蘇絲出去  以免妨礙你
Want me to take Suzy with me ?

254
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,520
不  蘇絲不會妨礙我們
No, Suzy isn't gonna disturb us at all.

255
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,520
讓她在這里玩  我會照顧她了
Just let her play right here. I'll see she doesn't fall in the pool.

256
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,530
好的
All right.

257
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,530
我們到那邊去  好嗎  
Well, shall we sit out here ?

258
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,530
好的
Yes. sir.

259
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,540
天朗氣清  最適宜戶外活動
It seems a shame to go indoors on such a beautiful day.

260
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,540
是啊
Yes, it does.

261
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,550
你有事要見我嗎  
You wanted to see me about something ?

262
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,550
是  我要找一個叫法蘭富禮的人
Yes, sir. I'm looking for a man named Fry. Frank Fry.

263
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,620
我在洛杉磯遇到他  我知道他住在這里
I met him up in Los Angeles. I understand he lives here.

264
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,550
不
Oh, no. No.

265
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,560
富禮  
Fry, huh ?

266
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,570
法蘭富禮  我不認識這名字的人
Frank Fry. I'm afraid I don't know anybody by that name.

267
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,400
我似曾聽過這名字
Wait a minute. Fry. I've heard that name somewhere.

268
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,580
但沒有印象  
I just don't seem to be able to place it.

269
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,500
以前有個這名字的人
Uh, there used to be a fellow... with a name something like that,

270
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,650
在這里工作
worked around here.

271
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,660
不  他不是富禮
No. No. It wasn't Fry.

272
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,590
你可以找錯地址了
Well, I'm afraid you found the wrong address.

273
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,600
或許是你這里的工人  
Well, it couldn't be one of the cowhands or somebody who's working ?

274
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,610
不會  我記得所有工人的名字
No, I know the names of all my men.

275
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,610
等等  是我的鄰居  
Wait a minute. My next door neighbor--

276
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,610
我鄰居距離這里二十里
''Next door neighbor.'' He lives 20 miles from here !

277
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,610
他可能認識你的朋友讓
But he may know.

278
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,620
我致電給他
I'll telephone him.

279
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,620
不  不必勞煩了
Oh, no, please don't.

280
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,620
絕對不會  你跑了這么遠的路
No, no ! You look as though you've had a hard journey.

281
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,620
我不想你白走一趟
Too bad if you came all this way for nothing.

282
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,630
你稍候  我們起碼也要搞清楚
If you'll just wait, we can find out.

283
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,600
你要照顧蘇絲  別讓她掉進泳池
Will you see that Suzy doesn't fall into the pool ? Yes, sir. Thank you.

284
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,650
唏  過來
Hey. Come here.

285
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,410
過來
Come over here.

286
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,660
你要玩球嗎  將球拋給我
Oh, so you're a ball player, are you ? Throw me the ball.

287
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,670
給我吧  拋給我
Let me have it. Come on. Throw me the ball.

288
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,670
對了  拋另一個給我
Throw me the other one. Come on.

289
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,740
來吧  拋給我  好極了
Throw it to me. Come on. Give me the ball.

290
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,750
我拋回給你
That's fine. Fine ! Now, I'll throw it back.

291
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,690
你去哪里  別這樣做
Where are you goin' ? Uh-oh. Don't do that.

292
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,690
放回原位
Leave those where they are. Leave them right there.

293
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,700
"致法蘭富禮"

294
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,710
"勞煩查理杜賓轉交"

295
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,720
"已辦妥  在梳打鎮會合尼爾信"

296
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,720
"法蘭字"

297
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,740
你要乖呀  快放回原位
Wanna be a good girl ? Put these back where you found them.

298
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,740
叔叔叫你將它放回原位
No, no, Suzy. The gentleman says put them back where you found them.

299
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,090
你要小心保管
The gentleman knows that you must be careful

300
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,750
不屬于你的信件
with letters that don't belong to you.

301
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,860
我并非偏心  
Probably I'm prejudiced, but it seems to me...

302
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,920
蘇絲確實很可愛
that Suzy is a pretty cute young lady.

303
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,820
她很可愛  法蘭富禮在哪里  
Yeah. she's great. Where's Frank Fry ?

304
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,770
你的記憶力一定有問題了
Really, you must do something about that memory of yours.

305
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,770
剛才你看過富禮給我的電報
It wasn't a minute ago that you read a telegram that Fry sent me,

306
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,850
他說正在前往梳打鎮途中
and it said that he was on his way to Soda City.

307
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,780
你記得嗎  
Don't you remember that ?

308
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,780
梳打市在哪里  
Where's Soda City ?

309
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,780
我未曾詳細查核過  
Well, I haven't given it much thought, but I wouldn't imagine...

310
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,850
梳打市已廢置應已在地圖上消失
there'd be an overabundance of Soda Cities on the map.

311
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,790
但總會有辦法可找到的
You could find out some way.

312
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,790
來自洛杉磯的最新消息
bringing you last-minute headlines.

313
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,550
史劍活飛機廠
Los Angeles. The fire in the Stewart Aircraft Works

314
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,800
火警中有一人喪生
in which one man was killed,

315
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,810
傷者眾多  損失超過五十萬
many injured and half a million dollars' worth of damage caused,

316
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,810
肯定是被陰謀破壞
has been definitely set down to sabotage.

317
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,810
警方正追尋爆炸之兇巴利堅尼
Police have traced the incendiary blaze to Barry Kane,

318
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,820
是飛機廠的前任  
former--

319
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,820
你不想再聽吧
Don't want any more of that.

320
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,820
你定會對描述自己感到沉悶
Think you'd be rather bored with the descriptions of yourself.

321
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,820
你或許不會覺得煩厭
Or maybe you never get tired of them. Well, I am by this time.

322
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,910
但我整個早上也在聽這些報導
I've been listening to those reports all morning.

323
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,840
你已知道我了  究竟如何  
You knew me. What about it ?

324
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,840
我相信你已知道一切
Oh, quite a lot about it, Mr. Kane. You ought to know that.

325
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,850
你已舉世聞名  何必保持低調
You've become too famous to remain so modest.

326
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,850
可否告訴我一件事  可以
Tell me one thing.

327
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,850
你為何要維護法蘭富禮  
Why are you covering up Frank Fry ?

328
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,850
你為何要如此對待這人  
What's a man like you in this for ?

329
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,850
年青人  我不知你在說什么
Young man, I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,870
我看你是知道的  他是個破壞者
I think maybe you do !

331
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,870
收受金錢殺戮美國人
Frank Fry is a saboteur who doesn't mind killing Americans for money.

332
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,870
堅尼先生  你要自己小心
You must watch yourself, Mr. Kane !

333
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,880
我這樣說是為你好
I'm telling you this for your own benefit,

334
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,880
你會招惹很多麻煩的
but you have the makings of an outstanding bore.

335
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,880
杜賓  你也不能置身事外
You can't get away with this.

336
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,880
我不阻止你  其他人也會的
Even if I don't stop you, others will.

337
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,890
你這類人是不能在國內安枕的
A man like you can't last in a country like this.

338
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,890
好漂亮的說話
Very pretty speech.

339
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,900
有朝氣  有熱誠  有理想
Youthful, passionate, idealistic.

340
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,900
我已通知警方
You see, I've already sent for the police.

341
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,910
你別嚇唬我  你也有關連的
You can't bluff me. You're hooked, and you know it.

342
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,910
我提醒你  你是個逃犯而我不是
Must I remind you that you are the fugitive and not I ?

343
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,910
我是個廣受愛戴的顯赫公民
I'm a prominent citizen, widely respected.

344
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,930
你是個重犯  
You are an obscure young workman...

345
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,880
是個逃亡的工人
wanted for the committing of an extremely unpopular crime.

346
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,920
你認為警方會相信誰  
Which of us do you think the police will believe ? Hmm ?

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,940
你定以為我是個窮困的主人家了
Oh, you must think me a very poor host, Mr. Kane.

348
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,940
要喝杯什么飲品嗎  
Now, don't you feel that a long, cold drink is indicated ?

349
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,940
我已清楚你要跟我講的說話
I found out everything you're gonna tell me.

350
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,950
我要離去  獨自應付未來
I'll have to do the rest by myself.

351
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,950
你意思是要離開我們  
You wish to leave us ?

352
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,950
艾黛  堅尼先生要走了
Adele, Adele! Mr. Kane is going!

353
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,960
對不起  請你停步
I'm sorry. You'll stop, please.

354
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,970
這是什么  水槍  
What does that shoot ? Water ?

355
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,970
我恐怕會有子彈
Bullets. I'm afraid.

356
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,970
你別憂心沖沖地離去吧  堅尼
You shouldn't be so anxious to leave us.

357
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,970
你傷害我們的感情
You'll hurt our feelings.

358
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,980
你令我難以抗拒你的邀請
You make it very hard for me to refuse your invitations.

359
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,980
蘇絲  來吧
- Suzy, come on.

360
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,980
不  蘇絲  過來
- No, no, Suzy ! Come here.

361
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,980
來吧  蘇絲  你知要去何處嗎  
Hello, Suzy. You know where we're going ?

362
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,990
我們要去騎牛牛
For a piggyback ride. You like piggyback rides ?

363
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,010
祖  快去追他
Dick, Joe! Get after him !

364
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,010
追他  快  
Hurry up ! Get him ! Get after him ! Hurry up !

365
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,040
繼續走  
Come on. Get going.

366
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,040
等等  你不能這樣帶我走的
You can't take me away like this.

367
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,040
別教我們做事  快走吧
Don't tell us what we can't do, chum. Go on. Get started !

368
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,040
我告訴你  你要去拘捕他
You gotta get him ! Just because he's got a big ranch...

369
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,510
他擁有一間大農場泳池及大屋  
and a fancy pool doesn't mean

370
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,120
你便認為他是個好人嗎
he's a nice guy !

371
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,050
你為何不去了解他所做的一切  
Find out the things he's been doing ! Sure. We know all about that.

372
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,070
我們已了解一切  你走吧  那寶寶收藏那些信件
Just come on along. The baby had the letters !

373
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,070
蘇絲當然會樂于合作
Oh, Suzy would be only too glad to cooperate,

374
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:10,300
但她要過幾個月才能提供協助
but it'll be months before she'll be of any assistance.

375
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,150
不  蘇絲  不是給你的
No, no, Suzy. Those are not for Suzy. Those are for the gentleman.

376
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,080
是給這位先生的
All right, let's go.

377
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,100
我們要去哪里  
Where are we goin' ?

378
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,100
要帶你去見識一下本州的監獄
We're gonna let you get an idea of the county jail.

379
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,110
這是西部最好的監獄
You won't find it the best in the West.

380
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,110
在這里住兩天無傷大雅
But it won't hurt you

381
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,110
待洛杉磯警方來接你吧
'til they come up from Los Angeles for you.

382
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,110
你沒有手令是不能拘留我的
You can't hold me without a warrant. Chum.

383
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,120
我不是說過  別教我做事啊
Do I have to keep askin' you not to tell us what we can't do ?

384
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,120
我要向你解釋  沒有時間了
I'm tryin' to explain ! There isn't time !

385
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,120
有的是時間  你別擔心
Time's the one thing you don't need to worry about.

386
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,130
若找到個好律師
You'll have it to burn.

387
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,140
你可過二十年平靜舒適的生活
You'll have 20 years, if you get the right lawyer.

388
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,140
否則  你的一生便就此告終
If you don't, you'll have all the time there is.

389
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,140
有何不妥  為何在此停車  
- What's wrong ? What's holding us up ?

390
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,150
前面有輛貨車阻擋去路
- Truck blockin' the road.

391
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,150
似乎在換輪胎
Looks like they're changin'a tire.

392
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,380
有香煙嗎  有
Got a cigarette ? Sure. All you want.

393
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,170
你好嗎  老友
Hiya, bud !

394
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,170
什么事  
Hey, what's the matter ?

395
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:00,010
他往那邊逃了他在那兒
There he goes ! There he is !

396
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,400
有人嗎  
Hello there.

397
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,410
我遇上雷暴  全身都濕透了
Hello. I got caught in this storm. I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid.

398
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,410
不如進來  先抹干身體吧
Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry.

399
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,480
你將車留在路上嗎  何不將它駛來這里  
Did you leave your car down on the road ? Put it in the shed.

400
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,420
任由它被風吹雨打不大好啊
It won't do it any good standing in the rain.

401
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,420
我沒有汽車的
I don't have any car.

402
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,430
你可說我是徒步旅行
You might say I'm traveling by thumb.

403
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
徒走  對  我是搭順風車的
By thumb ? Yeah. I'm a hitchhiker.

404
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,420
我認為這是
Oh, I see. I've always thought that was

405
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,510
了解民風的好方法
the best way to learn about this country,

406
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,440
亦是測試美國民心的妙法
and the surest test of the American heart.

407
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,440
對  我猜是的
Yes, I guess it is.

408
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,440
你去火爐旁烘干衣服吧
Will you go to the fire and dr your clothes ?

409
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,440
謝謝
Thanks.

410
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,450
將衣服掛起來會快干一點
They'd dry more quickly

411
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,450
你穿上我的衣服吧
if you put on something of mine.

412
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
不  謝謝了  這樣可以了
Oh, no, thanks ! This is fine.

413
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,530
我們要加添柴枝  好嗎  
We could do with another log on the fire. Would you ?

414
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,470
當然
Why, sure.

415
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,470
你要留下來待暴雨過去
You must stay until this blows over.

416
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,470
不會誤你太久的
It won't detain you long.

417
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,470
秋天的暴雨通常不會持久
These autumn storms are short.

418
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,480
令人衣衫盡濕  但維時短暫
They yield to none in wetness, but they are short. Yes. I--

419
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,490
我應警告你  那些木是很重的
I should have warned you. Those logs are heavier than you'd think.

420
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,500
我也常常丟在地上
I drop them constantly.

421
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,500
對  很重
Yes, they are heavy.

422
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,500
我還以為可以一雙后拿起它
I guess I was too smart trying to pick it up with one hand.

423
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,580
幸虧沒有掉在腳上
Good job it didn't land on your foot. That often happens to me.

424
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,510
我常被擊中腳  你真幸運
You're lucky.

425
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,510
對  我很幸運
Yeah. I'm lucky.

426
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,530
我忘了  我叫菲力馬田
Oh, I was forgetting. My name is Philip Martin.

427
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,530
我叫巴利  美臣
Oh, I'm Barry K-- Mason.

428
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,530
美臣  在暴雨中得你光臨寒舍
I'm glad you found yourself near here, Mr. Mason, when the storm came.

429
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
在雨水打在屋頂的時刻
It's a pleasant thing to have a guest sharing the fire

430
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,540
能遇到你這貴賓實在是樂事
when the rain is beating on the roof.

431
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,540
你在這里獨居嗎  
- You live here alone, sir ?

432
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,540
是  但我并非這般想法
- Yes, except I don't think of it in that way.

433
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,550
聲音對我來說是光芒  是色彩
You see, sounds are my lights and my colors.

434
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,560
例如說音樂  我作了些樂曲
My music, for example. I compose a little.

435
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:51,630
不必人言  我也覺得很美妙
And there is nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant,

436
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,570
因此我樂得自娛  活得開心
so I live in a comfortable glow of self-appreciation.

437
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,580
我也樂意演奏別人的作品
##

438
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,580
毫無疑問  你也會樂于聆聽的
Undoubtedly, you'd prefer listening to them.

439
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,580
我以前中學時是玩敲擊樂哭的
I used to play the triangle in our high school

440
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,580
但已是很久以前的事了
band a long time ago.

441
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,940
你竟疏于
Oh, that's too bad. It's unfortunate

442
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,360
練習敲擊樂器
when you get out of practice on the triangle.

443
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,600
鋼琴簡直是上天對我的恩賜
The piano is a boon to me.

444
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,600
鋼琴不知你是盲的
The piano can't know that you're blind,

445
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,680
它不會令你尷尬  不會令你難過
so it doesn't embarrass you by trying to make things easier for you.

446
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,610
它令你信任它
It does you the compliment to trust you.

447
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,610
英國作曲家狄里斯也是失明的
Delius, the British composer, was blind too.

448
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,620
這是我們唯一相近似的地方
That's our only resemblance.

449
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,630
這是他的"仲夏夜的河畔"
This is his ''Summer Night on the River.''

450
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,710
深入咬蘋果聲  效果很有趣
A very interesting effect: obligato on an apple.

451
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,640
美臣先生  我要向你道歉
Oh, I apologize, Mr. Mason.

452
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,710
我忘記你長途跋涉后很肚餓
I forgot how hungry you must be after your long walk.

453
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,640
等一會  我去替你預備  
Just a moment. I'll get something. Oh, no. Thanks.

454
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,720
不  多謝了  我喜歡吃蘋果
This is fine. I-- I like apples.

455
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,660
我也喜歡  留待作甜品吧
So do I. We'll save them for dessert.

456
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,670
晚餐已預備好了
It was all ready, you see.

457
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,680
我常要人提醒我進食
All I needed was a reminder that I was hungry too.

458
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,680
你衣服干透了嗎  
Are you dry enough ?

459
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,680
差不多了
Just about. sir.

460
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,690
雨已停了
It stopped raining.

461
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,770
有汽車來嗎  
Is that a car coming ?

462
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,770
我猜是兩架失陪了
Two cars, I think.

463
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,710
其中一架是我侄女的  我認得
One car is my niece's. I'd know that motor anywhere.

464
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,710
另一架是陌生的
The other is a stranger to me.

465
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,710
另一車內有兩名男子  那女孩  
A couple of men.The girl's

466
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,730
站在車旁指點  似是問路的人
pointing down the road. They must have asked her where to go.

467
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,730
在這國家很易迷途
This is an easy country to lose your way in.

468
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,730
這正是可愛之處
That's one of its charms.

469
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,730
汽車已開走了
They're starting off down the road now.

470
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,730
那女孩正從小徑上來
The girl's coming.

471
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,740
她是我的侄女  來這里陪我
That's my niece. She's been staying with me.

472
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,740
她每年從紐約來陪我一個月
She comes from New York to spend a month with me every year.

473
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,740
這是我最大的樂趣
It's one of my greatest pleasures.

474
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,750
最令我不高興的是她不能久留
Unhappily for me, she can't stay longer.

475
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,760
一個月后  寂靜令她變聾
After a month, she finds the quiet deafening.

476
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,760
菲力叔叔
Uncle Philip. Hello, old boy.

477
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,760
你知否發生了什么事  
Uncle Philip, what do you think happened ? Oh.

478
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,770
你知我們有貴客到嗎  
You didn't know we had a guest.

479
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,770
你轉過身看看
You turned your back, and see what happens.

480
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,770
我侄女柏茜雅馬田  美臣先生
My niece, Patricia Martin, Mr. Mason.

481
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,770
你好嗎  你好
How do you do ? How do you do ?

482
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,780
叔叔  路上有架車滿載探員
Uncle Philip, there was a car full of detectives down the road.

483
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,850
他們想知道往市中心的路
They wanted to know the way to town.

484
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,780
他們正在找尋一個逃犯
They're searching for a man.

485
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,780
已在電臺全面廣播
It was on all the radios.

486
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,790
他們說那人是個危險的罪犯
A really dangerous criminal--

487
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,800
警方總愛危言聳聽
My dear, the police are always on the alarmist side.

488
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,800
但他們說那人真的很危險
- But they said this man is really dangerous !

489
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,800
他們一定會這樣說
- I'm sure they did.

490
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,800
若他無殺傷力怎顯得警方是英雄
How could they be heroes if he were harmless ?

491
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,810
柏  別再引述警方的說話了
Would you mind not having any further quotations from the police ?

492
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,810
他們的言論是有計謀的
Their remarks are always so expected.

493
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,810
要杜絕批評
They kill conversation.

494
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,860
你可能覺得我侄女很面熟  美臣
You've probably seen the face of my niece before, Mr. Mason.

495
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,830
對  不知在那里見過她
Why, yes. I was wondering where I'd seen--

496
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,830
其實你應該到處都可見到她
As a matter of fact, you've seen her practically everywhere.

497
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,840
我得悉她的服飾地通行全國
I'm told that billboards she adorns would reach across the continent...

498
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,910
我想不到有人會穿她那些服飾
if placed end to end. I can't imagine who's going to place them end to end,

499
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,840
有誰會仿效她的衣著  
nor why they should consider it the thing to do.

500
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,860
叔叔一直不喜歡我當模特兒
Uncle Philip never has been enthusiastic over my career as a model.

501
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,860
親戚總是如此的
Relatives are like that.

502
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,930
你倆打算繼續吃  不理我  
My, aren't you two mean, going ahead and eating without me !

503
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,870
我很肚餓  可否將碟遞給我  
I'm starving. Would you pass me one of those plates, please, Mr. Mason ?

504
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,970
你已看見他的手銬嗎  
- Oh ! - What's the matter ? Have you just seen his handcuffs ?

505
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,900
他進來時我已聽到了
I heard them as soon as he came in.

506
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,900
我相信他正是警方要找的那個人
Uncle Philip, he must be the man they're looking for.

507
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,910
對  有可能
Yes, very probably.

508
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,910
你應將他交給警方
But you should have given him to the police !

509
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,910
你恐懼嗎  恐懼令你如此殘忍嗎  
Are you frightened, Pat ? Is that what makes you so cruel ?

510
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,920
你必須這樣做  他是個危險人物
But you've got to ! He's a dangerous man.

511
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,930
柏  美臣可能犯事
Oh, Pat, come on, Mr. Mason may be many things,

512
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
但他絕非危險人物
but he's certainly not dangerous.

513
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,940
你別忘記身為美國公民的責任
Uncle Philip, it's your duty as an American citizen !

514
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,940
我為身美國公民的責任  
It is my duty as a citizen...

515
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,940
是要相信他是無辜的
But you should have given him to the police !

516
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,940
直至他被定罪
to believe a man innocent until he's been proved guilty.

517
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,940
別對我說權責吧
Don't tell me about my duty.

518
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,960
人們會以為我古板守舊
It makes you sound so stuffy.

519
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,960
此外我對公民責任有自己的見解
Besides, I have my own ideas about my duties as a citizen.

520
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,960
有時候需要漠視法律的
They sometimes involve disregarding the law.

521
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,960
你打算怎樣做  
But what are you going to do with him ?

522
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,960
你打算怎樣對付他  
But what are you going to do with him ?

523
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,970
我打算將他交給你
I'm going to turn him over to you, my dear.

524
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,970
你要送他去找添  那打鐵匠
And you're going to drive him down to Tim, the blacksmith,

525
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,980
將那荒謬的裝置從他手腕拆除
and have those preposterous contraptions removed from his wrists.

526
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,980
菲力叔叔  我怎能做這種事  
Oh, how could I do a thing like that ?

527
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,990
你應知道我的目光較你遠大
'Cause you know I can see a great deal farther than you can.

528
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,060
我能預知未來的事  例如  被冤枉
I can see intangible things. For example, innocence.

529
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,000
美臣先生  你愿跟我侄女去嗎  
Will you go with my niece, Mr. Mason ? Oh. yes. sir.

530
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,070
愿意  若你不介意的話
Uh, if you don't mind ?

531
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,000
我該怎樣對鐵匠說  
What'll I tell the blacksmith ?

532
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,010
告訴他  美臣是我朋友及貴賓
Tell him Mr. Mason is my friend and my guest.

533
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,010
他不會再問你其他問題的
He won't ask any other questions.

534
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,020
去吧  柏
Go ahead, Pat.

535
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,030
跟她去吧  巴利
Go with her, Barry.

536
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,030
巴利是你的名字
Barry, I know, is your name.

537
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,030
但我聽得出美臣并非真姓氏
Your voice explained to me that ''Mason'' isn't.

538
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,030
但正如我跟你說過的
But as I told you before,

539
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,040
名字并不太重要
names are of such little importance.

540
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,040
我不知道如何感激你  馬田先生
I-- I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Martin.

541
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,040
去吧  巴利
Go ahead, Barry. Go ahead.

542
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,050
做些我希望做到的事情吧
And do the things I wish I could do.

543
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,500
祝你好運  
Good luck, Barry, and for heaven's sake,

544
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,660
要練習敲擊樂器啊
get back in practice on that triangle !

545
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,070
鐵匠的店鋪很遠嗎  
Is the blacksmith's shop very far ?

546
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,080
不太遠  由此直去
Not ver. Right along here.

547
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,090
他真的不會有問題  
And, uh, is he-- Is he really all right ?

548
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,090
他跟我叔叔是好朋友
He and my uncle are great friends. Oh.

549
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,090
那么  我看不會有問題了
I guess he's all right, then.

550
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,100
別擔心  他沒問題的
You needn't worry. He's all right.

551
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,100
他是個親切的人
He's a darling blacksmith,

552
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,100
唯一擔心是他應付手銬的經驗
only I'm not sure how much experience he's had with handcuffs.

553
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,110
介意我看看手銬嗎  
Do you mind if I see them ?

554
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,110
不知他會如何拆除它
I wonder-- I can't quite see.

555
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,120
我看不清楚  可否拿近一點
Could you hold them nearer ?

556
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,120
現在我可安心點了
Now I feel better.

557
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,120
我看你一定會  
I'll bet you do.

558
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,130
我看這樣會令你高興
I'll bet this makes you feel great.

559
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,130
你想知的打鐵匠店在后面兩里
The blacksmith shop is two miles back.

560
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,130
我們正前往警局途中
We're on our way to the police.

561
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,130
你叔叔肯定會以你為榮
Your uncle's gonna be proud of you !

562
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,130
世上很少老人家像我叔叔般仁慈
The world isn't full of kind old gentlemen

563
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,140
你嘗試去找吧  若叔叔多了解你
. You're gonna find that out.

564
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,140
也不會如此仁慈對待你
Even my uncle wouldn't have been so kind if he'd known more.

565
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,140
向前走吧  我做過些什么  
All right, go ahead. What'd I do ?

566
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,140
我也想知道
I'd be happy to know.

567
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,150
若你犯的是其他案件  
If it had been any other crime--

568
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,160
若因饑餓而偷竊
if a man had stolen because he was starving,

569
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,160
又或者為了自衛而殺人
even committed murder to defend himself,

570
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,160
我也不會將你送交警方
maybe I wouldn't tell the police.

571
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,160
唯一原因是你進行陰謀破壞
But there's only one reason why a man commits sabotage.

572
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,160
這比殺人更差勁
That's worse than murder.

573
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,170
你令我驚訝  我贊同你每句說話
Surprise, Miss Martin. I agree with ever word.

574
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,170
別再跟我說話了
Please don't talk to me.

575
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,170
我喜歡說
That'll be my pleasure.

576
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,190
我看她不喜歡說話
Well ! I'll see that she doesn't !

577
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,210
以后別再這樣開車  很辛苦的
Never try driving this way; it hurts.

578
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,220
我要去截車
I'm stopping the first car I see !

579
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,470
對不起
Help !

580
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,470
對不起  沒有你我寸步難行
Come on. I can't get along without you.

581
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,490
放我走  救命呀  快報警  
Let me go ! Help ! Help ! Get the police !

582
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,510
救命呀  
Help !

583
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,490
他倆定是一對怨侶
My, they must be terribly in love.

584
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,530
這車可能過熱了
Looks as though this car has been overheated.

585
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,530
是風扇壞了
Fan's broken.

586
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,540
我很冷
I'm cold.

587
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,540
我知道  肚子也餓吧
Yeah, I know. And you're hungry.

588
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,550
主要是冷
Now mostly I'm cold.

589
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,560
若你不再扮英雄  相信我吧
If you'd stop trying to be a hero and decide to be on my side,

590
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,560
或許可替你想辦法驅寒
maybe we could do something about your being cold.

591
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,560
生一堆火  
Build a fire ?

592
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,560
不  我沒這打算
No, I wasn't exactly thinking of that.

593
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,570
我不作嘗試并非要侮辱你
Well, I didn't want to insult you by not even trying.

594
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,570
你為何要告發我  你的照片  
What do you want to turn me in for ?

595
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,570
已到處可見  仍想搏取知名度  
Haven't you got your picture in enough places now ?

596
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,590
我只是盡公民責任
I just want to do my duty.

597
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,590
你是不明白的
That's hard for you to understand.

598
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,590
你為何不信我是無辜的  
Why won't you believe I'm all right ?

599
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,590
因你的表現不合情理
You don't make sense.

600
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,590
若沒做過  應去面對警方
If you hadn't done it, you would have gone to the police.

601
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,590
我跟你說過  只是時間問題
It's a question of time !

602
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,590
若去投案將要花數周時間作解釋
It'd take weeks to convince them.

603
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,600
若他們像你般愚昧更要花數月
If they're as dumb as you are, it'll take me months !

604
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,600
你知否我們離開梳打鎮很遠了  
Do you think we're very far from Soda City ?

605
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,670
我不知  到了下一個鎮再問路
I don't know. We'll ask at the next town. If there's a next town.

606
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,620
無論如何我也不相信杜賓那件事
Anyway, I don't believe that part about Tobin.

607
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,620
你不相信  
You don't believe it

608
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,620
因為他擁有農場  泳池及大屋
because he's got a big ranch and a pool--

609
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,630
任何美國人也不會置信
No. It's just hard to believe that about any American.

610
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,630
但人相信我是兇徒  
Well, you believe it about me!

611
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,630
你不同  你像個陰謀破壞者
Well, you're different. You look like a saboteur.

612
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,640
你有破壞的傾向
You have a saboteur's disposition.

613
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,650
難道你決定相信我了  
Don't tell me you've decided to be on my side.

614
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,660
不  我很冷
No, I'm cold.

615
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:26,190
你在浪費寶貴光陰
Say, aren't you wasting your very valuable time,

616
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,360
去欣賞風景
sitting up here admiring the scenery ?

617
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,670
唏  你看
Hey, look at that.

618
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,670
我們有伙伴了
Looks like we've got company.

619
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,670
他們列隊到來做什么呢  
What do you suppose all that's doing way up here ?

620
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,680
他們移動很慢
They aren't moving very fast, are they ?

621
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,690
知否我們可怎么辦  
You know what we can do ?

622
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,690
噢  你是不會的
Oh, no, you won't.

623
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,700
我不會冒險的
Sorry, I can't take a chance.

624
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,700
到了下一個站定會告發你
You're right. I'll kill you the first opportunity I get.

625
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,900
放開我
Let go of me ! Let me go ! Ouch !

626
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,720
救命啊
Help ! Help !

627
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,720
可否暫時放過我  
Won't you give me one break ?

628
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,720
待我們到梳打鎮后再作打算  
. Wait 'til we get to Soda City ?

629
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,730
對不起  我要留下你
All right. I'm sorry I've got to leave you here alone,

630
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,730
去做早決定的事
but I told you what I've got to do.

631
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,730
我只有一件事要做
There's only one thing

632
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,730
我警告你  這里有很多蛇
I want to warn you about. Snakes.

633
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,740
當然  只有五六種是有毒的
There are a lot out here. There's only five or six poisonous kinds.

634
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,750
它們是又長又滑的
But there are a lot of long, slippery, slimy ones.

635
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,760
巴利
- Barry!

636
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,760
我可重見天日了  比蛇更自由
- I'm coming up in the world; I'm better than the snakes.

637
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,760
巴利  求求你
Barry, please!

638
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,770
你要跟隨我嗎  是的
Are you with me ? Yes, yes!

639
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,780
什么事令你改變主意了  
What made you change your mind ?

640
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,780
因我處身荒野便不能告發你
I can't turn you in if I'm stuck out there.

641
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,790
那么  回去跟蛇蟲鼠蟻為伍吧
So that's it. Go back with the reptiles.

642
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,790
放開我  
Let me go !

643
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:56,860
誰在這里  你們不能在這里
Who's there ? You've got no right here!

644
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,790
快停手  下車
Stop it and get off!

645
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,860
是偷渡客
Now, now, Major. Ah, stowaways.

646
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,800
在沙漠中又再捉多兩個流浪者
In the middle of this desert sea, we acquired two more vagabonds.

647
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,870
像我們一樣  是游牧民族
Bedouins like ourselves,

648
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,800
什么  只不過是兩個小伙子
eh, Esmeralda ? They're just a couple of kids !

649
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,520
我們汽車壞了  徒步走了數里
Uh, our car broke down, and we've walked for miles.

650
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,520
見你的車不想吵醒你
We hopped on. We didn't want to

651
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,520
幫擅自登車
wake you at this hour.

652
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,520
壞車  
Broke down, eh ?

653
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,520
我們在公路上未見有壞車
We didn't pass no wrecks on the highway.

654
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,520
你們所說的全是慌話
- Sounds like a pack of lies.

655
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,530
我們是從小路出來的
- We were off on a side road.

656
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:26,530
在月色下停車  實在美妙
I know. A moonlight night and a parked car. That's nice.

657
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,530
不  真的  我們只不過  
- Oh, no, really-- -

658
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,540
艾瑪拉  你總愛想入非非
Esmeralda ! Everywhere you search for sex.

659
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,550
擦干凈你的眼睛抬頭觀星吧
Get your eyes out of the mud and look up at the stars.

660
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,550
對不起  我叫邦斯
Oh, I beg your pardon. My name is Bones.

661
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,550
人稱我為人類骷髏頭你好
I'm also known as the Human Skeleton.

662
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,560
她是艾瑪拉  是長滿胡子的女士
- How do you do ? - And this is Esmeralda, our bearded lady.

663
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,630
她加入我們的隊伍令我們自豪
Naturally, we're very proud to have her as a member of our group.

664
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,560
你們一定疲倦了
You must be tired.

665
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,560
進來坐下  休息一會
Come on in and rest.

666
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,570
我們要到一處叫梳打鎮的地方
We're trying to get to Soda City,

667
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,570
我看是在北面兩百里
a couple hundred miles north, I think.

668
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,580
大概天明便到達  休息一會兒吧
You won't get there 'til morning, so make yourselves comfortable.

669
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,580
我來介紹另一伙伴泰坦妮
You must meet our other coworker:

670
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,590
她是個龐然大物
Titania, our little human mountain.

671
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,660
是一座人肉山你好
A very great lady, indeed.

672
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,590
這里發生什么事了  
How do you do ? What's goes on there ?

673
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,590
我們吵醒你們嗎  
Oh, did we wake you ?

674
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,590
我已醒了
Oh. I was awake.

675
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,600
你想辦法替米露妮解決失眠癥吧
I wish you'd tell Minnie to do something about that insomnia.

676
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,600
她令我整晚輾轉反側
I've been tossing and turning.

677
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,600
你叫瑪莉高掩蓋那丑陋的面孔吧
Tell Marigold to shut her silly old face.

678
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,610
你們兩個別再互相挖苦吧
Are you girls not speaking to each other again ?

679
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,610
瑪莉高恨我
Marigold's mad

680
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,620
因為我的艷光掩蓋她的
because I got her beau away from her.

681
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,690
告訴米露妮  我聽到些閑言
Kindly tell Minnie I heard that last remark.

682
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,620
我才不稀罕那個所謂俊男
I wouldn't have the gentleman as a gift.

683
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,620
他只不過是個貪新鮮的男人
A common novelty seeker !

684
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,630
女孩子  別失禮我們的貴賓
Girls ! What will our guests think ?

685
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,630
他很可愛啊
Hey, he's cute !

686
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,630
聽到嗎  她又來了
You hear that ? There she goes again.

687
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,630
別再爭吵了
Stop your squabbling.

688
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,630
他們經過長途跋涉  已很疲倦
They're tired.- They've been walking for miles!

689
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,640
沒有人讓你們搭順風車嗎  
- Nobody gave you a lift.

690
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:43,650
我明白了
I know

691
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,650
一般人都是鐵石心腸的
The normal are normally coldhearted.

692
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,650
別再廢話  趕他們下車
Get these tramps off !

693
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,650
鐵石心腸  
A cold heart.

694
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,720
你怪我也要這樣做  趕他們下車
I won't take no insults. Get 'em off.

695
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,730
美捷  別哄我了
Aw, Major, honey-- Don't ''honey'' me !

696
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,730
我有合約在身  要安全運送
I've got a contract. It provides for safe transportation

697
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,670
合約沒要求我接載無業游民
and don't say nothing about hobos !

698
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,680
是警察
That's the police.

699
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,680
他們一定是在尋人
They must be looking for somebody.

700
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:11,580
他們要找什么人呢  
Who could they want ?

701
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,590
我猜是找我
Me, I guess.

702
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,690
一個戴上手銬逍遙法外的年青人
Oh ! They came for you.

703
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,690
他們為何要追捕你  
He has handcuffs on. What do they want you for ?

704
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
是因為一宗別人犯的案
For something somebody else did.

705
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,700
我不相信他會犯案
I don't believe he's done anything wrong !

706
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,700
我隨時愿意舍命幫他
I'll go to bat for him anytime.

707
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,530
我常說  
I've always told

708
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,720
米露妮遲早會惹官非
Minnie she'd get mixed up with the police if she wasn't careful.

709
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,730
他們從前面開始搜查了
They're starting to search at the front.

710
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,730
你在等什么  將他交給警方吧
Well, what are you waiting for ? Hand them over to the police.

711
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,730
他絕對正確
He's perfectly right.

712
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,740
他是個麻煩的人
He's a little stinker.

713
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,750
這似乎是很為難的事
Seems terrible,

714
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,750
但我們留住了  我們便會很為難
but it would be terrible, too, if we got into trouble.

715
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,750
邦斯  通知警方
Bones, call the cops !

716
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,750
且慢  美捷
Just a minute, Major.

717
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,760
我們采取這方法來解決這窘境吧
In this situation I find a parallel for the present world predicament.

718
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,830
我們現在形勢不利
We stand defeated at the outset.

719
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,760
艾瑪拉富有同情心  但卻消極
You, Esmeralda, have sympathy, yet you're willing

720
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,760
任由事情發生
to remain passive.

721
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:13,770
我有個想法  我將不理會警方
I have a belief, and yet I'm tempted to let myself be overridden by force.

722
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,850
除了那罪無可赦的小子外
The rest of you, with the exception of this malignant jerk,

723
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,780
其他人全是無辜的  被人瞞騙
are ignorant of the facts and, therefore, confused.

724
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,790
我們是奉行民主的人
Thank heaven we're still members of a democracy.

725
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,790
來投票作決定吧
We'll vote.

726
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,790
不準投票  我反對投票
- I'm against voting!

727
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,790
法西斯主義者  
- Fascist !

728
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,790
結果顯而易見的
You know how we stand so far.

729
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,800
那對孿生姐妹互相對立
The twins, as usual, are on opposite sides.

730
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,800
正反票各一
And so their votes pair.

731
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,870
泰坦妮猶豫未決  是中立票
Titania's on both sides at once and, therefore, neutral.

732
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,040
美捷贊成交警方  
The major is for delivering these people to the police,

733
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,890
我則反對
and I, frankly, am against it.

734
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,820
艾瑪拉  由你作決定了
Esmeralda, the decision is up to you.

735
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,820
我不想任何人有麻煩
I don't want any trouble any more than anybody else,

736
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,890
當你們討論時  我發現了一件事
but while you've been talking, I've been looking at something--

737
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,830
一個很甜蜜的場面
something pretty fine too.

738
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,830
我看見那位小女孩
I've been looking at that little girl

739
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,840
她一直靠在他的身旁
standin' beside that poor man.

740
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,850
不發一言  絕不懷疑他
Never a word. Never a question.

741
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,850
接受他所做的一切
Takin'everything he's had to take,

742
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,850
無論發生任何事也支持他
stringin'along with him.

743
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,630
大難臨頭仍支持著  
And I've been thinking, it's the good people

744
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,860
她一定是好人
that stick when anybody's in trouble,

745
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,860
世上已沒有太多好人了
and there aren't many good people in the world.

746
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:20,860
相信大家會小數服從多數
I think that we, all of us, know that better than most.

747
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,870
這絕非等閑之事
It isn't something you see every day of the week.

748
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,880
因此我投票  
- So I vote--

749
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,880
你做得好  你不離棄他們
- We don't give them up. Good girl, Esmeralda !

750
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,880
這是顛覆行為  我不贊成
This is subversive ! I won't stand for it !

751
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,880
你不可以這樣  要服從多數人
Oh, no, you don't ! You'll abide by the will of the majority.

752
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,890
我們回到原位  假裝熟睡
Back in your places and pretend to be asleep.

753
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,160
就此決定  你坐在這里
That's all you have to do.

754
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,890
年青人  你要躲起來
Here, you sit here. Come on, young man. We've got to hide you.

755
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,910
關掉所有燈  換上這套衣服
Turn all the lights off. Here. Take off your coat and put this on.

756
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,920
全部人起床
Come on. Wake up in there !

757
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,920
什么事  萬圣節  
Hey, what is this ? Halloween ?

758
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,920
是警察
Police.

759
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:57,920
真的嗎  
Is that so ? Haven't you got anything better to do...

760
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,990
為何在深夜吵醒守法的人  
than waking up law-abiding citizens in the middle of the night ?

761
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:04,930
我們要找一個男人及他的女同黨
We're lookin'for a man and his woman companion.

762
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,930
他是黑發的
He's got dark hair,

763
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,930
年齡約二十至二十五歲
between the ages of 20 and 25.

764
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,010
那女士挺漂亮的  有見過他們嗎  
The dame's supposed to be good-lookin'. Have you seen him ?

765
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,950
如此普通的人隨處可見
Now, where would I see anybody as normal as that ?

766
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,030
她是誰  不像你的馬戲團員
Who's this ? Doesn't look like one of your troupe.

767
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:25,960
她是團員之一
Sure, she's one of us.

768
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,960
是蛇舞女郎
She's our little snake charmer.

769
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:33,040
她坐著的是一箱蛇  在安撫它們
Right now, she's sitting on a box of snakes so they don't get lonesome.

770
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,980
想不到如此美女竟與蛇為伍
Can you imagine that ? A good-lookin'gal too.

771
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,980
你們可以回去睡覺了
Well, I guess you can all go back to sleep now.

772
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,990
蛇舞女郎  別把婦女看扁啊
A snake charmer! Well, well. You never can tell about women.

773
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,000
沒事了  你可出來了
It's all right. You can come out now.

774
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,010
等等  執法人員  回來
Wait,Justice, come back !

775
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,020
坐下  我們已經啟程了
Sit down here ! We're on our way.

776
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,020
不知該如何感激你
I don't know how I can thank you, sir.

777
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,340
沒事了  
It's all right. my boy.

778
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,090
助人為快樂之本
Gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody.

779
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,020
你們有權知道事件的始末
You've got a right to know what this is about. It's all right.

780
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:16,100
你的女友也信你  我們也會信你
If that little girl can trust you, I guess we can.

781
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,040
寶貝  你受盡委屈了
The baby ! She's had a tough time.

782
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,040
可憐的女孩  已筋疲力竭了
Poor little girl. She's worn out.

783
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,050
我來照顧她
I'll take care of her.

784
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,050
來吧  我們走
Come on. Let's go.

785
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,050
讓那些蛇安睡吧
Better let the snakes get some sleep.

786
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,060
它們明天會精神奕奕了
They have to look good tomorrow.

787
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,090
對不起
I'm sorry.

788
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,090
為什么  
What for ?

789
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,090
因為我那么笨拙
For being such a dope. I was scared.

790
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,090
你不驚慌才算是笨蛋
You'd have been a dope if you hadn't been scared.

791
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,110
你已太疲累了
You're tired; that's all that's the matter with you.

792
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,110
睡一會兒便沒事了
Get some sleep. You'll be fine.

793
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,110
我會睡的
I can go to sleep, all right.

794
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,120
我很疲倦了
I'm so tired.

795
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,120
有件事想告訴你
I want to tell you something.

796
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,220
我相信你
I believe you.

797
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,190
真的嗎  柏茜亞
Do you, Pat ?

798
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,130
你以前是不信的
You didn't, you know.

799
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,360
這是自由的國家  可改變主意嗎  
It's a free country. A girl can change her mind, can't she ?

800
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:31,210
當然可以
Sure, she can.

801
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,150
謝謝你
Thank you, Pat.

802
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,150
他們令我感到羞愧
They made me so ashamed.

803
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,150
他們很好人  信任別人
They're so nice and trusting.

804
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,220
他們確實了不起
They're wonderful people,

805
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,160
所有人  除了那討厭的美捷
all except that nasty little major and that...

806
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,160
還有那小氣的孿生妹妹
mean twin.

807
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:53,180
你不應怪責那個胖婦
I don't suppose you can really blame the fat lady, though,

808
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,180
尤其是當她變成這般身材后
when a woman has lost her figure that way.

809
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,950
"梳打鎮"

810
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,290
歡迎光臨梳打鎮
Welcome to Soda City.

811
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,960
是蘊藏梳打的心臟地帶
The heart of the bicarbonate belt.

812
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,040
我們到鎮內逛逛吧
Well, we might as well do the town.

813
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,010
里面什么也沒有
There's nothing here. Come on.

814
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,010
看來我們遲來一步了
I suppose we are a little late.

815
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,020
對不起  早知道便不帶你來
Sorry, darling. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.

816
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,020
我并非向你投訴
I'm not complaining.

817
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,020
現在好極了  是嗎  
This is great, isn't it ?

818
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,020
已解決我的所有問題
The solution to all my problems.

819
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,030
我要倚賴這地方了
I was counting on this place.

820
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:47,040
這荒蕪之地距離五千里
A dump like this, 5,000 miles from nowhere.

821
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,080
你看  仍有人住的
Look at this. It's been in use.

822
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,090
我們到窗前
Let's go around to the window.

823
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,110
小心割傷手
Careful! Don't cut yourself.

824
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,140
喂  掛線了
Hello ? Hello ?

825
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,210
這是什么類型的電話  
Hung up. What sort of phone is that ?

826
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,140
是戰地電話
It's a field telephone.

827
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,160
這房間有美麗景觀
Well, a room with a view.

828
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,160
為何要開這個洞  
What do you suppose they cut that for ?

829
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,170
我不知道
I don't know.

830
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,180
看
Say, look.

831
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,580
有個?腳架
Tripod.

832
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,050
高度吻合
Looks like it's the right height.

833
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:34,190
一定有東西連接的
Yeah. Something else goes with this.

834
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,190
在這里
There !

835
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,210
對了
That's it.

836
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,220
看見什么嗎  
See anything ?

837
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,220
還沒有  
Not yet.

838
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,230
讓我看
Let me see !

839
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,240
那是  
Why, that's a-- Why, Barry ! Yeah.

840
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:15,250
我們拿走它  接住
Better put this away. Take that.

841
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,250
你看什么  
- Say ! The wood.

842
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,260
那些木條那又如何  
- What about it ?

843
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,260
他們不會在爐上燃燒木材
You wouldn't burn that.

844
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,260
為何不會  
Why not ?

845
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,270
產生的煙被人發覺
The smoke would show.

846
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,280
是汽車聲
That's a car.

847
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,290
你躲起來
You better hide.

848
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,290
不  進來
No, not here.

849
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,320
唏  你在這里干什么  
Hey. What d'you think you're doin' around here ?

850
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,320
你好嗎  你何時回來的  
I, uh-- I was wonderin' when you'd get here. Where you from ?

851
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:14,340
你來自何方  在這里干什么  
What are you stickin' around here for?

852
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,340
對不起
Excuse me.

853
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:31,350
"巴利堅尼涉嫌破壞兵工廠"

854
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,370
我不明你如何會知道這地方
Funny, you knowin' about this place. I don't quite get it.

855
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,370
你要考慮清楚
You might have thought it over more carefully.

856
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,380
你到來對我們毫無幫助
Your coming here doesn't help us a bit.

857
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,380
他被通緝  竟在此出現
The heat's on this guy,

858
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,380
是杜賓派我來的
and he shows up here.

859
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,380
那老頭子定是傻了  竟派他來
Tobin sent me. The old man must be off his nut sending him up here.

860
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,380
尼爾信  你說話要小心
Be a little more careful, Neilson.

861
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,390
你竟然在人前批評他  
Your criticisms in front of other people.

862
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,390
對  別用這口吻批評老頭子
- Yeah. Don't talk that way about the old guy.

863
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,390
我會小心言行的
- I'll watch out for myself.

864
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,400
我也是  別忽略我  杜賓叫我來
Me too. Don't forget about me. That's why Tobin sent me here.

865
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,410
他說你會懂得如何照顧我
He said you'd know how to take care of me.

866
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,410
尼爾信  形勢已很明顯
I guess that makes it pretty clear, Neilson.

867
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,410
我不知  突然有個人來到沙漠
I don't know. A guy walks in, and right away I get orders.

868
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,420
要我接受命令  我實在不太明
It ain't so clear to me.

869
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,420
你看到報導便不視我為陌生人
I'm a little better than a stranger, if you'll remember my clippings !

870
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,420
對  堅尼在南部干了驚天大事
Yes. Mister, uh, Kane has done pretty well down south.

871
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,440
我們不應漠視他的成就
His accomplishments can't be disregarded. At least I hope not.

872
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,510
他的表現起碼也值得我們認同
A man that has served as well as he has is entitled to recognition.

873
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:29,440
不單如此  更應受到保護
More than that-- protection.

874
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,440
你們要照顧我
You guys have got to take care of me.

875
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,440
我肯定公司會盡力而為
The firm will do its best.

876
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,450
公司是出名厚待雇員的
They're quite loyal to their employees.

877
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,450
尼爾信翻查公司紀錄便了解一切
Neilson will see that the firm's record is maintained.

878
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,450
你說來容易  你安坐東岸
You got it easy, you guys from back East.

879
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,460
發號施令  一貫如此
You give orders. You do that, all right.

880
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,470
大人物只做文書工作
The big boys with the desk jobs.

881
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,470
你只需坐在辦公椅上打電話
All you gotta do is reach for a telephone, sit back,

882
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,480
而外面的人卻要背上黑鍋
and us guys out here have gotta take the rap.

883
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,480
看來  我也想回去工作了
I think I'll go back East for a while.

884
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,480
你對公司毫不忠心
You're not a very good example of loyalty.

885
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,480
因為我已有點厭倦
Yeah ? Well, I'm gettin' just a little bit tired. See ?

886
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,490
我也是  我厭倦了聽這些說話
So am I ! Let's get goin' !

887
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,490
我徒步而來
The trip here was no pushover.

888
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:07,500
長途跋涉絕不輕松
I had to hoof it most of the way.

889
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,500
我沒地方讓你藏匿并非由我負責
I got no place to hide you out. That ain't my line.

890
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,510
并非由你負責  
That ain't your line, huh ?

891
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,510
你呢  你似乎也沒興趣管
What about you ? You don't seem so interested either !

892
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,510
你是公司的主腦
I suppose you're just the big brains !

893
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,510
你已得償所愿  在暗暗偷笑
Or maybe you take a chance just for laughs !

894
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:22,160
我舍命相從  
Maybe it doesn't work that way.

895
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
落得如此田地
Maybe I'm the only guy that sticks his neck out !

896
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,520
我做了一件驚天動地的大事
Well, get this ! I pulled a big job,

897
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,520
被警方追輯
and they're after me !

898
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:28,520
你要照顧我否則你倆也會被拘捕
And you guys have gotta take care of me, or you're gonna have some trouble!

899
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,520
我要離開這地區
I've gotta get out of this part of the country !

900
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,530
這里烈日當空  腳底飽受煎熬
The ground's burning up under my feet !

901
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,530
我要回到東岸
I've gotta get back East !

902
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,540
那里人煙稠密  不易被人發覺
It's more crowded and a guy doesn't stand out, like here !

903
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,540
你別緊張  別沖動
Take it easy. Hang onto your nerve.

904
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:41,540
我已克制  我已忍受夠了
I've been hanging on long enough !

905
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,550
我明白你的困難
I understand your difficulties,

906
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,550
你對所講過的說話致歉  但是  
but in this business...

907
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,550
為了安全
we always have to make sure.

908
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,550
我現在已清楚你的為人
I think I know him now.

909
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,570
我會駕車回東岸  你跟我走
I'm driving back East. You'd better come with me. All right.

910
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,570
好的  我們啟程
Let's get goin'.

911
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,570
執拾一切  別留下痕跡
Get all the things together.

912
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,570
我們走后便不會再回來
After we leave, I want this place cleaned up. You won't be coming back here.

913
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,570
為什么  這地方被監視嗎  
Why not ? You think they got the place spotted ?

914
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,320
我要確介安全  
I'm making sure.

915
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,580
你另覓地方吧
You'll have to find another place and store all this stuff.

916
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:07,650
這絕不容易啊
It's not gonna be easy.

917
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:09,580
這是你的職責  你若不勝任
If you can't handle it,

918
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:10,580
我會另覓人選
I'll have to get someone else.

919
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,580
好的  我會處理好
All right. I'll handle it.

920
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,590
你需要帶些衣服
You'll need some clothes.

921
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:17,670
是四十二號  我的手銬怎么辦  
Size 42. What'll we do about these ?

922
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:18,600
你是如何弄斷它的  
How did you manage to break them ?

923
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,600
是用汽車風扇
On an automobile fan.

924
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,610
你真聰明
Very bright of you. I think we can even take care of that.

925
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,680
我們會處理的  但現在先起程
But let's get started now.

926
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,610
你聽到嗎  是何處發出的聲音  
Did you hear something ?Where does that lead to ?

927
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,620
是另一房間  另一個出口
Just another room. The way out.

928
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,540
我們知道堅尼
We figure that Kane

929
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,370
及其他人正往紐約
and the other fellows are probably headin' for New York.

930
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,370
有什么需要我幫忙嗎  
If there's anything I can do.

931
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,370
我們很感激你
We sure appreciate that.

932
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,370
這是任何人也應做的事
Why, anyone would have done the same thing. That's right.

933
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,370
對  但本案卻有分別
This war sure makes a difference.

934
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,380
所有人也想參與本案
Everybody wants to get in and pitch.

935
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,380
你可否將紐約的地址給我  
Now, if you'll give me your address in New York, Miss Martin,

936
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:17,380
你回去后我們可聯絡你
we can contact you back there.

937
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,380
到時可致電告訴我乘哪一班飛機
Or maybe you could wire me which plane you're taking.

938
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,380
我們會盡快去接你
We may want to get ahold of you fast.

939
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,390
我會的  我先回去叔叔的家
I can do that when I get back to my uncle.

940
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:29,400
好的  馬田小姐  保持聯絡
Okay. Just keep in touch.

941
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:32,410
這條路雖然要多走幾里
I'm glad we came this way. It adds a few miles,

942
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:35,410
但我有點傷感  
but I've become a little sentimental.

943
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,410
想看它最后一眼
I want to take a last look at it.

944
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,960
美好的風景
Beautiful, isn't it ? A great monument to man's industry...

945
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,450
將被摧毀了
and his stubborn faith in the future.

946
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,420
你們快可前進了
You'll be moving along soon.

947
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,430
有攝影機或槍械嗎  
Are you carrying any cameras or firearms at all ?

948
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,430
完全沒有  警官
Nothing at all, Officer. You. sir ?

949
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,870
你呢  沒有
No, sir.

950
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,440
這水壩定可提供很多能源
They must get a lot of power from this dam.

951
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:00,440
供應洛杉磯75%的電力
I think it supplies about 7 5% for the Los Angeles district,

952
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:04,450
當然包括兵工廠的電力
including most of the power for the defense plants.

953
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,450
你跟杜賓很熟嗎  
Do you think there's-- Do you know Tobin ver well ?

954
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,450
不  我在他農場見過一面
No. I met him just that once at his ranch.

955
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,450
他的兒子跟他在一起嗎  
Did he have the child with him ?

956
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,470
他的孫女  他很喜歡這孫女
His grandchild ? Yes. He seemed to be very fond of her.

957
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,470
對  這是我喜歡老杜賓的原因
Yes. That's one of the things I like about old Tobin:

958
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,470
他深愛那小女孩
his love for that little girl.

959
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:23,480
證明他有愛心  你知道嗎  我也有孩子
Evidence of a good heart.I have children too, you know ?

960
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:28,550
我有兩個兒子  分別兩歲和四歲
Oh ? Two boys. Nice little fellows. Aged two and four.

961
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:32,490
四歲那個很頑皮  一定是有毛病
The four-year-old is naughty at times.He's quite a problem.

962
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:37,570
買件玩具給他  半小時后便搞壞
We get him a new toy and within half an hour it's smashed to bits.

963
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:43,130
之后
And then, sometimes, after it's all over,

964
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,580
他卻會后悔
he seems almost sorry.

965
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,580
有時候我希望幼子是個女兒
Sometimes I wish my younger child had been a girl.

966
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,580
我妻常為我的怪習慣而爭執
In fact, my wife and I argue over a little idiosyncrasy I have.

967
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:55,590
我想待幼子年紀稍大才剪發
I don't want his hair cut short until he's much older.

968
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,520
你認為這樣對他有壞處嗎  
Do you think it'd be bad for him ?

969
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,530
我不知  有可能吧
It might be.

970
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,540
我幼時長得一頭金色曲發
When I was a child, I had long golden curls.

971
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,540
人們常在街上停步來贊賞我
People used to stop to admire me.

972
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:09,900
時移勢易  替他剪發可免生意外
Things are different nowadays. A haircut might save him a lot of grief.

973
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,550
我們開車了
Ah, we're on our way.

974
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:20,550
當月色  
We love

975
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,770
在夜空照耀時
While the moon

976
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,650
我們觸摸繁星  愛是屬于我們的
We touch the stars Love is ours

977
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,650
晚風在夜空  
Like winds that sigh

978
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,650
發出呼嘯聲
Embrace the sky

979
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,670
今晚我們  
Tonight we love

980
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,600
愛上了月色
In the glow

981
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:55,170
月色正溫柔地照耀  
That blows so softly

982
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:10,030
別往辦公室  駛往401  是
Drive to 401 instead of the office. Okay.

983
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,040
有問題嗎  
Anything wrong ?

984
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,040
很多問題  我剛致電回辦公室
I've just called the office.

985
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,040
但電話線已被截斷
They've disconnected the phone.

986
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:21,040
仍是那間電話公司  應付了帳的
Same old phone company. Should've paid the bill.

987
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,040
沒時間開玩笑了
This is no time for jokes !

988
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,050
是警方  他們在監視辦公室
The police. They're watching the office.

989
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,050
截斷電話是給我們的暗示
The phone is our signal.

990
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,050
他們是否要監視我  
Think they're watching for me ?

991
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,130
我不知  誰會知你在紐約呢  
I don't know. Who'd know you were in New York ?

992
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,070
對  你說得對
Yeah. I guess you're right.

993
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,080
明天要見布連  要我開車嗎  
How about Brooklyn tomorrow ? Do you want me on the job ?

994
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,080
你何時才學懂閉嘴  
When are you gonna learn to keep your mouth shut ?

995
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,080
對不起  我以為他有份參與
Sorry. I-I thought he was in on it.

996
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,080
閉嘴  
Shut up.

997
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,150
沒問題  我擅于保守秘密
It's all right. I'm good at keeping secrets.

998
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:54,100
我們走
Let's go.

999
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,840
費文先生
Mr. Freeman.

1000
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:31,210
你好嗎  費文先生
Hi, Mr. Freeman. Hello.

1001
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:34,150
高興見到你  旅途愉快嗎  
Ah, pleased to see you. Have a good trip ?

1002
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,150
很好  謝謝你  羅拔
Yes. Thank you, Robert.

1003
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,150
太太在樓上  她很憂心地等著你
Madam is upstairs. She's waiting anxiously.

1004
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:43,200
謝謝  我們到樓上  這邊走
Oh, thank you, Robert. We'll go right up. This way.

1005
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,170
他是誰  
Who was that ?

1006
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,240
這是酒店  有什么慶典  
Hey, is this a hotel ? What's the festivity ?

1007
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,180
這是富商的活動
It's for a very worthy cause.

1008
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,180
瑟頓太太常借出地方辦慈善活動
Mrs. Sutton often gives her house over to charity affairs.

1009
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,180
她是個慷慨的女人  但我恐怕
She's a very generous woman, but

1010
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:04,200
她會不喜歡見到我們如此衣著
she isn't going to be pleased to see us.

1011
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:11,200
你們這班低效率的笨蛋
Idiots, all of you. Stupid, inefficient idiots.

1012
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,200
所有事也要我處理
Everything is left to me.

1013
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:14,210
要我東奔西跑
I have to hover over you like an old hen.

1014
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,210
對不起  瑟頓太太
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.

1015
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,210
樓下的賓客正等待我露面
The guests expect me to put in an appearance.

1016
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,210
他們付出二十五元要討回代價
As you say, they want something for their $ 25!

1017
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,280
我不想樂善好施的聲譽受損
I will not have my benevolence abused.

1018
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:28,300
我的名譽地位是很重要的
My life, my position-- they're important to me.

1019
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,230
我會盡力而為  瑟頓太太
I'll do my best.

1020
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:34,240
希望你的能力會改善
I wish your best were a little better.

1021
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,240
費文先生  很高興此刻遇到你
Oh. Mr. Freeman. I'm glad you've come at this time.

1022
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:39,240
我剛剛對愛德華說  這年青人
I was just telling Edward-- Is this the young man ?

1023
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,310
我不能讓他在此作避難所
Must you bring him here ? I certainly can't furnish him with sanctuary.

1024
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,320
這屋里全是貴賓  顯赫人物
This house is full of guests, important people !

1025
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,260
你明白我的處境嗎  這年青人在此
Don't you understand ?

1026
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,260
警方已監視人的辦公室
The police are already watching your office.

1027
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,270
祈求他們不會到來  
Thank goodness they'll never come here.

1028
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,270
你的愚蠢行為  
But a little more of your stupid behavior,

1029
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,340
我這尊貴的大屋也難以庇護你啊
and even the respectability of my house won't shield you.

1030
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,270
對不起  我是不會無故登門的
I'm sorry. We can't leave any loose ends.

1031
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,480
好了  別再隱瞞陰謀了
All right ! But for heaven's sake,

1032
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,280
告訴我那女孩的事
stop playing the conspirator.

1033
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:09,280
你可問他
Now tell me all you know about the girl, or ask him.

1034
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:13,360
你為何不告訴你關于那女孩的事
Why didn't you tell me about the young lady back in Soda City ?

1035
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,300
我以為不重要
Well, I didn't think it was important.

1036
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:17,300
她只是個普通女孩
She was just a girl.

1037
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:21,300
她攔載我  她漂亮
She picked me up. She was pretty.

1038
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,380
或許是冒險  
I guess it was kind of risky. Well, there you are.

1039
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,380
對不起  我令你冒風險
I'm so sorry to have exposed you to any risk.

1040
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,310
她來這里干什么  
What's she doing here ?

1041
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,390
你再遇我  覺得詫異嗎  
You're surprised to see me again.

1042
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,330
你是如何進來的  
How did you get here ?

1043
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,330
她如何進來并不重要
It doesn't matter.

1044
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,330
問題是你沒理由帶她來
There was no reason to bring her at all!

1045
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,400
我在油站打電話時才知此事
You see, I just learned on the telephone at the gas station...

1046
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,340
她最失策是在梳打鎮讓你下車后
that she was most indiscreet after she left you at Soda City.

1047
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:47,340
便直接前往找當地的警長
She went to the sheriff, who,

1048
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,340
幸好警長是我的好朋友
fortunately, happened to be a good friend of ours.

1049
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,340
別浪費時間解釋了
Don't waste time in explanations.

1050
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:55,420
你快將那女孩帶離本屋  全部人
You've got to get the girl out of this house.

1051
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,350
我不想聲譽受損
I will not have my benevolence abused!

1052
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:02,360
你自作聰明  變成幫了大忙
So you played smart. That's great. That's a big help to all of us.

1053
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,370
不  我絕不聰明
No, I wasn't smart at all.

1054
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,440
我四天以來絕不聰明
I haven't been smart for four days.

1055
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,370
我在警長面前也有點猶豫
Even when I went to the sheriff, I hesitated.

1056
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,370
我討厭做些令你惹麻煩的事
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble.

1057
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,440
我同情你  真后悔不將你留下
Yeah, I sympathize. The mistake I made was

1058
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,380
讓你與蛇為伍
not leaving you with the snakes !

1059
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:16,380
起碼可學會響尾蛇的聲音
You might have learned to rattle.

1060
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,380
我當初沒看錯你
I was right about you.

1061
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:22,390
堅尼先生  晚上好
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

1062
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,400
想不到你竟是書呆子
I didn't know you were a bookworm.

1063
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,470
讓我選些適合你的東西送給你
You must let me choose something appropriate for you.

1064
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,400
一些你不會太難去理解的
Something not too difficult.

1065
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,400
讓我看
Let me see.

1066
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,410
"身份不詳的死者"

1067
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,410
有了  這是經典之作
Here we are. This'll do admirably.

1068
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,430
是一些預言
Remarkable work. Somehow prophetic.

1069
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,430
查理  你到來做什么  一派胡言
Why are you here, Charles ? What's all this nonsense about books ?

1070
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,430
我是個難民
I am a refugee.

1071
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:53,500
終于加入這令人惡心的漂泊隊伍
I have at last joined that revolting group of world travelers.

1072
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,440
做一些令人鄙視的事情
One ultimately turns into the thing one despises most.

1073
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,440
我應多謝誰  是你  費文先生
And whom have I to thank for it ? You, Mr. Freeman.

1074
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,510
我讓那女孩無拘無束地逃走
The girl was allowed to escape unobserved.

1075
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,450
她離開堅尼后便去找她的叔叔
She left Mr. Kane, went straight to her uncle.

1076
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,460
那可愛的老人家去找警察
That charming old man went to the police.

1077
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:11,460
結果  大班警察來到我家
As a result, a whole hoard of officers came to my house.

1078
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,530
僥幸地  他們到來時我并不在家
Luckily, I was leaving when they arrived.

1079
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,470
這里的人很忠心
And the others-- the very loyal ones--

1080
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,540
他們的忠誠終于獲得回報
Well, they're paying for their loyalty.

1081
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,470
真駭人  對不起  查理
How appalling !Your charming house. I'm so sorry, Charles.

1082
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:26,550
實在幸運  你本應更感遺憾
Rather lucky. You might have been sorrier.

1083
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:30,560
費文  你做事更有效率
And you might have been more efficient, Mr. Freeman.

1084
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,490
你侮辱我  對你有什么好處  
What good is it to insult me ?

1085
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,490
我們現在已惹上麻煩
We're in trouble now.

1086
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,570
最重要的是確保大家的安全
So the most important thing is to make sure of everyone around us.

1087
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,500
確保堅尼安全  
Mr. Kane. I'm just not sure.

1088
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,500
我想知道他是否安全
I want to know that he's all right.

1089
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:47,440
好一句輕描淡寫  他不只如此
All right ? What an understatement. He's much more than that!

1090
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,510
他高貴  溫文純潔
He's noble and fine and pure.

1091
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:54,590
他因此要在這世上得到懲罰
So he pays the penalty that the noble must pay in this world:

1092
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,530
各位對他判斷錯誤了
he's misjudged by everyone.

1093
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,530
甚至警方也對他誤會了
Why, even the police have a completely erroneous impression of him.

1094
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,540
我肯定他是判若兩人
I can assure you that, contrary to what is supposed,

1095
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,540
讓他親口對你們說吧
and to what he may have told you,

1096
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:09,610
這年青人絕非自己國家的敵人
that young man is certainly not one of his country's enemies.

1097
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:11,540
查理  你在開玩笑
Charles, you'rejoking!

1098
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,550
我說的是千真萬確的
I mean exactly what I say.

1099
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,630
堅尼絕對不是我們組織的人
Mr. Kane is definitely no part of our little organization.

1100
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:20,250
你這個仗權勢的人  
Your protege. Well, you've done splendidly.

1101
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,560
竟然帶他來
You bring him here, you idiot !

1102
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,570
我們應如何處置他  
What in heaven's name are we going to do with him ?

1103
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,570
很好的問題
That's a very appropriate question.

1104
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,640
其實沒有太多方法去處置他
Not much we can do with him.

1105
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,570
當初將他送交警方  已是大錯
I made the mistake once of turning him over to the police.

1106
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,580
在這時刻更加沒可能
That's even more impossible at the moment.

1107
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:40,590
恐怕只有唯一的方法了
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do.

1108
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:45,600
新法例下  我們全部會被判死刑
You see, the new law threatens all...

1109
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,440
我們要用落伍的
So I'm afraid we'll have to apply the ancient axiom:

1110
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,600
以牙還牙方法
a tooth for a tooth.

1111
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:53,600
以堅尼還杜賓
A Kane for a Tobin.

1112
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,680
別在這里討論這些事情吧
Please don't discuss things of that sort here.

1113
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,610
這令人討厭  這地方亦不適宜
It's rather nauseating and out of place.

1114
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,620
查理  我很害怕
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.

1115
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:04,630
我們必須采取預防措施
We must take all precaution.

1116
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,630
當然  但也要繼續我們的工作
Of course. We must also continue with our work.

1117
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,630
現在太冒險了  已取消炸堤壩
It's too risky now. We're abandoning the dam.

1118
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,630
要暫時保持低調
We must remain inactive.

1119
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,630
低調  你絕對錯了
Inactive ? You are utterly mistaken.

1120
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,640
若如此  我們的組織將告完蛋
Once we do that, our organization is finished.

1121
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,640
不惜代價  也要繼續
- We must carry on.

1122
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,640
明天那件事如何  
- What about tomorrow's work ?

1123
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:19,640
你已準備就緒  不應放棄
Tomorrow's work ? You can't abandon that. But the risk !

1124
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:23,710
但風險  很大  我知道
Is great. I know that.

1125
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,660
很可惜  我們要執行命令
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.

1126
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:31,660
我現在要去加勒比海
I'm leaving for the Caribbean now.

1127
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,670
我的處境比你們更差
My position here is more impossible than all of yours.

1128
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:38,670
當然  我很想去中美洲
I'm rather looking forward to Central America.

1129
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,670
夏灣拿這季節的天氣很好
Havana will be very gay this season.

1130
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:44,740
我忽然間對這國家厭倦
Somehow I've suddenly had enough of this country.

1131
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:47,690
戰爭令國家頹廢
The war has made it grim.

1132
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,690
你就此離開我們而走  逍遙自在  
You're leaving us here to face everything, and you'll be on a boat.

1133
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,690
要我們面對一切  你去享樂  
It all sounds idyllic.

1134
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,700
查理  整件事  沒可能的
Oh, Charles. It's-- This whole thing-- It's impossible !

1135
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,700
我真的很抱歉
It's panicky. I'm deeply sorr.

1136
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,710
噢  你在這里  
Ah, there you are!

1137
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,710
身為主人家  為何不露面  
How unbecoming for a hostess to hide herself away.

1138
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,720
對不起  騷擾你們了  我要綁架她
Am I intruding ? I just must kidnap Henrietta.

1139
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,720
她遲些會回來
She'll be back.

1140
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,730
他們是負責膳食的  有些麻煩
I've had some trouble with these people.

1141
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:14,730
實在很糟糕
They're doing the catering.

1142
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,730
我朋友會帶魚子醬來  我可打賭
Our boy will appear any minute with the caviar ! I assure you !

1143
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,730
別做傻事  利用內線電話
Don't be a fool! Get to the house phone.

1144
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,730
你是如何進來的  
How'd you get here ?

1145
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,730
我在機場碰到他們
They met me at the airport.

1146
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,730
還以為是警員
I thought they were the police.

1147
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,740
等等  不能用進來的路線
Wait a minute. No use trying the way I came in.

1148
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:30,740
我們利用正門出去
Let's walk right out through the front door ! Might as well.

1149
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,740
我們會留意后門
Yes, sir. We'll watch the back exit.

1150
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,760
他們不能出去的
They won't get out.

1151
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,770
不妙  對面那人  我進來時見過
No good. See the one on the other side ?

1152
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,770
他是同黨  不能走這條路出去
He's one of them. We'll never get out that way.

1153
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,770
他們會怎樣對付我們  
What can they do ?

1154
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,770
他們會捉我們  我們沒有機會
Plenty. They'd grab us. We wouldn't have a chance.

1155
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,840
那些人會見到他們對付我們的
These people would see them.

1156
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,780
他們會懷疑我倆是擅自闖入的人
If anyone had a question, we're gate crashers.

1157
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:58,790
巴利  這真是一場惡夢
Barry, this is awful.

1158
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,630
這里的人  
It's like a bad dream. All these people.

1159
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:00,790
有任何一人可信任嗎
Isn't there anyone we can trust ?

1160
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:05,800
當然有  全部人  只是不知哪個
Sure. All of them. Only which one ?

1161
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:14,810
先生  你可能會覺得瘋狂
Excuse me. Uh, this may sound sort of crazy.

1162
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:17,810
不知如何說起  這間屋  
I don't even know how to start.

1163
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,820
是間諜及陰謀破壞者的溫床
But this whole house is a hotbed of spies and saboteurs.

1164
01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:23,830
我可肯定  主人瑟頓太太也是
I'm not being silly. Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.

1165
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,830
你有問題嗎  你喝醉了嗎  
What's the matter with you, sir ? You're drunk.

1166
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,830
你連禮服也沒穿
You're not even dressed.

1167
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,830
他說什么  
What'd he say ?

1168
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,840
他以為我喝醉了
He thinks I'm drunk.

1169
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,840
我閱報得悉日本人的所為
When I read in the papers what those Japs are doing--

1170
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:42,920
我要去華盛頓找份工作了
Beat it out! Eight to the bar.

1171
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,860
我要跳搖擺舞
Yeah, man. Stay in there and pitch.

1172
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,930
你付出二十五元入場的嗎  
Pardon me. Did you pay $25 to get in here tonight ?

1173
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,860
不  我老板給我入場券的
No, not exactly. The boss gave me a ticket. Why ?

1174
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:52,860
我需要你幫忙
I need your help.

1175
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,870
你身處一班專欄作家中間
We're among the biggest bunch of fifth columnists in this country.

1176
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,870
你開玩笑嗎  是什么鬧劇  
Are you kiddin' ? What's the gag ?

1177
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,870
我是其中之一
No. I'm on the level.

1178
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:58,870
別開玩笑吧
Aw, you're kiddin'.

1179
01:13:58,940 --> 01:13:59,870
他在戲弄我
The guy's tryin' to rib me.

1180
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:06,390
他向你搭訕  齊來搖擺  
Aw, sling him your curve. Beat it out. son.

1181
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,900
先生  我有些要事跟你談
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to talk to you about something very important.

1182
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:22,970
是什么  堅尼先生  你沒希望了
What is it, Mr. Kane ? You know it's hopeless.

1183
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:26,910
不如到樓上跟杜賓先生共膳吧
Why don't you join Mr. Tobin upstairs in a little supper?

1184
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,920
我帶你去
I'll show you the way.

1185
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,620
不如停止音樂  
Barry, before they get to us,

1186
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,460
向各位分開此事
stop the music and tell them ! Tell them all.

1187
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,460
這是瑟頓的大宅
This is the Sutton mansion.

1188
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,460
我只是個被通緝的小伙子
I'm just a guy from California wanted by the police.

1189
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:05,540
我一開口便會被他們拖下去
They'll grab me as soon as I open my mouth.

1190
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,470
我們該怎么辦  難道要坐以待斃  
What are you gonna do ? We can't just stand here.

1191
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:09,470
我知道哪里會安全
I know where we'll be safe.

1192
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,490
巴利  我很害怕
Barry, I'm scared.

1193
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,490
所有人在盡慶  在翩翩起舞
It's so unreal, all these people dancing and having a good time.

1194
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,490
對他們提出警告竟當我說笑
And when you try to warn them, they laugh at you.

1195
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,500
以為我喝醉了
They think you're drunk.

1196
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,500
那個白發老人似乎是個老實人
That man you spoke to seemed like such an honest citizen.

1197
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,500
他是這家庭的3朋友
Mmm, just a friend of the family.

1198
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,500
整個房間滿布黨羽
The room's well-sprinkled with them.

1199
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,510
他們很聰明  令我害怕
They're so smart. That's what frightens me.

1200
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,520
他們很聰明  因此冷酷無情
Yeah, they're smart, because they're ruthless.

1201
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:39,520
當你將規條拋諸腦后便很易獲勝
It's easy to win when you forget about the rules.

1202
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,520
一個叫富禮的人在加州掉了錢包
A man named Fry drops a wallet in California,

1203
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,590
竟導致我倆身陷窘境
and we wind up here, you and me.

1204
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:46,600
唯一好處是可跟你在一起
That's the only good part: I'm with you.

1205
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,530
但愿是在別處  在此極也不介意
I wish it were somewhere else. The North Pole. I wouldn't care.

1206
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,540
可在冰川上找尋富禮
We might wind up there too, chasing Fry over a glacier !

1207
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,540
他太渺少了  我已忘記他了
Fry. He seems so small now. I'd forgotten about him.

1208
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,550
我也是
So had I.

1209
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,560
我們不能在此一直跳舞
We can't just go on dancing like it's Saturday night at the Palladium.

1210
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,560
不能等他們來捉我們
We can't just wait 'til they get us.

1211
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,630
你看他們實際會怎樣做  
What do you think they'll really do ?

1212
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,560
可能正在跟暗殺公司討價還價
They're probably haggling over the price with Murder, Incorporated.

1213
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,560
巴昨  求求你
Oh, Barry, please !

1214
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,570
對不起  柏
Sorry.

1215
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,570
我現在不想走了  還有很多事做
I hate to be out of it. There's still so much to do.

1216
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,570
最重要是保住性命  他們說過
If staying alive was ever important. You heard what they said.

1217
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,590
明天要去布連執行任務
Something about a job tomorrow in Brooklyn.

1218
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,590
是海軍基地  我們其中一人逃走
The navy yard. One of us has got to get out of here.

1219
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,590
由我鬧事  你借機逃走
Maybe if I start something, you can make a break for it.

1220
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:29,590
你怎辦  
What about you ?

1221
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:33,600
別擔心我  你要搏一次了
You can't worry about me. We've gotta take a chance.

1222
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,600
巴利  我倆為何不在一百年前  
Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have met you a hundred years ago ?

1223
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:38,600
在海灘相逢
On a beach somewhere.

1224
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:42,600
一百年前的泳衣很羞
Bathing suits looked awfully funny a hundred years ago.

1225
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:47,620
但你穿起來卻會很漂亮
I'll bet you'd look beautiful, though.

1226
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,630
我們的行為太放肆了
Afraid we're not behaving very well.

1227
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:55,630
那又如何  
What's the difference ?

1228
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,630
反正我們不是被邀請到來的
We weren't invited anyway.

1229
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:08,650
柏  這一刻是屬于我的
Pat, this moment belongs to me.

1230
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,650
無論如何他們也不能搶走你
No matter what happens, they can never take it away from me.

1231
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,660
對不起  你介意嗎  
Oh, pardon me. Do you mind?

1232
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:27,670
對不起  你愿意跳舞嗎  
Oh, excuse me. Would you, uh-- Would you care to dance ?

1233
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,670
當然
Why, yes. Certainly.

1234
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,690
你是個更好的舞伴
Oh, you're really a much better dancer.

1235
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,690
謝謝  跟你共舞的男子是什么人
Thanks. Who was the man you were dancing with ?

1236
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,690
我不知  從未見過他
I have no idea. I never saw him before.

1237
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,690
我是指剛才離開你的人
No, I mean the man that just left you.

1238
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,690
我知道  講的正是他
I know.

1239
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,700
我這一生從未見過他
I never saw him before in my life.

1240
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:56,720
真可惜  希望有機會會再共舞
Oh, what a pity. That was lovely. I hope you will ask me again.

1241
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:59,720
好的  謝謝
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

1242
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:04,300
年青人  
Well, young man, you seem to be enjoying yourself.

1243
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,730
你很享受這舞會嗎
Charming party, isn't it ?

1244
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,730
她在哪里  
Where is she ?

1245
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,730
你的年輕女士  你不是照顧她嗎  
Your young lady ? I thought you were taking care of her.

1246
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,740
可能因為頭痛  去了休息
Perhaps she has a headache and is lying down somewhere.

1247
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,750
可否跟我一起去找她  
Would you like to come with me and look for her ?

1248
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,750
讓我來
Hold on.

1249
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,760
各位先生女士們  
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen !

1250
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,760
請注意
Your attention, please.

1251
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,770
我有事要告訴各位
I-I have something to tell you.

1252
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,780
是關于這屋和舞會的主人
Something you ought to know about this house and about your hostess.

1253
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,790
你繼續講之前
Sir, before you go on,

1254
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,800
最好先看看平臺的窗簾
take a look at the curtain on the balcony.

1255
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:13,020
各位  我并不擅于公開演講
I'm, uh, not much of a public speaker,

1256
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:16,180
部份人會奇怪  
ladies and gentlemen, and, uh, some of you are probably wondering

1257
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,900
我怎會告訴各位
how I can tell you anything about your hostess...

1258
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,840
一些大家也不知的女主人事跡
that you, uh, you don't already know--

1259
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,850
她的大方有禮
her graciousness,

1260
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,850
她的仁慈心  她的樂善好施
her kindness, her many charities.

1261
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,890
我要帶給
Well, I want to tell you

1262
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,860
各位一個驚喜
that you have a big surprise coming, ladies and gentlemen.

1263
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:38,930
為了今晚的善舉
Tonight, in this house, for the benefit of this great cause...

1264
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,930
她已付出很多
for which she's already done so much,

1265
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:43,870
今晚我們的主人瑟頓太太  
our hostess, Mrs. Sutton,

1266
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,870
打算將珍藏的珠寶送出來拍賣
is putting up for auction...

1267
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:51,880
是著名的瑟頓珠寶其中之一
one of her most treasured possessions, one of the famous Sutton jewels.

1268
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,100
瑟頓太太  請移玉步上前
Mrs. Sutton, would you kindly step forward ?

1269
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,920
謝謝
- Thank you.

1270
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,920
堅尼先生  有位年青女士要找你
- Mr. Kane, the young lady is asking to see you.

1271
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,920
真的嗎  
Are you sure ?

1272
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:25,930
若我是你  便不會要她久候
I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you, sir.

1273
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,930
好的
Yes.

1274
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
有誰來幫我  
Uh-- Will someone please, uh, uh--

1275
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,650
海軍司令  可否上來代替我  
W Admiral ?ould you take over for me, please ? I'm wanted on the phone.

1276
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:42,950
我樂意代勞謝謝
Delighted, sir. Thank you.

1277
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,140
各位  
Ladies and gentlemen,

1278
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,960
我會為大家拍賣這手鐲
I will entertain your bids for this beautiful bracelet...

1279
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:50,030
是由我們的主人瑟頓太太送出的
which has been donated by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.

1280
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,960
叫價多少  
What am I bid?

1281
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:52,960
一千元
One thousand dollars.

1282
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,970
有人出價一千  有更多嗎  
One thousand dollars has been bid. Do I have any more ?

1283
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:56,970
一千五百  
Fifteen hundred.

1284
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,970
已出價一千五百  還有嗎  
Fifteen hundred dollars.

1285
01:20:59,050 --> 01:20:59,980
一千七百五十
1 ,7 50.

1286
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,980
一千七百五十
$ 1.7 50.

1287
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:02,980
二千  
Two thousand.

1288
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:07,990
有人出價二千元買這美麗的手鐲
Two thousand.

1289
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:12,990
她在哪里  
Where is she ?

1290
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:16,000
你似乎在尋找那位年輕女士
You seem to have a soft spot for that young lady.

1291
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,000
你是受不起這刺激的
You can't afford to make yourself that vulnerable,

1292
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:21,070
何況是要救國  
not when you're out trying to save your country.

1293
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,420
為何每次提及國家你總嗤之以鼻  
You sneer every time you refer to this country.

1294
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:26,090
我不明白  你在這里活得很好
You've done well here. I don't get it.

1295
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,550
你不會明的  你是擁護美國的人
No, you wouldn't. You're one

1296
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:31,090
有數以百萬計的人像你一般
of the ardent believers, a good American.

1297
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:35,030
人民默默耕耘  不會提出疑問
Millions like you plod along without asking questions.

1298
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,030
我不想用愚蠢來形容
I hate to use the word stupid,

1299
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,030
但別無選擇
but it seems to be the one that applies.

1300
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:43,030
數以百萬計的傻瓜
The great masses,

1301
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,040
很少人像我般聰明
the moron millions.

1302
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:47,050
他們盲目附和
Well, there are a few of us who are unwilling to just troop along;

1303
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:51,050
很少人像我般聰明  力求上進
a few who are clever enough to see that there's much more to be done...

1304
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,060
不輕易自滿
than just live small, complacent lives;

1305
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,060
很少美國人要求政府爭取盈余
a few of us who desire a more profitable type of government.

1306
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:02,130
堅尼  你試想想
When you think about it, Mr. Kane,

1307
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:06,070
極權國家的能力尤勝于我們
the competence of totalitarian nations is much higher than ours.

1308
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,140
他們能完成既定的任務
They get things done.

1309
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:12,150
對  他們能完成任務  
Yeah. They get things done.

1310
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,090
炸城市  炸沉船只  嚴刑迫供
They bomb cities, sink ships, torture and murder...

1311
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:16,090
暗殺等任務  你們可從中得利
so you can eat off a gold plate;

1312
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,090
這是偉大的哲學
it's a great philosophy.

1313
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,160
我并非要放置炸彈或要炸沉船只
I neither intend to be bombed nor sunk, Mr. Kane.

1314
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,090
我現在在離開的原因
That's why I'm leaving now.

1315
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,500
是因為一切未如我所愿
And if things don't go right for you--

1316
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:30,100
若我們可獲勝  我便會回來
If, uh, we should win--

1317
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,180
我希望得到的  是權力
then I'll come back. Perhaps I can get what I want then: power.

1318
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:39,550
正如你渴求安居樂業般
Yes. I want that as much as you want your comfort or your job...

1319
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:44,130
我們的品味有異
or that girl. We all have different tastes, as you can see.

1320
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:49,130
我要用必須的武力來掙回品味
Only I'm willing to back my tastes with the necessary force.

1321
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:55,210
你說來輕描淡寫  這是詭計
You certainly make it sound smooth and easy. That's a trick.

1322
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:58,220
我知你所說的權力會帶來的后果
I know the results of that power you believe in.

1323
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:01,150
它會奪去我朋友及千萬人的性命
It killed my friend, and it's killing thousands like him.

1324
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,150
這正是你的目的
That's what you're aiming at.

1325
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,160
我知你對這一切絕不感受懊悔
But it doesn't bother you, I can see that.

1326
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,230
因為你憎恨所有人
Because you really hate all people.

1327
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,160
讓我告訴你
Let me tell you something.

1328
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:13,160
過去四五天我學懂了很多東西
The last four or five days I've learned a lot.

1329
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,170
我遇到很多像你這般的人
I've met guys like you, and I've met others--

1330
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:18,250
他們有能力  渴望做些正確的事
people that are helpful and eager to do the right thing,

1331
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:22,250
他們互相幫忙  合力擊退壞人
people that get a kick out of helping each other fight the bad guys.

1332
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:24,190
愛與恨
Love and hate.

1333
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,260
世人選擇正途  我也懂作出抉擇
The world's choosing up sides. I know who I'm with.

1334
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,260
很多人支持我  是來自世界各地
There are a lot of people on my side-- millions in every country.

1335
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,260
我們絕不懦弱  我們很堅強
And we're not soft; we're plenty strong.

1336
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:36,270
憑著赤手空拳  定會獲勝
And we'll fight standing up on

1337
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,200
無論你們做什么  我們必勝
our two feet, and we'll win !

1338
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,970
從這一刻開始  
Remember that, Mr. Tobin. We'll win, no matter what you guys do.

1339
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:43,340
勝利將屬于我們
We'll win if it takes from now until the cows come home !

1340
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:49,720
我們對人權的討論已夠了
Mr. Kane, I think we've discussed the rights of man sufficiently.

1341
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:55,290
我已感到疲倦  相信你也疲倦了
I'm feeling a little tired. You must be too.

1342
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:56,430
羅拔  
Robert,

1343
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:59,300
替堅尼安排睡覺的地方
do you think you can arrange for Mr. Kane to sleep somewhere tonight ?

1344
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,370
遵命
Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.

1345
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,250
夠了  羅拔
That's enough, Robert.

1346
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,250
很好
Ver good. sir.

1347
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,330
你可獨力看管他嗎  可以
Think you can take care of this ? Yes. sir.

1348
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:23,260
沒有其他事吧  對  謝謝
Will that be all, sir ? Yes. thank you.

1349
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,300
無論我們作任何安排或遇到麻煩
It doesn't matter what arrangements we've made, to what trouble we've gone.

1350
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,300
整件事最重要的一點是時間性
This whole job hangs on one thing: timing.

1351
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,380
若船在戰艦下水前升高
If the slipway goes up

1352
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,310
我們將會白費功夫
before the actual launching,

1353
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,310
若太遲引爆
then all our efforts have been wasted.

1354
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,320
只會引起群眾恐慌
If you blow her too late, then you just scare the crowd.

1355
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,320
時間性  
Timing, timing, timing.

1356
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:01,320
要在戰艦開始滑行時按擎
That button must not be pressed until the ship starts to move.

1357
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,320
我們如何安排逃離現場  
What arrangements have been made for getting out ?

1358
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,330
攝影機電線脫勾  貨車便可開動
As soon as the cables are unhooked, this truck goes.

1359
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:08,330
我們已安放在大閘上
We got it fixed at the gate.

1360
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,330
誰負責控制船臺附近的攝影機  
Who's handling the camera near the slipway ?

1361
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,100
是我  昨晚已鋪好接駁的電線
I am.The explosives were laid last night.

1362
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:14,410
我只需將連接攝影機的電線解開
I have to hook them up to the camera.

1363
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,350
很可惜
Too bad

1364
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,350
要損失一部優質的攝影機
we have to lose a good camera.

1365
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,420
好了  看來已一切就緒
Everything seems to be taken care of.

1366
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:24,360
我會在新聞中心等你們  祝好運
I'll be waiting at the newsreel office. Good luck.

1367
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:29,360
他們走了嗎  是
- Have they gone ? - Yes.

1368
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,360
她怎么了  
How is she ? Okay.

1369
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:36,380
很好  正在吃早餐
She's having her breakfast.

1370
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:37,380
令她肅靜有麻煩嗎  
Any trouble keeping her quiet ?

1371
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:40,380
沒有  我跟她有個協議
No. I made a deal with her.

1372
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:43,140
那些封眼有嘴的
You see, she got tired of having

1373
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,450
膠布令她疲倦
that adhesive tape over her eyes and mouth.

1374
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:47,390
希望你可盡快解決她
I hope we get rid of her soon.

1375
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,390
我答應帶孩子去聽管弦樂團表演
I promised to take my kid sister to the philharmonic.

1376
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:57,410
將鑰匙交給我在這里
Give me the key. There it is.

1377
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,420
對不起  昨晚未能讓你留在屋里
I'm sorry we couldn't keep you at the house,

1378
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,420
因為瑟頓太太的客房數量有限
but Mrs. Sutton has a limited number of guest rooms,

1379
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:10,420
我看堅尼先生會獲得優先接待
and I suppose Mr. Kane was first in line.

1380
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:11,420
我在哪里  
Where am I ?

1381
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:13,420
這是商業秘密
Oh. that's a trade secret.

1382
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:16,430
希望你不會畏高吧
I only hope it isn't too high for you here.

1383
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,850
堅尼正身處低層  
Mr. Kane's quarters are nearer the ground,

1384
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,430
得到悉心照料
but he's being well looked after...

1385
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:24,450
像你一樣  享受精美的早餐
and, like you, is probably enjoying a hearty breakfast.

1386
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:15,600
這是誰人的地方  
Whose place is that ?

1387
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,610
是瑟頓太太的房子
That's Mrs. Sutton's house.

1388
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,610
她是誰  
Oh. Who's she ?

1389
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,610
是有錢的太太
Some rich dame.

1390
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:24,620
看報章知道她做很多善事
Saw something in the paper about her doing things for charity.

1391
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,620
就在這里
Right here somewhere. Here.

1392
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:31,620
明天那件事如何  
What about tomorrow's work ?

1393
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:33,620
你已準備就緒  不應放棄
Tomorrow's work ? Can't abandon that.

1394
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:37,630
但風險  很大  我知道
But, Charles, the risk-- Is great! I know that.

1395
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:42,640
很可惜  我們要執行命令
Unfortunately, we will have to carry out our orders.

1396
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:46,650
現在幾點了  
- What's the time ? - 1 0:50.

1397
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,720
10點15分謝謝
Thanks.

1398
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,650
布連海軍基地  快  
Brooklyn Navy Yard, quick !

1399
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,710
有危險

1400
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:37,720
快召警方

1401
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:40,720
看有燈的地方

1402
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,750
多少錢  十五仙
How much ? Fifteen.

1403
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:05,760
有找贖嗎  有
Got change ? Yes.

1404
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,810
承蒙海軍部門的允許
Courtesy of the Navy Department,

1405
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,810
我們得以帶大家到布連海軍基地
we take you to the navy yard,

1406
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,810
我們在此作全國聯播
where we will endeavor

1407
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,820
為大家報導下水禮  
to bring you a description...

1408
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,820
是海軍的主力艦阿拉斯加號
of the launching ceremony of the U.S.S. Alaska.

1409
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,820
不浪費時間了
And so we switch you now

1410
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,820
立即帶大家到現場
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

1411
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:53,820
我們現正身處布連海軍基地
Here we are. A rather windy autumn day,

1412
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,830
雖然風勢較大  但天色尚算良好
but a pretty good day for a launching.

1413
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,840
適宜進行下水禮
Any day is a good day

1414
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,840
這季節任何一天也適宜下水禮
for a launching in these times.

1415
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,910
我們的揚聲器已安放在重點位置
Our microphones are in several key spots.

1416
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:02,840
可以為各位報導典禮的盛況

1417
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,840
為什么停車  
What's holding us up ?

1418
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:07,040
當然是交通擠塞
Traffic, buddy. What do you think ?

1419
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,920
我要徒步好的
Here. I'll walk. Okay.

1420
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,850
典禮快要開始了
The main speaker is about to begin.

1421
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:19,190
我要交給主禮臺上的唐倫
I am now turning you over to Bill Donnan, located on the actual platform.

1422
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,130
這艘巨型的戰艦
Go ahead, Bill. This is Bill Donnan.

1423
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:25,880
在我們面前
We're located right below the bow of the great ship.

1424
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:28,880
像只龐大的怪獸般
It towers over us like some enormous monster.

1425
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,880
我們身處的主禮臺  
This platform--

1426
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:33,880
帶我去見負責人
Take me to the guy in charge !

1427
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:34,880
我來應付他你想要什么  
Okay. I'll take care of this.

1428
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,890
下水禮會有事發生  是破壞
What do you want ? Something's gonna happen. Sabotage.

1429
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,890
你從何處得到這消息  
Where'd you get your information ?

1430
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,890
我不能詳細敘述  沒時間了
There isn't time !

1431
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,890
你最好到辦事處跟主管講
We gotta have more to go on.

1432
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,890
我告訴你  沒時間了
Better tell the chief.There isn't time !

1433
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:43,900
你想我怎么辦  
What do you expect ?

1434
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:45,910
帶我去見下水禮的負責人
Take me to the guy in charge of the launching.

1435
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,910
你要通過辦事處才可以
You gotta go through the office first.

1436
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:50,980
這是命令
Towley, 1 050.

1437
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,910
現在人山人海  海軍軍官齊集
Crowded with all kinds of navy officers and personnel.

1438
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,990
在左邊的是皮雅斯將軍及夫人
I can see Rear Admiral Pierce and Mrs. Pierce.

1439
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:02,920
皮雅斯夫人會在主持破瓶禮
It is Mrs. Pierce who will perform the bottle breaking.

1440
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:05,940
她正在下面跟來賓握手
She is shaking hands with a great many people down there.

1441
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,940
各位  
Just a second.

1442
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,940
皮雅斯少將正步向麥克風前
I see Rear Admiral Pierce moving toward the microphone.

1443
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,940
看來開始致辭了
Yes. He's going to begin his speech now.

1444
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,950
我們接駁到致辭者的揚聲器
We'll switch you over to the speaker's microphone.

1445
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,950
在戰爭期間一艘戰艘下水
The launching of a ship in time of war...

1446
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,950
是一件莊嚴的事情
is always a solemn occasion.

1447
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:23,120
今天我們的部隊
Today, when our fleet is fighting on all the seven seas,

1448
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,790
正在戮力作戰
this ceremony gains magnitude...

1449
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,040
這小伙子去哪里了  
for it represents a victory. Where'd that guy go ?

1450
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,970
我不知  他只是沖出去
I don't know. He just stepped outside.

1451
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:39,980
這是代表美國人民的  
by the strong hands of American workmen.

1452
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:43,980
在此刻  我們齊來慶祝  
- Let us rejoice, then, at this moment.

1453
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,990
我們要有信心  
Let us be confident,

1454
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:55,010
他們為國捐軀  
Our American soldiers...

1455
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,970
令我們可以
are freely giving their lives so

1456
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:00,010
和平地安全地生活
that we can live in decency, security and peace.

1457
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,010
我是唐倫  大家已聽到了
This is Bill Donnan again.

1458
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,980
是皮雅斯少將在海軍基地的演辭
You'vejust heard Rear Admiral Pierce speaking from the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

1459
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,910
比利  
His speech is being received with great applause--

1460
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,090
快鎖上后門
Shut the back doors ! Quick !

1461
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:12,020
她快要下水了  預備拉擎
I can handle this ! Be ready to pull out as soon as she goes.

1462
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:18,040
海軍軍官正將一瓶香檳交給她
The officer is handing her a bottle of champagne.

1463
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:26,050
群眾很緊張  這是莊嚴的典禮
The crowd is tense. It is indeed a solemn occasion.

1464
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:29,050
我用揚聲器接收現場的聲音
I switch you over to our microphone near the bow of the ship...

1465
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,050
會放在船頭位置  大家可聽清楚
so that you may hear the actual launching.

1466
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,060
我見到皮雅斯夫人正步向船頭
I can see that Mrs. Pierce is moving towards the bow.

1467
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,070
將麥克風交給皮雅斯夫人
I'll switch you over now to Mrs. Pierce.

1468
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,070
我憑藉美國人民之名
In the name of the people of the United States,

1469
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:44,070
為阿拉斯加號施洗
I christen thee Alaska.

1470
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,110
發生什么事  
What's the trouble ?

1471
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:15,120
我不知  某處發生了爆炸
Don't know. An explosion somewhere.

1472
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,140
佐治
George !

1473
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,140
一切順利嗎  
Everything okay ?

1474
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:39,150
不  快幫手  我們捉到一個人
No. Give us a hand. We got a guy.

1475
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,180
要分頭走  穿過走廊及鐵閘
Better scatter. Go through the iron door into the music hall.

1476
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:08,190
帶他進音樂廳  我們這邊走
We'll go this way.

1477
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:30,220
趁佐治來捉我們之前  快走吧
You must go at once, before Henry catches you here !

1478
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:33,230
你不是要令那老家伙妒忌嗎  
I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous.

1479
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:36,240
不要吧  他說見到你便要殺死你
Not anymore. He's threatened to kill you on sight.

1480
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,240
他不會那么過份吧  
You don't think he'd go that far, do you ?

1481
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:40,240
你要趁早走啦
Oh, will you go before it's too late ?

1482
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:43,240
趁他射殺你之前走吧
Before he shoots you ?

1483
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:47,250
你說老亨昨有手槍  
Old Henry's got a gun ? A real gun ?

1484
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,250
你以為這是什么  
Oh ! What do you think this is ?

1485
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,250
我終于捉到你了
I've caught you,

1486
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,260
你這混蛋  
you rat in the grass!

1487
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:00,340
走吧  韋伯  別讓他射中你
Stop that! Run, Wilbur! Before he gets your range!

1488
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:04,270
快出來  否則我再開槍
I think I got it now. Get out before I shoot again !

1489
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,280
走吧  韋伯
Run ! Quick!

1490
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,280
他碰不到我的
Never touched me!

1491
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,280
今次射中了
I'll get you this time.

1492
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:14,280
走吧  韋伯  他又開槍了
My husband ! He's shot !

1493
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:18,290
我的遺愿是要殺死他
I'll kill the rat if it's the last thing I do !

1494
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:20,300
我發誓  我只不過是開玩笑
He was only kidding. I swear ! And I'm only kidding too !

1495
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:26,310
快滾出來
Get outta here! Get outta here!

1496
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:29,310
來吧  滾出來
He's gone mad! Mad!

1497
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:33,310
不是這樣  他會殺死你的
- Get out! Get out! -

1498
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,320
謀殺呀  救命呀  
Not that way! He'll kill you!

1499
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:41,650
走吧  快逃命
Murder! Help ! Run ! Run ! - Run for your life! -

1500
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:50,340
他在這里
There he goes !

1501
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:51,340
他是你要捉的人
He's the one you're after !

1502
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:52,340
你才是  
You're the one we're after.

1503
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:53,340
我告訴你  是他  他快逃走了  
Come on ! He'll get away !

1504
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:59,420
你坐車去跟蹤他  這是唯一機會
Come on ! Grab a cab and go after him. It's our only chance ! Taxi !

1505
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:09,440
到市中心哪里  
Downtown. Whereabouts ?

1506
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:14,370
隨便去哪里  只管駛往市中心
Anywhere. Just keep goin' downtown.

1507
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:55,520
可否換些零錢打電話  好的
May I have change for the telephone ? Yes. ma'am.

1508
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:11,540
接線生  請接往聯邦調查局總部
Operator ? Give me the F.B.I. headquarters, please.

1509
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:17,540
聯邦調查局  請等我替你接線
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hold on, I'll put you through.

1510
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,550
要確保他不能搭下一班船走
Make sure he doesn't leave by the next boat.

1511
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,550
跟他談話  跟蹤他
Talk to him. Follow him !

1512
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:24,560
盡量拖延  直至我們到來
Keep him there until our men come along.

1513
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:27,570
那女孩說跟蹤到富禮去庇利島
She thinks she's traced Fry to Bedloe Island.

1514
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,570
她是瘋子  他從未去過那里
He'd never go there !

1515
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,570
你上月在何處捉到史高斯  
Where did you pick up Schultz ?

1516
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,570
在博物館  展覽現代藝術的地方
In that museum, that modern art place.

1517
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,570
連拿度呢  在看金魚時拘捕他  
And Renaldo ? You caught him in the aquarium.

1518
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,580
對  最后在自由神像附近擒獲
But the statue's a dead end.

1519
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,580
正是了  他很狡猾
He's smart. Get going.

1520
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,580
捉他回來  可告他很多罪名
Get going.

1521
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,580
但愿那女孩沒有弄錯
Let me take him to make sure the girl hasn't made a mistake.

1522
01:39:41,650 --> 01:39:46,600
布克  你最頑強  由你去
Burke, you're one of the most obstinate men I've ever met ! Get going.

1523
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:54,420
請問布連在哪里  
Pardon me. Could you tell me which is Brooklyn ?

1524
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:01,440
我們似曾相識嗎  
I've seen you before, haven't I ?

1525
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:04,700
一定見過
Sure.

1526
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:08,070
是在那艘船
On that boat comin' over.

1527
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,710
你問我什么  
What'd you ask me ?

1528
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,720
我素仰布連大名  想知道在何處
About Brooklyn, where it was. I've heard so much about it.

1529
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,720
在那邊
Over there.

1530
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,730
你來自何地  紐約
Where are you from ? New York.

1531
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,730
你為何兜搭我  
What are you handin' me ?

1532
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,730
我在市中心的商店工作
Oh, no. You see, I work in a store downtown.

1533
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,740
沒時間到處逛
I never get a chance to get out.

1534
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,810
整天呆坐店內  沒時間去游覽
I just sit around all day, and I never see anything.

1535
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:32,720
我對自己說過  首次外游  
So I said, the first vacation I get,

1536
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,810
一定要去看看自由神像
I'm going to see the Statue of Liberty.

1537
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:36,750
對你來說定是難忘的時刻
This must be a big moment for you, huh ?

1538
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:41,830
是啊  現在對我們很有意義
Oh, it is. And it means so much to us now.

1539
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,760
我剛看過這小冊子
Why, I was just reading in this booklet.

1540
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:46,830
你知否它是法國人帶給我們的  
Did you know this statue was given to us by the French ?

1541
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,840
知否上面寫著什么  
You know what they had written on it ?

1542
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,770
將你的疲累及貧窮的人民交給我
''Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses...

1543
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,780
他們盼望能呼吸自由的空氣
''yearning to breathe free;

1544
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,780
那受到污染的海岸
''the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

1545
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:02,780
將那些無家可歸的暴徒交給我吧
Send these: the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.''

1546
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,780
那些法國人真凄慘
And just look at the French. Isn't it sad ?

1547
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,800
對  很凄慘
Yeah. Ver sad.

1548
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:11,800
這神像真美麗
Oh, it's such a beautiful statue.

1549
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:15,810
我會整天坐著靜思  你會嗎  
I could just sit up here all day thinking about it. Couldn't you ?

1550
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:18,810
改天或許會  今天不行
Some other day, maybe. Not right now.

1551
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,810
我現在要趕搭那班船回去
Right now I gotta catch that boat back.

1552
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,810
你會跟我去嗎  
You comin' ?

1553
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,820
下一班船十五分鐘后便到
Well, there's another boat in 1 5 minutes.

1554
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,860
不如稍后吧  所有人離去
Couldn't we wait ?

1555
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,830
便可讓我倆單獨相對
All the people have gone, and we'd be alone-- just you and me.

1556
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:37,840
聽起來很寫意
Sounds cozy.

1557
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:40,840
但我要趕時間
But I-- I haven't got the time.

1558
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,590
秋色如意  
Oh, on a nice autumn day like this,

1559
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,850
你不能陪我片刻嗎
you couldn't spare 1 5 minutes for me ?

1560
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:50,580
我不喜歡秋天
I don't like autumn.

1561
01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:54,860
你對我這孤單的女孩太無禮了
You're not being very nice to a lonely girl.

1562
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:59,870
我看你也很孤單啊對
You look as though you might be lonely too. Yeah.

1563
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,870
我要趕搭那班船
I gotta catch that boat.

1564
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:10,880
一刻鐘有何分別  富禮先生
Fifteen minutes shouldn't make such a big difference, Mr. Fry.

1565
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,900
你是誰  
Who are ya ?

1566
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:27,980
別再假裝了  你是誰  
Come on. Quit stalling. Who are ya ?

1567
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:30,980
我已跟你說過  我今天休假
I think I told you. A working girl on her day off.

1568
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:33,910
別耍我吧  
Don't kid me !

1569
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:35,910
你在這里做什么  
What are you doin' here ?

1570
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:40,000
富禮先生  這是個很長的故事
It's rather a long story, Mr. Fry.

1571
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,930
是從一個不知名的金發男子開始
It all started with an unknown blonde,

1572
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,930
是一個來自加州的飛機廠工人
