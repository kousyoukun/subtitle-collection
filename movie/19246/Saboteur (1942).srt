1
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:48,001
<i>Here come the wolves.</i>

2
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,065
Uh-oh. Bottleneck.
Mr. Roosevelt should hear
of this.

3
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,945
I'm sorry.
Hope you didn't
hurt yourself.

4
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,025
My friend
says he's sorry.

5
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:33,026
Okay.

6
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,750
That shows what a blonde
can do to hold up
national defense.

7
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:41,185
Nice, pleasant guy.

8
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:43,938
Man!
Gee,
a hundred bucks.

9
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,787
So that's
what they look like.

10
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:48,962
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
Uh...

11
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,882
I wonder
what his name is.

12
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:54,883
I saw it on the envelope.
Uh... Fry. That's it. Fry.

13
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,635
Fry.

14
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:03,555
How do you
know my name?

15
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,731
What do you care
how I know your name?

16
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,323
I saw it on one
of the envelopes
you dropped.

17
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:12,324
Here's something
that belongs to you.

18
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:59,589
<i>The paint shop!</i>
<i>It'll go up like dynamite!</i>
Here. Take this one.

19
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,925
<i>What about me?</i>
<i>Don't I get to play too?</i>
<i>You get another.</i>

20
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:05,926
<i>Right!</i>

21
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:17,502
So I see these two kids.
And I yell at them,
"The sprinklers are busted.

22
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:19,749
The whole shootin' match
will go up."

23
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,374
And they run right in,
the both of them.

24
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,934
And the last thing I saw
when I looked back...

25
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:28,005
was one kid
give the extinguisher
to the other kid,

26
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:31,270
and then it was just like
all hell comes up.

27
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,982
That's all I see.
<i>Was there anybody else</i>
<i>around?</i>

28
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,766
No. Just the two kids:

29
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:41,923
the poor kid with the
extinguisher and the one
who give it to him.

30
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:45,350
Thank you, Rogers.
We appreciate
all you've done.

31
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:49,727
We needn't keep you
any longer now.
Take care of those hands.

32
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,750
Who've
you got next?

33
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,494
<i>There's a fellow</i>
<i>Barry Kane waiting.</i>
<i>Send Barry Kane in.</i>

34
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,495
Barry Kane!

35
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,143
<i>All right. Just take it easy.</i>
<i>We only want to ask you</i>
<i>a couple of questions.</i>

36
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,568
A routine checkup.
Well, I want to do
anything I can to help.

37
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,042
Sure. Now, suppose
you tell us where you were
when the fire started.

38
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:19,934
Well, I was one of the first
to rush in. The sprinkler
systems weren't working.

39
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,927
<i>Who else was with you?</i>

40
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:26,533
There was just myself,
a fellow named Fry
and my friend...

41
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:28,585
Ken Mason.

42
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:31,432
<i> Go on.</i>
Fry handed me
an extinguisher,

43
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,736
and I started running
toward the fire.

44
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:37,705
I gave it to Ken.

45
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:39,625
And then he...

46
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:43,273
Okay. Take it easy.
That's all.

47
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:47,274
Just stick around
for a while.
We may need you.

48
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,722
<i>Send for Fry.</i>

49
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,137
Get hold of a fellow
called Fry.

50
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,185
What'd they do,
ask you a lot
of questions?

51
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,842
Hardly any.
Gee, it's
awful tough going,

52
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,986
seeing it happen
in front of you.

53
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,987
Yeah, it is tough.
Ken Mason was your pal,
too, wasn't he?

54
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,698
Yeah.

55
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,834
Was he married?
No. He was living
with his mother.

56
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:16,650
Must be pretty tough
on her.

57
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:20,651
Sorry, fellows.
I'll see you later.

58
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,660
Hello, Mrs. Mason.

59
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:51,211
They... They wouldn't
let me see him.

60
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:54,347
It's awful hard
to believe.
It happened so quick.

61
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:58,059
Why, only
this morning...
Please!

62
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,484
Please don't
talk about it now.

63
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:04,428
Anything I can do?
Could I get you
something?

64
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:07,756
No. No, thank you.
Not now.

65
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,757
Maybe some brandy.

66
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,628
How is the poor,
dear soul?

67
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:22,188
If you mean Mrs. Mason,
she's feeling bad.

68
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,365
Ah, well.
She's every reason to.

69
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:27,661
Do you know what?
They wouldn't even
let her see him.

70
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,997
Her only son.
Yes, I know.

71
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:32,332
I told her to insist
on seeing him.

72
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,149
I told her <i>I</i> would,
and she as good as
told me to get out!

73
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,509
Me! That was only
tryin' to help.
The poor, dear soul.

74
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,901
I think you <i>can</i> help,
if you'll get some brandy.

75
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:46,375
You come with me,
young man. I have
a little in the house.

76
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:06,414
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Mason, but we're
looking for Barry Kane.

77
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:09,230
Do you know him?
He isn't here
right now, is he?

78
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:12,687
<i>They told us at the plant</i>
<i>we might be able</i>
<i>to find him here.</i>

79
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,438
Well... what do you
want to see him about?

80
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,959
He's in pretty bad
trouble, lady.
<i>What? I'd like to know.</i>

81
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,126
He was mixed up with
that fire at the factory.

82
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,624
I... I don't understand.

83
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,535
<i>There are a lot of things</i>
<i>we don't understand either.</i>

84
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:29,455
But how is Barry
involved in it?

85
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:32,943
That fire extinguisher.
Seems it wasn't
just an accident.

86
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:36,207
It turns out that
the extinguisher Barry Kane
handed your son...

87
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,352
<i>was filled</i>
<i>with gasoline.</i>
Oh!

88
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,232
<i>You ought to be able to help us.</i>
<i>Give us a lead on this guy Kane.</i>

89
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,720
Yeah. That's why
we want to look around.
Well...

90
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,896
Why...

91
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,104
I can't talk
about it now.
I...

92
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:52,176
Yeah. Sorry, but,
you see, there was...

93
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:55,568
I wouldn't give her
too much of that.
It often makes people weepy.

94
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,256
I know it affects me...
Yes, I've got to
hurry back.

95
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:02,257
Thank you very much.

96
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,298
Try some of this,
Mrs. Mason. It'll
make you feel better.

97
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,769
There were two detectives
just here.

98
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,970
They were
looking for you.
For me?

99
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:41,074
I guess they wanted
to ask more questions.
I said I'd help.

100
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:44,914
Here. Try this.
No.
That wasn't it.

101
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:47,026
They wanted to arrest you.

102
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,778
They said that
the fire extinguisher
that you handed to Kenneth...

103
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:51,635
was filled with gasoline.

104
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,747
That you killed him.

105
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:55,890
That <i>I</i> killed...

106
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,770
Why, are they crazy?
Why would I want to do
a thing...

107
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,179
Ken was my best friend!
Haven't they talked to Fry
about the extinguisher?

108
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:06,803
They said that
there was no such man
employed at the plant.

109
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:09,299
Why, I saw him!
I saw him twice!

110
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,987
Ken saw him too!
He was with us at the fire.

111
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,899
He handed me the extinguisher.
Ken said, "Don't I
get to play too?"

112
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,523
He was kidding.
I handed it to him.

113
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:21,171
Fry was right there with us,
I'm sure!

114
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:24,435
Why, he must have known
there was gasoline in it.

115
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:29,041
He must have known!
He stood right there with us
and watched, that...

116
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:38,132
Please go.

117
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:42,613
Don't you believe me?

118
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,844
Do you think I had
something to do with this?

119
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,244
I didn't tell the police
anything.

120
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:51,349
Oh, I don't know!

121
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,133
It's all so confused
and so terrible.

122
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:58,193
I don't know what they're
talking about! Why don't
they get this fellow Fry?

123
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:01,557
You'd better go.

124
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,797
All right. I'll go.

125
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,717
I've got to find Fry,

126
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:09,718
or Ken won't be the last one
to die.

127
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,798
<i>I saw him go in</i>
<i>the back way.</i>

128
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,111
Catchy.

129
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:45,112
What?
That tune
you're whistling.

130
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,366
Oh, I didn't even know
I was whistling.
You must be pretty happy.

131
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:52,503
Easy to see there's
nothin' on your mind.

132
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,927
<i>Oops. That must</i>
<i>have been Junior.</i>
<i>Felt like him.</i>

133
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,847
Junior?
Yeah, that rock.

134
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:00,983
I know every one
from Los Angeles
to Reno.

135
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:04,952
Tough job, driving a truck.
Got any other
hot news tonight?

136
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:07,479
I never realized
how tough it was before.

137
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,192
The tough part, you can
take that. It's the
monotony that gets you.

138
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:14,647
<i>I been thinking I'm gonna</i>
<i>get out of this trucking game.</i>
Why don't you?

139
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:18,136
One of the neighbors
told my wife it's stylish
to eat three meals a day.

140
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,952
- You married?
- Nope.

141
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:24,953
Go ahead and whistle.

142
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:29,048
That thing
bother you?
What's doin' it?

143
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,536
<i>Here. Stick this wad</i>
<i>of paper in there,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

144
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,064
<i>It's a pretty good thing</i>
<i>to have around,</i>
<i>one of these extinguishers.</i>

145
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:37,976
<i>I wouldn't be without one.</i>
<i>Now, take the other day.</i>

146
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:40,153
<i>A big truck turns over</i>
<i>right down here.</i>

147
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,553
<i>The gasoline catches,</i>
<i>and she goes up</i>
<i>like a matchbox.</i>

148
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,177
<i>A friend of the driver's</i>
<i>gets caught in her.</i>

149
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:49,236
If the driver hadn't had
an extinguisher, his pal
would have been fried alive.

150
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:52,793
<i>I didn't see it happen.</i>
<i>I never see</i> anything
<i>happen.</i>

151
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:56,794
I don't even <i>hear</i> about
anything, except when my wife
tells me the moving pictures.

152
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,961
That's the way
she spends the money:
moving pictures and new hats.

153
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:03,641
Buys a hat so she can go
to the picture show
so she can take it off.

154
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:07,194
No, sir. I haven't got
anything to whistle about.

155
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,690
Where are you from,
bud?

156
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,697
Uh, Los Angeles.
Tough. You work
down there?

157
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:15,481
Yeah.
Well, I did.
What doin'?

158
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:18,458
I was workin'
in an airplane factory.
They say that's pretty good.

159
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:21,115
I was wondering why
you weren't in the army.
Yeah.

160
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:24,730
They're particular
about the fellows they hire
in those defense plants.

161
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:28,888
That's no more than right.
They gotta be careful
they don't get blown up.

162
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:33,658
Yeah.
<i>I understand if a fellow</i>
<i>had any police record, no job.</i>

163
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:37,724
<i>Is that right?</i>
Oh, I don't know.

164
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:42,236
Hey, buddy. Hold the wheel
a while, will you,
while I animate this thing.

165
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:46,237
I'm a nicotine addict.

166
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:56,028
Hey, watch it, bud!
Stay on this side
of the white line.

167
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,619
Where do you wanna get off
when we get to Springville?

168
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,115
It doesn't matter.
Drop me in the middle
of town.

169
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:03,771
The minute you get
to Springville, you're
in the middle of the town.

170
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:05,724
The next minute,
the place is a memory.

171
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,636
Whole town
isn't a city block long.

172
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,100
You're goin' to one
of those big ranches
outside, aren't you?

173
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:15,101
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I'd be glad to drop you off
at whatever one you want.

174
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:33,693
That's it!
Deep Springs Ranch.

175
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:36,349
Hey! Say, that's
a whale of a big place.

176
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,909
Got a chance
of a job there?

177
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,302
Yeah.
I think so.

178
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:46,303
<i>You ought to like it.</i>
<i>Nice climate.</i>

179
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:51,711
The police! Maybe
something's happened!

180
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,974
<i>I'd like to talk</i>
<i>with you out here.</i>
Yeah. Sure, officer!

181
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:06,975
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

182
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,455
Hey, bud!
Come on. Everything's fixed.

183
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,174
Good night, Officer.

184
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,095
Can you imagine
a thing like that?

185
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:35,776
Cop, sirens, the whole works!
One of my taillights went out.

186
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:39,777
That's the trucking game
for you in a nutshell.

187
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,832
Calling all highway patrolmen.

188
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,424
Be on lookout
for a man named Barry Kane.

189
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:55,866
Last seen on Highway 99.
He has dark brown hair,
blue eyes,

190
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:59,873
height about six feet two,
no hat, around 25 years old.

191
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:03,874
Calling all highway patrolmen.
Calling all highway patrolmen.

192
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:49,314
How do you do? Is, uh,
Mr. Frank Fry here?

193
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,874
No, this is
Mr. Tobin's ranch.

194
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,875
Oh. Uh, could I
speak to Mr. Tobin?

195
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,146
Well, I'll see.
Just a minute.

196
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,834
You wait here, please.

197
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:04,835
There.
We've got the ball.

198
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,106
Throw it to me.
A young man
to see you, sir.

199
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,252
Throw it to me.
Where is Daddy's girl?

200
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:12,547
What did you say, Adele?

201
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:16,419
Who wants to see me?
A young man, sir. He came
to ask for a Mr. Fry.

202
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,371
Oh.

203
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,835
Well. Have him come out here,
will you?

204
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,363
Yes, sir.
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.

205
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:27,364
Here comes your granddaddy.

206
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:33,092
Mr. Tobin will see you.
Follow me, please.
Thank you.

207
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:38,118
<i>Want the ball?</i>

208
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,052
How do you do?
I'm Charles Tobin.

209
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:45,221
This is my daughter,
Mrs. Brown.
How do you do?

210
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:49,728
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
to excuse the informality
of this costume.

211
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:52,197
We're all informal out here
at Deep Springs Ranch.

212
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:54,212
That's one of the rules.
I see.

213
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,068
Want me to take Suzy
with me?

214
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,661
No, Suzy isn't gonna
disturb us at all.

215
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,189
Just let her play right here.
I'll see she doesn't fall
in the pool.

216
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,109
All right.

217
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,765
Well, shall we
sit out here?
Yes, sir.

218
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:09,286
It seems a shame to go indoors
on such a beautiful day.

219
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,837
Yes, it does.
You wanted to see me
about something?

220
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,165
Yes, sir. I'm looking
for a man named Fry.
Frank Fry.

221
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,685
I met him up in Los Angeles.
I understand he lives here.

222
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:22,982
Oh, no. No.
Fry, huh?

223
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:27,717
Frank Fry.
I'm afraid I don't know
anybody by that name.

224
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,798
Wait a minute.
Fry.

225
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,870
I've heard that name
somewhere.

226
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,791
I just don't seem
to be able to place it.

227
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,214
Uh-huh.
Uh, there used to be
a fellow...

228
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:42,215
with a name
something like that,
worked around here.

229
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:45,191
No. No.
It wasn't Fry.

230
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,271
Well, I'm afraid you
found the wrong address.

231
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:49,831
Well, it couldn't be
one of the cowhands
or somebody who's working?

232
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:52,550
<i>No, I know the names</i>
<i>of all my men.</i>

233
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,782
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>My next door neighbor...</i>

234
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:59,304
"Next door neighbor."
He lives 20 miles
from here!

235
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,639
But he may know.
I'll telephone him.

236
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,511
Oh, no, please don't.
No, no! You look as though
you've had a hard journey.

237
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,879
Too bad if you
came all this way
for nothing.

238
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,896
If you'll just wait,
we can find out.

239
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:13,159
Will you see that Suzy
doesn't fall into the pool?

240
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

241
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,016
Hey. Come here.

242
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:27,017
<i>Come over here.</i>

243
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:32,232
Oh, so you're
a ball player, are you?
Throw me the ball.

244
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,113
Let me have it.
Come on. Throw me the ball.

245
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,833
Throw me the other one.
Come on.

246
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,040
Throw it to me.
Come on.

247
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,216
Give me the ball.

248
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:45,800
That's fine. Fine!
Now, I'll throw it back.

249
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,618
<i>Where are you goin'?</i>
<i>Uh-oh. Don't do that.</i>

250
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:52,619
Leave those where they are.
Leave them right there.

251
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:18,730
Wanna be a good girl?
Put these back
where you found them.

252
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:22,378
<i>No, no, Suzy.</i>
<i>The gentleman says put them</i>
<i>back where you found them.</i>

253
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:27,715
The gentleman knows that you
must be careful with letters
that don't belong to you.

254
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,962
Probably I'm prejudiced,
but it seems to me...

255
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:33,194
that Suzy is a pretty cute
young lady.

256
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,627
Yeah, she's great.

257
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:37,771
Where's Frank Fry?

258
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,555
Really, you must do
something about that
memory of yours.

259
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:44,931
It wasn't a minute ago
that you read a telegram
that Fry sent me,

260
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:47,659
and it said that he was
on his way to Soda City.

261
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,956
Don't you
remember that?
Where's Soda City?

262
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,323
Well, I haven't given it
much thought, but I
wouldn't imagine...

263
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:56,651
there'd be an overabundance
of Soda Cities on the map.

264
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:00,044
You could find out some way.
<i>... bringing you</i>
<i>last-minute headlines.</i>

265
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,915
<i>Los Angeles: The fire</i>

<i>Police have traced</i>
<i>the incendiary blaze</i>
<i>to Barry Kane, former...</i>

269
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,876
Don't want any more
of that.

270
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,884
Think you'd be rather bored with
the descriptions of yourself.

271
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:24,293
Or maybe you never
get tired of them.
Well, I am by this time.

272
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,629
I've been listening to those
reports all morning.
You knew me. What about it?

273
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,893
Oh, quite a lot
about it, Mr. Kane.
You ought to know that.

274
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:34,284
You've become too famous
to remain so modest.

275
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:37,933
Tell me one thing.
Why are you covering up
Frank Fry?

276
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:40,494
What's a man like you
in this for?

277
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:44,301
Young man, I don't know
what you're talking about.
I think maybe you do!

278
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:47,886
Frank Fry is a saboteur
who doesn't mind
killing Americans for money.

279
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,990
You must watch yourself,
Mr. Kane!

280
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:55,693
I'm telling you this for your
own benefit, but you have the
makings of an outstanding bore.

281
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:59,342
You can't get away with this.
Even if I don't stop you,
others will.

282
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:02,223
A man like you can't last
in a country like this.

283
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:06,958
Very pretty speech.
Youthful, passionate,
idealistic.

284
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:10,286
You see, I've already
sent for the police.

285
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,263
You can't bluff me.
You're hooked,
and you know it.

286
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:17,071
Must I remind you that
<i>you</i> are the fugitive
and not I?

287
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:20,110
I'm a prominent citizen,
widely respected.

288
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:22,030
You are an obscure
young workman...

289
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:25,327
wanted for the committing
of an extremely
unpopular crime.

290
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:28,496
Which of us do you think
the police will believe?
Hmm?

291
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:33,101
Oh, you must think me
a very poor host, Mr. Kane.

292
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:37,424
Now, don't you feel
that a long, cold drink
is indicated?

293
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,952
I found out everything
you're gonna tell me.

294
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:43,979
I'll have to do the rest
by myself.
You wish to leave us?

295
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:48,049
<i>Adele, Adele!</i>
<i>Mr. Kane is going!</i>

296
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,824
I'm sorry.
You'll stop, please.

297
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:54,320
What does that shoot?
Water?
Bullets, I'm afraid.

298
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:58,224
<i>You shouldn't be</i>
<i>so anxious to leave us.</i>
<i>You'll hurt our feelings.</i>

299
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:01,904
You make it very hard for me
to refuse your invitations.

300
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:04,336
- Suzy, come on.
- No, no, Suzy! Come here.

301
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:07,376
Hello, Suzy.
You know where we're going?

302
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:11,377
For a piggyback ride.
You like piggyback rides?

303
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,625
<i>Dick, Joe!</i>
<i>Get after him!</i>

304
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:24,626
<i>Hurry up! Get him!</i>
<i>Get after him! Hurry up!</i>

305
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,466
Come on. Get going.
You can't take me
away like this.

306
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,025
Don't tell us
what we can't do, chum.
Go on. Get started!

307
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,458
You gotta get him!
Just because he's
got a big ranch...

308
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,859
and a fancy pool
doesn't mean
he's a nice guy!

309
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,410
Find out the things
he's been doing!
Sure. We know all about that.

310
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,194
Just come on along.
The baby
had the letters!

311
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:00,754
Oh, Suzy would be only
too glad to cooperate,

312
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:04,755
<i>but it'll be months</i>
<i>before she'll be</i>
<i>of any assistance.</i>

313
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,587
No, no, Suzy.

314
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:12,754
Those are not
for Suzy. Those are
for the gentleman.

315
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:16,755
All right, let's go.

316
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:25,011
Where are we goin'?
We're gonna let you get an idea
of the county jail.

317
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:27,476
You won't find it
the best in the West.

318
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,996
But it won't hurt you
'til they come up
from Los Angeles for you.

319
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,980
You can't hold me
without a warrant.
Chum.

320
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,604
Do I have to keep
askin' you not to tell us
what we can't do?

321
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,524
I'm tryin' to explain!
There isn't time!

322
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:40,565
Time's the one thing
you don't need to worry about.

323
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,485
You'll have it to burn.

324
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:46,420
You'll have 20 years,
<i>if</i> you get the right lawyer.

325
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:50,421
If you don't, you'll
have all the time there is.

326
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:55,477
- What's wrong?
What's holding us up?
- Truck blockin' the road.

327
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:58,997
<i>Looks like they're</i>
<i>changin' a tire.</i>

328
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,916
Got a cigarette?

329
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,917
Sure. All you want.

330
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:10,614
Hiya, bud!
Hey, what's the matter?

331
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:55,576
He went
behind those rocks!

332
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Not over here!

333
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:47,225
There he goes!

334
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:51,226
There he is!

335
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:46,235
<i>Hello there.</i>

336
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:50,075
Hello. I got caught
in this storm.
I'm pretty wet, I'm afraid.

337
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,347
Maybe you'd like to come
inside and get dry.

338
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:56,252
Did you leave your car
down on the road?
Put it in the shed.

339
00:27:56,253 --> 00:28:00,188
It won't do it any good
standing in the rain.
I don't have any car.

340
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:02,715
You might say
I'm traveling by thumb.

341
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,635
By thumb?
Yeah, I'm a hitchhiker.

342
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,556
Oh, I see.

343
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:10,013
I've always thought
that was the best way
to learn about this country,

344
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:12,380
and the surest test
of the American heart.

345
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:15,964
Yes, I guess it is.
Will you go to the fire
and dry your clothes?

346
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:20,538
Thanks.
They'd dry more quickly
if you put on something of mine.

347
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,716
Oh, no, thanks!
This is fine.

348
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:26,717
<i>We could do with another log</i>
<i>on the fire. Would you?</i>

349
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,677
Why, sure.
<i>You must stay</i>
<i>until this blows over.</i>

350
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:35,802
<i>It won't detain you long.</i>
<i>These autumn storms are short.</i>

351
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,870
<i>They yield to none in wetness,</i>
<i>but they are short.</i>
Yes, I...

352
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:45,566
I should have warned you.
Those logs are heavier
than you'd think.

353
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,567
<i>I drop them constantly.</i>

354
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,925
Yes, they <i>are</i> heavy.

355
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:55,582
I guess I was too smart
trying to pick it up
with one hand.

356
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:59,550
Good job it didn't
land on your foot.
That often happens to me.

357
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:02,430
You're lucky.

358
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:04,670
Yeah.
I'm lucky.

359
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:07,135
Oh, I was forgetting.
My name is Philip Martin.

360
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:10,143
Oh, I'm Barry K...
Mason.

361
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:14,142
I'm glad you found yourself
near here, Mr. Mason,
when the storm came.

362
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:18,143
It's a pleasant thing to have
a guest sharing the fire when
the rain is beating on the roof.

363
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:22,781
- You live here alone, sir?
- Yes, except I don't think
of it in that way.

364
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:26,848
<i>You see, sounds are my lights</i>
<i>and my colors.</i>

365
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:30,719
My music, for example.
I compose a little.

366
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,746
And there is nobody
to tell me that the results
are anything but brilliant,

367
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:39,453
so I live in a comfortable glow
of self-appreciation.

368
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,547
I prefer playing the works
of other composers.

369
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,792
Undoubtedly,
you'd prefer listening to them.

370
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:49,728
I used to play the triangle
in our high school band
a long time ago.

371
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,648
Oh, that's too bad.

372
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:55,392
It's unfortunate when you get
out of practice on the triangle.

373
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,433
The piano is a boon to me.

374
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:01,377
The piano can't know
that you're blind,

375
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:04,704
<i>so it doesn't embarrass you</i>
<i>by trying to make things</i>
<i>easier for you.</i>

376
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:08,608
<i>It does you the compliment</i>
<i>to trust you.</i>

377
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,617
<i>Delius, the British composer,</i>
<i>was blind too.</i>

378
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,537
<i>That's our only resemblance.</i>

379
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:17,538
This is his
"Summer Night on the River."

380
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,705
A very interesting effect:
obligato on an apple.

381
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:26,497
<i>Oh, I apologize, Mr. Mason.</i>

382
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:29,601
I forgot how hungry you
must be after your long walk.

383
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:32,802
Just a moment.
I'll get something.
<i>Oh, no. Thanks.</i>

384
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,914
This is fine. I...
I like apples.

385
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:38,915
So do I. We'll save them
for dessert.

386
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,346
It was all ready,
you see.

387
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,058
All I needed was a reminder
that I was hungry too.

388
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,483
Are you dry enough?
Just about, sir.

389
00:30:56,484 --> 00:31:00,484
It stopped raining.

390
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,683
Is that a car coming?

391
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,795
Two cars, I think.

392
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:09,796
Excuse me.

393
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:15,715
One car is my niece's.
I'd know that motor
anywhere.

394
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,859
The other is a stranger
to me.
A couple of men.

395
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,771
The girl's pointing
down the road. They must
have asked her where to go.

396
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:24,292
This is an easy country
to lose your way in.
That's one of its charms.

397
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:26,212
They're starting off
down the road now.

398
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:30,239
The girl's coming.
That's my niece.
She's been staying with me.

399
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,764
<i>She comes from New York</i>
<i>to spend a month</i>
<i>with me every year.</i>

400
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:38,304
It's one of my greatest
pleasures. Unhappily for me,
she can't stay longer.

401
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:41,508
After a month,
she finds the quiet deafening.

402
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,555
Uncle Philip.
Hello, old boy.

403
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:46,532
Uncle Philip, what do you
think happened? Oh.

404
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:51,040
You didn't know we had
a guest. You turned your
back, and see what happens.

405
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,284
My niece,
Patricia Martin,
Mr. Mason.

406
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,204
How do you do?
How do you do?

407
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,693
Uncle Philip, there was a car
full of detectives
down the road.

408
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:00,709
They wanted to know
the way to town.

409
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,412
They're searching for a man.
It was on all the radios.
A really dangerous criminal...

410
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:08,613
My dear, the police
are always on the alarmist side.

411
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:11,717
- But they said this man
is really dangerous!
- I'm sure they did.

412
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:14,501
How could they be heroes
if he were harmless?

413
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:18,406
Would you mind not having
any further quotations
from the police?

414
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:22,499
Their remarks
are always so expected.
They kill conversation.

415
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:26,374
You've probably seen the face
of my niece before,
Mr. Mason.

416
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,318
Why, yes. I was wondering
where I'd seen...

417
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,934
As a matter of fact,
you've seen her
practically everywhere.

418
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:36,422
I'm told that billboards
she adorns would reach
across the continent...

419
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:38,342
<i>if placed end to end.</i>

420
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:40,902
<i>I can't imagine who's</i>
<i>going to place them</i>
<i>end to end,</i>

421
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:43,974
nor why
they should consider it
the thing to do.

422
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:48,166
Uncle Philip never has
been enthusiastic over
my career as a model.

423
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,343
Relatives are like that.

424
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,479
My, aren't you two mean,
going ahead and eating
without me!

425
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm starving. Would
you pass me one of those
plates, please, Mr. Mason?

426
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,379
- Oh!
- What's the matter? Have you
just seen his handcuffs?

427
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:21,320
<i>I heard them</i>
<i>as soon as he came in.</i>

428
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,720
Uncle Philip,
he must be the man
they're looking for.

429
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:27,240
<i>Yes, very probably.</i>
But you should have
given him to the police!

430
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:30,280
Are you frightened, Pat?
Is that what makes you
so cruel?

431
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:32,776
<i>But you've got to!</i>
<i>He's a dangerous man.</i>

432
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,297
Oh, Pat, come on,
Mr. Mason may be many things,

433
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,601
but he's certainly
not dangerous.

434
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,905
In fact, I'm not at all
convinced that he's guilty.

435
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:43,624
Uncle Philip,
it's your duty as
an American citizen!

436
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,089
It is my duty
as a citizen...

437
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,610
to believe a man innocent
until he's been proved guilty.

438
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,702
<i>Don't tell me about my duty.</i>
<i>It makes you sound so stuffy.</i>

439
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,449
<i>Besides, I have my own ideas</i>
<i>about my duties as a citizen.</i>

440
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,298
<i>They sometimes involve</i>
<i>disregarding the law.</i>

441
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,378
But what are you
going to do with him?

442
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,777
I'm going to turn him over
to you, my dear.

443
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,754
<i>And you're going to drive him</i>
<i>down to Tim, the blacksmith,</i>

444
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:12,196
<i>and have those preposterous</i>
<i>contraptions removed</i>
<i>from his wrists.</i>

445
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:14,346
Oh, how could I do
a thing like that?

446
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:17,706
'Cause you know
I can see a great deal
farther than you can.

447
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:22,410
I can see intangible things.
For example, innocence.

448
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:25,194
<i>Will you go with my niece,</i>
<i>Mr. Mason?</i>
Oh, yes, sir.

449
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,626
Uh, if you don't mind?

450
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:31,718
What'll I tell the blacksmith?
<i>Tell him Mr. Mason</i>
<i>is my friend and my guest.</i>

451
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:35,787
He won't ask
any other questions.

452
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,979
Go ahead, Pat.

453
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,819
<i>Go with her, Barry.</i>
<i>Barry, I know, is your name.</i>

454
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,700
Your voice explained to me
that "Mason" isn't.

455
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:51,076
But as I told you before,
names are of such little
importance.

456
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,259
I... I don't know
how to thank you,
Mr. Martin.

457
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,596
Go ahead, Barry.
Go ahead.

458
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:59,597
And do the things
I wish I could do.

459
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:06,380
Good luck, Barry,
and for heaven's sake,

460
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:10,381
get back in practice
on that triangle!

461
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:18,094
Is the blacksmith's shop
very far?
Not very. Right along here.

462
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:22,668
And, uh, is he...
Is he really all right?

463
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:25,549
He and my uncle
are great friends.
Oh.

464
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,237
I guess he's all right,
then.

465
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,701
You needn't worry.
He's all right.

466
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:35,787
He's a darling blacksmith, only
I'm not sure how much experience
he's had with handcuffs.

467
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:38,286
Do you mind
if I see them?

468
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,005
I wonder...
I can't quite see.

469
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,493
Could you hold them
nearer?

470
00:35:44,494 --> 00:35:47,982
Now I feel better.
I'll bet you do.

471
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:49,902
I'll bet this
makes you feel great.

472
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:53,261
The blacksmith shop
is two miles back. We're
on our way to the police.

473
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,181
Your uncle's
gonna be proud of you!

474
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:58,542
The world isn't full
of kind old gentlemen.
You're gonna find that out.

475
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,198
Even my uncle wouldn't
have been so kind
if he'd known more.

476
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,910
All right, go ahead.
What'd I do?
I'd be happy to know.

477
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:08,111
If it had been any other crime...
if a man had stolen
because he was starving,

478
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:11,598
even committed murder
to defend himself, maybe I
wouldn't tell the police.

479
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,030
But there's only one reason
why a man commits sabotage.

480
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:18,031
That's worse than murder.
Surprise, Miss Martin.
I agree with every word.

481
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:22,064
Please
don't talk to me.
That'll be my pleasure.

482
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:27,408
Well! I'll see
that she doesn't!

483
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:47,151
Never try driving
this way; it hurts.

484
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:51,152
I'm stopping
the first car I see!

485
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,052
Help!
Come on. I can't get
along without you.

486
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:39,093
Let me go! Help!

487
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:42,196
Help!
Get the police!

488
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:45,716
Help!

489
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:49,717
My, they must be
terribly in love.

490
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:12,501
Looks as though this car
has been overheated.

491
00:39:12,502 --> 00:39:16,502
Fan's broken.

492
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,942
I'm cold.

493
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,943
Yeah, I know.
And you're hungry.
Now mostly I'm cold.

494
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,558
If you'd stop trying
to be a hero and decide
to be on my side,

495
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,438
maybe we could do something
about your being cold.

496
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,966
Build a fire?

497
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:38,679
No, I wasn't exactly
thinking of that.

498
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,879
Well, I didn't
want to insult you
by not even trying.

499
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,799
What do you want
to turn me in for?

500
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,454
Haven't you got
your picture
in enough places now?

501
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:49,302
I just want to do my duty.
That's hard for you
to understand.

502
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,863
Why won't you believe
I'm all right?
You don't make sense.

503
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,976
If you hadn't done it,
you would have gone
to the police.

504
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,271
It's a question of time!
It'd take weeks
to convince them.

505
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:00,119
If they're
as dumb as you are,
it'll take me months!

506
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,518
Do you think we're very far
from Soda City?

507
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,112
I don't know.
We'll ask
at the next town.

508
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,991
If there's a next town.

509
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:10,775
Anyway, I don't believe
that part about Tobin.

510
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:14,423
You don't believe it
because he's got
a big ranch and a pool...

511
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:17,688
No. It's just
hard to believe that
about any American.

512
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:20,568
Well, you believe it
about <i>me!</i>

513
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:23,960
Well, you're different.
You look like a saboteur.

514
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:27,961
You have a saboteur's
disposition.

515
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:35,512
Don't tell me
you've decided
to be on my side.

516
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:38,264
No, I'm cold.

517
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:40,601
Say, aren't you wasting
your very valuable time,

518
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:43,353
sitting up here
admiring the scenery?

519
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,328
Hey, look at that.

520
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:48,345
Looks like
we've got company.

521
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,032
<i>What do you suppose</i>
<i>all that's doing way up here?</i>

522
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,786
They aren't moving very fast,
are they?

523
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,761
You know what
we can do?

524
00:40:56,762 --> 00:41:00,762
Oh, no, you won't.

525
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,298
Sorry, I can't take a chance.

526
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:09,786
You're right.
I'll kill you the first
opportunity I get.

527
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:11,706
Let go of me!

528
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:14,585
Let me go!
Ouch!

529
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:18,586
Help! Help!

530
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,191
Won't you give me one break?
Wait 'til we get to Soda City?

531
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,946
All right.
I'm sorry I've got to
leave you here alone,

532
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,866
but I told you
what I've got to do.

533
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:30,875
There's only one thing
I want to warn you about.
Snakes.

534
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,851
There are a lot out here.
There's only five or six
poisonous kinds.

535
00:41:33,852 --> 00:41:37,852
But there are a lot
of long, slippery, slimy ones.

536
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:47,260
<i>- Barry!</i>
- I'm coming up in the world;
I'm better than the snakes.

537
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:49,851
<i>Barry, please!</i>
Are you with me?

538
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:53,852
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

539
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:59,099
What made you
change your mind?

540
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,660
I can't turn you in
if I'm stuck out there.

541
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:03,772
So that's it.
Go back with the reptiles.

542
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,653
Let me go!
<i>Who's there?</i>

543
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:09,148
<i>You've got no right here!</i>
<i>Stop it and get off!</i>

544
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,100
Now, now, Major.

545
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,020
Ah, stowaways.

546
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:16,380
In the middle of this
desert sea, we acquired
two more vagabonds.

547
00:42:16,381 --> 00:42:20,029
Bedouins like ourselves,
eh, Esmeralda?
They're just a couple of kids!

548
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,389
Uh, our car broke down,
and we've walked for miles.

549
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,501
We hopped on.
We didn't want to
wake you at this hour.

550
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,637
Broke down, eh?
We didn't pass no wrecks
on the highway.

551
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:32,445
- Sounds like a pack of lies.
- We were off on a side road.

552
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:36,788
<i>I know. A moonlight night</i>
<i>and a parked car. That's nice.</i>

553
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:41,533
- Oh, no, really...
- Esmeralda! Everywhere
you search for sex.

554
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,573
Get your eyes out of the mud
and look up at the stars.

555
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:48,917
Oh, I beg your pardon.
My name is Bones. I'm also
known as the Human Skeleton.

556
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:52,669
- How do you do?
- And this is Esmeralda,
our bearded lady.

557
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,646
Naturally, we're very proud
to have her as a member
of our group.

558
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,942
You must be tired.
Come on in and rest.

559
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,494
We're trying to get to
Soda City, a couple hundred
miles north, I think.

560
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:05,406
You won't get there
'til morning,
so make yourselves comfortable.

561
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:08,095
You must meet
our other coworker:

562
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:10,654
Titania,
our little human mountain.

563
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,862
A very great lady, indeed.

564
00:43:12,863 --> 00:43:14,815
How do you do?
<i>What's goes on there?</i>

565
00:43:14,816 --> 00:43:18,047
Oh, did we wake you?
Oh, I was awake.

566
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:22,718
I wish you'd tell Minnie to do
something about that insomnia.
I've been tossing and turning.

567
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,703
Tell Marigold to shut
her silly old face.

568
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:27,807
Are you girls
not speaking
to each other again?

569
00:43:27,808 --> 00:43:31,199
Marigold's mad
because I got her beau
away from her.

570
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,535
Kindly tell Minnie
I heard that last remark.

571
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:36,704
I wouldn't have
the gentleman as a gift.
A common novelty seeker!

572
00:43:36,705 --> 00:43:40,095
Girls! What
will our guests think?

573
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:44,123
Hey, he's cute!
You hear that?
There she goes again.

574
00:43:44,193 --> 00:43:46,208
<i>Stop your squabbling.</i>
<i>They're tired.</i>

575
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:50,878
<i>- They've been</i>
<i>walking for miles!</i>
- Nobody gave you a lift.

576
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:55,005
The normal are normally
coldhearted.
Get these tramps off!

577
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:56,992
A cold heart.

578
00:43:56,993 --> 00:44:00,064
I won't take no insults.
Get 'em off.

579
00:44:00,065 --> 00:44:03,200
Aw, Major, honey...
Don't "honey" me!
I've got a contract.

580
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:07,479
It provides for safe
transportation and don't say
nothing about hobos!

581
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,017
That's the police.
They must be looking
for somebody.

582
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,673
Who could they want?

583
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:19,490
Me, I guess.

584
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,722
Oh!
They came for you.

585
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:25,697
He has handcuffs on.
What do they
want you for?

586
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:28,225
- For something
somebody else did.

587
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:31,682
I don't believe he's
done anything wrong!
I'll go to bat for him anytime.

588
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:35,806
I've always told Minnie
she'd get mixed up with the
police if she wasn't careful.

589
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:51,298
They're starting to search
at the front.

590
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:53,858
Well, what are you waiting for?
Hand them over to the police.

591
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,779
He's perfectly right.
He's a little stinker.

592
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,267
Seems terrible, but it
would be terrible, too,
if we got into trouble.

593
00:44:59,268 --> 00:45:01,379
Bones, call the cops!
Just a minute,
Major.

594
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,017
In this situation I find
a parallel for the present
world predicament.

595
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:08,291
We stand defeated
at the outset.

596
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:13,027
You, Esmeralda, have sympathy,
yet you're willing
to remain passive.

597
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:17,369
I have a belief, and yet
I'm tempted to let myself
be overridden by force.

598
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:20,932
The rest of you,
with the exception
of this malignant jerk,

599
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:23,331
<i>are ignorant of the facts</i>
<i>and, therefore, confused.</i>

600
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:27,236
Thank heaven we're still
members of a democracy.
We'll vote.

601
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:29,988
<i>- I'm against voting!</i>
- Fascist!

602
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:34,365
You know how we stand so far.
The twins, as usual,
are on opposite sides.

603
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:37,124
And so their votes pair.

604
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:41,183
Titania's on
both sides at once
and, therefore, neutral.

605
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:43,492
<i>The major is for</i>
<i>delivering these people</i>
<i>to the police,</i>

606
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,764
and I, frankly,
am against it.

607
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:48,996
Esmeralda, the decision
is up to you.

608
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,780
I don't want any trouble
any more than anybody else,

609
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,500
but while you've been talking,
I've been looking at something...

610
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,966
something pretty fine too.

611
00:45:56,967 --> 00:46:01,244
I've been looking
at that little girl standin'
beside that poor man.

612
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,517
Never a word.
Never a question.

613
00:46:04,518 --> 00:46:09,058
<i>Takin' everything</i>
<i>he's had to take,</i>
<i>stringin' along with him.</i>

614
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:13,404
<i>And I've been thinking,</i>
<i>it's the</i> good <i>people that stick</i>
<i>when anybody's in trouble,</i>

615
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,197
<i>and there aren't many</i>
<i>good people in the world.</i>

616
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:19,973
<i>I think that we, all of us,</i>
<i>know that better than most.</i>

617
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:22,854
<i>It isn't something</i>
<i>you see every day</i>
<i>of the week.</i>

618
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:25,830
- So I vote...
- We don't give them up.
Good girl, Esmeralda!

619
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:27,750
This is subversive!
I won't stand for it!

620
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,237
Oh, no, you don't!
You'll abide by the will
of the majority.

621
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:34,278
Back in your places
and pretend to be asleep.
That's all you have to do.

622
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:38,279
Here, you sit here.
Come on, young man.
We've got to hide you.

623
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:43,845
Turn all the lights off.
Here. Take off your coat
and put this on.

624
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:52,039
Come on.
Wake up in there!

625
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,527
Hey, what is this?
Halloween?
<i>Police.</i>

626
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:58,279
Is that so? Haven't you got
anything better to do...

627
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,800
than waking up
law-abiding citizens
in the middle of the night?

628
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,816
<i>We're lookin' for a man</i>
<i>and his woman companion.</i>

629
00:47:03,817 --> 00:47:07,015
<i>He's got dark hair,</i>
<i>between the ages</i>
<i>of 20 and 25.</i>

630
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:09,288
<i>The dame's supposed</i>
<i>to be good-lookin'.</i>
<i>Have you seen him?</i>

631
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:13,289
Now, where would I see anybody
as normal as that?

632
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,792
<i>Who's this?</i>
<i>Doesn't look like</i>
<i>one of your troupe.</i>

633
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:25,993
<i>Sure, she's one of us.</i>
<i>She's our little snake charmer.</i>

634
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:30,598
<i>Right now, she's sitting</i>
<i>on a box of snakes</i>
<i>so they don't get lonesome.</i>

635
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:33,577
<i>Can you imagine that?</i>
<i>A good-lookin' gal too.</i>

636
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,809
<i>Well, I guess you can</i>
<i>all go back to sleep now.</i>

637
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,810
<i>A snake charmer!</i>
<i>Well, well. You never</i>
<i>can tell about women.</i>

638
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:51,402
It's all right.
You can come out now.

639
00:47:54,698 --> 00:47:58,698
Wait, Justice, come back!
Sit down here!
We're on our way.

640
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:03,178
I don't know
how I can thank you, sir.
It's all right, my boy.

641
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,225
Gives you a good feeling
when you can help somebody.

642
00:48:05,226 --> 00:48:07,753
You've got a right to know
what this is about.
It's all right.

643
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:11,846
If that little girl
can trust you,
I guess we can.

644
00:48:11,915 --> 00:48:14,218
The baby!
She's had a tough time.

645
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:17,354
Poor little girl.
She's worn out.
I'll take care of her.

646
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:21,194
Come on. Let's go.

647
00:48:21,195 --> 00:48:24,715
Better let the snakes
get some sleep.

648
00:48:24,716 --> 00:48:28,716
They have to look good
tomorrow.

649
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:46,347
I'm sorry.

650
00:48:46,348 --> 00:48:50,348
What for?
For being such a dope.
I was scared.

651
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:54,699
You'd have been a dope
if you <i>hadn't</i> been scared.

652
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,515
You're tired;
that's all that's
the matter with you.

653
00:48:57,516 --> 00:48:59,660
Get some sleep.
You'll be fine.

654
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:02,348
I can go to sleep,
all right.

655
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:06,349
I'm so tired.

656
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,716
I want to tell you
something.

657
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:12,620
I believe you.

658
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:15,500
Do you, Pat?

659
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:17,420
You didn't, you know.

660
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,388
It's a free country.
A girl can change
her mind, can't she?

661
00:49:21,389 --> 00:49:23,949
Sure, she can.

662
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:26,829
Thank you, Pat.

663
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,421
They made me so ashamed.

664
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:31,789
They're so nice
and trusting.

665
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,805
They're
wonderful people,

666
00:49:33,806 --> 00:49:36,654
all except that
nasty little major
and that...

667
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:40,655
mean twin.

668
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:44,813
I don't suppose
you can really blame
the fat lady, though,

669
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:48,814
when a woman has lost
her figure that way.

670
00:50:37,265 --> 00:50:39,184
Welcome to Soda City.

671
00:50:39,185 --> 00:50:43,185
The heart
of the bicarbonate belt.

672
00:50:46,737 --> 00:50:50,737
Well, we might as well
do the town.

673
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:14,065
There's nothing here.
Come on.

674
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,721
I suppose we are a little late.

675
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:20,689
Sorry, darling.
I knew I shouldn't
have brought you here.

676
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,865
I'm not complaining.

677
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:27,242
This is great, isn't it?
The solution
to all my problems.

678
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:29,713
I was counting
on this place.

679
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:33,714
A dump like this,
5,000 miles from nowhere.

680
00:52:02,548 --> 00:52:06,548
Look at this.
It's been in use.

681
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:11,828
Let's go around
to the window.

682
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:20,533
<i>Careful!</i>
<i>Don't cut yourself.</i>

683
00:52:36,212 --> 00:52:39,829
Hello? Hello?

684
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,228
Hung up.
What sort of phone
is that?

685
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:46,229
It's a field telephone.

686
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,644
Well, a room with a view.

687
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:02,672
What do you suppose
they cut that for?
I don't know.

688
00:53:02,742 --> 00:53:05,205
Say, look.

689
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:09,077
Tripod.

690
00:53:09,078 --> 00:53:11,317
Looks like it's
the right height.

691
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:13,525
Yeah.

692
00:53:13,526 --> 00:53:17,526
Something else
goes with this.

693
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:21,591
There!

694
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,199
That's it.

695
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:38,775
<i>See anything?</i>
<i>Not yet.</i>

696
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:40,695
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

697
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:44,696
Let me see!

698
00:53:46,936 --> 00:53:50,936
Why, that's a...
Why, Barry!
Yeah.

699
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Better put this away.
Take that.

700
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:02,776
- Say! The wood.
- What about it?

701
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,856
You wouldn't burn that.
Why not?

702
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:08,857
The smoke would show.

703
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:19,513
That's a car.

704
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:23,769
You better hide.
No, not here.

705
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:45,273
Hey. What d'you think
you're doin' around here?

706
00:54:45,274 --> 00:54:49,209
I, uh... I was wonderin'
when you'd get here.
Where you from?

707
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,994
<i>What are you stickin'</i>
<i>around here for?</i>

708
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:55,995
Excuse me.

709
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:14,966
Funny, you knowin'
about this place.
I don't quite get it.

710
00:55:15,035 --> 00:55:17,242
You might have
thought it over
more carefully.

711
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:19,418
Your coming here
doesn't help us a bit.

712
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:22,298
<i>The heat's on this guy,</i>
<i>and he shows up here.</i>

713
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:25,915
Tobin sent me.
<i>The old man must be off his nut</i>
<i>sending him up here.</i>

714
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:30,073
Be a little more careful,
Neilson. Your criticisms
in front of other people.

715
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,646
- Yeah. Don't talk that
way about the old guy.
- I'll watch out for myself.

716
00:55:34,715 --> 00:55:37,402
Me too. Don't forget about me.
That's why Tobin sent me here.

717
00:55:37,403 --> 00:55:41,180
He said you'd know
how to take care of me.

718
00:55:41,181 --> 00:55:43,163
I guess that makes it
pretty clear, Neilson.

719
00:55:43,164 --> 00:55:46,491
<i>I don't know. A guy walks in,</i>
<i>and right away I get orders.</i>

720
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:48,411
It ain't so clear to me.

721
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:51,132
I'm a little better
than a stranger, if you'll
remember my clippings!

722
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:55,508
Yes. Mister, uh, Kane
has done pretty well
down south.

723
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:59,260
His accomplishments
can't be disregarded.
At least I hope not.

724
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:02,300
<i>A man that has served</i>
<i>as well as he has</i>
<i>is entitled to recognition.</i>

725
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:05,821
More than that... protection.
You guys have got to
take care of me.

726
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:09,500
The firm will do its best.
They're quite loyal
to their employees.

727
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:12,092
Neilson will see that
the firm's record
is maintained.

728
00:56:12,093 --> 00:56:15,484
You got it easy,
you guys from back East.

729
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,524
You give orders.
You do that, all right.

730
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:22,012
The big boys
with the desk jobs.

731
00:56:22,013 --> 00:56:24,829
All you gotta do is reach
for a telephone, sit back,

732
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,484
and us guys out here
have gotta take the rap.

733
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,949
I think I'll go back East
for a while.

734
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,477
<i>You're not a very good</i>
<i>example of loyalty.</i>

735
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:35,709
<i>Yeah? Well, I'm gettin'</i>
<i>just a little bit tired. See?</i>

736
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,397
So am I!
Let's get goin'!

737
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:41,278
The trip here was no pushover.
I had to hoof it
most of the way.

738
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:44,670
I got no place to hide you out.
That ain't my line.

739
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:46,846
That ain't your line, huh?

740
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,086
What about you? You don't
seem so interested either!

741
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:52,349
I suppose you're just
the big brains! Or maybe you
take a chance just for laughs!

742
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,518
Maybe it doesn't work that way.
Maybe I'm the only guy that
sticks his neck out!

743
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:58,079
Well, get this!
I pulled a big job,
and they're after me!

744
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,214
<i>And you guys have gotta</i>
<i>take care of me, or you're</i>
<i>gonna have some trouble!</i>

745
00:57:01,215 --> 00:57:04,414
I've gotta get out of this part
of the country! The ground's
burning up under my feet!

746
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:08,415
I've gotta get back East!
It's more crowded and a guy
doesn't stand out, like here!

747
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,070
Take it easy.
Hang onto your nerve.

748
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:14,143
I've been hanging on
long enough!

749
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:17,439
<i>I understand your difficulties,</i>
<i>but in this business...</i>

750
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,647
we always have to make sure.

751
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:22,143
I think I know him now.

752
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:25,759
I'm driving back East.
You'd better come with me.
All right.

753
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,415
Let's get goin'.
Get all the things together.

754
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,456
After we leave,
I want this place cleaned up.
You won't be coming back here.

755
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:33,376
Why not?
You think they got
the place spotted?

756
00:57:33,377 --> 00:57:37,024
I'm making sure.
You'll have to find another
place and store all this stuff.

757
00:57:37,025 --> 00:57:41,280
It's not gonna be easy.
If you can't handle it,
I'll have to get someone else.

758
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:43,264
All right.
I'll handle it.

759
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:45,985
You'll need
some clothes.
Size 42.

760
00:57:45,986 --> 00:57:48,320
What'll we do about these?

761
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:51,456
How did you manage
to break them?
On an automobile fan.

762
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:54,880
Very bright of you.
I think we can even
take care of that.

763
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:58,016
But let's get started
now.

764
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:00,225
Did you hear
something?

765
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,464
Where does that
lead to?
Just another room.

766
00:58:02,465 --> 00:58:06,465
The way out.

767
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:31,137
We figure that Kane
and the other fellows are
probably headin' for New York.

768
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:35,203
If there's anything
I can do.
We sure appreciate that.

769
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:37,922
Why, anyone would have
done the same thing.
That's right.

770
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:41,410
This war sure makes
a difference. Everybody
wants to get in and pitch.

771
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,619
Now, if you'll give me
your address in New York,
Miss Martin,

772
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,730
we can contact you
back there.

773
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,290
Or maybe you could wire me
which plane you're taking.

774
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,274
We may want
to get ahold of you fast.

775
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:54,334
I can do that when I
get back to my uncle.
Okay. Just keep in touch.

776
00:58:57,348 --> 00:59:00,131
I'm glad we came this way.
It adds a few miles,

777
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:02,946
but I've become
a little sentimental.

778
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:05,122
I want to take
a last look at it.

779
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:08,931
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>
<i>A great monument</i>
<i>to man's industry...</i>

780
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:12,547
and his stubborn
faith in the future.

781
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:16,451
You'll be moving along soon.
Are you carrying any cameras
or firearms at all?

782
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,691
Nothing at all,
Officer.
You, sir?

783
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,612
No, sir.

784
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:23,044
They must get a lot of power
from this dam.

785
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:27,045
<i>I think it supplies about 75%</i>
<i>for the Los Angeles district,</i>

786
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:30,628
including most of the power
for the defense plants.

787
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:33,764
Do you think there's...
Do you know Tobin
very well?

788
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:37,124
No. I met him just that once
at his ranch.
Did he have the child with him?

789
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:40,324
His grandchild?
Yes. He seemed to be
very fond of her.

790
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:43,236
Yes. That's one
of the things I like
about old Tobin:

791
00:59:43,237 --> 00:59:45,381
his love
for that little girl.

792
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,389
Evidence
of a good heart.

793
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:50,469
I have children too,
you know?
Oh?

794
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:54,528
Two boys.
Nice little fellows.
Aged two and four.

795
00:59:54,597 --> 00:59:56,742
The four-year-old
is naughty at times.

796
00:59:56,743 --> 00:59:58,661
He's quite a problem.

797
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:03,878
We get him a new toy
and within half an hour
it's smashed to bits.

798
01:00:03,942 --> 01:00:07,878
And then, sometimes,
after it's all over,

799
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:11,334
he seems almost sorry.

800
01:00:11,335 --> 01:00:14,341
Sometimes I wish
my younger child
had been a girl.

801
01:00:14,342 --> 01:00:18,498
In fact, my wife and I
argue over a little
idiosyncrasy I have.

802
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:21,126
I don't want
his hair cut short
until he's much older.

803
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:24,038
Do you think
it'd be bad for him?
It might be.

804
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,494
When I was a child,
I had long golden curls.

805
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:29,894
People used to stop
to admire me.

806
01:00:29,895 --> 01:00:33,895
Things are different nowadays.
A haircut might save him
a lot of grief.

807
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:39,015
Ah, we're on our way.

808
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:30,821
Drive to 401
instead of the office.
Okay.

809
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:39,688
Anything wrong?
I've just called the office.
They've disconnected the phone.

810
01:01:39,754 --> 01:01:43,780
Same old phone company.
Should've paid the bill.
This is no time for jokes!

811
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:47,658
The police.
They're watching the office.
The phone is our signal.

812
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:50,057
Think they're watching
for me?
I don't know.

813
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:52,521
Who'd know you
were in New York?

814
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:56,522
Yeah.
I guess you're right.

815
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,626
How about Brooklyn tomorrow?
Do you want me on the job?

816
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:05,865
When are you gonna learn
to keep your mouth shut?

817
01:02:05,866 --> 01:02:08,649
Sorry. I-I thought
he was in on it.
Shut up.

818
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,730
It's all right.
I'm good at keeping secrets.

819
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:14,731
Let's go.

820
01:02:23,276 --> 01:02:27,276
Mr. Freeman.

821
01:02:45,964 --> 01:02:48,844
Hi, Mr. Freeman.
Hello.

822
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:52,139
Ah, pleased to see you.
Have a good trip?

823
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,916
Yes. Thank you, Robert.
Madam is upstairs.
She's waiting anxiously.

824
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:58,155
Oh, thank you, Robert.
We'll go right up.

825
01:02:58,156 --> 01:03:01,196
This way.

826
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:05,197
Who was that?

827
01:03:07,469 --> 01:03:09,612
Hey, is this a hotel?
What's the festivity?

828
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:14,316
<i>It's for a very worthy cause.</i>
<i>Mrs. Sutton often gives her</i>
<i>house over to charity affairs.</i>

829
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:19,083
She's a very generous woman,
but she isn't going to be
pleased to see us.

830
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,592
<i>Idiots, all of you.</i>
<i>Stupid, inefficient idiots.</i>

831
01:03:27,662 --> 01:03:31,244
<i>Everything is left to me.</i>
<i>I have to hover over you</i>
<i>like an old hen.</i>

832
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,413
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.
The guests expect me
to put in an appearance.

833
01:03:34,414 --> 01:03:37,965
<i>As you say, they want</i>
<i>something for their $25!</i>

834
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:40,717
I will not have
my benevolence abused.

835
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:44,493
My life, my position...
they're important to me.

836
01:03:44,494 --> 01:03:48,521
I'll do my best.
I wish your best
were a little better.

837
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,758
Oh. Mr. Freeman.
I'm glad you've come
at this time.

838
01:03:51,759 --> 01:03:55,310
<i>I was just telling Edward...</i>
<i>Is this the young man?</i>

839
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:58,637
<i>Must you bring him here?</i>
<i>I certainly can't furnish</i>
him <i>with sanctuary.</i>

840
01:03:58,638 --> 01:04:01,774
This house is full of guests,
important people!

841
01:04:01,775 --> 01:04:06,892
Don't you understand?
The police are already
watching your office.

842
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,083
Thank goodness they'll never
come here. But a little more
of your stupid behavior,

843
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:14,063
and even the respectability
of my house won't shield you.

844
01:04:14,064 --> 01:04:15,983
I'm sorry. We can't
leave any loose ends.

845
01:04:15,984 --> 01:04:20,042
All right!
But for heaven's sake, stop
playing the conspirator.

846
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:23,728
Now tell me all you know
about the girl, or ask him.

847
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:27,568
Why didn't you tell me
about the young lady
back in Soda City?

848
01:04:27,569 --> 01:04:30,256
Well, I didn't think
it was important.

849
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:34,697
She was just a girl.
She picked me up.
She was pretty.

850
01:04:34,768 --> 01:04:36,752
I guess
it was kind of risky.

851
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:38,992
Well, there you are.

852
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:42,256
<i>I'm so sorry</i>
<i>to have exposed you to any risk.</i>

853
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,848
What's she doing here?

854
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:48,560
<i>You're surprised</i>
<i>to see me again.</i>
How did you get here?

855
01:04:48,561 --> 01:04:52,400
<i>It doesn't matter. There was</i>
<i>no reason to bring her at all!</i>

856
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:54,768
You see, I just learned
on the telephone
at the gas station...

857
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:57,808
<i>that she was most indiscreet</i>
<i>after she left you at Soda City.</i>

858
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:01,713
She went to the sheriff,
who, fortunately, happened
to be a good friend of ours.

859
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,176
Don't waste time
in explanations.

860
01:05:04,177 --> 01:05:07,121
<i>You've got to get the girl</i>
<i>out of this house.</i>

861
01:05:07,122 --> 01:05:09,361
<i>I will not have</i>
<i>my benevolence abused!</i>

862
01:05:09,362 --> 01:05:13,233
So you played smart.
That's great. That's
a big help to all of us.

863
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:16,338
No, I wasn't smart at all.

864
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:20,878
<i>I haven't been smart</i>
<i>for four days. Even when I went</i>
<i>to the sheriff, I hesitated.</i>

865
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:23,185
I hated to do anything that
might get you into trouble.

866
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:26,514
Yeah, I sympathize.
The mistake I made was not
leaving you with the snakes!

867
01:05:26,515 --> 01:05:28,977
<i>You might have</i>
<i>learned to rattle.</i>
I was right about you.

868
01:05:28,978 --> 01:05:32,978
<i>Good evening, Mr. Kane.</i>

869
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,953
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>you were a bookworm.</i>

870
01:05:35,954 --> 01:05:40,592
You must let me choose
something appropriate for you.
Something not too difficult.

871
01:05:40,659 --> 01:05:44,659
Let me see.

872
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:49,042
Here we are.
This'll do admirably.

873
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:52,563
Remarkable work.
Somehow prophetic.

874
01:05:52,564 --> 01:05:56,688
Why are you here, Charles?
What's all this nonsense
about books?

875
01:05:56,756 --> 01:05:58,802
I am a refugee.

876
01:05:58,803 --> 01:06:02,739
I have at last joined
that revolting group
of world travelers.

877
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,766
One ultimately
turns into the thing
one despises most.

878
01:06:06,836 --> 01:06:10,099
And whom have I
to thank for it?
You, Mr. Freeman.

879
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,147
The girl was allowed
to escape unobserved.

880
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:14,644
She left Mr. Kane,
went straight to her uncle.

881
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:17,555
That charming old man
went to the police.

882
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,852
As a result, a whole hoard
of officers came to my house.

883
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:23,411
Luckily, I was leaving
when they arrived.

884
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,421
And the others...
the very loyal ones...

885
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:29,748
Well, they're paying
for their loyalty.
How appalling!

886
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:32,564
Your charming house.
I'm so sorry, Charles.

887
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:35,540
Rather lucky.
You might have
been sorrier.

888
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:38,708
And you might have
been more efficient,
Mr. Freeman.

889
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:41,940
What good is it to insult me?
We're in trouble now.

890
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:45,908
So the most important thing
is to make sure of everyone
around us.

891
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:49,236
<i>Mr. Kane. I'm just not sure.</i>
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>that he's all right.</i>

892
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:52,245
<i>All right?</i>
<i>What an understatement.</i>

893
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:54,229
<i>He's much more than that!</i>

894
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:57,429
He's noble
and fine and pure.

895
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,488
So he pays the penalty
that the noble must pay
in this world:

896
01:07:01,557 --> 01:07:03,702
he's misjudged by everyone.

897
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:07,542
Why, even the police
have a completely erroneous
impression of him.

898
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:11,029
I can assure you that,
contrary to what is supposed,

899
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,621
and to what he
may have told you,

900
01:07:13,622 --> 01:07:16,406
that young man is certainly
not one of his country's
enemies.

901
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,406
<i>Charles, youre joking!</i>
<i>I mean exactly what I say.</i>

902
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:23,606
<i>Mr. Kane is definitely no part</i>
<i>of our little organization.</i>

903
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:27,607
Your protg. Well,
you've done splendidly.
You bring him here, you idiot!

904
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,198
<i>What in heaven's name</i>
<i>are we going to do with him?</i>

905
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:32,663
That's a very appropriate
question.

906
01:07:32,664 --> 01:07:36,919
Not much we <i>can</i> do with him.
I made the mistake once of
turning him over to the police.

907
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:41,174
That's even more impossible
at the moment.

908
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,680
I'm afraid there's only
one thing we can do.

909
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:49,975
You see, the new law
threatens all...

910
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,439
of <i>us...</i>
with the death penalty.

911
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,695
So I'm afraid we'll have to
apply the ancient axiom:
a tooth for a tooth.

912
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,679
A Kane for a Tobin.

913
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,887
Please don't discuss things
of that sort here.

914
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:04,120
It's rather nauseating
and out of place.

915
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,543
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.

916
01:08:07,544 --> 01:08:10,871
We must take all precaution.
Of course. We must also
continue with our work.

917
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:14,872
It's too risky now.
We're abandoning the dam.
We must remain inactive.

918
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:18,616
Inactive? You are utterly
mistaken. Once we do that,
our organization is finished.

919
01:08:18,617 --> 01:08:21,432
- We must carry on.
- What about tomorrow's
work?

920
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:24,888
Tomorrow's work?
You can't abandon that.
But the risk!

921
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:27,321
Is great.
I know that.

922
01:08:27,322 --> 01:08:31,380
Unfortunately, we will have
to carry out our orders.

923
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:34,553
I'm leaving
for the Caribbean now.

924
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:37,816
My position here
is more impossible
than all of yours.

925
01:08:37,817 --> 01:08:41,305
I'm rather looking forward
to Central America.

926
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:44,025
Havana will be very gay
this season.

927
01:08:44,026 --> 01:08:47,353
Somehow I've suddenly
had enough of this country.

928
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:49,657
The war has made it grim.

929
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:53,210
You're leaving us here
to face everything,
and you'll be on a boat.

930
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:55,130
It all sounds idyllic.

931
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:59,473
Oh, Charles.
It's... This whole thing...
It's impossible!

932
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:03,546
It's panicky.
I'm deeply sorry.

933
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:07,986
<i>Ah, there you are!</i>
<i>How unbecoming for a hostess</i>
<i>to hide herself away.</i>

934
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:12,057
Am I intruding? I just
must kidnap Henrietta.
She'll be back.

935
01:09:12,058 --> 01:09:15,611
I've had some trouble
with these people.
They're doing the catering.

936
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:18,651
Our boy will appear
any minute with the caviar!
I assure you!

937
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:20,954
<i>Don't be a fool!</i>
<i>Get to the house phone.</i>

938
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:23,642
<i>How'd you get here?</i>
They met me at the airport.
I thought they were the police.

939
01:09:23,643 --> 01:09:27,515
Wait a minute.
No use trying the way
I came in.

940
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:30,843
Let's walk right out
through the front door!
Might as well.

941
01:09:30,844 --> 01:09:34,844
Yes, sir. We'll
watch the back exit.
They won't get out.

942
01:09:42,684 --> 01:09:47,354
No good. See the one on the
other side? He's one of them.
We'll never get out that way.

943
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:50,908
What can they do?
Plenty. They'd grab us.
We wouldn't have a chance.

944
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:54,780
These people would see them.
If anyone had a question,
we're gate crashers.

945
01:09:54,781 --> 01:09:56,956
Barry, this is awful.

946
01:09:56,957 --> 01:10:00,475
It's like a bad dream.
All these people. Isn't
there anyone we can trust?

947
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:04,476
Sure. All of them.
Only which one?

948
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:13,372
Excuse me. Uh, this may
sound sort of crazy.

949
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:15,868
I don't even know
how to start.

950
01:10:15,869 --> 01:10:19,677
But this whole house
is a hotbed of spies
and saboteurs.

951
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:22,205
<i>I'm not being silly.</i>
<i>Even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.</i>

952
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:25,565
What's the matter
with you, sir?
You're drunk.

953
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:29,566
You're not even dressed.

954
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,406
What'd he say?
He thinks I'm drunk.

955
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:36,797
When I read in the papers
what those Japs are doing...

956
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:40,253
<i>Beat it out!</i>
<i>Eight to the bar.</i>

957
01:10:40,254 --> 01:10:42,814
Yeah, man.
Stay in there and pitch.

958
01:10:42,815 --> 01:10:46,557
Pardon me. Did you pay $25
to get in here tonight?

959
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:48,606
No, not exactly.
The boss gave me a ticket.
Why?

960
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:52,221
I need your help. We're among
the biggest bunch of fifth
columnists in this country.

961
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:54,910
Are you kiddin'?
What's the gag?
No. I'm on the level.

962
01:10:54,911 --> 01:10:58,111
Aw, you're kiddin'.
The guy's tryin' to rib me.

963
01:10:58,112 --> 01:11:02,421
Aw, sling him
your curve.
Beat it out, son.

964
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,079
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to talk to you
about something very important.

965
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,126
What is it, Mr. Kane?

966
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:18,880
<i>You know it's hopeless.</i>

967
01:11:18,881 --> 01:11:22,720
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>join Mr. Tobin upstairs</i>
<i>in a little supper?</i>

968
01:11:22,721 --> 01:11:26,721
I'll show you the way.

969
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:53,980
Barry, before they get to us,
stop the music and tell them!
Tell them all.

970
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:57,729
This is the Sutton mansion.
I'm just a guy from California
wanted by the police.

971
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,680
They'll grab me
as soon as I open my mouth.

972
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:04,056
What are you gonna do?
We can't just stand here.
I know where we'll be safe.

973
01:12:07,682 --> 01:12:10,081
Barry, I'm scared.

974
01:12:10,082 --> 01:12:13,441
It's so unreal,
all these people dancing
and having a good time.

975
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:15,553
And when you try
to warn them,
they laugh at you.

976
01:12:15,554 --> 01:12:20,257
They think you're drunk.
That man you spoke to seemed
like such an honest citizen.

977
01:12:20,323 --> 01:12:24,862
Mmm, just a friend
of the family. The room's
well-sprinkled with them.

978
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:26,913
They're so smart.
That's what frightens me.

979
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:29,121
Yeah, they're smart,
because they're ruthless.

980
01:12:29,122 --> 01:12:32,002
It's easy to win when you
forget about the rules.

981
01:12:32,003 --> 01:12:35,074
A man named Fry drops
a wallet in California,

982
01:12:35,075 --> 01:12:37,153
and we wind up here,
you and me.

983
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:39,106
That's the only good part:
I'm with you.

984
01:12:39,107 --> 01:12:42,691
I wish it were somewhere else.
The North Pole.
I wouldn't care.

985
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:47,001
We might wind up there too,
chasing Fry over a glacier!

986
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:51,232
Fry. He seems so small now.
I'd forgotten about him.

987
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,474
So had I.

988
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:57,475
We can't just go on dancing
like it's Saturday night
at the Palladium.

989
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,523
We can't just wait
'til they get us.

990
01:12:59,524 --> 01:13:01,603
What do you think
they'll really do?

991
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:04,642
They're probably
haggling over the price
with Murder, Incorporated.

992
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:09,532
Oh, Barry, please!
Sorry. I hate to be out of it.
There's still so much to do.

993
01:13:09,604 --> 01:13:12,675
If staying alive
was ever important.
You heard what they said.

994
01:13:12,676 --> 01:13:14,915
Something about a job
tomorrow in Brooklyn.

995
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,955
The navy yard.
One of us has got
to get out of here.

996
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:20,036
Maybe if I start something,
you can make a break for it.

997
01:13:20,037 --> 01:13:23,364
What about you?
You can't worry about me.
We've gotta take a chance.

998
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,788
Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have
met you a hundred years ago?

999
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:29,124
On a beach somewhere.

1000
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:32,996
Bathing suits
looked awfully funny
a hundred years ago.

1001
01:13:32,997 --> 01:13:36,997
I'll bet you'd look
beautiful, though.

1002
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,349
Afraid we're not behaving
very well.

1003
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:49,350
What's the difference?
We weren't invited anyway.

1004
01:13:54,885 --> 01:13:58,117
Pat, this moment
belongs to me.

1005
01:13:58,118 --> 01:14:01,382
No matter what happens,
they can never take it away
from me.

1006
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:05,383
<i>Oh, pardon me.</i>
<i>Do you mind?</i>

1007
01:14:13,222 --> 01:14:16,486
Oh, excuse me.
Would you, uh...
Would you care to dance?

1008
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:20,486
Why, yes. Certainly.

1009
01:14:20,487 --> 01:14:22,438
Oh, you're really
a much better dancer.

1010
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:24,838
Thanks. Who was the man
you were dancing with?

1011
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:27,110
I have no idea.
I never saw him before.

1012
01:14:27,111 --> 01:14:29,126
No, I mean the man
that just left you.

1013
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:33,127
I know. I never saw him
before in my life.

1014
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:43,782
Oh, what a pity.
That was lovely. I hope
you will ask me again.

1015
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:47,783
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1016
01:14:50,184 --> 01:14:53,575
Well, young man, you seem
to be enjoying yourself.
Charming party, isn't it?

1017
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:57,576
Where is she?
Your young lady? I thought
you were taking care of her.

1018
01:14:57,641 --> 01:15:00,936
Perhaps she has a headache
and is lying down somewhere.

1019
01:15:00,937 --> 01:15:04,263
Would you like to come
with me and look for her?

1020
01:15:04,264 --> 01:15:08,264
Hold on.

1021
01:15:14,633 --> 01:15:16,808
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen!

1022
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:19,624
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1023
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,985
I-I have something
to tell you.

1024
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:27,077
Something you ought to know
about this house
and about your hostess.

1025
01:15:33,354 --> 01:15:37,445
Sir, before you go on,
take a look at the curtain
on the balcony.

1026
01:15:52,906 --> 01:15:56,905
I'm, uh, not much
of a public speaker,

1027
01:15:56,906 --> 01:15:59,914
ladies and gentlemen,
and, uh,

1028
01:15:59,915 --> 01:16:03,113
some of you are probably
wondering how I can tell you
anything about your hostess...

1029
01:16:03,114 --> 01:16:06,538
that you, uh,
you don't already know...

1030
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,282
<i>her graciousness,</i>

1031
01:16:10,283 --> 01:16:12,395
<i>her kindness,</i>
<i>her many charities.</i>

1032
01:16:12,396 --> 01:16:17,316
Well, I want to tell you that
you have a big surprise coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

1033
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:23,114
Tonight, in this house,
for the benefit
of this great cause...

1034
01:16:23,115 --> 01:16:25,034
for which she's
already done so much,

1035
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:28,586
<i>our hostess, Mrs. Sutton,</i>
<i>is putting up</i>
<i>for auction...</i>

1036
01:16:28,587 --> 01:16:31,050
<i>one of her most treasured</i>
<i>possessions,</i>

1037
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:35,051
<i>one of the famous</i>
<i>Sutton jewels.</i>

1038
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:50,317
Mrs. Sutton, would you
kindly step forward?

1039
01:16:57,773 --> 01:17:01,773
- Thank you.
- Mr. Kane, the young lady
is asking to see you.

1040
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:05,837
Are you sure?
I wouldn't keep her waiting
if I were you, sir.

1041
01:17:08,236 --> 01:17:10,317
Yes. Uh...

1042
01:17:10,318 --> 01:17:14,318
Will someone please, uh,
uh... Admiral?

1043
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:18,350
<i>Would you take over</i>
<i>for me, please?</i>
<i>I'm wanted on the phone.</i>

1044
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:23,469
Delighted, sir.
Thank you.

1045
01:17:24,047 --> 01:17:28,236
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I will entertain your bids</i>
<i>for this beautiful bracelet...</i>

1046
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:31,181
<i>which has been donated</i>
<i>by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.</i>

1047
01:17:31,182 --> 01:17:33,389
<i>What am I bid?</i>
One thousand dollars.

1048
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:36,077
<i>One thousand dollars</i>
<i>has been bid.</i>
<i>Do I have any more?</i>

1049
01:17:36,078 --> 01:17:39,694
Fifteen hundred.
<i>Fifteen hundred dollars.</i>

1050
01:17:39,695 --> 01:17:42,445
1,750.
<i>$1,750.</i>

1051
01:17:42,446 --> 01:17:46,446
<i>Two thousand.</i>
<i> Two thousand.</i>

1052
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:52,590
Where is she?

1053
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:55,982
You seem to have a soft spot
for that young lady.

1054
01:17:55,983 --> 01:17:58,157
You can't afford to make
yourself that vulnerable,

1055
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,879
not when you're out trying
to save your country.

1056
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,735
You sneer every time you refer
to this country. You've done
well here. I don't get it.

1057
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:09,806
No, you wouldn't.
You're one of the ardent
believers, a good American.

1058
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:13,391
Millions like you plod along
without asking questions.

1059
01:18:13,392 --> 01:18:17,582
I hate to use the word <i>stupid,</i>
but it seems to be the one
that applies.

1060
01:18:17,648 --> 01:18:21,804
The great masses,
the moron millions.

1061
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:25,263
Well, there are a few of us
who are unwilling to just
troop along;

1062
01:18:25,264 --> 01:18:28,655
a few who are clever enough
to see that there's
much more to be done...

1063
01:18:28,656 --> 01:18:31,983
than just live small,
complacent lives;

1064
01:18:31,984 --> 01:18:36,076
a few of us who desire
a more profitable type
of government.

1065
01:18:37,105 --> 01:18:39,792
When you think about it,
Mr. Kane,

1066
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:43,760
the competence
of totalitarian nations
is much higher than ours.

1067
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,680
They get things done.

1068
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:49,169
Yeah. They get things done.

1069
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:51,280
They bomb cities,
sink ships,
torture and murder...

1070
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:54,608
so you can eat
off a gold plate;
it's a great philosophy.

1071
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:58,256
I neither intend
to be bombed nor sunk,
Mr. Kane.

1072
01:18:58,257 --> 01:19:00,401
That's why I'm leaving now.

1073
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:05,258
And if things don't
go right for you...
If, uh, <i>we</i> should win...

1074
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,249
then I'll come back.

1075
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:11,088
Perhaps I can get
what I want then: power.

1076
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:14,898
Yes. I want that as much
as you want your comfort
or your job...

1077
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:17,169
or that girl.

1078
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:20,785
We all have different tastes,
as you can see.

1079
01:19:20,786 --> 01:19:25,293
Only I'm willing
to back my tastes
with the necessary force.

1080
01:19:25,363 --> 01:19:28,690
You certainly make it sound
smooth and easy.

1081
01:19:28,691 --> 01:19:31,185
That's a trick.

1082
01:19:31,186 --> 01:19:33,425
I know the results of
that power you believe in.

1083
01:19:33,426 --> 01:19:36,371
It killed my friend,
and it's killing thousands
like him.

1084
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:38,386
That's what
you're aiming at.

1085
01:19:38,387 --> 01:19:40,979
But it doesn't bother you,
I can see that.

1086
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,962
Because you
really hate all people.

1087
01:19:42,963 --> 01:19:44,946
Let me tell you something.

1088
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,730
The last four or five days
I've learned a lot.

1089
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:50,259
I've met guys like you,
and I've met others...

1090
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,010
people that are helpful
and eager to do
the right thing,

1091
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:57,010
people that get a kick
out of helping each other
fight the bad guys.

1092
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:58,930
Love and hate.

1093
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:01,875
The world's
choosing up sides.
I know who I'm with.

1094
01:20:01,876 --> 01:20:05,331
There are a lot
of people on my side...
millions in every country.

1095
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:07,667
And we're not soft;
we're plenty strong.

1096
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:10,547
And we'll fight standing up
on our two feet,
and we'll win!

1097
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:13,427
Remember that, Mr. Tobin.
We'll win, no matter what
you guys do.

1098
01:20:13,428 --> 01:20:17,428
We'll win if it takes
from now until the cows
come home!

1099
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:22,292
Mr. Kane, I think we've
discussed the rights of man
sufficiently.

1100
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,197
I'm feeling a little tired.

1101
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,468
You must be too.

1102
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:32,372
Robert, do you think
you can arrange for Mr. Kane
to <i>sleep</i> somewhere tonight?

1103
01:20:32,373 --> 01:20:36,373
Yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.

1104
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:41,075
<i>That's enough, Robert.</i>
Very good, sir.

1105
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:50,549
Think you can take care
of this?
Yes, sir.

1106
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,550
Will that be all, sir?
Yes, thank you.

1107
01:21:12,086 --> 01:21:15,030
<i>It doesn't matter what</i>
<i>arrangements we've made,</i>
<i>to what trouble we've gone.</i>

1108
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:17,718
This whole job hangs
on one thing: timing.

1109
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:20,373
If the slipway goes up
before the actual launching,

1110
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:22,390
then all our efforts
have been wasted.

1111
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:24,821
If you blow her too late,
then you just scare the crowd.

1112
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:27,543
Timing, timing, timing.

1113
01:21:27,544 --> 01:21:31,158
That button must not be pressed
until the ship starts to move.

1114
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:33,110
What arrangements
have been made for getting out?

1115
01:21:33,111 --> 01:21:37,584
As soon as the cables
are unhooked, this truck goes.
We got it fixed at the gate.

1116
01:21:37,655 --> 01:21:40,087
Who's handling the camera
near the slipway?
I am.

1117
01:21:40,088 --> 01:21:44,022
The explosives were laid
last night. I have to
hook them up to the camera.

1118
01:21:44,023 --> 01:21:47,095
Too bad we have to
lose a good camera.

1119
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:50,616
Everything seems to be taken
care of. I'll be waiting
at the newsreel office.

1120
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:54,617
Good luck.

1121
01:21:55,129 --> 01:21:59,129
- Have they gone?
- Yes.

1122
01:22:00,632 --> 01:22:04,504
How is she?
Okay. She's having
her breakfast.

1123
01:22:04,505 --> 01:22:09,109
Any trouble keeping her quiet?
No. I made a deal
with her.

1124
01:22:09,177 --> 01:22:13,650
You see, she got tired
of having that adhesive tape
over her eyes and mouth.

1125
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,120
I hope we get rid
of her soon.

1126
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:20,121
I promised to
take my kid sister
to the philharmonic.

1127
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,602
Give me the key.
There it is.

1128
01:22:30,266 --> 01:22:32,888
I'm sorry we couldn't keep you
at the house,

1129
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:35,193
but Mrs. Sutton has a limited
number of guest rooms,

1130
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:37,656
and I suppose Mr. Kane
was first in line.

1131
01:22:37,657 --> 01:22:40,762
Where am I?
Oh, that's a trade secret.

1132
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:43,673
I only hope it isn't too high
for you here.

1133
01:22:43,674 --> 01:22:47,673
Mr. Kane's quarters are nearer
the ground, but he's being
well looked after...

1134
01:22:47,674 --> 01:22:51,674
and, like you, is probably
enjoying a hearty breakfast.

1135
01:23:57,725 --> 01:24:01,725
Somebody get the fire hose!

1136
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,133
Whose place is that?
That's Mrs. Sutton's
house.

1137
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:42,333
Oh. Who's she?
Some rich dame.

1138
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:45,662
Saw something
in the paper about her
doing things for charity.

1139
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:49,663
Right here somewhere.
Here.

1140
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:52,606
<i>What about tomorrow's work?</i>

1141
01:24:52,607 --> 01:24:54,974
<i>Tomorrow's work?</i>
<i>Can't abandon that.</i>

1142
01:24:54,975 --> 01:24:58,558
<i>But, Charles, the risk...</i>
<i>Is great! I know that.</i>

1143
01:24:58,559 --> 01:25:02,559
<i>Unfortunately, we will</i>
<i>have to carry out our orders.</i>

1144
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,223
- What's the time?
- 10:50.

1145
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,143
Thanks.

1146
01:25:10,144 --> 01:25:14,144
Brooklyn Navy Yard, quick!

1147
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:16,130
How much?
Fifteen.

1148
01:26:19,202 --> 01:26:23,202
Got change?
Yes.

1149
01:26:52,483 --> 01:26:55,555
<i>Courtesy of the Navy Department,</i>
<i>we take you to the navy yard,</i>

1150
01:26:55,556 --> 01:26:59,615
where we will endeavor
to bring you
a description...

1151
01:26:59,684 --> 01:27:03,010
<i>of the launching ceremony</i>
<i>of the</i> U.S.S. Alaska.

1152
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:06,692
<i>And so we switch you now</i>
<i>to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</i>

1153
01:27:06,693 --> 01:27:11,581
<i>Here we are. A rather windy</i>
<i>autumn day, but a pretty good</i>
<i>day for a launching.</i>

1154
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:14,468
<i>Any day is a good day</i>
<i>for a launching in these times.</i>

1155
01:27:14,469 --> 01:27:17,507
<i>Our microphones</i>
<i>are in several key spots.</i>

1156
01:27:17,508 --> 01:27:19,428
What's holding us up?

1157
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:21,380
Traffic, buddy.
What do you think?

1158
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:24,004
Here. I'll walk.

1159
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,924
Okay.

1160
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:29,060
<i>The main speaker</i>
<i>is about to begin.</i>

1161
01:27:29,061 --> 01:27:33,061
<i>I am now turning you over</i>
<i>to Bill Donnan, located</i>
<i>on the actual platform.</i>

1162
01:27:33,093 --> 01:27:35,012
<i>Go ahead, Bill.</i>

1163
01:27:35,013 --> 01:27:40,228
<i>This is Bill Donnan.</i>
<i>We're located right below</i>
<i>the bow of the great ship.</i>

1164
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:44,294
<i>It towers over us</i>
<i>like some enormous monster.</i>
<i>This platform...</i>

1165
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,388
Take me to the guy in charge!
Okay. I'll take care
of this.

1166
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:50,308
What do you want?
Something's gonna happen.
Sabotage.

1167
01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:52,709
Where'd you
get your information?
There isn't time!

1168
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:54,852
We gotta have
more to go on.

1169
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,773
Better tell the chief.
There isn't time!

1170
01:27:56,774 --> 01:27:59,653
What do you expect?
Take me to the guy
in charge of the launching.

1171
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:02,021
You gotta go through
the office first.

1172
01:28:02,022 --> 01:28:03,941
Towley, 1050.

1173
01:28:03,942 --> 01:28:08,579
<i>Crowded with all kinds</i>
<i>of navy officers and personnel.</i>

1174
01:28:08,647 --> 01:28:11,974
<i>I can see Rear Admiral Pierce</i>
<i>and Mrs. Pierce.</i>

1175
01:28:11,975 --> 01:28:15,558
It is Mrs. Pierce who will
perform the bottle breaking.

1176
01:28:15,559 --> 01:28:17,701
<i>She is shaking hands</i>
<i>with a great many</i>
<i>people down there.</i>

1177
01:28:17,702 --> 01:28:22,275
<i>Just a second.</i>
<i>I see Rear Admiral Pierce</i>
<i>moving toward the microphone.</i>

1178
01:28:22,343 --> 01:28:24,422
<i>Yes. He's going</i>
<i>to begin his speech now.</i>

1179
01:28:24,423 --> 01:28:27,590
<i>We'll switch you over</i>
<i>to the speaker's microphone.</i>

1180
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:29,702
<i>The launching of a ship</i>
<i>in time of war...</i>

1181
01:28:29,703 --> 01:28:31,943
<i>is always a solemn occasion.</i>

1182
01:28:31,944 --> 01:28:33,958
<i>Today, when our fleet is</i>
<i>fighting on all the seven seas,</i>

1183
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:36,871
<i>this ceremony</i>
<i>gains magnitude...</i>

1184
01:28:36,872 --> 01:28:40,038
<i>for it represents</i>
<i>a victory.</i>
Where'd that guy go?

1185
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:44,039
I don't know.
He just stepped outside.

1186
01:28:45,608 --> 01:28:49,608
<i>...by the strong hands</i>
<i>of American workmen.</i>

1187
01:28:51,944 --> 01:28:56,003
<i>- Let us rejoice, then, at this</i>
<i>moment. Let us be confident,</i>

1188
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:02,024
<i>...work together</i>
<i>to show the world</i>
<i>what Americans can do.</i>

1189
01:29:02,025 --> 01:29:04,487
<i>Our American soldiers...</i>

1190
01:29:04,488 --> 01:29:09,126
<i>are freely giving their lives</i>
<i>so that we can live in decency,</i>
<i>security and peace.</i>

1191
01:29:10,185 --> 01:29:12,104
<i>This is Bill Donnan again.</i>

1192
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,336
<i>Youve just heard</i>
<i>Rear Admiral Pierce speaking</i>
<i>from the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</i>

1193
01:29:15,337 --> 01:29:18,056
<i>His speech is being received</i>
<i>with great applause...</i>
Shut the back doors! Quick!

1194
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:20,904
I can handle this!
Be ready to pull out
as soon as she goes.

1195
01:29:20,905 --> 01:29:24,905
<i>The officer is handing her</i>
<i>a bottle of champagne.</i>

1196
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:34,697
<i>The crowd is tense.</i>
<i>It is indeed a solemn occasion.</i>

1197
01:29:34,698 --> 01:29:37,993
<i>I switch you over</i>
<i>to our microphone</i>
<i>near the bow of the ship...</i>

1198
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:40,393
<i>so that you may hear</i>
<i>the actual launching.</i>

1199
01:29:40,394 --> 01:29:44,200
<i>I can see that Mrs. Pierce</i>
<i>is moving towards the bow.</i>

1200
01:29:44,201 --> 01:29:47,273
<i>I'll switch you over now</i>
<i>to Mrs. Pierce.</i>

1201
01:29:47,274 --> 01:29:49,801
<i>In the name of the people</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

1202
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:53,802
<i>I christen thee</i> Alaska.

1203
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:20,524
What's the trouble?
Don't know.
An explosion somewhere.

1204
01:30:34,605 --> 01:30:38,605
George!

1205
01:30:39,756 --> 01:30:43,756
Everything okay?
No. Give us a hand.
We got a guy.

1206
01:31:05,517 --> 01:31:09,227
Better scatter.
Go through the iron door
into the music hall.

1207
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:13,228
We'll go this way.

1208
01:31:31,182 --> 01:31:33,773
You must go at once, before
Henry catches you here!

1209
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:35,886
<i>I thought you wanted</i>
<i>to make the old boy jealous.</i>

1210
01:31:35,887 --> 01:31:39,694
<i>Not anymore. He's threatened</i>
<i>to kill you on sight.</i>

1211
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:42,606
<i> You don't think</i>
<i>he'd go that far, do you?</i>

1212
01:31:42,607 --> 01:31:46,286
<i>Oh, will you go before it's too</i>
<i>late? Before he shoots you?</i>

1213
01:31:46,287 --> 01:31:51,590
<i>Old Henry's</i>
<i>got a gun? A real gun?</i>

1214
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,046
<i> Oh!</i>
<i>What do you think this is?</i>

1215
01:31:56,047 --> 01:31:58,479
<i>I've caught you,</i>
<i>you rat in the grass!</i>

1216
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,847
<i>- Stop that!</i>

1217
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,958
<i>Run, Wilbur!</i>
<i>Before he gets your range!</i>

1218
01:32:02,959 --> 01:32:06,959
I think I got it now.
Get out before I shoot again!

1219
01:32:07,024 --> 01:32:10,063
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

1220
01:32:10,064 --> 01:32:12,559
<i> Never touched me!</i>
<i>I'll get you this time.</i>

1221
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,560
My husband! He's shot!

1222
01:32:16,624 --> 01:32:20,901
I'll kill the rat
if it's the last thing I do!

1223
01:32:20,976 --> 01:32:22,896
He was only kidding.
I swear!

1224
01:32:22,897 --> 01:32:25,135
And I'm only kidding too!

1225
01:32:25,136 --> 01:32:28,367
<i>Get outta here!</i>
<i>Get outta here!</i>

1226
01:32:28,368 --> 01:32:30,703
<i>He's gone mad! Mad!</i>

1227
01:32:30,704 --> 01:32:33,519
<i>Get out! Get out!</i>

1228
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,048
<i>Not that way!</i>
<i>He'll kill you!</i>

1229
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:38,928
<i>Murder! Help!</i>
<i> Run! Run!</i>

1230
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:42,929
<i>Run for your life!</i>

1231
01:32:48,177 --> 01:32:52,236
There he goes!
He's the one
you're after!

1232
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:54,288
<i>You're</i> the one we're after.
Come on!
He'll get away!

1233
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:57,296
Come on!
Grab a cab and go after him.
It's our only chance!

1234
01:32:57,297 --> 01:33:01,297
Taxi!

1235
01:33:07,346 --> 01:33:09,521
Downtown.
Whereabouts?

1236
01:33:09,522 --> 01:33:13,522
Anywhere. Just
keep goin' downtown.

1237
01:34:45,237 --> 01:34:49,237
May I have change
for the telephone?
Yes, ma'am.

1238
01:34:51,703 --> 01:34:55,703
There you are.

1239
01:35:02,647 --> 01:35:06,390
Operator? Give me the F.B.I.
headquarters, please.

1240
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:09,045
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

1241
01:35:09,046 --> 01:35:13,046
Hold on,
I'll put you through.

1242
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:16,598
Make sure he doesn't
leave by the next boat.
Talk to him. Follow him!

1243
01:35:16,599 --> 01:35:19,158
Keep him there
until our men come along.

1244
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:23,159
She thinks she's traced Fry
to Bedloe Island.
He'd never go there!

1245
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:26,518
Where did you pick up Schultz?
In that museum,
that modern art place.

1246
01:35:26,519 --> 01:35:29,014
And Renaldo?
You caught him
in the aquarium.

1247
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:31,959
But the statue's
a dead end.
He's smart. Get going.

1248
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,255
Let me take him
to make sure the girl
hasn't made a mistake.

1249
01:35:35,256 --> 01:35:39,256
Burke, you're one of the most
obstinate men I've ever met!
Get going.

1250
01:36:40,187 --> 01:36:44,409
Pardon me. Could you tell me
which is Brooklyn?

1251
01:36:48,282 --> 01:36:52,186
I've seen you before,
haven't I?

1252
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:55,642
Sure.

1253
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:59,482
On that boat
comin' over.

1254
01:36:59,483 --> 01:37:01,402
What'd you ask me?

1255
01:37:01,403 --> 01:37:05,306
About Brooklyn, where it was.
I've heard so much about it.

1256
01:37:05,307 --> 01:37:07,962
Over there.

1257
01:37:07,963 --> 01:37:09,914
Where are you from?
New York.

1258
01:37:09,915 --> 01:37:14,322
What are you handin' me?
Oh, no. You see,
I work in a store downtown.

1259
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:16,570
I never get a chance
to get out.

1260
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:19,323
I just sit around all day,
and I never see anything.

1261
01:37:19,324 --> 01:37:23,895
So I said, the first vacation
I get, I'm going to see
the Statue of Liberty.

1262
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,042
This must be a big moment
for you, huh?

1263
01:37:26,043 --> 01:37:30,551
Oh, it is. And it means
so much to us now.

1264
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,795
Why, I was just reading
in this booklet.

1265
01:37:32,796 --> 01:37:35,867
Did you know this statue
was given to us by the French?

1266
01:37:35,868 --> 01:37:38,395
You know what they had written
on it?

1267
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:42,332
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses...

1268
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:44,252
"yearning to breathe free;

1269
01:37:44,253 --> 01:37:46,939
"the wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

1270
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:50,427
Send these: the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me."

1271
01:37:50,428 --> 01:37:55,098
And just look at the French.
Isn't it sad?
Yeah. Very sad.

1272
01:37:55,165 --> 01:37:59,606
Oh, it's such
a beautiful statue.

1273
01:37:59,677 --> 01:38:02,108
I could just sit up here
all day thinking about it.
Couldn't you?

1274
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:06,109
Some other day, maybe.
Not right now.

1275
01:38:06,174 --> 01:38:08,509
<i>Right now I gotta catch</i>
<i>that boat back.</i>

1276
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:11,068
You comin'?

1277
01:38:11,069 --> 01:38:13,980
Well, there's another boat
in 15 minutes.

1278
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:15,901
Couldn't we wait?

1279
01:38:15,902 --> 01:38:19,902
All the people have gone,
and we'd be alone...
just you and me.

1280
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:24,445
Sounds cozy.

1281
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:28,789
But I...
I haven't got the time.

1282
01:38:28,863 --> 01:38:33,303
Oh, on a nice autumn day
like this, you couldn't spare
15 minutes for me?

1283
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:35,869
I don't like autumn.

1284
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:40,061
You're not being very nice
to a lonely girl.

1285
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:42,718
You look as though you
might be lonely too.

1286
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,430
Yeah.

1287
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:50,431
I gotta catch that boat.

1288
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:55,166
Fifteen minutes shouldn't
make such a big difference,
Mr. Fry.

1289
01:39:05,216 --> 01:39:09,216
Who are ya?

1290
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:12,575
Come on. Quit stalling.
Who are ya?

1291
01:39:12,576 --> 01:39:15,006
I think I told you.
A working girl
on her day off.

1292
01:39:15,007 --> 01:39:19,007
Don't kid me!

1293
01:39:19,104 --> 01:39:21,247
What are you doin' here?

1294
01:39:21,248 --> 01:39:23,551
It's rather a long story,
Mr. Fry.

1295
01:39:23,552 --> 01:39:25,503
It all started
with an unknown blonde,

1296
01:39:25,504 --> 01:39:27,615
an aircraft worker
at a factory
in Glendale, California.

1297
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:31,616
I get it.

1298
01:39:31,681 --> 01:39:35,681
Little Miss Liberty,
carryin' the torch.

1299
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:39,456
Why'd you follow me?
Why do you think?

1300
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:43,582
Take a look down there.
If you can't figure it out,
they're coming for you.

1301
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:11,299
Do you see him
in this bunch?
No.

1302
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:16,665
Barnes, you stay here
and watch this end.
You fellows, come with me.

1303
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:28,227
You two, watch that side.

1304
01:40:31,683 --> 01:40:35,683
I'm going up.

1305
01:40:37,219 --> 01:40:39,137
Barry!
Pat, where is he?

1306
01:40:39,138 --> 01:40:43,138
He started down!
Are you sure?

1307
01:40:58,084 --> 01:41:02,084
He's up here! Come on!

1308
01:41:22,565 --> 01:41:26,565
Come on, Fry!

1309
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:07,430
I'll get your sleeve.

1310
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:17,477
Don't you go over!
If you slip, that'll
be three gone!

1311
01:42:17,478 --> 01:42:21,478
Quick! Get a rope.

1312
01:42:21,639 --> 01:42:25,639
- Can you get a grip
with your feet?
- I can't.

1313
01:42:26,023 --> 01:42:28,070
Kane, I'm
getting a rope!

1314
01:42:28,071 --> 01:42:33,702
- They're getting a rope.
Hold on, Fry.
- I'll clear you.

1315
01:42:33,768 --> 01:42:36,231
I swear I will.

1316
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:40,232
- I'll clear you.
- Hurry up with the rope!

1317
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:14,440
Tell them quick.
The sleeve.

1318
01:43:14,441 --> 01:43:18,441
Sleeve!

1319
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:25,002
Kane!
