1
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,774
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:22,614
No dorm, no roommates,
my own place. I was so happy.

3
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:27,871
I had my own parking space.

4
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,434
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

5
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:53,309
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

6
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:12,670
-Hello.
-Need some help?

7
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:15,375
No, l...
Well, yeah, thanks.

8
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:26,803
I'm from Spain.

9
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:30,595
-Really? Which part?
-Galicia.

10
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:34,391
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

11
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:38,814
"U-Dub."
That's what people call it here.

12
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,820
Finally, a local tells me
some secrets.

13
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:47,866
You don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

14
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,280
Where else do I have to go?

15
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,666
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

16
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,045
U-Dub.

17
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:33,405
This is Linda Powell from
the Seattle Environmental Council.

18
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:36,122
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

19
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:40,507
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

20
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,546
We gotta get somebody out there...

21
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:47,421
Ruth, how long have I been saying
there are no guys?

22
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,974
Forever.

23
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:52,926
I met one. I met one
when I was least expecting it.

24
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,599
You held out on me.

25
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:57,394
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

26
00:04:57,567 --> 00:05:01,434
His visa runs out in two days. He's...

27
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,612
He's like a comet. What do I do?

28
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,994
I wish you could stay.

29
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:12,289
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

30
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:16,835
-Were you ever gonna come back?
-Well, now I have a reason.

31
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,174
I want you to have this.

32
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,840
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

33
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:33,891
But this is a symbol of our future.

34
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,731
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

35
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:51,486
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

36
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,123
It's important to me.

37
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:00,580
Use this when you get back.

38
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,924
You'll always have a parking space.

39
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,017
Hello.

40
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:27,406
Don't wake up. I'm getting
on the plane. I wanted to say bye.

41
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:34,240
-I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
-Goodbye, honey. I miss you already.

42
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,366
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

43
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:46,665
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

44
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:48,465
"Basics"?

45
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:54,176
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

46
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,761
You're talking
about marrying this guy?

47
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,230
I'm tired of all the games.

48
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:08,273
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

49
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:12,194
-We will always go out dancing.
-What?!

50
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:16,111
We will always go out dancing!

51
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:17,265
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

52
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:22,309
Here's the Liftrex and the Liftrex
Super. Might be more than you need.

53
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,684
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

54
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,441
...garage-door opener combo.

55
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:34,533
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

56
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,206
I recently broke up with Jennifer,
my last girlfriend.

57
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:54,670
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

58
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:59,306
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

59
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:03,307
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

60
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,022
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

61
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,814
Now she's with Tony.

62
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,987
Tony knows my friend Bailey, who's
friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

63
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,529
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

64
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:24,489
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

65
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:28,036
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

66
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,747
Tony will tell Jennifer I was
dating Rita when I was with her.

67
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:35,507
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

68
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:41,678
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

69
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,764
Isn't that great?

70
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,353
I don't know. I think...

71
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,903
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

72
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,113
I'm back to the beginning.

73
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:05,455
My dad left home when I was 8.
He said to me:

74
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:09,208
"Have fun. Stay single."

75
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:11,670
I was 8.

76
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:16,671
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

77
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,007
He was from Boston.

78
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,469
The father and the mother
have finally learned to come together.

79
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:27,593
The father inserts his penis...

80
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:31,770
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

81
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:39,445
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

82
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:45,406
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

83
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,747
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

84
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,838
-What?
-Yeah, what comes out?

85
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,506
-Spam!
-Oh, man!

86
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:04,470
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

87
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:09,719
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

88
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:13,812
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

89
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,312
Work.

90
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,356
I gotta go.

91
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:50,556
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

92
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:55,392
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

93
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,404
Here I am, 23.

94
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,438
Things are...
They're basically the same.

95
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:06,236
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

96
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:11,573
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

97
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,793
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.

98
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:36,772
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

99
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,654
He's like a Renaissance man.

100
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,451
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

101
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:14,435
Janet. What's the ordeal?

102
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:19,772
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday but...

103
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:23,645
So I just thought I'd come by
and say, hi.

104
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,321
-Hi.
-Hey.

105
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:30,704
-So how about this weekend?
-This weekend we're really busy.

106
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:33,160
-We got that show, right?
-Yeah, that show.

107
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,120
-We got these guys coming from L.A.
-Great.

108
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,701
-It's gonna be rocking.
-Bye, Cliff.

109
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,370
-So come over after.
-Deal.

110
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:47,798
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

111
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:50,968
You do know that, don't you?

112
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,766
You don't fool me.

113
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:58,104
Janet, I could not
be fooling you less.

114
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:01,692
Cliff, you gotta move your truck, man.

115
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,857
I know what you're thinking.
We connected.

116
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:09,527
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

117
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:14,530
So sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it's real. This is real.

118
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,874
We just don't even have to discuss it.

119
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:21,913
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

120
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,882
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

121
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,403
So I'll see you Saturday, and then
I'll help you with your speakers.

122
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,945
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

123
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,949
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

124
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:01,668
I can store 20 numbers.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

125
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:05,123
All or nothing.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

126
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,135
What if the super you meets the super
her, and the super her rejects you?

127
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,795
-Then it's no problem.
-Why?

128
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:16,556
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

129
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:22,015
-I live my life like a French movie.
-What?

130
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:26,311
Webster and 24th, it should be here.

131
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:30,780
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

132
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,910
Hey, man...

133
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
...where's De Soto?

134
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,284
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

135
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:46,330
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

136
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:50,005
Where's De Soto? Our car broke down.

137
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:57,349
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

138
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:01,767
When I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

139
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,395
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

140
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,318
Maybe I've been hurt,
or I've been dogged!

141
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:11,402
-Know where this place is?
-Do I look like a Thomas Guide?

142
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,863
-You really shouldn't speak.
-Yes.

143
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:16,361
-Where do you work?
-I'm a maître d' .

144
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:19,871
-Department of Transportation.
-Solving the gridlock.

145
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,329
I build airplanes.

146
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:57,596
-Hey.
-Hello.

147
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:07,522
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

148
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,359
He says when you're
at a place like this...

149
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,776
...you can't just be yourself,
you need an act.

150
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:16,568
So anyway, I saw you standing there...

151
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:20,320
...so I thought,
A: I could just leave you alone.

152
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:26,746
B: I could come up with an act,
or C: I could just be myself.

153
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:29,292
I chose C.

154
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,952
What do you think?

155
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:36,425
I think that
A: You have an act...

156
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:41,505
...and that
B: Not having an act is your act.

157
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,018
Thank you.

158
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:57,405
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

159
00:18:57,574 --> 00:19:01,357
I don't like to reduce us just
to being part of Seattle.

160
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:03,909
I think of us expanding more.

161
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:06,868
We're huge in Europe right now.

162
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:11,039
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

163
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:20,755
A song like "Touch Me, I'm Dick"
is about what?

164
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,057
I think "Touch Me, I'm Dick, "
in essence, speaks for itself.

165
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:29,888
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

166
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,724
It's about, you know...

167
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,564
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

168
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:38,488
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

169
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:42,239
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

170
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:46,742
-Hey, excuse me! Hello.
-Hi.

171
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:49,536
-Want to meet up later?
-Where you going?

172
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,829
-Anywhere you're going.
-Anywhere you're going.

173
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,914
-We're going home.
-Going home.

174
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,209
-Do you have a...?
-See you.

175
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,424
"Anywhere you're going."

176
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:04,466
Always get their numbers.
I got 20 numbers.

177
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,006
Twenty numbers.

178
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:10,596
Bailey, you got 20 numbers
of 20 girls that you will never call...

179
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,772
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

180
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:19,066
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

181
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,527
-Watch the volume.
-Sorry. Tinnitus.

182
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,744
-Club disease.
-You kids are all going to be deaf.

183
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:27,110
Bailey.

184
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:29,830
This is my night.

185
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,200
-What?
-Look.

186
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:36,285
Linda, don't look over.

187
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:25,551
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

188
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:29,927
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

189
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:32,723
-It was a joke.
-I know. I know.

190
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:37,142
You think it's something desperate
people do. You are wrong!

191
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:41,729
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

192
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:44,656
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

193
00:21:44,824 --> 00:21:47,990
-Your medication, Miss Hunt.
-Thank you.

194
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:52,576
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

195
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,788
My roommate has no domestic...
Guys just don't know...

196
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:03,499
-Did you get the tunnel stuff?
-I'll call you back.

197
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:07,970
The l-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

198
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:11,424
The Times asked why
there's gridlock on the l-5.

199
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,804
It's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio."

200
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,601
Did you read my proposal?
What'd you think?

201
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:20,526
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

202
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:21,892
-Stu?
-After lunch.

203
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,643
After lunch, okay. After lunch, Stu.

204
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:28,108
-Ted, what's up?
-Making music with my fingers.

205
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:31,618
And what a beautiful sound it is.

206
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:44,339
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

207
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,886
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

208
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:52,056
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

209
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:55,510
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

210
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,229
Coffee?

211
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,684
Water? How about some water?

212
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:05,485
I'll meet you where you're having
lunch, and we'll have some water.

213
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:09,741
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

214
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,121
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

215
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:20,492
And now... And now
with all the Exxon kickbacks, it's...

216
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,003
-God, yes. The worst.
-Yes.

217
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:29,001
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

218
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,547
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

219
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:34,681
I think it will work out.

220
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,059
-What?
-There's just no privacy anymore.

221
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,935
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

222
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,362
-Me too.
-My God.

223
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,608
Do you know what time it is?

224
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:54,777
-Yeah, 3:30.
-Oh, I'm so late.

225
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:58,121
-I'm glad your lunch date didn't show.
-Me too.

226
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:01,956
-Did you really have a lunch date?
-No.

227
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:05,245
-Maybe...
-I'm getting over somebody.

228
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:09,087
-Nothing big.
-I think it's a bad time to get...

229
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,003
-Okay.
-Okay.

230
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:15,214
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.

231
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:18,842
Okay. Thanks.

232
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,485
Thanks.

233
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:47,254
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

234
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:50,211
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

235
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:54,880
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

236
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:57,262
I like this girl.

237
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:59,965
Gotta handle this one really well.

238
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:04,308
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

239
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:09,476
-You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
-Thanks.

240
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:15,034
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

241
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:21,868
That some jerk could trash the Mona
Lisa or an ocean or someone's life.

242
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:26,627
So who are your neighbors?

243
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:31,331
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d' .

244
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,179
He keeps us all on free meals.

245
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:38,504
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

246
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:43,427
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

247
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,516
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

248
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:53,779
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

249
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,236
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

250
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,324
She works there too. She's
saving for architecture school.

251
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:02,785
Cliff and Janet.

252
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:07,622
That's it.

253
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:12,755
You sound like me talking
about my family.

254
00:26:13,802 --> 00:26:17,253
Wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying?

255
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:37,073
That's a good picture of you.

256
00:26:37,992 --> 00:26:41,443
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic?

257
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:47,333
Because I do, constantly. Traffic
is caused by the single car driver.

258
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:51,167
900,000 single people
get in their cars every morning.

259
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,376
They drive and wonder why
there's gridlock.

260
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:58,630
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

261
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:04,309
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Coffee, great music...

262
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:07,312
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

263
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,149
But I still love my car, though.

264
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:12,475
Well... Oh.

265
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:17,146
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

266
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,945
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

267
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:24,578
-Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
-You dare to rip the X-Man.

268
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:30,834
"Kiss at the Hotel de Ville."
You have this too. I have this.

269
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:35,215
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

270
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:41,422
-I was a deejay in college.
-Really?

271
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:44,551
That's why I still have records.

272
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,867
So any boyfriends?

273
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:05,450
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

274
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:11,702
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

275
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:15,830
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

276
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:20,051
I made that up. Plus, I got
back together with Lynn last night.

277
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:23,385
So you probably want to go ahead
and freak out.

278
00:28:26,476 --> 00:28:31,137
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

279
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:34,813
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

280
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:36,064
And then l...

281
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,726
-I'm talking too much.
-No, go ahead.

282
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:42,736
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

283
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:47,950
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

284
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:52,784
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

285
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,333
I was a semester too late.

286
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,226
Hi.

287
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,617
Condoms. They're free.

288
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:45,585
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

289
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,637
Really?

290
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:52,644
There is so much life in you.

291
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:57,853
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

292
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:03,564
-I'm Andy.
-I'm Linda.

293
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,739
Emotional larceny?

294
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:11,033
We talked about how passion didn't
matter as much as comfort, stability.

295
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:13,245
-That's bullshit.
-No kidding.

296
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,704
-Sorry.
-It's cool.

297
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:22,214
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

298
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:24,042
I did the same thing.

299
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:28,262
One day, one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back.

300
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:31,598
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

301
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:36,181
-Why did I have to meet you in a club?
-I don't know.

302
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:41,897
Oh, I love this song.

303
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:01,912
My clothes.

304
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:06,916
This is you?

305
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:10,344
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

306
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,718
-I inherited it.
-Not sure how I feel about that.

307
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:19,723
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

308
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,770
-Okay. I'll call you.
-Okay. Don't forget.

309
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:24,224
I won't.

310
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:32,703
Good night.

311
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:46,173
Good night.

312
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:48,500
Good night.

313
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,381
Listen, next time, why don't you...

314
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,141
...park underground?

315
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,813
I should go.

316
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:40,971
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

317
00:32:41,147 --> 00:32:44,895
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

318
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:07,539
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

319
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:30,604
Burglar, burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar.

320
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:54,208
Neighbors.

321
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:58,761
It's Andy. Just calling
to make sure you're okay.

322
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,684
I was thinking about the conversation.

323
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,723
Trust him, although
he's putting on moves.

324
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,850
Passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy.

325
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,943
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

326
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:15,110
I think that you can trust him,
but you certainly want to...

327
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:18,817
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

328
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:23,241
Starring Fred MacMurray.

329
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,586
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

330
00:34:30,756 --> 00:34:34,919
-Whenever, whenever.
-You're amazing.

331
00:34:35,095 --> 00:34:39,009
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

332
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:42,218
We're being too loud.

333
00:34:45,355 --> 00:34:49,399
What are you thinking
right now?

334
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:54,316
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

335
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,489
Things happen in the game.
Nothing you can do.

336
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:00,992
I don't go and say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up."

337
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:05,030
-Anything else, X?
-Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

338
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:27,471
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

339
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:34,855
What can I eat? I'm tired
of starving myself for this guy.

340
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:37,983
Salad. I'll have a salad.

341
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:45,622
If I call him, that's being desperate.

342
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:51,295
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

343
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:55,127
If he shows up, I'll listen.
No way do I call him.

344
00:35:56,551 --> 00:36:00,085
Of course, men do like to be called.

345
00:36:00,513 --> 00:36:05,673
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will
be one hour, and that is very late.

346
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,970
He is offiicially very late.

347
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:19,691
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

348
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:22,823
Two out of three.

349
00:36:28,374 --> 00:36:32,371
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

350
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,501
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

351
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:45,340
Forget it. I am not desperate. I have
many people to spend time with.

352
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,390
-Quit getting involved with neighbors.
-That broke us up?

353
00:36:50,563 --> 00:36:52,888
-We're better as friends.
-Absolutely.

354
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:57,145
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

355
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,645
-I know.
-Except when it comes to women.

356
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:02,823
He likes these club-type women...

357
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:05,993
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

358
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:11,496
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

359
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,496
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

360
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:20,049
You're from the high plains, Janet.

361
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,221
I'm so glad I live here.

362
00:37:48,288 --> 00:37:52,119
-Are my breasts too small for you?
-No.

363
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,624
God.

364
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:07,806
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

365
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:13,216
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

366
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:16,267
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

367
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:19,607
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

368
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:23,360
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

369
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:24,729
You know?

370
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:30,115
Don't lie because when you do, your
eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

371
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:37,920
Okay, ask me.

372
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:42,548
Are my breasts too small for you?

373
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:51,464
Sometimes.

374
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,242
Have you had implants before?

375
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,328
What do you think?

376
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,792
No.

377
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:24,371
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

378
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,965
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

379
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:30,711
...by graph. Right.

380
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:33,049
Well, what's painful?

381
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:37,847
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

382
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,097
...mine in particular.

383
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:45,981
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

384
00:39:46,197 --> 00:39:49,316
All right. Bye-bye.

385
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:52,453
-Hi.
-Hi.

386
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:56,957
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

387
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:02,166
How about that?

388
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:16,223
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

389
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:21,852
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

390
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:30,190
-Whoa. Do you jog?
-A little.

391
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,281
See, maybe, here.

392
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:40,206
-Split the difference?
-Split the difference.

393
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,277
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing.

394
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:11,731
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

395
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:17,950
I'm on the bed right now, wearing
something really outrageous.

396
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:21,698
I've got no underwear on.

397
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:26,460
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

398
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:31,922
I think you've got the wrong number,
lady, but I'll be right over.

399
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:43,395
-This guy plays no games.
-That's great.

400
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:44,850
Yeah.

401
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:48,434
-I've got to play this one perfectly.
-Go with it.

402
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:52,110
-What do your instincts say?
-Not to listen to you guys.

403
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,530
-There you go.
-Don't tug at her bra strap.

404
00:41:55,702 --> 00:42:00,494
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

405
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:04,870
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

406
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:09,088
-Should I trust him?
-Yeah.

407
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,633
-Not all guys are like Luiz.
-You're right.

408
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,006
You're right. Steve is different.

409
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:21,600
Just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

410
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:26,348
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

411
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:33,938
What are you thinking?

412
00:42:34,157 --> 00:42:39,577
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

413
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:42,324
My chest hurts.

414
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,667
-You didn't, like, leave a note?
-No, I left my blue T-shirt.

415
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:49,962
-There are no mistakes.
-What?

416
00:42:50,173 --> 00:42:53,755
What is that? What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

417
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:58,795
I'm going to call my
new semigirlfriend.

418
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:01,505
You're gonna scare her off.

419
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:04,643
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

420
00:43:04,895 --> 00:43:08,595
-Distinguish yourself by not calling.
-Yep.

421
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:13,312
-P.S., that's how you get her.
-No, Bailey, you don't understand.

422
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,276
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

423
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,076
You're right.

424
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:28,241
I gotta let this one breathe.

425
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:34,588
Yes. You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

426
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:42,009
-So how'd it go?
-I got the boat.

427
00:43:42,225 --> 00:43:45,428
-The trip to Alaska's set.
-Oh, great, Linda.

428
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:48,438
-That is great.
-Yeah.

429
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:56,018
-Oh, Steve on two.
-Four days he waits to call me.

430
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:58,942
So, what do I tell him?

431
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,108
-Tell him I went out for groceries.
-Okay.

432
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:06,029
She went out for groceries.

433
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:09,208
Bye-bye.

434
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:12,040
He's coming right over.

435
00:44:12,255 --> 00:44:14,876
-What do you mean, nothing?
-Nothing is wrong.

436
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:18,008
Really. Thanks.

437
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:21,089
-We connected.
-This is a small office.

438
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:24,432
-Is this because I didn't call?
-Did you call?

439
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:28,135
I don't know why you're
being like this. I like you.

440
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:31,681
I'll call you, or you call me.

441
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:44,741
-I'm sorry if I blew it by not calling.
-You don't owe me anything.

442
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:48,446
-Is this about your ex who calls?
-Andy doesn't.

443
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,000
-Ponytail, right?
-No.

444
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:54,628
-Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
-He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

445
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:04,212
-You're scared of getting close to me.
-You don't know me.

446
00:45:04,473 --> 00:45:07,557
-I think I do.
-No, you don't.

447
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:12,054
Look, let's not play games.

448
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:17,019
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

449
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:22,363
-What I mean is...
-I've gotta work, Steve.

450
00:45:22,575 --> 00:45:26,524
-Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
-Bye, Steve.

451
00:45:36,381 --> 00:45:41,588
Why? Why do you talk such a good game?

452
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:48,379
You talk about things that matter,
that get me excited, that get me hot.

453
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:56,223
But it's like you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?

454
00:45:56,442 --> 00:46:01,150
Why can't I just be a buddy?

455
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:06,193
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

456
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:08,659
It's better to be the dumper.

457
00:46:08,997 --> 00:46:11,997
Mom... Mom! Yeah.

458
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:17,202
Listen, Mom, if he invited you
to Hawaii, yes, he wants something.

459
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:22,836
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for two years.

460
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:26,217
Listen. Listen, Mom!

461
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:31,015
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

462
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:36,226
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

463
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:38,100
I rinsed them, Debbie.

464
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:41,851
You have to rinse off
the food or it gets all over.

465
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:46,732
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

466
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:52,033
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

467
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:02,245
Hi.

468
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:06,089
-This is for Expect the Best, right?
-I brought clippings.

469
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:08,337
Possible looks for my video.

470
00:47:08,598 --> 00:47:12,844
Here we have
the Edie Sedgwick. You know?

471
00:47:14,771 --> 00:47:17,522
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

472
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:23,943
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

473
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:30,573
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

474
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:33,113
Truth?

475
00:47:33,748 --> 00:47:35,621
Truth.

476
00:47:39,129 --> 00:47:44,123
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

477
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,216
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

478
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:53,967
Twenty.

479
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:58,228
He doesn't even know me.

480
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:00,431
Debbie...

481
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:04,860
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

482
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:09,775
Okay. Okay, I'm in your hands.

483
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:22,419
I am Debbie Hunt.

484
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:26,665
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

485
00:48:27,385 --> 00:48:30,836
But I am not about looks.

486
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,478
Hi.

487
00:48:38,688 --> 00:48:42,471
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

488
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:48,319
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

489
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:51,443
Oh, no druggies, please.

490
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:56,030
I'm fairly intense, and
I'm an advertising exec...

491
00:48:56,206 --> 00:49:01,745
...at KRWE-TV. That's me.

492
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:07,796
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

493
00:49:17,602 --> 00:49:19,261
Yeah.

494
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:24,102
"Debbie country." It's funny.

495
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:34,410
-"Doghouse" as an encore?
-Six songs.

496
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:37,613
-They want me.
-They are just our friends.

497
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,874
-"Doghouse" as an encore.
-You can't start out with that.

498
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,616
Why make them clap
so we come out again?

499
00:49:44,796 --> 00:49:47,417
-You don't get it.
-I agree with Cliff.

500
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,504
-Hey, a review of our record.
-Whoa, read it out loud.

501
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,423
"When the shirtless Cliff
starts to sing..."

502
00:49:54,597 --> 00:49:59,757
Wait a minute, man. I don't
want to hear anything negative.

503
00:49:59,936 --> 00:50:02,177
Go on.

504
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:27,292
Other than that, "He was ably backed
by Stone and Jeff...

505
00:50:27,546 --> 00:50:31,625
...and drummer Eddie Vedder."
That's good. That's a good review.

506
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:36,719
-A compliment for us is one for you.
-No, man.

507
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,472
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

508
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:44,177
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

509
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:47,890
This weekend, we rock Portland.

510
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,019
Yeah!

511
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:58,776
Okay, are you sure
you want to do this?

512
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:02,488
Yep. My mind is made up.

513
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:05,245
Want to read a magazine?

514
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:08,750
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

515
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:11,797
I didn't want you to go alone.

516
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:26,976
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

517
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:31,525
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

518
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:34,814
...I wanted a guy with...

519
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:39,532
...Iooks, security, caring.

520
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:42,406
Someone with their own place.

521
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:47,329
Someone who said "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

522
00:51:47,502 --> 00:51:51,546
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

523
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:54,419
And someone who loves me.

524
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:59,044
-Tall order.
-Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

525
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,718
What is it now?

526
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:06,559
Someone who says "gesundheit, "
although I prefer "bless you."

527
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:08,471
It's nicer.

528
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:12,480
-Janet, sorry you had to wait.
-Dr. Jamison.

529
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:14,853
This is my friend, Steve.

530
00:52:15,113 --> 00:52:18,279
-Doctor.
-Hi, Steve. Come on in.

531
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:21,610
Hey, last chance.

532
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,495
Here we go.

533
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:32,291
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

534
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:36,247
...in three years of being an HMO.

535
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:41,797
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

536
00:52:42,056 --> 00:52:43,929
I think you're perfect.

537
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:49,812
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate
you the way you are, then ask:

538
00:52:50,064 --> 00:52:55,105
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

539
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,812
Wow.

540
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:00,610
What's that mean, "wow"?

541
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:04,573
-Did my check bounce?
-No.

542
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,405
Janet...

543
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:10,748
...I really have
a feeling about you.

544
00:53:12,837 --> 00:53:16,704
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

545
00:53:16,924 --> 00:53:18,881
Okay.

546
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:24,588
-I still feel good about what I said.
-Oh, no, you should. It's good.

547
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:31,263
-Can I say something to you?
-Sure.

548
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:34,980
Your face wants
a different part, your hair.

549
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:39,183
-My hair?
-Yeah.

550
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:43,741
Yeah, there you go.

551
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:46,109
Now you look vaguely rocking.

552
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:49,116
You are a happening guy, you know?

553
00:53:49,332 --> 00:53:52,083
You're Dr. Jamison.

554
00:53:52,335 --> 00:53:58,503
You've got nice eyes, and you've got
those great trustworthy eyebrows...

555
00:53:58,716 --> 00:54:03,045
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

556
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:05,088
Yeah.

557
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:07,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:12,891
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

559
00:54:13,148 --> 00:54:15,603
See, I don't know how to have fun.

560
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:20,236
I'm 33 years old, and I don't
know how to have fun.

561
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:30,199
There. Now was that fun or what?

562
00:54:30,873 --> 00:54:33,031
Yeah, that was fun.

563
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:51,466
-Doc.
-Yeah, I know, the operation.

564
00:54:56,565 --> 00:55:00,229
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

565
00:55:03,364 --> 00:55:05,023
Thanks.

566
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:13,453
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

567
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:19,044
High in the sky, the only
male bees, the drones...

568
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:22,795
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

569
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:26,465
Man, where are the anthems
of our youth?

570
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:30,175
What happened to music
that meant something?

571
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:34,014
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

572
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:40,805
Where is the "Misty Mountain Hop"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

573
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,477
-We're not going out tonight, are we?
-Look at this.

574
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:52,322
These bands are bottles of bleach.
It's beer and lifestyle music.

575
00:55:52,747 --> 00:55:56,993
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

576
00:55:57,251 --> 00:56:00,086
...I don't know, I mean, what?

577
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:03,461
We could just take a bath.

578
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:09,053
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

579
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:12,714
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

580
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,800
The alarm is sounded.

581
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:30,117
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend...

582
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:37,660
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

583
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:44,286
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.

584
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:56,052
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

585
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:05,148
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

586
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:41,509
Hi!

587
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:46,646
Hi, did I overreact?

588
00:57:47,153 --> 00:57:49,228
Do you know who this is?

589
00:58:19,602 --> 00:58:23,765
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

590
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:30,528
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

591
00:58:30,696 --> 00:58:36,734
I can't fiigure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

592
00:58:37,077 --> 00:58:42,747
-I'm a bit late this month, that's all.
-Well, how...? How late?

593
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:46,585
Late.

594
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:07,483
-Steve Dunne.
-Yeah.

595
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:10,064
Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.

596
00:59:10,236 --> 00:59:14,529
-What is up? How you doing, man?
-Okay, man.

597
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:17,777
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

598
00:59:17,994 --> 00:59:22,323
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

599
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,035
We're throwing down tonight
on Aloha Street. It's gonna be insane.

600
00:59:27,211 --> 00:59:29,998
-Would you do some wheels of steel?
-Oh, no.

601
00:59:30,256 --> 00:59:31,798
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

602
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:37,168
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

603
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:50,184
You're the best, man!
You are the king.

604
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:54,269
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

605
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,242
Of course, you may be busy.

606
01:00:01,204 --> 01:00:04,703
Ten minutes and we pour
X into B. If it's blue...

607
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:08,664
-Then we have a big talk.
-Yeah.

608
01:00:13,966 --> 01:00:18,295
-I have some time right now.
-Then let's talk right now.

609
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:22,303
-My body knows it's going to be blue.
-It's not gonna be blue.

610
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:24,723
-It won't be blue.
-You're right.

611
01:00:24,894 --> 01:00:29,187
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

612
01:00:31,484 --> 01:00:36,822
-Do you know where my other shoes are?
-No, maybe they're by the door.

613
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:39,404
-That would be wild.
-What?

614
01:00:39,617 --> 01:00:42,107
Having a kid.

615
01:00:43,538 --> 01:00:47,238
-lf you were pregnant.
-lf I were pregnant, but I'm not.

616
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:51,621
And I would not expect you
to deal with it anyway.

617
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:55,338
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

618
01:00:59,095 --> 01:01:01,632
To friendship.

619
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:12,271
-That's bluish, right?
-It's fairly blue.

620
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:15,098
-Well...
-Put it against something blue.

621
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:18,314
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

622
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:22,908
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

623
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:32,533
-What are you gonna do today?
-Meet the deputy mayor.

624
01:01:32,712 --> 01:01:38,465
-Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
-I have stuff to do. Do, or call you...

625
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:40,046
-Okay.
-Bye.

626
01:01:40,303 --> 01:01:42,710
-Bye.
-Bye.

627
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:47,844
-Finally...
-Interesting.

628
01:01:48,102 --> 01:01:54,305
...if we get the single car driver on
the supertrain, we can change the city.

629
01:01:54,566 --> 01:01:57,317
It's all in the proposal.

630
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:07,120
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

631
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:11,078
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

632
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:13,072
Thank you.

633
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:19,455
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

634
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:25,137
I'd kind of like to leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

635
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:30,342
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

636
01:02:33,064 --> 01:02:35,934
All right, these
are the men who want me.

637
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,692
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

638
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:45,317
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

639
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:49,739
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

640
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:55,080
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

641
01:02:55,336 --> 01:03:00,543
I'm a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise.

642
01:03:00,758 --> 01:03:03,842
If two people really
believe in each other...

643
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:07,794
...love can go around the world
and through their souls.

644
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:10,090
But love is very delicate.

645
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:14,638
In fact, if you're both not very
nurturing, that love can:

646
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:18,059
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

647
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:22,859
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

648
01:03:23,072 --> 01:03:26,156
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

649
01:03:26,325 --> 01:03:31,319
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

650
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:35,202
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

651
01:03:35,418 --> 01:03:40,756
I am very, very, very lonely.

652
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:51,596
-Who?
-Definitely the bicycle guy.

653
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:53,718
The bicycle guy.

654
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:57,014
He's like your soul mate.

655
01:03:57,272 --> 01:03:58,849
Guy with the bicycle.

656
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:20,163
Nice outfit.

657
01:04:20,546 --> 01:04:23,297
-Is he late?
-Yeah.

658
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:27,878
-Yeah, but I expect the best.
-Yeah.

659
01:04:28,137 --> 01:04:32,798
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

660
01:04:32,975 --> 01:04:36,390
-There's another Sea Merchant?
-Yeah, the new one.

661
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:38,228
Oh, no.

662
01:04:39,398 --> 01:04:42,185
-On your right!
-On your right!

663
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:46,855
-On your right!
-On your right!

664
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:04,294
Was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

665
01:05:04,507 --> 01:05:07,294
Yes, and he left you a message:

666
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:11,922
"I got your address from Expect
the Best. I'll be at your house."

667
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:15,009
He was hot.

668
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:30,739
Desperation, it's the world's
worst cologne.

669
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:35,324
-Lot of salt.
-You are good at that.

670
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,784
-This is the key to popcorn.
-Is it?

671
01:05:37,957 --> 01:05:40,910
-Swirl with the bowl.
-Good, put the bowl down.

672
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:43,706
-Let's make some more.
-You want more?

673
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,168
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

674
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:00,686
-More popcorn.
-Stop, stop, stop.

675
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:03,060
-What, what, what?
-Stop, stop, stop.

676
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:05,308
-Want more?
-How does this work?

677
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,861
-Do you want butter?
-Do I want butter?

678
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,274
-Hi.
-Hi.

679
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:12,321
-Debbie.
-Jamie.

680
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:17,408
-Wow, you represent well in real life.
-Thanks a lot. So do you.

681
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:18,865
Thank you.

682
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,407
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

683
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:25,704
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

684
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:28,625
-Pamela. I'm Pamela.
-Oh, you're Pamela.

685
01:06:28,842 --> 01:06:33,337
Pam-ela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

686
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:38,844
-No, Jamie and l, we're making popcorn.
-Yeah, popcorn with Kermit.

687
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:43,009
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

688
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,563
-Just for a second.
-Okay. All right.

689
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:48,061
-Okay.
-See you.

690
01:06:48,235 --> 01:06:49,515
Sure.

691
01:06:52,198 --> 01:06:56,575
-We always said, separate lives, Pam.
-It's no biggie, all right?

692
01:06:56,744 --> 01:07:00,077
-It's a major biggie!
-Look, I knew him first.

693
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:03,989
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

694
01:07:04,752 --> 01:07:08,535
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

695
01:07:08,756 --> 01:07:12,041
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

696
01:07:12,509 --> 01:07:17,503
-I make popcorn with whomever I want.
-You've done it with half the city!

697
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:20,599
At least I don't have to chase
the popcorn.

698
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,554
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

699
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:30,776
Remember how you told me to
tell you when you're being plastic?

700
01:07:31,028 --> 01:07:33,103
This is so unfair.

701
01:07:33,364 --> 01:07:35,985
-How much do you want for him?
-$200.

702
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:38,900
-Outrageous.
-That's what I paid.

703
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,529
-Seventy-five.
-150.

704
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:42,739
80 and I'll do the dishes all month.

705
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:43,947
-Deal.
-Deal.

706
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,204
-Fine.
-Fine.

707
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:54,603
-We need to talk.
-I think we do.

708
01:07:54,775 --> 01:07:56,767
There's something I need to say.

709
01:07:56,944 --> 01:07:59,316
-Let's get married...
-You want out.

710
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:03,191
Everyone's together
for the wrong reasons...

711
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:07,659
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

712
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:09,323
-Oh, God.
-What?

713
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,291
Don't make me remember
this chilidog.

714
01:08:12,543 --> 01:08:17,038
Remember it. Make that
a historic chilidog.

715
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:20,507
Take your time. Think about it.

716
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:27,046
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

717
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,225
-I want to be logical.
-Okay.

718
01:08:33,397 --> 01:08:36,066
Say we're married, we have the kid...

719
01:08:36,317 --> 01:08:41,274
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

720
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:45,907
I've got that coastal trip to Alaska,
and you've got your thing.

721
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:51,318
I want to be logical. I think
I can love you and still be logical.

722
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:55,198
What? What is that look?

723
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,830
Someone who really cares about you
must scare you to death.

724
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:05,212
Forget logic.

725
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:08,381
What's in your heart?

726
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:14,186
I want to do it.

727
01:09:14,813 --> 01:09:18,228
-This is life telling us something.
-So that's a yes?

728
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,104
Yes.

729
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:26,398
-You're gonna feel good about this.
-Oh, really?

730
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:33,243
Mom, I wanna get out!
Mom, can't we get out?

731
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:37,164
-Did we make the right decision?
-I don't know.

732
01:09:37,336 --> 01:09:39,909
Please, Mom!

733
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,161
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:42,412
-Yes.
-Yes.

735
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:46,965
Xavier McDaniel
made the All-Star team.

736
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:49,930
-Why does he pick fights with players?
-Like?

737
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,262
Like Charles Barkley.

738
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:55,139
-That's a Bobby Van.
-Who's Bobby Van?

739
01:09:55,562 --> 01:09:58,598
He was the host of Make Me Laugh.

740
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:05,650
I never got to finish
that chilidog, you know?

741
01:10:05,822 --> 01:10:09,155
That light's on yellow
way too long.

742
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:21,327
You, okay?

743
01:10:22,673 --> 01:10:24,464
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

744
01:10:24,716 --> 01:10:26,673
Are you all right?

745
01:10:26,927 --> 01:10:30,093
Are you all right? Let's get out.

746
01:10:30,263 --> 01:10:31,970
Come on, let's get out.

747
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:35,926
James.

748
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:38,723
James.

749
01:10:41,442 --> 01:10:45,735
-Who's James?
-I don't know.

750
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:48,446
Honey?

751
01:10:48,782 --> 01:10:54,368
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

752
01:10:54,955 --> 01:10:59,949
-This a conversation you had earlier?
-Yes.

753
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,621
It's a good sign.

754
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:05,455
-What?
-Hey.

755
01:11:05,716 --> 01:11:07,791
-Hey.
-Hi.

756
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:11,751
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

757
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:21,393
I lost it, right? It's all over.

758
01:11:24,902 --> 01:11:30,690
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

759
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:35,077
-Linda?
-I lost the baby.

760
01:11:36,747 --> 01:11:38,538
Will you look at me?

761
01:11:43,086 --> 01:11:47,213
I was flunking high school,
overweight, had a dead-end job.

762
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:52,341
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

763
01:11:52,513 --> 01:11:53,544
-Hey.
-Hi.

764
01:11:53,722 --> 01:11:58,716
-How are you doing today?
-I'm better. I'm better.

765
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:03,187
I think I've read every
single magazine in the world.

766
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:08,183
-Did you go to work today?
-No. It's been two weeks.

767
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:11,361
I think they're going to fire me.

768
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:18,913
-I need some time alone.
-Alone?

769
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:21,156
Yeah.

770
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:26,370
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

771
01:12:33,011 --> 01:12:36,426
I think I should take
that research trip.

772
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:43,261
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

773
01:12:43,647 --> 01:12:46,517
I know I'm right about this.

774
01:12:46,775 --> 01:12:50,558
It's just a month. It's just work.

775
01:12:53,156 --> 01:12:54,733
See you in a month!

776
01:12:56,326 --> 01:12:58,899
I'll miss you!

777
01:13:05,753 --> 01:13:09,168
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

778
01:13:09,965 --> 01:13:15,303
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes. Come on.

779
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:20,637
-Hey. This'll be great.
-Oh.

780
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:23,762
You're gonna love me for this.

781
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,767
I installed your new stereo.

782
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:36,406
Oh. Great.

783
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:55,623
Yeah.

784
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:05,433
Yeah.

785
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:30,331
-I'll replace the windows.
-Thanks.

786
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:58,906
Work. Work has never been better.

787
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,527
I miss her.

788
01:15:09,793 --> 01:15:13,707
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

789
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:31,312
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome back.

790
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:33,141
-You look great.
-You too.

791
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,641
How are you? How was it?

792
01:15:35,819 --> 01:15:37,478
-It was really good.
-Yeah?

793
01:15:37,654 --> 01:15:38,898
Yeah, really good.

794
01:15:39,072 --> 01:15:42,357
-You want to go home? Out someplace?
-Whatever.

795
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:48,322
-Let me think of the place...
-There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

796
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:53,325
-The 3-2-1? We could go... Or Costas...
-Whatever. I don't really care.

797
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:04,634
Jesus. We both could sink
from all the pressure in the air.

798
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,265
I know.

799
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:10,845
-I really got into my job again.
-Me too. I was working my ass off.

800
01:16:11,104 --> 01:16:15,433
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

801
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:17,850
That's great.

802
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:24,026
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

803
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:28,371
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

804
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:35,289
Great.

805
01:16:36,546 --> 01:16:38,787
Friends.

806
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:45,505
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

807
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,435
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

808
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:10,489
That obnoxious mime?
Was right. Love disappears.

809
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:05,794
-Come on, man!
-Let's go!

810
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:07,511
We got people out here!

811
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:11,427
-Hello.
-I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

812
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:17,934
Linda. It's me. I had to call you.

813
01:18:18,106 --> 01:18:21,688
It's about midnight. I was just
having many beers and...

814
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:24,351
...I wanted to say...

815
01:18:25,322 --> 01:18:27,943
What I should have said at the dock.

816
01:18:28,117 --> 01:18:34,237
I fucking chickened out. I lied when
I acted casual, like Mr. Casual...

817
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:37,035
...and I should have said it.

818
01:18:37,584 --> 01:18:44,250
You belong with me!

819
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:47,800
We belong together and...

820
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:51,504
...and what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

821
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:54,801
...I proposed only because
you were pregnant.

822
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,017
I've got to go piss!

823
01:18:57,187 --> 01:19:00,935
-I've got to go...
-Hey, this is not the bathroom!

824
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:06,102
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

825
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:11,403
I think we made a big mistake because
we had good times and bad times...

826
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:13,403
...but we had times.

827
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:17,196
And I would like to start over.

828
01:19:17,374 --> 01:19:20,125
I would like to be new to you.

829
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:24,338
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New...

830
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:29,463
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

831
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:39,475
And if you really needed to know how
I really feel, that's it. I love you.

832
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:43,346
And... That's something
you should know, so...

833
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:55,410
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

834
01:19:55,578 --> 01:20:00,204
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

835
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:22,929
This thing just eats tapes.

836
01:20:33,283 --> 01:20:39,949
We're talking about 900,000 to
a million people by the time it's done.

837
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:45,455
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

838
01:20:45,628 --> 01:20:50,005
-So it's a train.
-A supertrain.

839
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:53,341
I've been burned by this
train business before.

840
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:57,260
-You people all seem to forget.
-We can change this city.

841
01:20:57,432 --> 01:20:59,720
People love their cars.

842
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,557
Yes. But...

843
01:21:04,731 --> 01:21:07,304
-But if you give them great...
-Coffee.

844
01:21:07,484 --> 01:21:10,733
Coffee... And great music. If you...

845
01:21:10,988 --> 01:21:16,361
I'll put it to you like this, and then
I'll thank you for your time.

846
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:18,277
My answer is...

847
01:21:19,705 --> 01:21:21,744
...no.

848
01:22:03,999 --> 01:22:05,409
Hi. May I help you?

849
01:22:05,751 --> 01:22:11,290
Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los
Angeles, first class, please. And...

850
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:17,967
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

851
01:22:21,099 --> 01:22:24,183
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

852
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,058
Thank you.

853
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:34,815
Tell me everything there is to know
about you.

854
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:37,978
I've got a special feeling about you.

855
01:22:38,909 --> 01:22:42,609
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

856
01:22:42,787 --> 01:22:46,950
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
Dad picks him up.

857
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:50,576
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

858
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:53,625
Look at those fantastic earrings.

859
01:22:55,342 --> 01:23:00,798
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

860
01:23:04,142 --> 01:23:05,684
Got back two weeks ago.

861
01:23:05,852 --> 01:23:09,434
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

862
01:23:09,606 --> 01:23:13,817
...she sends back, just to be
mysterious. I don't know, games.

863
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:16,108
He wants her to move to Mexico...

864
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,775
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

865
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:30,952
Oh, thanks.

866
01:23:34,214 --> 01:23:40,548
Tomorrow, I gotta spell her name in
rose petals. Do you believe this job?

867
01:24:10,626 --> 01:24:13,710
It's so easy to fall back into
old patterns.

868
01:24:13,879 --> 01:24:17,082
Back with Andy. One week
and we're already like...

869
01:24:17,257 --> 01:24:23,129
...one of those old couples, who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

870
01:24:23,304 --> 01:24:25,011
What am I doing?

871
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:27,968
Why did I chicken out?

872
01:24:30,688 --> 01:24:32,098
Do you have the...?

873
01:24:38,403 --> 01:24:44,523
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

874
01:24:45,702 --> 01:24:48,821
At least I'm not out there dating.

875
01:24:48,997 --> 01:24:53,705
-Love you.
-Love you too.

876
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:03,272
-What?
-Hi.

877
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:04,561
Hey.

878
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,616
Hey. I was worried about you.

879
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:22,331
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

880
01:26:22,591 --> 01:26:25,710
Steve, I think you're
going through a phase.

881
01:26:25,885 --> 01:26:28,921
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

882
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:34,339
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

883
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,927
-At all.
-Steve, you're wigging.

884
01:26:38,273 --> 01:26:41,641
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

885
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:50,575
This is hang time. I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.

886
01:26:50,744 --> 01:26:54,326
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

887
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:58,449
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

888
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:04,499
...how I listened to my instincts, and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

889
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:09,466
Well, I just wanted to bring you
your mail.

890
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:16,092
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you, but...

891
01:27:16,269 --> 01:27:18,938
...things do turn around, Steve.

892
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:22,936
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

893
01:27:23,193 --> 01:27:25,862
I'm having the best time,
on my terms.

894
01:27:26,029 --> 01:27:29,113
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

895
01:27:29,366 --> 01:27:31,073
-Really?
-Yeah.

896
01:27:31,493 --> 01:27:34,992
Got all my architecture classes.
My first project is...

897
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:38,614
...redesigning the fountain so we
can sit in it.

898
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,875
-That's good news.
-It is.

899
01:27:45,382 --> 01:27:50,542
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

900
01:27:51,013 --> 01:27:55,805
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

901
01:27:56,059 --> 01:27:57,885
Forget it.

902
01:27:58,145 --> 01:28:00,682
Tell you what.

903
01:28:00,855 --> 01:28:03,524
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

904
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:09,480
...something good and nice that I
want to share with you or something...

905
01:28:09,657 --> 01:28:12,527
I will knock four times, okay?

906
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:17,611
It's gonna be our secret code.

907
01:28:17,789 --> 01:28:20,540
-How?
-Okay? What?

908
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:21,823
-How?
-How what?

909
01:28:22,002 --> 01:28:24,041
How will you knock?

910
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:26,121
Oh.

911
01:28:28,258 --> 01:28:31,840
Like that.

912
01:28:32,011 --> 01:28:34,169
Okay.

913
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:40,308
Take care of yourself, Steve. Please.

914
01:28:57,161 --> 01:29:00,825
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a great couple.

915
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:04,958
But in this one...

916
01:29:05,128 --> 01:29:06,408
Neighbors.

917
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,154
-Hi.
-Hi.

918
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:43,533
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

919
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:44,739
I know.

920
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:51,083
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

921
01:29:55,595 --> 01:30:01,348
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

922
01:30:01,518 --> 01:30:05,681
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

923
01:30:05,855 --> 01:30:10,397
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

924
01:30:10,818 --> 01:30:14,815
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

925
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:18,026
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

926
01:30:21,288 --> 01:30:25,367
-Cliff, what are you talking about?
-I don't know.

927
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:32,209
I miss you. The way
you used to look at me...

928
01:30:32,465 --> 01:30:36,592
-Don't. I'm finally over you.
-Really?

929
01:30:36,845 --> 01:30:42,717
Yeah. I mean, you know, I still really
do like you, you know?

930
01:30:43,143 --> 01:30:45,930
I think you're very...

931
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:48,272
What?

932
01:30:48,982 --> 01:30:50,013
Entertaining.

933
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:56,613
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

934
01:30:58,074 --> 01:31:00,564
Janet, you rock my world.

935
01:31:55,674 --> 01:32:00,881
I'm walking down the avenue

936
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:09,802
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

937
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:17,935
I'm laughing at the people I see

938
01:32:18,447 --> 01:32:24,567
Something like that. I'm playing
with the lyrics. It's not set in stone.

939
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:28,576
Give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

940
01:32:28,748 --> 01:32:31,238
...but give me a call, huh?

941
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,464
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.

942
01:32:38,717 --> 01:32:40,958
Here we go.

943
01:33:02,865 --> 01:33:05,023
Hi.

944
01:33:05,202 --> 01:33:08,701
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

945
01:33:12,834 --> 01:33:17,329
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

946
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:21,882
What took you so long?

947
01:33:24,095 --> 01:33:25,838
I was stuck in traffic.

948
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:22,396
Well, that's the way it happens.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

949
01:34:22,571 --> 01:34:24,812
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

950
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,904
-Coming down. Look out.
-No problem.

951
01:34:29,077 --> 01:34:34,865
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

952
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:38,540
For a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

953
01:34:38,711 --> 01:34:43,668
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

954
01:34:43,842 --> 01:34:49,002
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

955
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:52,715
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

956
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:03,941
-Hey.
-Hey. Going out?

957
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:08,275
-Yep. You?
-Yeah.

958
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:14,322
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

959
01:35:14,498 --> 01:35:16,905
Thanks.

960
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:24,164
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

961
01:35:44,235 --> 01:35:46,607
Does everybody go through this?

962
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,946
No, I think, just us.

963
01:35:50,116 --> 01:35:52,155
I'm going to be celibate forever.

964
01:35:52,327 --> 01:35:55,162
I could spend my life with that person.

965
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:58,366
-All you see is her head, Tommy.
-I know my type.

966
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:02,124
-Met someone new today.
-She's more my type than yours.

967
01:36:02,295 --> 01:36:06,506
-You always say they're your type.
-Tell me I'm not like Shelly.

968
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:09,675
-She should try living alone...
-lt took two dates...

969
01:36:09,844 --> 01:36:12,513
Hi, it's me. I just thought I'd call...

970
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:17,887
-You said that I said...
-I don't play games.

971
01:36:19,355 --> 01:36:21,810
I can't believe I feel this way!
