1
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,804
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:22,644
No dorm, no roommates,
my own place. I was so happy.

3
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:27,901
I had my own parking space.

4
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,462
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

5
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:53,337
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

6
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,695
-Hello.
-Need some help?

7
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:15,400
No, l...
Well, yeah, thanks.

8
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,826
I'm from Spain.

9
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:30,618
-Really? Which part?
-Galicia.

10
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:34,414
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

11
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:38,837
"U-Dub."
That's what people call it here.

12
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,843
Finally, a local tells me
some secrets.

13
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:47,889
You don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

14
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,303
Where else do I have to go?

15
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:55,687
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

16
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,067
U-Dub.

17
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:33,424
This is Linda Powell from
the Seattle Environmental Council.

18
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:36,141
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

19
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:40,526
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

20
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:43,564
We gotta get somebody out there...

21
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:47,438
Ruth, how long have I been saying
there are no guys?

22
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,992
Forever.

23
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,943
I met one. I met one
when I was least expecting it.

24
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,616
You held out on me.

25
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,411
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

26
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:01,451
His visa runs out in two days. He's...

27
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:05,628
He's like a comet. What do I do?

28
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,009
I wish you could stay.

29
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:12,304
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

30
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,850
-Were you ever gonna come back?
-Well, now I have a reason.

31
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:23,189
I want you to have this.

32
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:28,855
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

33
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,904
But this is a symbol of our future.

34
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:41,744
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

35
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:51,499
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

36
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,134
It's important to me.

37
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,591
Use this when you get back.

38
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:06,934
You'll always have a parking space.

39
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,026
Hello.

40
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:27,415
Don't wake up. I'm getting
on the plane. I wanted to say bye.

41
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:34,249
-I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
-Goodbye, honey. I miss you already.

42
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,375
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

43
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:46,673
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

44
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:48,472
"Basics"?

45
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:54,183
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

46
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,767
You're talking
about marrying this guy?

47
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:01,236
I'm tired of all the games.

48
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,279
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

49
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,198
-We will always go out dancing.
-What?!

50
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,116
We will always go out dancing!

51
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:17,264
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

52
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:22,309
Here's the Liftrex and the Liftrex
Super. Might be more than you need.

53
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,682
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

54
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:29,440
...garage-door opener combo.

55
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:34,531
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

56
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:51,203
I recently broke up with Jennifer,
my last girlfriend.

57
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,666
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

58
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,303
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

59
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,303
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

60
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,018
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

61
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:10,809
Now she's with Tony.

62
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:16,981
Tony knows my friend Bailey, who's
friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

63
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:20,523
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

64
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,483
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

65
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:28,030
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

66
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,741
Tony will tell Jennifer I was
dating Rita when I was with her.

67
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:35,500
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

68
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:41,670
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

69
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,756
Isn't that great?

70
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,345
I don't know. I think...

71
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,893
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

72
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:02,103
I'm back to the beginning.

73
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,445
My dad left home when I was 8.
He said to me:

74
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:09,198
"Have fun. Stay single."

75
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,660
I was 8.

76
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:16,661
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

77
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,996
He was from Boston.

78
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:23,459
The father and the mother
have finally learned to come together.

79
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:27,581
The father inserts his penis...

80
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:31,758
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

81
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:39,433
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

82
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:45,393
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

83
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,735
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

84
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,824
-What?
-Yeah, what comes out?

85
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:57,492
-Spam!
-Oh, man!

86
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,455
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

87
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:09,704
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

88
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:13,796
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

89
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,296
Work.

90
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,340
I gotta go.

91
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:50,538
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

92
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:55,373
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

93
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,384
Here I am, 23.

94
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,419
Things are...
They're basically the same.

95
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,215
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

96
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:11,552
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

97
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,772
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.

98
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:36,750
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

99
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:48,631
He's like a Renaissance man.

100
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:51,428
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

101
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:14,410
Janet. What's the ordeal?

102
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:19,746
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday but...

103
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,619
So I just thought I'd come by
and say, hi.

104
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,294
-Hi.
-Hey.

105
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:30,677
-So how about this weekend?
-This weekend we're really busy.

106
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,133
-We got that show, right?
-Yeah, that show.

107
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,092
-We got these guys coming from L.A.
-Great.

108
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,674
-It's gonna be rocking.
-Bye, Cliff.

109
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:41,343
-So come over after.
-Deal.

110
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:47,770
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

111
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:50,939
You do know that, don't you?

112
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,737
You don't fool me.

113
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:58,075
Janet, I could not
be fooling you less.

114
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:01,662
Cliff, you gotta move your truck, man.

115
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,826
I know what you're thinking.
We connected.

116
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:09,497
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

117
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:14,499
So sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it's real. This is real.

118
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:17,843
We just don't even have to discuss it.

119
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:21,882
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

120
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,851
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

121
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:44,369
So I'll see you Saturday, and then
I'll help you with your speakers.

122
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,912
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

123
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:57,914
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

124
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:01,633
I can store 20 numbers.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

125
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:05,088
All or nothing.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

126
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:10,099
What if the super you meets the super
her, and the super her rejects you?

127
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,760
-Then it's no problem.
-Why?

128
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:16,521
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

129
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,977
-I live my life like a French movie.
-What?

130
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,275
Webster and 24th, it should be here.

131
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,743
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

132
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:33,873
Hey, man...

133
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,282
...where's De Soto?

134
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:42,247
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

135
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:46,291
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

136
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,966
Where's De Soto? Our car broke down.

137
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:57,310
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

138
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:01,726
When I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

139
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,355
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

140
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,279
Maybe I've been hurt,
or I've been dogged!

141
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:11,360
-Know where this place is?
-Do I look like a Thomas Guide?

142
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,822
-You really shouldn't speak.
-Yes.

143
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,320
-Where do you work?
-I'm a maître d' .

144
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,830
-Department of Transportation.
-Solving the gridlock.

145
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,288
I build airplanes.

146
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,546
-Hey.
-Hello.

147
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:07,472
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

148
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,309
He says when you're
at a place like this...

149
00:18:10,476 --> 00:18:13,725
...you can't just be yourself,
you need an act.

150
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:16,517
So anyway, I saw you standing there...

151
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:20,267
...so I thought,
A: I could just leave you alone.

152
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:26,695
B: I could come up with an act,
or C: I could just be myself.

153
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,239
I chose C.

154
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,900
What do you think?

155
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:36,372
I think that
A: You have an act...

156
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:41,452
...and that
B: Not having an act is your act.

157
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,964
Thank you.

158
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:57,350
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

159
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,302
I don't like to reduce us just
to being part of Seattle.

160
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,852
I think of us expanding more.

161
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,811
We're huge in Europe right now.

162
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:10,983
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

163
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:20,698
A song like "Touch Me, I'm Dick"
is about what?

164
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:25,001
I think "Touch Me, I'm Dick, "
in essence, speaks for itself.

165
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,830
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

166
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,666
It's about, you know...

167
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:35,506
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

168
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,430
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

169
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:42,180
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

170
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:46,684
-Hey, excuse me! Hello.
-Hi.

171
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:49,477
-Want to meet up later?
-Where you going?

172
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,769
-Anywhere you're going.
-Anywhere you're going.

173
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,854
-We're going home.
-Going home.

174
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,149
-Do you have a...?
-See you.

175
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,364
"Anywhere you're going."

176
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:04,406
Always get their numbers.
I got 20 numbers.

177
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:05,944
Twenty numbers.

178
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:10,536
Bailey, you got 20 numbers
of 20 girls that you will never call...

179
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,711
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

180
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:19,005
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

181
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,465
-Watch the volume.
-Sorry. Tinnitus.

182
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:25,682
-Club disease.
-You kids are all going to be deaf.

183
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,047
Bailey.

184
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,767
This is my night.

185
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,137
-What?
-Look.

186
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,222
Linda, don't look over.

187
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:25,484
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

188
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,859
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

189
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,655
-It was a joke.
-I know. I know.

190
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:37,074
You think it's something desperate
people do. You are wrong!

191
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,661
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

192
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,587
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

193
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,921
-Your medication, Miss Hunt.
-Thank you.

194
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,507
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

195
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,718
My roommate has no domestic...
Guys just don't know...

196
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:03,429
-Did you get the tunnel stuff?
-I'll call you back.

197
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:07,899
The l-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

198
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:11,353
The Times asked why
there's gridlock on the l-5.

199
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,732
It's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio."

200
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:17,529
Did you read my proposal?
What'd you think?

201
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:20,453
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

202
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:21,819
-Stu?
-After lunch.

203
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:24,571
After lunch, okay. After lunch, Stu.

204
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,035
-Ted, what's up?
-Making music with my fingers.

205
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:31,545
And what a beautiful sound it is.

206
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:44,265
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

207
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:48,811
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

208
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,981
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

209
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,435
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

210
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,154
Coffee?

211
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:00,609
Water? How about some water?

212
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:05,409
I'll meet you where you're having
lunch, and we'll have some water.

213
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:09,665
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

214
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:14,044
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

215
00:23:14,212 --> 00:23:20,415
And now... And now
with all the Exxon kickbacks, it's...

216
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:23,926
-God, yes. The worst.
-Yes.

217
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:28,923
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

218
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:32,469
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

219
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,602
I think it will work out.

220
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:42,979
-What?
-There's just no privacy anymore.

221
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,855
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

222
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,283
-Me too.
-My God.

223
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,529
Do you know what time it is?

224
00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:54,698
-Yeah, 3:30.
-Oh, I'm so late.

225
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,041
-I'm glad your lunch date didn't show.
-Me too.

226
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:01,875
-Did you really have a lunch date?
-No.

227
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:05,165
-Maybe...
-I'm getting over somebody.

228
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:09,006
-Nothing big.
-I think it's a bad time to get...

229
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,922
-Okay.
-Okay.

230
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:15,133
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.

231
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,761
Okay. Thanks.

232
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,402
Thanks.

233
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:47,169
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

234
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:50,125
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

235
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,795
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

236
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,177
I like this girl.

237
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,880
Gotta handle this one really well.

238
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,222
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

239
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:09,390
-You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
-Thanks.

240
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,946
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

241
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:21,781
That some jerk could trash the Mona
Lisa or an ocean or someone's life.

242
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,539
So who are your neighbors?

243
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:31,243
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d' .

244
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,090
He keeps us all on free meals.

245
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,415
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

246
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:43,338
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

247
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:50,427
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

248
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:53,689
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

249
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,146
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

250
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,232
She works there too. She's
saving for architecture school.

251
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:02,694
Cliff and Janet.

252
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,530
That's it.

253
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:12,663
You sound like me talking
about my family.

254
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,161
Wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying?

255
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,980
That's a good picture of you.

256
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,350
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic?

257
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:47,238
Because I do, constantly. Traffic
is caused by the single car driver.

258
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:51,071
900,000 single people
get in their cars every morning.

259
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:54,280
They drive and wonder why
there's gridlock.

260
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:58,534
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

261
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:04,212
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Coffee, great music...

262
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:07,215
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

263
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,053
But I still love my car, though.

264
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,378
Well... Oh.

265
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:17,049
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

266
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,847
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

267
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:24,481
-Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
-You dare to rip the X-Man.

268
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:30,736
"Kiss at the Hotel de Ville."
You have this too. I have this.

269
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:35,117
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

270
00:27:38,204 --> 00:27:41,323
-I was a deejay in college.
-Really?

271
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:44,452
That's why I still have records.

272
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:01,765
So any boyfriends?

273
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:05,349
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

274
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:11,601
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

275
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,728
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

276
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:19,949
I made that up. Plus, I got
back together with Lynn last night.

277
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,283
So you probably want to go ahead
and freak out.

278
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:31,034
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

279
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,710
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

280
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:35,960
And then l...

281
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,622
-I'm talking too much.
-No, go ahead.

282
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:42,632
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

283
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:47,846
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

284
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:52,679
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

285
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,226
I was a semester too late.

286
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,119
Hi.

287
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:31,508
Condoms. They're free.

288
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:45,475
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

289
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:47,527
Really?

290
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:52,534
There is so much life in you.

291
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:57,743
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

292
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,452
-I'm Andy.
-I'm Linda.

293
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,626
Emotional larceny?

294
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:10,921
We talked about how passion didn't
matter as much as comfort, stability.

295
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:13,133
-That's bullshit.
-No kidding.

296
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,592
-Sorry.
-It's cool.

297
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:22,101
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

298
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:23,930
I did the same thing.

299
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:28,150
One day, one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back.

300
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:31,484
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

301
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:36,067
-Why did I have to meet you in a club?
-I don't know.

302
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:41,783
Oh, I love this song.

303
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,796
My clothes.

304
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:06,800
This is you?

305
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:10,227
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

306
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,600
-I inherited it.
-Not sure how I feel about that.

307
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,605
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

308
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:22,652
-Okay. I'll call you.
-Okay. Don't forget.

309
00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:24,106
I won't.

310
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,584
Good night.

311
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:46,053
Good night.

312
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:48,379
Good night.

313
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,261
Listen, next time, why don't you...

314
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:00,020
...park underground?

315
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:06,691
I should go.

316
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,847
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

317
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:44,771
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

318
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:07,413
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

319
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:30,476
Burglar, burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar.

320
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:54,077
Neighbors.

321
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,630
It's Andy. Just calling
to make sure you're okay.

322
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,553
I was thinking about the conversation.

323
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:04,591
Trust him, although
he's putting on moves.

324
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:07,719
Passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy.

325
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:10,811
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

326
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,977
I think that you can trust him,
but you certainly want to...

327
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,684
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

328
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:23,108
Starring Fred MacMurray.

329
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:30,453
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

330
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:34,786
-Whenever, whenever.
-You're amazing.

331
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,873
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

332
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:42,083
We're being too loud.

333
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,264
What are you thinking
right now?

334
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:54,180
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

335
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:57,353
Things happen in the game.
Nothing you can do.

336
00:34:57,522 --> 00:35:00,855
I don't go and say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up."

337
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:04,893
-Anything else, X?
-Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

338
00:35:21,544 --> 00:35:27,332
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

339
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:34,715
What can I eat? I'm tired
of starving myself for this guy.

340
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:37,843
Salad. I'll have a salad.

341
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:45,481
If I call him, that's being desperate.

342
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,153
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

343
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:54,986
If he shows up, I'll listen.
No way do I call him.

344
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,944
Of course, men do like to be called.

345
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:05,531
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will
be one hour, and that is very late.

346
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:11,828
He is offiicially very late.

347
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:19,548
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

348
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,679
Two out of three.

349
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,227
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

350
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:40,356
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

351
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:45,194
Forget it. I am not desperate. I have
many people to spend time with.

352
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:50,245
-Quit getting involved with neighbors.
-That broke us up?

353
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,742
-We're better as friends.
-Absolutely.

354
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,999
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

355
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,499
-I know.
-Except when it comes to women.

356
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,676
He likes these club-type women...

357
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,845
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

358
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:11,349
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

359
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:15,348
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

360
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,901
You're from the high plains, Janet.

361
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,071
I'm so glad I live here.

362
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:51,968
-Are my breasts too small for you?
-No.

363
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,472
God.

364
00:38:03,443 --> 00:38:07,654
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

365
00:38:07,822 --> 00:38:13,064
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

366
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:16,113
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

367
00:38:16,288 --> 00:38:19,454
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

368
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:23,206
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

369
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:24,574
You know?

370
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:29,961
Don't lie because when you do, your
eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

371
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:37,766
Okay, ask me.

372
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:42,393
Are my breasts too small for you?

373
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,307
Sometimes.

374
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:13,083
Have you had implants before?

375
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:16,170
What do you think?

376
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,634
No.

377
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:24,213
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

378
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,807
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

379
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:30,551
...by graph. Right.

380
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,889
Well, what's painful?

381
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:37,687
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

382
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,937
...mine in particular.

383
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:45,820
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

384
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:49,155
All right. Bye-bye.

385
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:52,292
-Hi.
-Hi.

386
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:56,795
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

387
00:39:58,173 --> 00:40:02,004
How about that?

388
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:16,060
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

389
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:21,688
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

390
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:30,026
-Whoa. Do you jog?
-A little.

391
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:34,116
See, maybe, here.

392
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:40,042
-Split the difference?
-Split the difference.

393
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:08,110
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing.

394
00:41:08,278 --> 00:41:11,563
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

395
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:17,781
I'm on the bed right now, wearing
something really outrageous.

396
00:41:17,996 --> 00:41:21,530
I've got no underwear on.

397
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:26,291
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

398
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:31,754
I think you've got the wrong number,
lady, but I'll be right over.

399
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:43,225
-This guy plays no games.
-That's great.

400
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:44,680
Yeah.

401
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:48,263
-I've got to play this one perfectly.
-Go with it.

402
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,939
-What do your instincts say?
-Not to listen to you guys.

403
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,359
-There you go.
-Don't tug at her bra strap.

404
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,321
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

405
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:04,697
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

406
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:08,916
-Should I trust him?
-Yeah.

407
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:13,460
-Not all guys are like Luiz.
-You're right.

408
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,833
You're right. Steve is different.

409
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,426
Just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

410
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,174
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

411
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,763
What are you thinking?

412
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:39,402
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

413
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:42,149
My chest hurts.

414
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:46,491
-You didn't, like, leave a note?
-No, I left my blue T-shirt.

415
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:49,786
-There are no mistakes.
-What?

416
00:42:49,996 --> 00:42:53,578
What is that? What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

417
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:58,619
I'm going to call my
new semigirlfriend.

418
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:01,328
You're gonna scare her off.

419
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:04,466
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

420
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:08,418
-Distinguish yourself by not calling.
-Yep.

421
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:13,133
-P.S., that's how you get her.
-No, Bailey, you don't understand.

422
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:18,098
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

423
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:22,897
You're right.

424
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:28,062
I gotta let this one breathe.

425
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:34,408
Yes. You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

426
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,828
-So how'd it go?
-I got the boat.

427
00:43:42,044 --> 00:43:45,246
-The trip to Alaska's set.
-Oh, great, Linda.

428
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,257
-That is great.
-Yeah.

429
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:55,836
-Oh, Steve on two.
-Four days he waits to call me.

430
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:58,761
So, what do I tell him?

431
00:43:58,976 --> 00:44:02,925
-Tell him I went out for groceries.
-Okay.

432
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:05,846
She went out for groceries.

433
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:09,025
Bye-bye.

434
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:11,857
He's coming right over.

435
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,692
-What do you mean, nothing?
-Nothing is wrong.

436
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:17,824
Really. Thanks.

437
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:20,905
-We connected.
-This is a small office.

438
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:24,247
-Is this because I didn't call?
-Did you call?

439
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:27,950
I don't know why you're
being like this. I like you.

440
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:31,496
I'll call you, or you call me.

441
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:44,556
-I'm sorry if I blew it by not calling.
-You don't owe me anything.

442
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:48,260
-Is this about your ex who calls?
-Andy doesn't.

443
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,813
-Ponytail, right?
-No.

444
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:54,441
-Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
-He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

445
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:04,025
-You're scared of getting close to me.
-You don't know me.

446
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,370
-I think I do.
-No, you don't.

447
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,866
Look, let's not play games.

448
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:16,829
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

449
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:22,173
-What I mean is...
-I've gotta work, Steve.

450
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,335
-Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
-Bye, Steve.

451
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,396
Why? Why do you talk such a good game?

452
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:48,188
You talk about things that matter,
that get me excited, that get me hot.

453
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:56,031
But it's like you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?

454
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,958
Why can't I just be a buddy?

455
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:06,000
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

456
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,465
It's better to be the dumper.

457
00:46:08,803 --> 00:46:11,803
Mom... Mom! Yeah.

458
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:17,009
Listen, Mom, if he invited you
to Hawaii, yes, he wants something.

459
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:22,642
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for two years.

460
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:26,022
Listen. Listen, Mom!

461
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:30,820
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

462
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:36,031
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

463
00:46:36,245 --> 00:46:37,904
I rinsed them, Debbie.

464
00:46:38,122 --> 00:46:41,656
You have to rinse off
the food or it gets all over.

465
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:46,536
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

466
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:51,837
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

467
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:02,048
Hi.

468
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:05,891
-This is for Expect the Best, right?
-I brought clippings.

469
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:08,139
Possible looks for my video.

470
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:12,645
Here we have
the Edie Sedgwick. You know?

471
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:17,323
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

472
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:23,743
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

473
00:47:25,498 --> 00:47:30,373
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

474
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:32,913
Truth?

475
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:35,420
Truth.

476
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:43,921
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

477
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,014
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

478
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,765
Twenty.

479
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:58,026
He doesn't even know me.

480
00:47:58,237 --> 00:48:00,229
Debbie...

481
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:04,658
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

482
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:09,570
Okay. Okay, I'm in your hands.

483
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:22,215
I am Debbie Hunt.

484
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:26,460
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

485
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,631
But I am not about looks.

486
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,272
Hi.

487
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,265
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

488
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:48,113
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

489
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,237
Oh, no druggies, please.

490
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:55,822
I'm fairly intense, and
I'm an advertising exec...

491
00:48:55,998 --> 00:49:01,537
...at KRWE-TV. That's me.

492
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:07,588
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

493
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:19,052
Yeah.

494
00:49:21,188 --> 00:49:23,892
"Debbie country." It's funny.

495
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,199
-"Doghouse" as an encore?
-Six songs.

496
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:37,402
-They want me.
-They are just our friends.

497
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,663
-"Doghouse" as an encore.
-You can't start out with that.

498
00:49:41,832 --> 00:49:44,405
Why make them clap
so we come out again?

499
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:47,205
-You don't get it.
-I agree with Cliff.

500
00:49:47,378 --> 00:49:51,291
-Hey, a review of our record.
-Whoa, read it out loud.

501
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:54,211
"When the shirtless Cliff
starts to sing..."

502
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:59,544
Wait a minute, man. I don't
want to hear anything negative.

503
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:01,964
Go on.

504
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:27,078
Other than that, "He was ably backed
by Stone and Jeff...

505
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:31,410
...and drummer Eddie Vedder."
That's good. That's a good review.

506
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:36,501
-A compliment for us is one for you.
-No, man.

507
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:40,255
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

508
00:50:40,427 --> 00:50:43,961
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

509
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:47,673
This weekend, we rock Portland.

510
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:50,802
Yeah!

511
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,558
Okay, are you sure
you want to do this?

512
00:50:58,819 --> 00:51:02,270
Yep. My mind is made up.

513
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:05,027
Want to read a magazine?

514
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:08,532
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

515
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:11,579
I didn't want you to go alone.

516
00:51:22,048 --> 00:51:26,756
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

517
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:31,304
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

518
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:34,593
...I wanted a guy with...

519
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:39,312
...Iooks, security, caring.

520
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:42,185
Someone with their own place.

521
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,108
Someone who said "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

522
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,324
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

523
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,196
And someone who loves me.

524
00:51:55,287 --> 00:51:58,821
-Tall order.
-Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

525
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,495
What is it now?

526
00:52:01,876 --> 00:52:06,336
Someone who says "gesundheit, "
although I prefer "bless you."

527
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,248
It's nicer.

528
00:52:08,507 --> 00:52:12,255
-Janet, sorry you had to wait.
-Dr. Jamison.

529
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,629
This is my friend, Steve.

530
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:18,054
-Doctor.
-Hi, Steve. Come on in.

531
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:21,385
Hey, last chance.

532
00:52:25,898 --> 00:52:28,269
Here we go.

533
00:52:28,484 --> 00:52:32,066
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

534
00:52:32,321 --> 00:52:36,021
...in three years of being an HMO.

535
00:52:36,825 --> 00:52:41,569
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

536
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,703
I think you're perfect.

537
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:49,584
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate
you the way you are, then ask:

538
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:54,878
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

539
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,584
Wow.

540
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:00,382
What's that mean, "wow"?

541
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:04,345
-Did my check bounce?
-No.

542
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:06,176
Janet...

543
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:10,519
...I really have
a feeling about you.

544
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:16,475
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

545
00:53:16,695 --> 00:53:18,651
Okay.

546
00:53:19,698 --> 00:53:24,359
-I still feel good about what I said.
-Oh, no, you should. It's good.

547
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,032
-Can I say something to you?
-Sure.

548
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,749
Your face wants
a different part, your hair.

549
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,952
-My hair?
-Yeah.

550
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,509
Yeah, there you go.

551
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,878
Now you look vaguely rocking.

552
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,883
You are a happening guy, you know?

553
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,850
You're Dr. Jamison.

554
00:53:52,102 --> 00:53:58,270
You've got nice eyes, and you've got
those great trustworthy eyebrows...

555
00:53:58,483 --> 00:54:02,811
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

556
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:04,855
Yeah.

557
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,402
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:54:07,616 --> 00:54:12,657
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

559
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:15,368
See, I don't know how to have fun.

560
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm 33 years old, and I don't
know how to have fun.

561
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:29,963
There. Now was that fun or what?

562
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:32,795
Yeah, that was fun.

563
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,228
-Doc.
-Yeah, I know, the operation.

564
00:54:56,328 --> 00:54:59,992
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

565
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,784
Thanks.

566
00:55:08,422 --> 00:55:13,213
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

567
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,805
High in the sky, the only
male bees, the drones...

568
00:55:19,057 --> 00:55:22,556
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

569
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,225
Man, where are the anthems
of our youth?

570
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:29,934
What happened to music
that meant something?

571
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:33,773
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

572
00:55:33,945 --> 00:55:40,563
Where is the "Misty Mountain Hop"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

573
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:45,236
-We're not going out tonight, are we?
-Look at this.

574
00:55:45,414 --> 00:55:52,080
These bands are bottles of bleach.
It's beer and lifestyle music.

575
00:55:52,504 --> 00:55:56,750
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

576
00:55:57,008 --> 00:55:59,842
...I don't know, I mean, what?

577
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:03,218
We could just take a bath.

578
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:08,809
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

579
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:12,470
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

580
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:15,554
The alarm is sounded.

581
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:29,871
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend...

582
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:37,414
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

583
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:44,039
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.

584
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:55,804
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

585
00:56:58,898 --> 00:57:04,900
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

586
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:41,257
Hi!

587
00:57:41,437 --> 00:57:46,394
Hi, did I overreact?

588
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,975
Do you know who this is?

589
00:58:19,347 --> 00:58:23,510
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

590
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:30,272
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

591
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:36,477
I can't fiigure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

592
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:42,490
-I'm a bit late this month, that's all.
-Well, how...? How late?

593
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,327
Late.

594
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:07,224
-Steve Dunne.
-Yeah.

595
00:59:07,432 --> 00:59:09,803
Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.

596
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:14,269
-What is up? How you doing, man?
-Okay, man.

597
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,516
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

598
00:59:17,733 --> 00:59:22,061
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

599
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:26,774
We're throwing down tonight
on Aloha Street. It's gonna be insane.

600
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,736
-Would you do some wheels of steel?
-Oh, no.

601
00:59:29,995 --> 00:59:31,537
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

602
00:59:31,746 --> 00:59:36,905
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

603
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:49,922
You're the best, man!
You are the king.

604
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,007
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

605
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:57,977
Of course, you may be busy.

606
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,439
Ten minutes and we pour
X into B. If it's blue...

607
01:00:04,651 --> 01:00:08,399
-Then we have a big talk.
-Yeah.

608
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:18,029
-I have some time right now.
-Then let's talk right now.

609
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:22,037
-My body knows it's going to be blue.
-It's not gonna be blue.

610
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,457
-It won't be blue.
-You're right.

611
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:28,921
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

612
01:00:31,217 --> 01:00:36,555
-Do you know where my other shoes are?
-No, maybe they're by the door.

613
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:39,138
-That would be wild.
-What?

614
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,840
Having a kid.

615
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:46,970
-lf you were pregnant.
-lf I were pregnant, but I'm not.

616
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,353
And I would not expect you
to deal with it anyway.

617
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,070
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

618
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:01,363
To friendship.

619
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:12,001
-That's bluish, right?
-It's fairly blue.

620
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:14,828
-Well...
-Put it against something blue.

621
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:18,044
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

622
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,636
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

623
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:32,262
-What are you gonna do today?
-Meet the deputy mayor.

624
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:38,193
-Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
-I have stuff to do. Do, or call you...

625
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:39,774
-Okay.
-Bye.

626
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,437
-Bye.
-Bye.

627
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,571
-Finally...
-Interesting.

628
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:54,032
...if we get the single car driver on
the supertrain, we can change the city.

629
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,044
It's all in the proposal.

630
01:02:02,634 --> 01:02:06,845
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

631
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:10,803
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

632
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:12,797
Thank you.

633
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,179
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

634
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:24,861
I'd kind of like to leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

635
01:02:25,071 --> 01:02:30,065
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

636
01:02:32,787 --> 01:02:35,657
All right, these
are the men who want me.

637
01:02:35,873 --> 01:02:40,415
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

638
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:45,039
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

639
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:49,461
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

640
01:02:49,677 --> 01:02:54,801
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

641
01:02:55,057 --> 01:03:00,263
I'm a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise.

642
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:03,563
If two people really
believe in each other...

643
01:03:03,732 --> 01:03:07,515
...love can go around the world
and through their souls.

644
01:03:07,736 --> 01:03:09,811
But love is very delicate.

645
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:14,357
In fact, if you're both not very
nurturing, that love can:

646
01:03:14,575 --> 01:03:17,777
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

647
01:03:18,037 --> 01:03:22,579
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

648
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:25,875
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

649
01:03:26,044 --> 01:03:31,038
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

650
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:34,921
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

651
01:03:35,136 --> 01:03:40,474
I am very, very, very lonely.

652
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:51,313
-Who?
-Definitely the bicycle guy.

653
01:03:51,609 --> 01:03:53,435
The bicycle guy.

654
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:56,730
He's like your soul mate.

655
01:03:56,989 --> 01:03:58,566
Guy with the bicycle.

656
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:19,878
Nice outfit.

657
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:23,011
-Is he late?
-Yeah.

658
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:27,591
-Yeah, but I expect the best.
-Yeah.

659
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:32,511
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

660
01:04:32,688 --> 01:04:36,103
-There's another Sea Merchant?
-Yeah, the new one.

661
01:04:36,317 --> 01:04:37,941
Oh, no.

662
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:41,897
-On your right!
-On your right!

663
01:04:42,155 --> 01:04:46,567
-On your right!
-On your right!

664
01:05:00,756 --> 01:05:04,005
Was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

665
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:07,003
Yes, and he left you a message:

666
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,632
"I got your address from Expect
the Best. I'll be at your house."

667
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:14,719
He was hot.

668
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:30,448
Desperation, it's the world's
worst cologne.

669
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,032
-Lot of salt.
-You are good at that.

670
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:37,492
-This is the key to popcorn.
-Is it?

671
01:05:37,664 --> 01:05:40,617
-Swirl with the bowl.
-Good, put the bowl down.

672
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:43,413
-Let's make some more.
-You want more?

673
01:05:43,586 --> 01:05:45,874
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

674
01:05:57,558 --> 01:06:00,392
-More popcorn.
-Stop, stop, stop.

675
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,766
-What, what, what?
-Stop, stop, stop.

676
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:05,012
-Want more?
-How does this work?

677
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:08,566
-Do you want butter?
-Do I want butter?

678
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:09,978
-Hi.
-Hi.

679
01:06:10,152 --> 01:06:12,025
-Debbie.
-Jamie.

680
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:17,113
-Wow, you represent well in real life.
-Thanks a lot. So do you.

681
01:06:17,326 --> 01:06:18,570
Thank you.

682
01:06:18,744 --> 01:06:22,112
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

683
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:25,408
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

684
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,329
-Pamela. I'm Pamela.
-Oh, you're Pamela.

685
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:33,039
Pam-ela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

686
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:38,547
-No, Jamie and l, we're making popcorn.
-Yeah, popcorn with Kermit.

687
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:42,712
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

688
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,265
-Just for a second.
-Okay. All right.

689
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:47,763
-Okay.
-See you.

690
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,217
Sure.

691
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:56,275
-We always said, separate lives, Pam.
-It's no biggie, all right?

692
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,778
-It's a major biggie!
-Look, I knew him first.

693
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:03,690
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

694
01:07:04,452 --> 01:07:08,235
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

695
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:11,741
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

696
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:17,203
-I make popcorn with whomever I want.
-You've done it with half the city!

697
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:20,298
At least I don't have to chase
the popcorn.

698
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,253
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

699
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:30,475
Remember how you told me to
tell you when you're being plastic?

700
01:07:30,726 --> 01:07:32,801
This is so unfair.

701
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:35,683
-How much do you want for him?
-$200.

702
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,597
-Outrageous.
-That's what I paid.

703
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:40,227
-Seventy-five.
-150.

704
01:07:40,443 --> 01:07:42,435
80 and I'll do the dishes all month.

705
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:43,643
-Deal.
-Deal.

706
01:07:43,821 --> 01:07:44,900
-Fine.
-Fine.

707
01:07:52,177 --> 01:07:54,299
-We need to talk.
-I think we do.

708
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,463
There's something I need to say.

709
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:59,010
-Let's get married...
-You want out.

710
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:02,887
Everyone's together
for the wrong reasons...

711
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:07,355
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

712
01:08:07,608 --> 01:08:09,018
-Oh, God.
-What?

713
01:08:09,234 --> 01:08:11,985
Don't make me remember
this chilidog.

714
01:08:12,237 --> 01:08:16,732
Remember it. Make that
a historic chilidog.

715
01:08:17,117 --> 01:08:20,201
Take your time. Think about it.

716
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:26,740
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

717
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:32,918
-I want to be logical.
-Okay.

718
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,758
Say we're married, we have the kid...

719
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:40,966
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

720
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:45,598
I've got that coastal trip to Alaska,
and you've got your thing.

721
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:51,010
I want to be logical. I think
I can love you and still be logical.

722
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:54,889
What? What is that look?

723
01:08:55,610 --> 01:09:00,520
Someone who really cares about you
must scare you to death.

724
01:09:01,866 --> 01:09:04,902
Forget logic.

725
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:08,071
What's in your heart?

726
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,875
I want to do it.

727
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:17,917
-This is life telling us something.
-So that's a yes?

728
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:20,793
Yes.

729
01:09:22,635 --> 01:09:26,086
-You're gonna feel good about this.
-Oh, really?

730
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:32,930
Mom, I wanna get out!
Mom, can't we get out?

731
01:09:33,353 --> 01:09:36,852
-Did we make the right decision?
-I don't know.

732
01:09:37,023 --> 01:09:39,596
Please, Mom!

733
01:09:39,817 --> 01:09:40,848
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:42,099
-Yes.
-Yes.

735
01:09:44,196 --> 01:09:46,651
Xavier McDaniel
made the All-Star team.

736
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:49,616
-Why does he pick fights with players?
-Like?

737
01:09:49,826 --> 01:09:51,948
Like Charles Barkley.

738
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:54,825
-That's a Bobby Van.
-Who's Bobby Van?

739
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:58,284
He was the host of Make Me Laugh.

740
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:05,336
I never got to finish
that chilidog, you know?

741
01:10:05,507 --> 01:10:08,840
That light's on yellow
way too long.

742
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:21,011
You, okay?

743
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:24,147
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

744
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,356
Are you all right?

745
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,776
Are you all right? Let's get out.

746
01:10:29,946 --> 01:10:31,653
Come on, let's get out.

747
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,608
James.

748
01:10:36,828 --> 01:10:38,405
James.

749
01:10:41,123 --> 01:10:45,416
-Who's James?
-I don't know.

750
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:48,127
Honey?

751
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:54,049
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

752
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:59,630
-This a conversation you had earlier?
-Yes.

753
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:01,301
It's a good sign.

754
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,134
-What?
-Hey.

755
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:07,470
-Hey.
-Hi.

756
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:11,431
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

757
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:21,072
I lost it, right? It's all over.

758
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:30,368
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

759
01:11:30,543 --> 01:11:34,754
-Linda?
-I lost the baby.

760
01:11:36,424 --> 01:11:38,215
Will you look at me?

761
01:11:42,763 --> 01:11:46,890
I was flunking high school,
overweight, had a dead-end job.

762
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:52,017
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

763
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:53,219
-Hey.
-Hi.

764
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:58,392
-How are you doing today?
-I'm better. I'm better.

765
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:02,862
I think I've read every
single magazine in the world.

766
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:07,858
-Did you go to work today?
-No. It's been two weeks.

767
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,036
I think they're going to fire me.

768
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:18,586
-I need some time alone.
-Alone?

769
01:12:18,754 --> 01:12:20,829
Yeah.

770
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:26,043
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

771
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:36,099
I think I should take
that research trip.

772
01:12:36,646 --> 01:12:42,933
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

773
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:46,188
I know I'm right about this.

774
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:50,229
It's just a month. It's just work.

775
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,404
See you in a month!

776
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:58,570
I'll miss you!

777
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:08,837
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

778
01:13:09,634 --> 01:13:14,972
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes. Come on.

779
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:20,306
-Hey. This'll be great.
-Oh.

780
01:13:20,477 --> 01:13:23,430
You're gonna love me for this.

781
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:31,434
I installed your new stereo.

782
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:36,073
Oh. Great.

783
01:13:52,715 --> 01:13:55,288
Yeah.

784
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:05,097
Yeah.

785
01:14:24,953 --> 01:14:29,994
-I'll replace the windows.
-Thanks.

786
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:58,567
Work. Work has never been better.

787
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:05,186
I miss her.

788
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:13,365
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

789
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:30,968
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome back.

790
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:32,798
-You look great.
-You too.

791
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:35,298
How are you? How was it?

792
01:15:35,476 --> 01:15:37,135
-It was really good.
-Yeah?

793
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:38,555
Yeah, really good.

794
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:42,014
-You want to go home? Out someplace?
-Whatever.

795
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:47,978
-Let me think of the place...
-There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

796
01:15:48,154 --> 01:15:52,981
-The 3-2-1? We could go... Or Costas...
-Whatever. I don't really care.

797
01:15:57,955 --> 01:16:04,288
Jesus. We both could sink
from all the pressure in the air.

798
01:16:04,544 --> 01:16:05,919
I know.

799
01:16:06,087 --> 01:16:10,499
-I really got into my job again.
-Me too. I was working my ass off.

800
01:16:10,758 --> 01:16:15,086
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

801
01:16:15,346 --> 01:16:17,504
That's great.

802
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,679
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

803
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:28,022
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

804
01:16:32,653 --> 01:16:34,941
Great.

805
01:16:36,198 --> 01:16:38,439
Friends.

806
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:45,156
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

807
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:51,085
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

808
01:17:03,473 --> 01:17:10,139
That obnoxious mime?
Was right. Love disappears.

809
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:05,438
-Come on, man!
-Let's go!

810
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:07,155
We got people out here!

811
01:18:07,407 --> 01:18:11,071
-Hello.
-I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

812
01:18:11,243 --> 01:18:17,576
Linda. It's me. I had to call you.

813
01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:21,331
It's about midnight. I was just
having many beers and...

814
01:18:21,503 --> 01:18:23,993
...I wanted to say...

815
01:18:24,964 --> 01:18:27,585
What I should have said at the dock.

816
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:33,879
I fucking chickened out. I lied when
I acted casual, like Mr. Casual...

817
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:36,677
...and I should have said it.

818
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:43,892
You belong with me!

819
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:47,440
We belong together and...

820
01:18:47,693 --> 01:18:51,144
...and what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

821
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:54,441
...I proposed only because
you were pregnant.

822
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,656
I've got to go piss!

823
01:18:56,827 --> 01:19:00,575
-I've got to go...
-Hey, this is not the bathroom!

824
01:19:00,747 --> 01:19:05,741
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

825
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:11,042
I think we made a big mistake because
we had good times and bad times...

826
01:19:11,215 --> 01:19:13,041
...but we had times.

827
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,834
And I would like to start over.

828
01:19:17,012 --> 01:19:19,763
I would like to be new to you.

829
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:23,975
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New...

830
01:19:24,143 --> 01:19:29,100
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

831
01:19:32,943 --> 01:19:39,111
And if you really needed to know how
I really feel, that's it. I love you.

832
01:19:39,282 --> 01:19:42,982
And... That's something
you should know, so...

833
01:19:50,918 --> 01:19:55,045
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

834
01:19:55,214 --> 01:19:59,840
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

835
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,561
This thing just eats tapes.

836
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:39,581
We're talking about 900,000 to
a million people by the time it's done.

837
01:20:39,796 --> 01:20:45,086
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

838
01:20:45,259 --> 01:20:49,635
-So it's a train.
-A supertrain.

839
01:20:49,805 --> 01:20:52,971
I've been burned by this
train business before.

840
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:56,890
-You people all seem to forget.
-We can change this city.

841
01:20:57,062 --> 01:20:59,350
People love their cars.

842
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,185
Yes. But...

843
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,933
-But if you give them great...
-Coffee.

844
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:10,362
Coffee... And great music. If you...

845
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:15,989
I'll put it to you like this, and then
I'll thank you for your time.

846
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:17,905
My answer is...

847
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:21,371
...no.

848
01:22:03,623 --> 01:22:05,033
Hi. May I help you?

849
01:22:05,374 --> 01:22:10,913
Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los
Angeles, first class, please. And...

850
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:17,590
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

851
01:22:20,722 --> 01:22:23,806
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

852
01:22:24,392 --> 01:22:26,680
Thank you.

853
01:22:30,606 --> 01:22:34,437
Tell me everything there is to know
about you.

854
01:22:35,026 --> 01:22:37,599
I've got a special feeling about you.

855
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:42,230
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

856
01:22:42,408 --> 01:22:46,571
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
Dad picks him up.

857
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:50,196
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

858
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:53,245
Look at those fantastic earrings.

859
01:22:54,961 --> 01:23:00,417
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

860
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,303
Got back two weeks ago.

861
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:09,053
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

862
01:23:09,224 --> 01:23:13,435
...she sends back, just to be
mysterious. I don't know, games.

863
01:23:13,603 --> 01:23:15,725
He wants her to move to Mexico...

864
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:20,392
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

865
01:23:27,366 --> 01:23:30,568
Oh, thanks.

866
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:40,163
Tomorrow, I gotta spell her name in
rose petals. Do you believe this job?

867
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:13,323
It's so easy to fall back into
old patterns.

868
01:24:13,492 --> 01:24:16,694
Back with Andy. One week
and we're already like...

869
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:22,742
...one of those old couples, who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

870
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:24,624
What am I doing?

871
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,580
Why did I chicken out?

872
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:31,709
Do you have the...?

873
01:24:38,014 --> 01:24:44,134
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

874
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:48,431
At least I'm not out there dating.

875
01:24:48,607 --> 01:24:53,315
-Love you.
-Love you too.

876
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:02,876
-What?
-Hi.

877
01:26:03,133 --> 01:26:04,164
Hey.

878
01:26:12,851 --> 01:26:16,219
Hey. I was worried about you.

879
01:26:17,188 --> 01:26:21,932
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

880
01:26:22,193 --> 01:26:25,312
Steve, I think you're
going through a phase.

881
01:26:25,487 --> 01:26:28,523
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

882
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:33,941
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

883
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,527
-At all.
-Steve, you're wigging.

884
01:26:37,874 --> 01:26:41,242
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

885
01:26:44,671 --> 01:26:50,174
This is hang time. I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.

886
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:53,925
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

887
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:58,047
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

888
01:26:58,226 --> 01:27:04,098
...how I listened to my instincts, and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

889
01:27:05,649 --> 01:27:09,064
Well, I just wanted to bring you
your mail.

890
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:15,690
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you, but...

891
01:27:15,867 --> 01:27:18,536
...things do turn around, Steve.

892
01:27:18,703 --> 01:27:22,534
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

893
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:25,459
I'm having the best time,
on my terms.

894
01:27:25,626 --> 01:27:28,710
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

895
01:27:28,962 --> 01:27:30,669
-Really?
-Yeah.

896
01:27:31,089 --> 01:27:34,588
Got all my architecture classes.
My first project is...

897
01:27:34,759 --> 01:27:38,210
...redesigning the fountain so we
can sit in it.

898
01:27:38,471 --> 01:27:41,471
-That's good news.
-It is.

899
01:27:44,977 --> 01:27:50,136
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

900
01:27:50,607 --> 01:27:55,398
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

901
01:27:55,653 --> 01:27:57,479
Forget it.

902
01:27:57,738 --> 01:28:00,275
Tell you what.

903
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:03,118
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

904
01:28:03,285 --> 01:28:09,073
...something good and nice that I
want to share with you or something...

905
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:12,119
I will knock four times, okay?

906
01:28:12,293 --> 01:28:17,203
It's gonna be our secret code.

907
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:20,132
-How?
-Okay? What?

908
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:21,415
-How?
-How what?

909
01:28:21,594 --> 01:28:23,633
How will you knock?

910
01:28:23,804 --> 01:28:25,713
Oh.

911
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:31,431
Like that.

912
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:33,761
Okay.

913
01:28:35,356 --> 01:28:39,898
Take care of yourself, Steve. Please.

914
01:28:56,751 --> 01:29:00,415
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a great couple.

915
01:29:02,589 --> 01:29:04,545
But in this one...

916
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:05,996
Neighbors.

917
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,739
-Hi.
-Hi.

918
01:29:39,915 --> 01:29:43,117
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

919
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:44,324
I know.

920
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:50,668
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

921
01:29:55,179 --> 01:30:00,932
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

922
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:05,264
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

923
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:09,981
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

924
01:30:10,401 --> 01:30:14,398
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

925
01:30:14,572 --> 01:30:17,608
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

926
01:30:20,869 --> 01:30:24,948
-Cliff, what are you talking about?
-I don't know.

927
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:31,791
I miss you. The way
you used to look at me...

928
01:30:32,046 --> 01:30:36,173
-Don't. I'm finally over you.
-Really?

929
01:30:36,425 --> 01:30:42,297
Yeah. I mean, you know, I still really
do like you, you know?

930
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:45,509
I think you're very...

931
01:30:46,309 --> 01:30:47,851
What?

932
01:30:48,561 --> 01:30:49,592
Entertaining.

933
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:56,192
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

934
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:00,143
Janet, you rock my world.

935
01:31:55,247 --> 01:32:00,453
I'm walking down the avenue

936
01:32:04,714 --> 01:32:09,375
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

937
01:32:12,513 --> 01:32:17,507
I'm laughing at the people I see

938
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:24,138
Something like that. I'm playing
with the lyrics. It's not set in stone.

939
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:28,147
Give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

940
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:30,809
...but give me a call, huh?

941
01:32:33,991 --> 01:32:38,035
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.

942
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:40,528
Here we go.

943
01:33:02,434 --> 01:33:04,592
Hi.

944
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:08,268
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

945
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:16,896
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

946
01:33:19,825 --> 01:33:21,449
What took you so long?

947
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:25,405
I was stuck in traffic.

948
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:21,957
Well, that's the way it happens.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

949
01:34:22,132 --> 01:34:24,373
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

950
01:34:24,551 --> 01:34:28,464
-Coming down. Look out.
-No problem.

951
01:34:28,638 --> 01:34:34,426
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

952
01:34:34,601 --> 01:34:38,100
For a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

953
01:34:38,271 --> 01:34:43,228
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

954
01:34:43,401 --> 01:34:48,560
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

955
01:34:48,739 --> 01:34:52,273
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

956
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:03,499
-Hey.
-Hey. Going out?

957
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:07,833
-Yep. You?
-Yeah.

958
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:13,879
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

959
01:35:14,054 --> 01:35:16,461
Thanks.

960
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:23,720
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

961
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:46,161
Does everybody go through this?

962
01:35:46,334 --> 01:35:49,500
No, I think, just us.

963
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:51,709
I'm going to be celibate forever.

964
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,714
I could spend my life with that person.

965
01:35:54,883 --> 01:35:57,919
-All you see is her head, Tommy.
-I know my type.

966
01:35:58,095 --> 01:36:01,677
-Met someone new today.
-She's more my type than yours.

967
01:36:01,848 --> 01:36:06,059
-You always say they're your type.
-Tell me I'm not like Shelly.

968
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:09,227
-She should try living alone...
-lt took two dates...

969
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:12,066
Hi, it's me. I just thought I'd call...

970
01:36:12,232 --> 01:36:17,438
-You said that I said...
-I don't play games.

971
01:36:18,905 --> 01:36:21,360
I can't believe I feel this way!
