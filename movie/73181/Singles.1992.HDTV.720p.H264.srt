1
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:17,078
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,874
No dorm, no roommates, my own place.

3
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,959
I was so happy.

4
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:28,048
I had my own parking space.

5
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,818
Where I come from, they don't
keep them in cages.

6
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,573
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

7
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,719
- Hello.
- You need some help?

8
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:16,721
Yeah, thanks.

9
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,316
I'm from Spain.

10
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,985
Really? Which part?

11
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:31,444
Galicia.

12
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,823
I'm taking engineering at U of W.

13
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,200
- I like Seattle.
- U-Dub.

14
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,120
That's what people call it here.

15
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,123
Finally, a locaI tells me some secrets.

16
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:49,254
Listen, you really don't have to stay.
I think this will take some time.

17
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,464
Where else do I have to go?

18
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,009
In one week I have to go back to Spain.

19
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,052
My visa runs out.

20
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,054
U- Dub.

21
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,716
Let him know this is Linda Powell
from the Seattle EnvironmentaI CounciI.

22
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:35,926
Okay, great.

23
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,552
Thank you. Bye-bye.

24
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes, that's right.
There's another spill in Bellingham.

25
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,897
Ruth, how long have I been
saying there are no guys?

26
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,315
Forever.

27
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,691
I met one.

28
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,361
I met one when I least expected it.

29
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,154
You held out on me.

30
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,907
He's an engineering student.
He's from Spain.

31
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,201
His visa runs out in 2 days.

32
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:04,955
He's like a comet.

33
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,539
What do I do?

34
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,251
I wish you could stay.

35
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,212
If I overstay my visa
I can't come back for 5 years.

36
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,382
Were you coming back?

37
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,134
Well, now I have a reason.

38
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,473
I want you to have this.

39
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:29,771
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

40
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,150
But this is a symboI of our future.

41
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,156
I want to return in...

42
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,409
...2 months and see you again.

43
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,793
I don't really have much
to give you...

44
00:05:54,713 --> 00:05:56,464
...but it's important to me.

45
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,760
Use this when you get back.

46
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:07,225
You'll always have a parking space.

47
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:27,162
Don't wake up.
I'm about to get on the plane...

48
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,832
...and wanted to say goodbye.
I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.

49
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,751
Goodbye, honey.

50
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,794
I miss you already.

51
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,676
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

52
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,637
It's amazing.

53
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:47,974
We can't hide things in language.
We speak in basics.

54
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:49,726
Basics?

55
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:50,977
You know what else?

56
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,939
If I married him,
he could live in this country...

57
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,523
...and I'd always have a date.

58
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,525
You're talking about marrying him?

59
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:00,862
I'm tired of games.

60
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:09,621
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

61
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:12,290
We will always go out dancing.

62
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,500
What?

63
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,835
We will always go out dancing!

64
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:15,437
The Genie Classic!

65
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,648
You can't go wrong with this garage
door opener.

66
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:21,276
We have the Liftrex and Liftrex Super.

67
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,570
Might be more opener than you need.

68
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:28,491
And the Linear pocket-pager-
beeper-garage-door-opener...

69
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,035
...combo.

70
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:33,872
Just give me the best one you have.

71
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,707
I'll never lose it again.

72
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,680
I broke up with someone recently.

73
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,766
Jennifer, my last girlfriend.

74
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:54,893
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

75
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,396
She just stared at me with that look:

76
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:00,607
'How can you pass me up?'

77
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,236
I told her we weren't right and
all the stuff we both knew.

78
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,781
A week later I realized I was wrong,
tried to get her back.

79
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:11,159
She won't see me.
Now she's with Tony.

80
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,291
Tony knows Bailey, who's friends
with Tony's girI on the side...

81
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,670
...Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

82
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:25,674
Do I tell Jennifer that I know
Tony's going out with Rita?

83
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:29,219
Or do I tell Rita that I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

84
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:32,973
Tony, who'll tell Jennifer I was still
with Rita when I went out with her.

85
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:36,017
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

86
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:41,940
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

87
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:48,280
Isn't that great?

88
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,619
I don't know.

89
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,248
Cliff!
I'm talking here, man.

90
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,378
I think back to the beginning.

91
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:06,381
My dad left home when I was 8.
You know what he said?

92
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:08,258
'Have fun.

93
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,801
Stay single. '

94
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:12,971
I was 8.

95
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,098
My mom's a teacher.

96
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:19,352
She took me to a doctor to learn
about sex. He was from Boston.

97
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:24,482
The father and the mother have
finally learned to come together.

98
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,903
The father inserts his penis in-

99
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:32,157
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

100
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:38,330
The father inserts the penis...

101
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,665
...into the mother's vagina.

102
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,418
This is called intercourse.

103
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,755
And what comes out is called sperm.

104
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,260
Then the man keeps moving untiI
something squirts out of his penis.

105
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,553
What?

106
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,305
What comes out?

107
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,973
Spam.

108
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,516
Oh, man!

109
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:04,105
Maybe it was never simple.

110
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:05,899
I'll tell you this:

111
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:10,195
For the next 3 years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

112
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:13,949
It's the only thing I have controI over.

113
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,077
Work.

114
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,454
I got to go.

115
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:51,361
I'm 23. Remember how old 23 seemed
when you were little?

116
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,406
I thought people would be
traveling in air locks...

117
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,116
...and I would have 5 kids.

118
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,243
Here I am.

119
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,829
I'm 23. Things are...

120
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,415
...basically the same.

121
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:07,502
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

122
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:11,673
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

123
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:16,886
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.

124
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:18,138
He's a musician.

125
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,947
His band put out
an independent album last month.

126
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,116
He's a really good artist too.

127
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,835
He's like a Renaissance man.

128
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,797
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

129
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:15,737
What's the ordeaI?

130
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,074
Your machine wasn't on and
I was supposed to see you Saturday.

131
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,537
So I thought I'd come by and say hi.

132
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,168
How's this weekend?

133
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,421
We're busy.
We got that show, right?

134
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,340
Yeah, we got that show.

135
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,968
- We got guys coming from L.A.
- Great!

136
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,011
It'll be really rocking.

137
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,721
So come over after.

138
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,764
DeaI.

139
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,894
Look, you know I see
other people still, right?

140
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:50,897
You do know that, don't you?

141
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,569
You don't fooI me.

142
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,447
I could not be fooling you less.

143
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,658
Cliff, move your truck.

144
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:05,912
We made the connection.

145
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,790
It's like chemistry
takes care of itself.

146
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,959
It makes its own decisions.

147
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,961
You got to sit back and enjoy it.

148
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:15,297
You know when it's reaI,
and this is reaI.

149
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,841
We don't even have to discuss it.

150
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,344
Janet...

151
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:23,263
...you're spazzing off on me.

152
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,228
While we're young.

153
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:43,158
I'll see you Saturday, then and...

154
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,076
...I'll help you with your speakers.

155
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:52,000
What can I say?
She's crazy about me.

156
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,299
Check out my new Gortec watch.

157
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,094
I can store 20 numbers in this watch.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

158
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:06,473
All or nothing, no compromise.
Tonight I'll be the Super Me.

159
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:10,810
What if the Super You meets
the Super Her and she rejects you?

160
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:13,396
Then it's no problem.

161
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:16,399
- Why?
- Because it was never you.

162
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:17,901
It was just an act.

163
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,655
I live my life like a French movie.

164
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,284
Webster and 24th.
It should be here.

165
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,122
Let's ask this clown where the club is.

166
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,960
Hey, man!

167
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,962
Where's Desoto?

168
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,509
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

169
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,721
Give me a ride and I'll show you.

170
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:51,351
Where's Desoto?
Our car broke down.

171
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,356
I'll tell you about love.

172
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:58,692
Love disappears, baby.

173
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,860
Every time I've been broke...

174
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:03,113
...babe has been off like a prom dress.

175
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,782
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

176
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,618
Maybe I've been hurt!
Maybe I've been dogged!

177
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,662
Anybody know where this place is?

178
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,872
Am I a Thomas Bros. Guide?

179
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,457
You really shouldn't speak.

180
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,626
Yes!
Where do you guys work?

181
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:19,087
- I'm a maitre d'.
- Dept. of Transportation.

182
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,214
- He's working on gridlock.
- Thank God!

183
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,008
I build airplanes.

184
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,185
Hey!

185
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,395
Hello!

186
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,988
My friend and I have
this long-running argument.

187
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,658
He says when you come to
a place like this...

188
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,202
...you have to have an act.

189
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,914
So, anyway, I saw you standing there...

190
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,250
...so I thought:

191
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,794
I could just leave you alone...

192
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,380
I could come up with an act...

193
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,424
...or C: I could just be myself.

194
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,343
I chose C.

195
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,387
What do you think?

196
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:37,517
I think that A:
You have an act.

197
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,313
And that B:
Not having an act is your act.

198
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,902
Thank you.

199
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,701
Talking with Cliff Poncier.

200
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,872
Any comments on the Seattle sound
and Citizen Dick's place in it?

201
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:02,876
I don't like to reduce us to being
part of the Seattle sound.

202
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:05,503
I like to think of us expanding more.

203
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,006
Like, we're huge in Europe right now.

204
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,216
We've got records...

205
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,385
A big record just broke in Belgium.

206
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,603
A song like 'Touch Me, I'm Dick'
is about what?

207
00:19:21,853 --> 00:19:26,274
I think 'Touch Me, I'm Dick' in essence
speaks for itself, you know.

208
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:27,692
I think...

209
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:30,612
...that's basically what the song is...

210
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:33,031
...about, you know.

211
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:37,077
I think a lot of people might think it's
actually about, you know...

212
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,747
...my name is Dick and you can touch me
but I think...

213
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,625
...it can be seen either way.

214
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:46,962
Excuse me?

215
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,004
- Hello.
- Hi.

216
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:49,798
Want to meet up later?

217
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:50,840
Where?

218
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,677
- Anywhere you're going.
- Anywhere you're going.

219
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:55,679
We're going home.

220
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:58,181
- We're going home.
- See you!

221
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,352
Anywhere you're going.

222
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,814
Always get their numbers.
Tonight I got 20 numbers.

223
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,941
Twenty numbers.

224
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,904
You got numbers of 20 girls
you will never call, never date...

225
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,073
...never see in the daylight.

226
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,659
20 numbers that exist
only to make you feeI...

227
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,828
...like a guy who can get 20 numbers.

228
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,496
Watch the volume!

229
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:22,998
Sorry. Tinnitus.

230
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,207
Club disease.

231
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,751
You kids are all going to be deaf.

232
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,172
This is my night.

233
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,341
- What?
- Look.

234
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,429
Linda, don't look over.

235
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:26,895
I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

236
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,024
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

237
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:32,525
It was a joke.

238
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,027
I know.

239
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:37,280
You think it's something
desperate people do.

240
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:38,323
You're wrong!

241
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:42,077
'Expect the Best' is the best
video dating in the country.

242
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,747
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

243
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,500
- Your medication, Miss Hunt.
- Thank you.

244
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,420
You make the greatest coffee.

245
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,849
I can ask Steve.
I'll call you back.

246
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:08,019
The I-90 construction's
way behind schedule...

247
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:12,399
...and the Times wants to know why
there's gridlock on the I-5.

248
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:16,027
Tell them it's God's way of saying,
'Listen to the radio. '

249
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:17,946
Did you read my proposaI?

250
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,198
- What'd you think?
- I liked it.

251
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,033
You'll have to move it past Stu.

252
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:23,451
After lunch.

253
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,662
Okay. After lunch.

254
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:29,124
- Ted, what's up?
- Making music with my fingers.

255
00:22:29,332 --> 00:22:31,876
And what a beautifuI sound it is.

256
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,639
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne.

257
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:48,727
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.

258
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,270
That was me.

259
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,106
Listen, want to get some dinner?

260
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:54,608
Busy.

261
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:56,192
How about some lunch?

262
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,486
Have a lunch. Coffee?

263
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:00,071
Water?

264
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,865
How about some water?

265
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:05,535
I'll meet you where you're having lunch
and we'll have some...

266
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:06,786
...water.

267
00:23:07,203 --> 00:23:11,166
I think this whole decade
will have to be about cleaning up.

268
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,170
Our project spent last year
studying the Alaskan Exxon spill.

269
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,172
And now with...

270
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,133
...all the Exxon kickbacks and...

271
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:21,885
...things...

272
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:22,928
God, yes!

273
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,638
The worst!

274
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,266
I'm trying to put together
a group in June...

275
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,310
...to study the whole coast.

276
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:33,313
But I'm having a little trouble
getting a boat.

277
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,857
I think it will work out fine.

278
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:40,779
What?

279
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:44,366
There's just no privacy anymore.

280
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:48,870
I thought he was going to swallow her.

281
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,956
- Me too.
- My God!

282
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,875
Do you know what time it is?

283
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,253
-3:30.
- I'm so late!

284
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:59,256
- I'm glad your lunch date didn't show up.
- Me too.

285
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,342
- Did you really have a lunch date?
- No.

286
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:07,180
- So you want to-
- I'm getting over somebody.

287
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:10,267
- I really think it's a bad time.
- Maybe I'II- Okay.

288
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,688
Here's my car.

289
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,023
Let me give you a ride back to work.

290
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,442
Thanks.

291
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:27,701
Thanks.

292
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:48,430
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

293
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:49,556
It's ambitious.

294
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,266
If it were up to me...

295
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,643
She opened my car door button.

296
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,061
Unmistakable sign.

297
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,398
I like this girl.

298
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:01,109
Got to handle this one really well.

299
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:02,986
The thing I like best about you...

300
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,405
...is that you really listen to me.

301
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:08,199
You're a realist-slash-dreamer.

302
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,619
Thanks.

303
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,790
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

304
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:19,794
That some jerk could
trash the Mona Lisa...

305
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:21,421
...or an ocean...

306
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,298
...or someone's life!

307
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:27,218
Who are your neighbors?

308
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:32,641
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maitre d'.

309
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,517
He keeps us all in free meals.

310
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:37,103
On the corner there...

311
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,564
...that's Debbie Hunt.

312
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:44,277
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

313
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,491
And that is Cliff.

314
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:52,285
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

315
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:54,996
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

316
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:58,708
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.
She works there too.

317
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,586
She's saving up for architecture schooI.

318
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,630
Cliff and Janet...

319
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,010
That's it.

320
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,722
You sound like me
talking about my family.

321
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:17,894
Want to go upstairs
while your stuff is drying?

322
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:37,914
That's a good picture of you.

323
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,794
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think about traffic, ever?

324
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,879
Because I do.

325
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:48,675
Constantly. Traffic is caused
by the single-car driver.

326
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:51,970
900,000 single people get
in their cars every morning...

327
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,473
...they drive to work and they wonder
why there's gridlock.

328
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,101
But if you had a train...

329
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:02,564
...a supertrain, you give the people
a reason to get out of their cars.

330
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:05,233
You give them great coffee,
great music...

331
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,068
...they will park and ride.

332
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,361
I know they will.

333
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,405
I still love my car, though.

334
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,663
The Sonics.
They got a good team this year.

335
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:22,250
Good thing they traded Xavier McDanieI.
What is he?

336
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,921
- A boxer or a basketball player?
- You dare to rip the X-man.

337
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:32,010
'IKiss at the HoteI De Ville. '
You have this too. I have this.

338
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:33,637
And albums.

339
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,972
I miss albums.

340
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:42,312
- I was a DJ in college.
- Really?

341
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:45,774
That's why I still have records.

342
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,166
Any boyfriends?

343
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,919
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

344
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:09,798
But there was this one guy.

345
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:11,299
Rich.

346
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:13,051
All my girlfriends loved him.

347
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:16,972
All that stuff I told you about
the money I inherited?

348
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,473
I made that up.

349
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:21,142
Plus, I got back together
with Lynn last night...

350
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,145
...so you probably want
to go ahead and freak out.

351
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:32,445
It was like a professionaI hit.

352
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:35,991
I didn't want to get close
to anybody for a long time.

353
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,325
And then I-

354
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:40,078
- I'm talking too much.
- No, go ahead.

355
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:44,165
I thought for sure I'd
meet someone in college, you know?

356
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,795
A perfect combination of
MeI Gibson and Holden Caulfield.

357
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:53,717
And the SexuaI Revolution would
just sweep us both away.

358
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,636
I was a semester too late.

359
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,129
Condoms.

360
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:32,964
They're free!

361
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:45,936
It's okay to loathe these people.

362
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:47,896
Really?

363
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:52,776
There is so much life in you.

364
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,570
And so much...

365
00:29:56,905 --> 00:29:59,199
...emotionaI larceny in these others.

366
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:02,661
I'm Andy.

367
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,913
I'm Linda.

368
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,581
'EmotionaI larceny'?

369
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,087
He said passion didn't matter
as much as comfort and stability.

370
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:14,589
- That's bullshit.
- No kidding!

371
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:15,632
Sorry.

372
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,092
It's cooI.

373
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:23,431
We lived together for 2 years.
We're still friends but-

374
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,809
I did the same thing.
It's like one day...

375
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,895
...one of you goes for groceries
and never comes back.

376
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:31,606
Everyone I know
wants everything to be easy.

377
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:32,899
I know.

378
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,026
Why'd I have to meet you in a club?

379
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,236
I don't know.

380
00:30:40,323 --> 00:30:41,992
I love this song.

381
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,429
My clothes!

382
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:08,310
Is this you?

383
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:11,396
This gas-guzzling monster is you?
The environmentalist?

384
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:15,191
- I inherited it from my dad.
- I'm not sure how I feeI about that.

385
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:20,822
Let's maybe do something
this weekend or-

386
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:21,907
Okay.

387
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,992
- I'll call you.
- Don't forget.

388
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,493
I won't.

389
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,044
Good night.

390
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,817
Listen, next time, why don't you...

391
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,153
...park underground.

392
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,161
I should go.

393
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,511
I was just...

394
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,889
...nowhere near your neighborhood.

395
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:27,574
Burglar.

396
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:29,367
Burglar.

397
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,726
Neighbors!

398
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:59,397
It's Andy, calling to
make sure you're okay.

399
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,984
- She's okay.
- I thought about the talk we had.

400
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:06,071
I think you should trust him.
Although I think...

401
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,031
...he's putting on the moves.

402
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,408
I'm a guy.
I know these things.

403
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:13,703
I don't like that I know them
but I know them.

404
00:34:13,912 --> 00:34:16,248
And I like that he's a Steve.

405
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,334
But be careful.
If he doesn't treat you right...

406
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,835
...I'll kick his ass.

407
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,135
Can you wait?

408
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:31,346
Just a little longer.

409
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,099
Whenever! Whenever!

410
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:36,059
You're amazing.

411
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:40,105
I feeI like I'm being pulled inside you.

412
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,691
Are we being too loud?

413
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:47,862
What are you thinking...

414
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,990
...right now?

415
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:55,287
I just go out and play good,
hard-nosed basketball.

416
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:58,957
Things happen throughout the game.
It's nothing you can do.

417
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,294
I don't go out and say I'll
to beat this or that guy up.

418
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:03,878
Anything else, X?

419
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,381
Steve, don't come yet.

420
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,357
God!

421
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,651
I'm in love with my neighbor.

422
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,778
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

423
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,199
What can I eat?

424
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:36,161
I'm tired of starving myself
for this guy.

425
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:37,370
Salad!

426
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,205
I'll have a salad.

427
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:46,796
If I call him that's being desperate.

428
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,549
He's late or he forgot.

429
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:53,929
I refuse to remind him he forgot.
If he shows up, I'll listen.

430
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:56,431
But no way do I call him.

431
00:35:58,016 --> 00:36:01,353
Of course, men do like to be called.

432
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,855
I'll call him in 10 minutes.

433
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:07,025
That will be one hour and
that is officially very late.

434
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:13,281
He is officially very late.

435
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:20,997
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

436
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:23,875
Two out of three.

437
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:30,507
Wait!

438
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:33,760
Did no basket mean call him or don't
call him?

439
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:41,685
Busy. That's a sign.
Fate says don't call.

440
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,895
Forget it.
I'm not desperate.

441
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,648
I have many, many people
to spend a Saturday with.

442
00:36:48,024 --> 00:36:50,277
Stop getting involved with your neighbors.

443
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:54,239
- Is that what broke us up?
- We're better as friends.

444
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,324
The thing about Cliff is...

445
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:59,202
...he has all this fierce integrity.

446
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:02,747
Except when it comes to women.
He likes...

447
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:07,127
...these club-type women.
These huge, hourglass Amazon women.

448
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:11,214
I think it's great you're together
but protect yourself.

449
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:15,594
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

450
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,056
You're from the high plains.

451
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,149
I'm so glad I live here.

452
00:37:49,753 --> 00:37:51,254
Are my breasts too small?

453
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,301
God!

454
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,895
Because, I mean...

455
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:09,397
...I look around
and all I see are these...

456
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:13,026
...posters and billboards
and magazines...

457
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:17,781
...and TV shows all with
these women with huge breasts.

458
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:19,532
And I guess...

459
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:22,953
...I just wanted to ask,
is that what men really want?

460
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:26,081
I mean, is that what you want?
You know?

461
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:29,417
Don't lie, because your eye twitches
and I'll know.

462
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:39,261
Ask me.

463
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:42,347
Are my breasts too small?

464
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:52,816
Sometimes.

465
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:13,878
Have you had implants before?

466
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:16,506
What do you think?

467
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,759
No.

468
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:25,473
You take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

469
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,269
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

470
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:31,146
...by graph, right.

471
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:34,399
Well, what's painfuI?

472
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:39,154
It can be mildIy painfuI and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

473
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,323
...mine in particular.

474
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:43,116
Right.

475
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:47,996
Take a couple of days and
think about it. All right.

476
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:57,839
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

477
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:00,342
How about...

478
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,011
...that?

479
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:14,981
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less...

480
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,192
...hourglass.

481
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:20,904
I think if you're going to
have the operation...

482
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:23,365
...have the operation.

483
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:30,163
Do you jog?

484
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,790
A little.

485
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:33,708
Maybe...

486
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,838
Split the difference?

487
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:40,840
Split the difference.

488
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:07,200
Hi, it's me.

489
00:41:08,076 --> 00:41:10,328
I'm tired of doing the right thing...

490
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:12,372
...waiting for you to call me.

491
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:16,418
I'm on the bed right now...

492
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,212
...wearing something really outrageous.

493
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,631
I've got no underwear on.

494
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,552
I need to be touched.

495
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,762
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

496
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:31,683
I think you got the wrong number,
but I'll be right over.

497
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,236
This guy plays no games.

498
00:41:43,486 --> 00:41:45,030
That's great!

499
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:48,491
I've got to play this one perfectly.

500
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,119
Go with it.
What do your instincts tell you?

501
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,747
Not to listen to you guys.

502
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:56,958
She doesn't want you
tugging at her bra strap.

503
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,461
She wants mystery.
She wants drama.

504
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:01,755
She wants excitement.
I know women.

505
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,215
I don't want drama.
I don't want excitement.

506
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:06,092
I want to trust him.

507
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:07,802
Should I trust him?

508
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:12,474
Not all guys are like Luiz.

509
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:14,142
You're right.

510
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:16,645
You're right.

511
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,271
Steve is different.

512
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,899
Will you just follow your instincts?

513
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:22,984
Don't treat this like casuaI sex.

514
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:25,278
CasuaI sex doesn't even exist anymore.

515
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:27,656
It's lethaI. It's over.

516
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:34,955
What are you thinking?

517
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,334
If I had a conversation with God,
I'd ask him to create this girI.

518
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:42,003
My chest hurts.

519
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,799
You didn't leave a note, did you?

520
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:47,926
I left my blue T-shirt by mistake.

521
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,470
There are no mistakes!

522
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:53,640
What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

523
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:57,769
I'm going to call my new...

524
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:00,063
...semi-girlfriend.

525
00:43:00,272 --> 00:43:02,816
You don't realize.
You'll scare her off.

526
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:05,944
She's beautifuI.
Anyone would call her.

527
00:43:06,152 --> 00:43:08,989
You distinguish yourself
by not calling her.

528
00:43:10,073 --> 00:43:11,783
P.S. That's how you get her.

529
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:15,078
Bailey, you don't understand.

530
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,997
Remember your last 3 girlfriends?

531
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:23,420
You're right.

532
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,883
I got to let this one breathe.

533
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:33,096
You're concerned about dioxins.

534
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:35,348
I'll give you Greenpeace's number.

535
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,147
How'd it go?

536
00:43:42,355 --> 00:43:43,315
I got the boat.

537
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:45,859
Trip to Alaska's set.

538
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:47,652
Great, Linda! That's great!

539
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:53,325
Steve on 2.

540
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:57,329
Four days he waits to call me.

541
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:58,747
What do I tell him?

542
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:01,666
I went for groceries.

543
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,421
She went for groceries.

544
00:44:10,926 --> 00:44:11,927
He's coming over.

545
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:14,763
'Nothing'?

546
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:16,181
Nothing is wrong.

547
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,891
Really.

548
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:22,270
- I thought we connected.
- This is a really small office.

549
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:25,649
- Is this because I didn't call?
- I don't remember. Did you call?

550
00:44:25,857 --> 00:44:29,319
Why are you being like this?
I like you. It was cooI meeting you.

551
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:31,988
I'll call you or you call me.

552
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:43,124
Look, I'm sorry if I blew it
by not calling you.

553
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:46,211
You don't owe me.
You don't have to call me.

554
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:48,672
Is it that old boyfriend
who always calls?

555
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,048
He doesn't always call.

556
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:51,925
- He probably has a ponytaiI.
- No.

557
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:53,969
He's Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.

558
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,929
He's not Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.

559
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,644
You're scared to get close to me.

560
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:05,313
You don't know me enough to say that.

561
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,232
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.

562
00:45:10,986 --> 00:45:13,321
Let's not play games.

563
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,283
If I was playing games I'd have
waited a week to call.

564
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:21,830
What I mean is-

565
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:23,623
I got to work, Steve.

566
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:26,501
- Bye, Steve.
- I left my T-shirt at your-

567
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:38,972
Why?

568
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:42,475
Why do you talk such a good game?

569
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:45,186
You talk about things that matter...

570
00:45:45,437 --> 00:45:49,524
...that get me excited, that get me hot.

571
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,485
Then it's like...

572
00:45:52,694 --> 00:45:54,779
...you're lobotomized.

573
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:57,616
Why can't I just protect myself?

574
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,326
Why can't I just...

575
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:01,369
...be a buddy?

576
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,206
Glad I caught this one in time.

577
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:07,500
Can't leave myself open.

578
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:09,961
Better to be the dumper
than the dumpee.

579
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:16,259
Listen, Mom, if he
invited you to Hawaii, yes...

580
00:46:16,468 --> 00:46:18,511
...he probably wants something.

581
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,390
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for 2 years.

582
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,437
Listen. Listen, Mom!

583
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:28,730
Look, Debbie.

584
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:32,317
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Could you just hold it down?

585
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:33,485
Wait a second.

586
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:37,530
Rinse off your dishes
before you put them in the dishwasher.

587
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:39,407
I rinsed them.

588
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:43,161
No, you have to rinse off all the food
or it gets over everything.

589
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:46,706
I found this big little
chunky thing on my glass.

590
00:46:47,082 --> 00:46:48,583
No biggie.

591
00:46:49,584 --> 00:46:52,671
Wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

592
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,267
This is for Expect the Best?

593
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,020
I brought some clippings,
some possible looks for my video.

594
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:12,941
Here we have the Edie Sedgwick.

595
00:47:13,149 --> 00:47:14,150
You know?

596
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:18,530
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

597
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,703
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

598
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:27,914
And...

599
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,876
...I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

600
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:33,628
Truth?

601
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:35,797
Truth.

602
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:42,804
I will create your new look.

603
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,432
I will have men dying at your feet.

604
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,017
$ 10 extra...

605
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:49,477
...and Brian will shoot your video.

606
00:47:53,148 --> 00:47:53,982
20.

607
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:59,529
He doesn't even know me.

608
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:01,323
Debbie...

609
00:48:01,823 --> 00:48:04,826
...he is only, like,
the next Martin Scorcese.

610
00:48:08,663 --> 00:48:10,457
I'm in your hands.

611
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,678
I am Debbie Hunt.

612
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:27,515
If you want to see how I look
rewind and freeze frame.

613
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,560
But I am not about...

614
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:32,145
...looks.

615
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:43,865
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

616
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:46,660
My goals are serenity and knowledge...

617
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:49,621
...and men who can understand me.

618
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:52,791
No druggies, please.

619
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:57,379
I'm fairly intense.
And I'm an advertising exec...

620
00:48:57,545 --> 00:49:00,340
...at KRWE-TV.

621
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:02,092
That's me!

622
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:05,345
Come to where the flavor is.

623
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,265
Come to Debbie Country.

624
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:24,072
'Debbie Country. '

625
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:25,407
It's funny.

626
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,040
'Doghouse. '

627
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:35,709
It should be 6 or 7 songs.

628
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:38,878
- They want me to come out.
- Stone's right. They're friends.

629
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:41,256
'Doghouse' as an encore, man.

630
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:43,133
You can't start off with that.

631
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:46,011
Why make those people clap,
so we come out again?

632
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,430
You don't get it, do you, man?

633
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:50,849
Check out this review of our record.

634
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:52,767
Read it out loud.

635
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,729
'Once again, when Cliff Poncier sings-'

636
00:49:55,937 --> 00:49:59,733
Wait a minute. I don't want
to hear anything negative.

637
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:02,110
Go on.

638
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,554
'He was ably backed by Stone,
Jeff and drummer Eddie Vedder. '

639
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,431
That's a good review.

640
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:35,644
A compliment for us
is a compliment for you.

641
00:50:35,894 --> 00:50:37,229
No, man.

642
00:50:38,146 --> 00:50:40,899
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

643
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:45,445
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable!

644
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:47,822
This weekend, we rock Portland.

645
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,627
I know you're in love,
but are you sure you want to do this?

646
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,796
My mind is made up.

647
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:06,091
Want to read a magazine?

648
00:51:06,883 --> 00:51:09,177
Thanks for doing this with me.

649
00:51:10,178 --> 00:51:11,930
Didn't want you to go alone.

650
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,194
Tell me, what do you
really want from a guy?

651
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:33,034
When I first moved here from Tucson...

652
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:35,328
...I wanted a guy with...

653
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:37,497
...looks...

654
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:39,207
...security...

655
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:40,667
...caring...

656
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,378
...someone with their own place.

657
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,133
Someone who said 'bless you'
or ' gesundheit ' when I sneezed.

658
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:52,846
And someone who liked
the same things as me, but not exactly.

659
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:54,222
Someone who loves me.

660
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:57,851
Tall order.

661
00:51:58,894 --> 00:52:00,312
I scaled it down a little.

662
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,521
What is it now?

663
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:06,192
Someone who says
' gesundheit ' when I sneeze.

664
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:08,820
Though I prefer 'bless you. '
It's nicer.

665
00:52:11,197 --> 00:52:12,908
Sorry you had to wait.

666
00:52:14,242 --> 00:52:16,912
This is my friend Steve.
Dr. Jamison.

667
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,998
Come on in.

668
00:52:20,624 --> 00:52:21,917
Last chance.

669
00:52:27,422 --> 00:52:29,049
Here we go.

670
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,929
I'm going to say something that
I haven't said to any patients...

671
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:35,931
...in 3 years of being at HMO.

672
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:42,229
I will perform the operation
but I don't think you need it.

673
00:52:43,271 --> 00:52:45,065
I think you're perfect.

674
00:52:45,398 --> 00:52:49,069
I think if your boyfriend doesn't
appreciate you the way you are...

675
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:52,906
...then you have to ask,
are you his Miss Right...

676
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,367
...or are you his Miss Maybe?

677
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:01,414
What's that mean?

678
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:03,792
Did my check bounce?

679
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,715
I really have a feeling about you.

680
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:15,971
Thanks but...

681
00:53:16,596 --> 00:53:17,973
...I love my boyfriend.

682
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:23,645
I still feeI good about
saying what I said.

683
00:53:23,812 --> 00:53:25,897
You should. It's good!

684
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:30,902
Can I say something to you?

685
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,404
Sure.

686
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:35,240
Your face wants a different part.

687
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:37,993
- You know, your hair.
- My hair?

688
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:44,958
There you go!

689
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,419
Now you look vaguely rocking.

690
00:53:47,794 --> 00:53:51,298
I mean, come on.
You're a happening guy, you know?

691
00:53:51,506 --> 00:53:53,341
You're Dr. Jamison.

692
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:55,135
You've got...

693
00:53:55,343 --> 00:53:59,681
...nice eyes. And you've got those
great, trustworthy eyebrows.

694
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,641
And you're a surgeon, man!

695
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,352
Many, many babes are into that.

696
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:10,483
No, really!

697
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:14,154
Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

698
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:16,865
I don't know how to have fun, right?

699
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:21,536
I'm 33 years old and
I don't know how to have fun.

700
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:28,293
There.

701
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,754
Now was that fun or what?

702
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:34,174
Yeah. That was fun.

703
00:54:47,812 --> 00:54:48,897
Doc?

704
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:52,067
And now with the operation.

705
00:54:57,906 --> 00:55:00,575
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

706
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:05,580
Thanks.

707
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:12,546
A few days later, she leaves the hive.

708
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:14,756
Now she's ready to mate.

709
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:23,682
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

710
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:26,893
Where are the anthems of our youth?

711
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,439
What happened to music
that meant something?

712
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:35,235
The Who at the IKingdome
or IKiss at the Coliseum?

713
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:38,029
Where is the 'Misty Mountain Hop'?

714
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:42,284
Where is the 'Smoke on the Water'
or the 'Ironman' of today?

715
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,370
We're not going out tonight,
are we, honey?

716
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:50,041
Look at this. These bands are like
well-designed bottles of bleach.

717
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,836
It's beer-and-lifestyle music.

718
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:57,966
I mean, it's like the next world war
is going to be sponsored by...

719
00:55:58,592 --> 00:56:00,635
I don't know. What?

720
00:56:02,804 --> 00:56:04,806
We could just take a bath.

721
00:56:04,973 --> 00:56:06,725
Just remember one thing.

722
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:09,936
We are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

723
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:14,024
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

724
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:17,110
The alarm has sounded.

725
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:25,160
They pour into the European hive.

726
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:28,538
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.

727
00:56:28,747 --> 00:56:30,665
I'm playing this weekend.

728
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:36,630
Wait a minute.

729
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:38,757
What am I doing?

730
00:56:39,257 --> 00:56:41,509
I don't have to be here.

731
00:56:42,594 --> 00:56:44,971
I could just break up with him.

732
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:53,647
I have always been able to do this.

733
00:56:53,855 --> 00:56:56,691
Break up with someone
and never look back.

734
00:57:00,445 --> 00:57:02,322
Being alone.

735
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:05,700
There's a certain dignity to it.

736
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:47,450
Did I overreact?

737
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:50,495
You know who this is?

738
00:58:20,859 --> 00:58:23,904
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

739
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:27,991
But my mind works in strange ways.

740
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:31,703
When things are at their best,
I wait for them to fall apart.

741
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:34,581
I can't figure out
if I do it to myself...

742
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,125
...or if life does it for me.

743
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:40,921
I'm a little late this month,
that's all I'm saying.

744
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:42,839
How late?

745
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,635
Late.

746
00:59:05,987 --> 00:59:06,821
Steve Dunne.

747
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:11,409
Doug Hughley.
Mr. Deegan's class.

748
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:13,495
What is up, you old goat?!

749
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:15,956
- How you doing?
- Okay, man.

750
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:19,125
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

751
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:22,003
I loved your radio show.
That was the best.

752
00:59:22,212 --> 00:59:23,463
Thanks, man.

753
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:26,508
We're throwing down tonight
over on Aloha Street.

754
00:59:26,716 --> 00:59:28,468
We got 2 bands.
It'll be insane!

755
00:59:28,677 --> 00:59:31,429
Would you get up and do a little
'Wheels of SteeI'?

756
00:59:31,638 --> 00:59:33,139
Are you sure?

757
00:59:33,348 --> 00:59:36,768
You're the only one who can mix up
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

758
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:39,229
What's so funny about
Peace peace peace?

759
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:41,106
Love and under-

760
00:59:41,648 --> 00:59:44,442
Death Row
What does a brother understand?

761
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:49,406
You're the best.

762
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:51,616
You are the king.
You are the king!

763
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:55,203
You've got to be there, man.
You must be there!

764
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:58,290
Of course, you may be busy.

765
01:00:02,669 --> 01:00:06,006
Ten more minutes and we pour X into B
and if it's blue-

766
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:08,174
Then we have a big talk.

767
01:00:15,473 --> 01:00:18,810
- I have some time right now.
- Then let's talk right now.

768
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,522
- My body knows it'll be blue.
- It won't be blue.

769
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:25,942
I've never gotten anybody pregnant.
It won't be blue.

770
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:27,944
I'm probably sterile.
A family trait.

771
01:00:28,153 --> 01:00:29,571
Really?

772
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:34,910
Do you know where my other shoes are?

773
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:37,370
Maybe they're by the door.

774
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,081
That'd be wild.

775
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,917
- What?
- Having a kid.

776
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,755
- If you were pregnant.
- If I were.

777
01:00:46,963 --> 01:00:48,465
Which I'm not.

778
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:51,801
And I wouldn't expect you
to deaI with it anyway.

779
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:56,765
I'd be with you.
We'd deaI with it.

780
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:02,145
To friendship.

781
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:11,947
That's bluish, right?

782
01:01:12,155 --> 01:01:13,657
It's fairly blue.

783
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:15,033
Oh, well.

784
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:17,869
Wait. Put it against
something blue, though.

785
01:01:19,704 --> 01:01:23,375
Wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

786
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:32,342
- So what are you doing today?
- Not much.

787
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:35,053
I got to meet the deputy mayor
to see the mayor.

788
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:38,515
- Good. I have stuff to do too.
- So you can call me.

789
01:01:38,723 --> 01:01:40,517
Call you or...

790
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:49,192
- And finally...
- Interesting!

791
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:52,862
...if we can get the single-car driver
onto the supertrain...

792
01:01:53,071 --> 01:01:55,365
...we can change the city.

793
01:01:55,574 --> 01:01:57,659
It's all in the proposaI.

794
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,585
Flirts with brilliance.

795
01:02:06,835 --> 01:02:08,336
Wish it were up to me.

796
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,006
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

797
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:14,509
Thank you.

798
01:02:15,677 --> 01:02:19,097
So basically, that's kind of
what we're all about...

799
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:20,599
...give or take a little.

800
01:02:20,932 --> 01:02:25,270
I'd like to just kind of
leave it up to you at this point.

801
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:28,815
I think that will be great.

802
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:31,484
I think you've explained it really well.

803
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:37,365
These are the men who want me.

804
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:39,784
But I'm more than just a good body.

805
01:02:40,118 --> 01:02:41,912
Feelings, man!

806
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,664
I have a lot of
tender feelings which are...

807
01:02:44,873 --> 01:02:46,625
...just waiting for the right woman.

808
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:51,129
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this, obviously.

809
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:53,173
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.

810
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,593
As you can see, my painting
is displayed behind me.

811
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:58,637
I'm the kind of person that's really...

812
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:01,973
...meticulous in appearance,
and also very precise.

813
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:05,227
In fact, if two people
really believe in each other...

814
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:09,231
...that love can go around the world
and through each other's soul.

815
01:03:09,397 --> 01:03:11,399
But love is a very delicate thing.

816
01:03:11,566 --> 01:03:16,029
In fact, if you're both not careful
and nurturing, that love can...

817
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:19,574
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

818
01:03:19,741 --> 01:03:21,952
Someone who is complex.

819
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,246
Someone who is willing to experiment.

820
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:27,332
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

821
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:31,419
I guess I'm just looking for someone
who feels the same way I do.

822
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:32,712
About a bicycle.

823
01:03:32,921 --> 01:03:36,591
Am I coming off as too intense?
I can be intensely laid back too.

824
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,552
I am very...

825
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:40,345
...very...

826
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:42,180
...very lonely.

827
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:49,271
Who?

828
01:03:49,938 --> 01:03:52,315
Definitely the bicycle guy.

829
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:55,068
The bicycle guy.

830
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,320
He's, like, your souI mate.

831
01:03:58,613 --> 01:04:00,282
Guy with the bicycle.

832
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:20,635
Nice outfit.

833
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:23,680
Is he late?

834
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:25,849
Yeah, but...

835
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:27,726
...I expect the best.

836
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,521
So why did you pick this Sea Merchant?

837
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,274
The First Avenue one is way happening.

838
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:36,568
You mean there's another Sea Merchant?

839
01:04:36,776 --> 01:04:37,819
The new one.

840
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:42,365
On your right!

841
01:05:02,427 --> 01:05:03,386
Excuse me.

842
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:05,680
Was a Jamie here looking
for a Debbie Hunt?

843
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:08,600
Yes, and he left you a message:

844
01:05:08,808 --> 01:05:12,062
I got your address from Expect the Best.
Meet you at your house.

845
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,313
Great!

846
01:05:13,521 --> 01:05:15,482
He was hot!

847
01:05:27,994 --> 01:05:29,663
Desperation.

848
01:05:29,871 --> 01:05:32,165
It's the world's worst cologne.

849
01:05:35,669 --> 01:05:38,421
- You're good at that.
- It's the key to popcorn.

850
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,257
SwirI with the bowI.

851
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:42,092
Let's put the bowI down.

852
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,885
Let's make some more.

853
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:45,095
All right.

854
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:47,556
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

855
01:05:59,234 --> 01:06:01,695
More popcorn!
Want more popcorn!

856
01:06:01,903 --> 01:06:03,029
Stop, stop, stop.

857
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:06,199
- You want more?
- How does it work?

858
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,911
- Do you want butter?
- Do I want butter?

859
01:06:13,915 --> 01:06:16,918
Yeah. You represent well
in reaI life.

860
01:06:17,335 --> 01:06:18,837
Thanks a lot. So do you.

861
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:20,088
Thank you.

862
01:06:20,338 --> 01:06:22,632
When I missed you at Sea Merchant...

863
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:25,760
...I buzzed over on my Elite
and I ran into Pammy!

864
01:06:25,927 --> 01:06:29,264
- Pammy from U-Dub.
- Pamela. I'm Pamela now.

865
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:30,932
Oh, you're Pamela.

866
01:06:31,641 --> 01:06:34,769
Did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

867
01:06:35,103 --> 01:06:37,230
No. Jamie and I made popcorn.

868
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,275
We're making popcorn here with IKermit.

869
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:44,446
I'd love to show you
this package on the porch.

870
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:46,448
Just one second.

871
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:50,952
Sure.

872
01:06:54,206 --> 01:06:57,334
First off, we always said
separate lives.

873
01:06:57,542 --> 01:06:59,753
- It's no biggie.
- It's a major biggie!

874
01:06:59,961 --> 01:07:01,463
I knew him first!

875
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:05,383
So that gives you the right
to just bone him in my kitchen!

876
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:09,971
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date to get him.

877
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:13,475
No, you'd just wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

878
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:17,020
I will make popcorn
with whomever I want to.

879
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:19,564
You've made popcorn
with half of the city!

880
01:07:19,773 --> 01:07:21,983
At least I don't have to
chase the popcorn.

881
01:07:24,402 --> 01:07:27,614
I don't think we should take
this vacation together.

882
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:30,575
You told me to tell you
when you're being plastic.

883
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:32,285
You're being plastic.

884
01:07:32,494 --> 01:07:34,496
This is so unfair.

885
01:07:34,663 --> 01:07:36,206
How much do you want for him?

886
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:37,415
$ 200.

887
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:40,293
- Outrageous!
- That's what I paid.

888
01:07:40,502 --> 01:07:41,920
- $ 75.
- $ 150.

889
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:44,005
$80 and I'll do dishes all month.

890
01:07:44,172 --> 01:07:45,423
DeaI!

891
01:07:45,674 --> 01:07:46,675
Fine!

892
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:56,059
- We need to talk.
- I think we do.

893
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:58,228
There's something I need to say.

894
01:07:58,436 --> 01:08:00,313
- You want out.
- Let's get married.

895
01:08:01,606 --> 01:08:04,609
Everyone around us is together
for the wrong reasons.

896
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:08,488
Or they baiI out.
This is life telling us something.

897
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:10,740
- Oh, God!
- What?

898
01:08:10,949 --> 01:08:13,868
Don't make me remember
this chili dog forever.

899
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:17,539
Remember it.
Make that a historic chili dog.

900
01:08:18,707 --> 01:08:19,833
Take your time.

901
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:21,376
Think about it.

902
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:24,379
You don't even have to use words.

903
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:27,549
Just take a bite if the answer is yes.

904
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:34,639
I want to be logicaI about this.

905
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:37,434
Say we're married, we have the kid.

906
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:39,811
Will we be anything like we are now?

907
01:08:40,562 --> 01:08:44,232
It's really the great unknown.
Plus I've got work.

908
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:47,319
I've got that Alaska trip,
you've got your thing.

909
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:49,029
I want to be logicaI.

910
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:51,489
I think I can love you
and still be logicaI.

911
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:55,327
What?
What is that look?

912
01:08:57,412 --> 01:09:00,916
Someone who really cares about you.
It must scare you to death.

913
01:09:03,668 --> 01:09:05,170
Forget logic.

914
01:09:07,923 --> 01:09:09,674
What's in your heart?

915
01:09:12,761 --> 01:09:14,638
I want to do it.

916
01:09:16,223 --> 01:09:18,600
I think this is life
telling us something.

917
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,518
So that's a yes?

918
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:26,274
You're going to feeI good about this.

919
01:09:26,524 --> 01:09:27,817
Really?

920
01:09:28,026 --> 01:09:30,195
Mom, I want to get out!

921
01:09:31,613 --> 01:09:33,615
Why can't we get out?

922
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:37,077
Did we make the right decision?

923
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:38,745
I don't know.

924
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:48,380
Xavier almost made the AII-Star team.

925
01:09:48,588 --> 01:09:50,757
He fights players
who are better than him.

926
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:52,968
- Like?
- Like Charles Barkley.

927
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:55,136
That is a Bobby Van.

928
01:09:55,387 --> 01:09:56,555
Who?

929
01:09:56,888 --> 01:09:58,974
The host of Make Me Laugh.

930
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,647
I never got to finish that chili dog.

931
01:10:07,148 --> 01:10:08,984
That light's on yellow way too long.

932
01:10:20,495 --> 01:10:21,788
You okay?

933
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,500
You all right?

934
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:26,501
I'm fine.

935
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:28,044
Are you all right?

936
01:10:28,253 --> 01:10:29,504
Are you all right?

937
01:10:29,754 --> 01:10:31,131
Let's get out.

938
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:33,425
Come on, let's get out.

939
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,803
James.

940
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,140
James.

941
01:10:42,684 --> 01:10:43,560
Who's James?

942
01:10:44,978 --> 01:10:46,396
I don't know.

943
01:10:48,106 --> 01:10:49,399
Honey.

944
01:10:50,191 --> 01:10:53,528
James Worthy is a star.

945
01:10:53,778 --> 01:10:55,780
X is just a player.

946
01:10:56,448 --> 01:10:58,533
Is this from an earlier conversation?

947
01:11:01,536 --> 01:11:02,537
Good sign.

948
01:11:09,294 --> 01:11:12,631
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospitaI.

949
01:11:19,304 --> 01:11:21,473
I lost it, right?

950
01:11:21,681 --> 01:11:22,807
It's all over.

951
01:11:26,394 --> 01:11:28,021
If we can't make it through this...

952
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,523
...if you don't know
you're not alone...

953
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:35,195
I lost the baby.

954
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,407
Will you look at me?

955
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:45,038
I was flunking out of high school.

956
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:48,667
I was 45 pounds overweight,
had a dead-end job, a beat-up car.

957
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,669
I didn't feel good about myself.

958
01:11:50,877 --> 01:11:53,088
My future did not look very bright.

959
01:11:55,173 --> 01:11:56,758
How are you doing today?

960
01:11:56,967 --> 01:11:58,426
I'm better.

961
01:12:00,428 --> 01:12:04,057
I think I've read every single
magazine in the world.

962
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,687
- Did you go to work today?
- No, I didn't.

963
01:12:08,937 --> 01:12:12,065
It's been 2 weeks.
I think they're going to fire me.

964
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:18,572
I need some time alone.

965
01:12:19,614 --> 01:12:20,615
Alone?

966
01:12:23,368 --> 01:12:27,080
I have a new emotion every five seconds.

967
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:37,632
I think I should go ahead
and take that research trip.

968
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:42,220
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean.

969
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:44,055
Alone.

970
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:47,350
I know I'm right about this.

971
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:49,936
It's just a month.

972
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:51,897
It's just work.

973
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:56,151
See you in a month!

974
01:12:57,652 --> 01:12:59,529
I'll miss you!

975
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:08,496
Janet!

976
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:10,582
I got a present for you.

977
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:13,043
Give me another chance.

978
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:14,502
One, two minutes.

979
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:15,962
Come on.

980
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:22,010
This'll be great.

981
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:24,554
You're going to love me for this.

982
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:33,438
I installed your new stereo.

983
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,025
Great!

984
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:28,952
I'll replace the windows.

985
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:30,704
Thanks.

986
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,438
Work.

987
01:14:57,522 --> 01:14:59,566
Work has never been better.

988
01:15:04,696 --> 01:15:06,197
I miss her.

989
01:15:11,203 --> 01:15:14,247
What will we say to each other
when she gets back?

990
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:33,391
- Welcome back.
- You look great.

991
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,559
You too.

992
01:15:34,768 --> 01:15:35,936
How are you?

993
01:15:36,186 --> 01:15:37,187
How was it?

994
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:38,855
It was really good.

995
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:40,232
Really good.

996
01:15:40,482 --> 01:15:42,192
You want to go home
or out someplace?

997
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,610
I could do either.

998
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:45,237
Can you think of a place?

999
01:15:45,654 --> 01:15:48,156
There's Costa's, I guess.

1000
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:49,449
Or whatever.

1001
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:50,909
The 3-2-1?

1002
01:15:51,117 --> 01:15:54,037
- No, Costa's all right.
- I don't really care.

1003
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,127
Jesus!

1004
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:06,091
The pressure in the air could sink us.

1005
01:16:06,299 --> 01:16:07,676
I know.

1006
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:10,053
I really got into my job again.

1007
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:12,264
I did too.
I've been working my ass off.

1008
01:16:12,514 --> 01:16:15,267
I had the Coast Guard working for us.

1009
01:16:15,475 --> 01:16:16,851
It was reaI exciting.

1010
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,728
That's great.

1011
01:16:22,732 --> 01:16:25,443
We don't have to try
and be what we were.

1012
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:29,781
Thanks.
I've been thinking the same thing.

1013
01:16:34,494 --> 01:16:35,871
Great.

1014
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:39,666
Friends.

1015
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:45,630
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and mean it.

1016
01:16:50,218 --> 01:16:52,304
You always say the perfect thing.

1017
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,402
That obnoxious mime...

1018
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:09,362
...was right.

1019
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:11,781
Love disappears.

1020
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,377
Let's go, man!

1021
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:06,795
Let's go!

1022
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:08,964
We got people out here!

1023
01:18:09,464 --> 01:18:10,924
I got to go piss, man!

1024
01:18:11,132 --> 01:18:12,801
Let's go!

1025
01:18:13,009 --> 01:18:14,261
Linda.

1026
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:15,929
It's me.

1027
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:19,099
I had to call you.

1028
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:22,435
It's about midnight.
I was having many beers...

1029
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:25,105
...and I wanted to say...

1030
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,150
...what I should have said at the dock.

1031
01:18:29,651 --> 01:18:31,403
I fucking chickened out.

1032
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:35,532
I lied when I acted casuaI,
like Mr. CasuaI...

1033
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,701
...and I should have said it!

1034
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,829
You belong...

1035
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:43,164
...with...

1036
01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:45,292
...me!

1037
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:49,254
We belong together.

1038
01:18:49,462 --> 01:18:52,924
It pissed me off that, now that
we're talking, you thought...

1039
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:56,261
...I proposed to you only because
you were pregnant!

1040
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:58,555
I've got to go piss!

1041
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:02,017
This is not the bathroom!

1042
01:19:02,475 --> 01:19:05,353
Maybe if I'd said some of
these things at the dock...

1043
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,941
...it would've made a difference.
I think we made a big mistake.

1044
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,777
We had good times and bad times...

1045
01:19:12,986 --> 01:19:14,863
...but we had times.

1046
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:17,657
And I would like to start over.

1047
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:21,161
I would like to be new to you.

1048
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:24,998
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New.

1049
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:29,961
Call me back if you want.
This is the last time I'll call.

1050
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:37,677
If you really needed to know
how I really feeI...

1051
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:40,388
...that's how I feeI. I love you.

1052
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:44,809
That's something you should know.

1053
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:56,780
I won't bother you again.
Good night and goodbye.

1054
01:19:57,113 --> 01:19:59,199
I love you. Call me back.

1055
01:20:00,283 --> 01:20:01,660
Goodbye.

1056
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:23,473
This thing just eats tapes.

1057
01:20:34,818 --> 01:20:36,570
So ultimately we're talking about...

1058
01:20:36,778 --> 01:20:39,447
...900,000 to a million people
by the time it's done...

1059
01:20:39,656 --> 01:20:41,449
...most of them single-car drivers.

1060
01:20:41,658 --> 01:20:44,870
We provide a better and safer
environment than their cars.

1061
01:20:45,078 --> 01:20:47,038
Why can't it work, Mr. Mayor?

1062
01:20:47,247 --> 01:20:48,456
So it's a train.

1063
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:50,375
A supertrain.

1064
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:54,504
I've been burned by this
train business before.

1065
01:20:54,713 --> 01:20:56,423
You people all seem to forget.

1066
01:20:56,631 --> 01:20:58,466
We can change this city.

1067
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:01,177
People love their cars.

1068
01:21:06,016 --> 01:21:09,895
But if you give them great coffee...

1069
01:21:10,103 --> 01:21:12,147
...and great music. If you-

1070
01:21:12,355 --> 01:21:13,857
I'll put it to you like this...

1071
01:21:14,065 --> 01:21:15,942
...then I'll thank you
for your time.

1072
01:21:17,986 --> 01:21:19,195
My answer is...

1073
01:21:21,114 --> 01:21:22,574
...no.

1074
01:22:05,283 --> 01:22:06,826
Hi, may I help you?

1075
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,870
One ticket to Cabo San Lucas...

1076
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:11,373
...through Los Angeles,
first class, please.

1077
01:22:16,127 --> 01:22:19,422
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

1078
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:25,595
I think I'll put you in seat 3-C.

1079
01:22:26,096 --> 01:22:27,681
Thank you.

1080
01:22:32,435 --> 01:22:35,438
Tell me everything there is
to know about you.

1081
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:39,442
I've got a speciaI feeling about you.

1082
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:41,861
Don't feeI too bad about her.

1083
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,738
I'll tell you what happened.

1084
01:22:44,114 --> 01:22:46,449
The kid talks her ear off
the whole flight.

1085
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,577
His dad picks him up at the airport.

1086
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:50,745
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.

1087
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:52,038
His first words are...

1088
01:22:52,372 --> 01:22:54,541
Look at those fantastic earrings.

1089
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,504
And that's all it took.

1090
01:23:00,547 --> 01:23:02,215
Debbie was in love.

1091
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:09,014
She got back 2 weeks ago. He sends
her the big basket every day.

1092
01:23:09,222 --> 01:23:12,392
Every third one she sends back
just to be mysterious.

1093
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:14,603
I don't know. Games.

1094
01:23:15,228 --> 01:23:17,272
He wants her to move to Mexico.

1095
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,234
And if she gets a job at the
TV station there, she's going.

1096
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,286
Thanks.

1097
01:23:35,665 --> 01:23:38,543
Tomorrow I sneak in and spell
her name in rose petals.

1098
01:23:38,752 --> 01:23:41,087
Do you believe this job?

1099
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:15,163
It's so easy to fall back
into old patterns.

1100
01:24:15,372 --> 01:24:17,207
Back with Andy.

1101
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:19,918
One week and we're already
like one of those...

1102
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:23,171
...old couples who sit around in
Denny's and don't speak.

1103
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:26,341
What am I doing?

1104
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,635
Why did I chicken out?

1105
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:33,557
You have the...

1106
01:24:39,854 --> 01:24:41,022
No.

1107
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:42,482
This is good.

1108
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:44,901
Being with Andy is like being alone.

1109
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:45,986
Together.

1110
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:49,531
At least I'm not out there dating.

1111
01:24:50,407 --> 01:24:51,241
Love you.

1112
01:24:52,784 --> 01:24:54,369
Love you too.

1113
01:26:01,937 --> 01:26:02,771
What?

1114
01:26:16,785 --> 01:26:18,078
I was worried about you.

1115
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,288
I'm fine.

1116
01:26:20,497 --> 01:26:21,748
I am great!

1117
01:26:21,957 --> 01:26:23,750
Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

1118
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:27,045
I think you're going through
a phase of some kind.

1119
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:30,298
Do you realize that
in modern-day society...

1120
01:26:30,507 --> 01:26:34,094
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

1121
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:37,305
At all.

1122
01:26:37,472 --> 01:26:38,390
You're wigging.

1123
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:41,309
I'm not wigging.

1124
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:43,103
What? You think I'm wigging?

1125
01:26:46,481 --> 01:26:48,108
This is hang time.

1126
01:26:48,316 --> 01:26:49,943
I'm just...

1127
01:26:51,027 --> 01:26:54,072
I'm just regrouping.
I'm spending some time with myself.

1128
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:55,740
Getting stronger. Regrouping.

1129
01:26:55,949 --> 01:26:58,159
Thinking about regrouping.

1130
01:26:58,368 --> 01:27:02,414
I'm thinking about how I listened
to my instincts and they were wrong.

1131
01:27:02,622 --> 01:27:05,000
Wrong. The opposite of right.

1132
01:27:07,627 --> 01:27:10,881
I just wanted to bring you your maiI.

1133
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,342
You know...

1134
01:27:14,551 --> 01:27:17,345
...and maybe this isn't the
right time to say this...

1135
01:27:17,554 --> 01:27:20,307
...but things do turn around.

1136
01:27:20,557 --> 01:27:24,144
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

1137
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:27,314
I'm having the best time ever.
On my terms.

1138
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:30,525
And you know what else?
I'm going back to schooI.

1139
01:27:30,734 --> 01:27:32,193
Really?

1140
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:35,280
Paid off my loan.
Got all my classes.

1141
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:38,617
My first project is
to redesign the fountain...

1142
01:27:38,825 --> 01:27:40,035
...so we can sit in it.

1143
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:41,328
That's good news.

1144
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:43,330
It is.

1145
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,460
People need people.

1146
01:27:48,668 --> 01:27:50,170
It has nothing to do with sex.

1147
01:27:52,505 --> 01:27:54,633
Maybe 40 percent.

1148
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:56,509
60 percent.

1149
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,803
Forget it. Forget it.

1150
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:00,805
Tell you what:

1151
01:28:02,265 --> 01:28:04,893
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

1152
01:28:05,101 --> 01:28:06,519
...something good...

1153
01:28:06,728 --> 01:28:07,896
...something nice...

1154
01:28:08,104 --> 01:28:10,565
...that I want to share with you
or something...

1155
01:28:11,107 --> 01:28:13,735
...I will knock four times, okay?

1156
01:28:13,944 --> 01:28:15,654
It's going to be...

1157
01:28:15,862 --> 01:28:17,864
...our secret code.

1158
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:20,534
How?

1159
01:28:21,284 --> 01:28:22,619
- What?
- How?

1160
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:25,038
- How what?
- How will you knock?

1161
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:31,086
Like that.

1162
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,261
Take care of yourself.

1163
01:28:39,511 --> 01:28:40,720
Please.

1164
01:28:58,738 --> 01:29:02,242
In a paralleI universe,
we're probably a scorching couple.

1165
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:06,121
But in this one...

1166
01:29:06,746 --> 01:29:07,831
...neighbors.

1167
01:29:41,781 --> 01:29:44,868
Did you get my message last night?
Because I called.

1168
01:29:45,118 --> 01:29:46,203
I know.

1169
01:29:47,204 --> 01:29:49,706
I thought I appreciated you
but I didn't.

1170
01:29:57,047 --> 01:29:58,548
I used to...

1171
01:29:58,798 --> 01:30:02,677
...live out by the airport
underneath the flight patterns.

1172
01:30:02,886 --> 01:30:05,555
It was noisy with the planes
going by all day.

1173
01:30:07,224 --> 01:30:10,060
I used to have cookouts
and no one would come...

1174
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:11,811
...because of the noise.

1175
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:13,605
I got used to it.

1176
01:30:13,813 --> 01:30:17,901
And then, when I moved,
I missed the noise.

1177
01:30:18,193 --> 01:30:19,486
I missed the planes.

1178
01:30:22,864 --> 01:30:24,491
What are you talking about?

1179
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:26,826
I don't know.

1180
01:30:28,662 --> 01:30:30,455
I miss you.

1181
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:33,291
The way you used to look at me.

1182
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:34,793
Don't.

1183
01:30:35,001 --> 01:30:36,419
I'm finally over you.

1184
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:38,046
Really?

1185
01:30:40,173 --> 01:30:43,134
I mean, you know,
I still really do like you.

1186
01:30:43,343 --> 01:30:44,177
You know?

1187
01:30:44,678 --> 01:30:46,763
I think you're very...

1188
01:30:48,306 --> 01:30:49,558
What?

1189
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,476
Entertaining.

1190
01:30:55,522 --> 01:30:58,066
That's me. I got to go.
My break's over.

1191
01:30:59,526 --> 01:31:02,028
Janet, you rock my world.

1192
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,919
I'm walking down the avenue

1193
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,011
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

1194
01:32:14,684 --> 01:32:17,270
I'm laughing at the people I see

1195
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:22,567
Something like that.
I'm just playing with the lyrics.

1196
01:32:22,776 --> 01:32:26,196
None of that stuff is set in stone.
Anyway, I'm working on it.

1197
01:32:26,446 --> 01:32:27,906
Call me when you get in.

1198
01:32:28,114 --> 01:32:29,741
I don't know
what you're doing tonight.

1199
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:31,743
But give me a call.

1200
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:37,290
Talk to me, talk to me.

1201
01:32:37,499 --> 01:32:39,918
40 rsums, bring me back something.

1202
01:32:40,293 --> 01:32:41,795
Here we go!

1203
01:33:06,653 --> 01:33:09,406
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

1204
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:16,288
I don't need to be your girlfriend.

1205
01:33:16,496 --> 01:33:18,248
I just want to know you again.

1206
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:23,336
What took you so long?

1207
01:33:25,505 --> 01:33:27,257
I was stuck in traffic.

1208
01:34:19,643 --> 01:34:21,853
That's the way it happens around here.

1209
01:34:22,062 --> 01:34:25,440
Steve's moving out,
they're finding their own place.

1210
01:34:25,649 --> 01:34:27,359
- I'm happy for them.
- Look out!

1211
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:29,152
No problem.

1212
01:34:30,570 --> 01:34:33,323
I may live here forever and that's fine.

1213
01:34:33,865 --> 01:34:36,326
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

1214
01:34:36,576 --> 01:34:39,955
I don't know, for a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

1215
01:34:40,163 --> 01:34:41,873
Not for me.

1216
01:34:42,332 --> 01:34:45,210
My music is all the juice I'll need.

1217
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:47,379
I'm a self-contained unit.

1218
01:34:47,587 --> 01:34:49,631
I'm a solo artist.

1219
01:34:50,507 --> 01:34:53,385
I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

1220
01:35:04,688 --> 01:35:06,147
Going out?

1221
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:07,399
You?

1222
01:35:09,776 --> 01:35:11,528
That's a nice hat you're wearing.

1223
01:35:11,736 --> 01:35:14,948
And I don't mean that
in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

1224
01:35:16,116 --> 01:35:17,367
Thanks.

1225
01:35:22,372 --> 01:35:24,624
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

1226
01:35:45,729 --> 01:35:47,731
Does everyone go through this?

1227
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:50,442
No, I think just us.

1228
01:35:51,484 --> 01:35:52,777
I'll be celibate forever.

1229
01:35:52,986 --> 01:35:55,614
I could spend the rest of my life
with that girl.

1230
01:35:55,822 --> 01:35:58,366
She's in a car.
All you see is her head.

1231
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:00,452
- I know my type.
- I met someone new.

1232
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:03,079
- She's more my type than yours.
- She is not.

1233
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,999
- She is.
- You always say they're your type.
