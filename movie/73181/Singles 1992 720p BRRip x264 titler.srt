1
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,885
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:21,891
No dorm, no roommates, my own place.
I was so happy.

3
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,854
I had my own parking space.

4
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,583
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

5
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,129
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

6
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,756
Hm.

7
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,592
Huh.

8
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,650
- Hello.
- Need some help?

9
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,194
No, I...
Well, yeah, thanks.

10
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,831
I'm from Spain.

11
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,250
- Really? Which part?
- Galicia.

12
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,459
Oh.

13
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,422
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

14
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,593
"U-Dub. "
That's what people call it here.

15
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,846
Finally, a local tells
me some secrets.

16
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,894
You really don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

17
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,313
Where else do I have to go?

18
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,901
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

19
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,070
U - Dub.

20
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,230
This is Linda Powell from the
Seattle Environmental Council.

21
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,150
Okay, great.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

22
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,529
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

23
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,574
We gotta get somebody out there...

24
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,453
Ruth, how long have I been
saying there are no guys?

25
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,996
Forever.

26
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,959
I met one. I met one when
I was least expecting it.

27
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,627
You held out on me.

28
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,254
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

29
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,342
His visa runs out in two days.
He's...

30
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,429
Heh. He's like a comet.
What do I do?

31
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,765
I wish you could stay.

32
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,726
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

33
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,649
- Were you ever gonna come back?
- Well, now I have a reason.

34
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,446
I want you to have this.

35
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,661
I wish I was better able to
tell you what I am thinking.

36
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,708
But this is a symbol of our future.

37
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,549
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

38
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,721
Wow.

39
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:51,308
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

40
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,937
It's important to me.

41
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,401
Use this when you get back.

42
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,741
You'll always have
a parking space.

43
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,840
Hello.

44
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,219
Don't wake up. I'm getting on the plane.
I wanted to say bye.

45
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,397
- I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
- Goodbye, honey.

46
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,179
I miss you already.

47
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,191
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

48
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:46,489
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

49
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,282
"Basics"?

50
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,996
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

51
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,956
You're talking about
marrying this guy?

52
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,045
I'm tired of all the games.

53
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,094
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

54
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,014
- We will always go out dancing.
- What?

55
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,476
We will always go out dancing!

56
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,567
# State of love and trust as I

57
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,695
# Busted down the pretext

58
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,156
# Sin still plays and preaches

59
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,742
# But to have an empty court

60
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,993
# Uh-huh

61
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,746
# And I listen

62
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,750
# For the voice inside my head

63
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,210
# Nothing

64
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,547
# I'll do this one myself

65
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,226
# Yeah, yeah #

66
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,079
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

67
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:21,031
Here's the Liftrex, we have a Liftrex,
and the Liftrex Super.

68
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,166
Might be a little bit more
opener than you need.

69
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,504
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

70
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,258
...garage-door-opener combo.

71
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,221
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

72
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,155
I broke up with someone recently.
Jennifer, my last girlfriend.

73
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,699
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

74
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:59,121
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

75
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,125
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

76
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,838
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

77
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,965
Now she's with Tony.

78
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,805
Tony knows my friend Bailey,
who's friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

79
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,351
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

80
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,313
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

81
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,858
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

82
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,570
Tony will tell Jennifer I was going out
with Rita when I was with her.

83
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,615
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

84
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:41,497
Sometimes, I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

85
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,002
Isn't that great?

86
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,176
I don't know.
I think...

87
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,720
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

88
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,934
I think I'm back to the beginning.

89
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,271
My dad left home when I was 8.
You know what he said to me?

90
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,024
"Have fun. Stay single. "

91
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,485
I was 8.

92
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,490
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

93
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,825
He was from Boston.

94
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:23,289
The father and the mother have
finally learned to come together.

95
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,418
The father inserts his penis...
Uh...

96
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,588
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

97
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:39,263
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

98
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,227
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

99
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,858
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

100
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,861
- What?
- Yeah, what comes out?

101
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,323
- Spam!
- Oh, man!

102
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,538
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

103
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:09,752
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

104
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,630
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

105
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,133
Work.

106
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,177
I gotta go.

107
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,584
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

108
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:55,464
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

109
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,425
Here I am, 23.

110
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,513
Things are, um...
They're basically the same.

111
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,058
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

112
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:11,397
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

113
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,610
I get so much inspiration from
my boyfriend. He's a musician.

114
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,588
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

115
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,552
# Yeah

116
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,972
# Touch me I'm dick #

117
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,475
He's like a Renaissance man.

118
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,270
I'm so glad he moved
into my building.

119
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,251
- Janet. What's the ordeal?
- Hey.

120
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,798
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday, but...

121
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,469
So I just thought I'd
come by and say hi.

122
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

123
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,767
- So, um, how about this weekend?
- This weekend we're really busy.

124
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,187
- We got that show, right?
- Yeah, we got that show.

125
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,482
- We got these guys coming
from L.A. - Great.

126
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,525
- It's gonna be rocking.
- Bye, Cliff.

127
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,195
- So come over after.
- Deal.

128
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,618
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

129
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,787
You do know that, don't you?

130
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,041
You don't fool me.

131
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,920
Janet, I could not be
fooling you less.

132
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,172
Cliff, you gotta move
your truck, man.

133
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,635
I know what you're thinking.
We made the connection.

134
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,346
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

135
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,640
I mean, it makes its own decisions,
you know?

136
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:14,520
So sit back and enjoy it, because you
know when it's real. This is real.

137
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,313
We just don't even
have to discuss it.

138
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,735
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

139
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,700
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

140
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:44,216
So, um, I'll see you Saturday,
and I'll help you with your speakers.

141
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,181
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

142
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,771
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

143
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,692
I can store 20 numbers in this.
Tonight, I'm gonna fill it.

144
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,945
All or nothing. No compromise.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

145
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,200
What if the super you meets the super her,
and the super her rejects the super you?

146
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,828
- Then it's no problem.
- Uh-huh. Why?

147
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,373
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

148
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,837
- I live my life like a French movie.
- What?

149
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,756
Webster and 24th,
it should be here.

150
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,596
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

151
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,724
Hey, man...

152
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,143
...where's De Soto?

153
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,981
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

154
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,736
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

155
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,823
- Where's De Soto?
Our car broke down. - Yeah.

156
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,164
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

157
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,793
Every time I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

158
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,463
- Maybe it's the girls you choose.
- Hey!

159
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,132
Maybe I've been hurt,
maybe I've been dogged!

160
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,428
- Anybody know where this place is?
- Do I look like a Thomas Brothers Guide?

161
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,014
- You really shouldn't speak.
- Yes.

162
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,308
- Where do you work?
- I'm a maître d'.

163
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,186
- Department of Transportation.
- He's working on the gridlock problem.

164
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,146
- Thank God.
- I build airplanes.

165
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,023
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

166
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,658
# Yeah!

167
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,796
# Ooh

168
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,304
# There I was

169
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:59,893
# Laid out on a table

170
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,647
# Screamin' sweat

171
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:08,944
# And bare feet to the floor

172
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:15,158
# In my life, I'd not soften

173
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,288
# Things that cut and
burn so often

174
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,543
# But I sit, think of somethin'

175
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:29,172
# Scared to face
the dyin' nothin'

176
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:35,716
# See the cycle I've waited for

177
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:44,638
# It ain't like that anymore #

178
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,908
- Hey.
- Hello.

179
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,544
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

180
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,380
He says when you're
at a place like this...

181
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,759
...you can't just be yourself,
you have to have an act.

182
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,386
So anyway, I saw you
standing there...

183
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,140
...so I thought,
A, I could just leave you alone...

184
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:25,812
...B, I could come up with an act,
or C, I could just be myself.

185
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,107
I chose C.

186
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,234
What do you think?

187
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,448
- I think that A, you have an act...
- Uh-huh.

188
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,869
...and that B, not having
an act is your act.

189
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,832
Thank you.

190
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,546
Smaller fish,
so huge the ocean

191
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:57,469
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

192
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,348
I don't like to reduce us just
as being part of the Seattle sound.

193
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,850
I think of us expanding more.

194
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,812
We're huge in Europe right now.

195
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,857
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

196
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,194
# Into the flood again

197
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,155
# Same old trip it was back then

198
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,325
A song like "Touch Me I'm Dick"
is about what?

199
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,871
I think "Touch Me I'm Dick,"
in essence, speaks for itself.

200
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,709
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

201
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,753
It's about, you know...

202
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:35,590
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

203
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,510
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

204
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,055
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

205
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,560
- Hey, excuse me! Hello.
- Hi.

206
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,396
- Want to meet up later?
- Where you going?

207
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,232
- Anywhere you're going.
- Anywhere you're going.

208
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,943
- We're going home.
- We're going home.

209
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,736
- Do you have a...?
- See you.

210
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,241
"Anywhere you're going. "

211
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,286
Always get their numbers.
Tonight I got 20 numbers.

212
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,996
Twenty numbers.

213
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,747
Bailey...

214
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,709
...you got 20 numbers of 20 girls
that you will never call...

215
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,837
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

216
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:19,134
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

217
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,636
- Watch the volume.
- Sorry. Tinnitus.

218
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,849
- Club disease.
- You kids are all going to be deaf.

219
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,225
Bailey.

220
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,644
This is my night.

221
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,022
- What?
- Look.

222
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,109
Linda, don't look over.

223
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:25,367
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

224
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,955
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

225
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,540
- It was a joke.
- I know. I know.

226
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,962
You think it's something desperate people
do. You are wrong, wrong, wrong!

227
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,633
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

228
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,469
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

229
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,806
- Your medication, Miss Hunt.
- Thank you.

230
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,394
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

231
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:56,606
My roommate has no domestic skills.
Guys just don't know...

232
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,321
- Did you get the tunnel stuff?
- I'll call you back.

233
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,531
Denise.

234
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:08,118
The I-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

235
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,204
The Times wants to know
why there's gridlock on the I-5.

236
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,791
Tell them it's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio. "

237
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,334
- Did you read my proposal?
- Yeah.

238
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,669
What'd you think?

239
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,338
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

240
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,548
- Stu?
- After lunch.

241
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,759
After lunch, okay.
After lunch, Stu.

242
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,929
- Ted, what's up?
- Making music with my fingers.

243
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,433
And what a beautiful sound it is.

244
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,320
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

245
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:49,034
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

246
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,245
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

247
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,582
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

248
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,042
Coffee?

249
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,837
Water?
How about some water?

250
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:05,341
I'll meet you where you're having lunch,
and we'll have some water.

251
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,054
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

252
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,263
Mm-hm.

253
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,797
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

254
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:15,676
- Right.
- And now...

255
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:20,790
And now with all the
Exxon kickbacks, it's...

256
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:24,110
- God, yes. The worst.
- Yes.

257
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:29,074
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

258
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

259
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,537
I think it will work out.

260
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,921
- What? - There's just
no privacy anymore.

261
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,801
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

262
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,428
- Me too.
- My God.

263
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,638
Do you know what time it is?

264
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,100
- Yeah, 3:30.
- Oh, I'm so late.

265
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,144
- I'm glad your lunch date
didn't show. - Me too.

266
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,107
- Did you really have a lunch date?
- No. Heh.

267
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,110
- Maybe...
- I'm getting over somebody.

268
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,114
- We don't have to make it anything big.
- I think it's a bad time to get...

269
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

270
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,286
Here's my car. Let me give
you a ride back to work.

271
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,123
Okay.
Thanks.

272
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,339
Thanks.

273
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,235
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

274
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,071
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

275
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,616
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

276
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,120
I like this girl.

277
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,831
Gotta handle this one really well.

278
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:04,169
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

279
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,340
- You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
- Thanks.

280
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,637
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

281
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:20,602
That some jerk could trash the Mona Lisa
or an ocean or someone's life.

282
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,811
Yes.

283
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:26,566
So who are your neighbors?

284
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:31,279
Um, that's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d'.

285
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,072
He keeps us all in free meals.

286
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,453
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

287
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,913
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.

288
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,291
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

289
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:50,965
And that is Cliff. He delivers flowers,
has four jobs...

290
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,801
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

291
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,387
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

292
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,183
She works there too.
She's saving for architecture school.

293
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,644
Cliff and Janet...

294
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,482
That's it.

295
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,612
You sound like me talking
about my family.

296
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,116
Wanna go upstairs while
your stuff is still drying?

297
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,329
Um... Um...

298
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,928
That's a good picture of you.

299
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,307
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic? Ever?

300
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:47,563
Because I do, constantly. Traffic is
caused by the single-car driver.

301
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,234
Nine hundred thousand single people
get in their cars every morning.

302
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,445
They drive to work and
wonder why there's gridlock.

303
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,741
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

304
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:04,289
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Great coffee, great music...

305
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,166
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

306
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,960
But I still love my car, though.

307
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,547
Well... Uh... Oh.

308
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,427
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

309
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,804
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

310
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,434
- Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
- You dare to rip the X-Man.

311
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,227
Oh.

312
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:31,024
Kiss at the Hotel de Ville.
You have this too. I have this.

313
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,069
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

314
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,116
- I was a deejay in college.
- Really?

315
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,412
Yeah. That's why I
still have records.

316
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,721
So any boyfriends?

317
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,474
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

318
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:11,564
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

319
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,693
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

320
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:20,114
I made that up. Plus, I got back
together with Lynn last night.

321
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,867
So you probably want to
go ahead and freak out.

322
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:31,250
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

323
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,712
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

324
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,130
And then I...

325
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,716
- I'm talking too much.
- No, go ahead.

326
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,845
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

327
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,809
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

328
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,939
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

329
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,191
I was a semester too late.

330
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,249
# Oh, the heads that turn

331
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,461
# Make my back burn

332
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,089
Hi.

333
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:23,428
# Make my back
Make my back burn

334
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,477
Condoms.
They're free.

335
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,194
# The sparkle in your eyes

336
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,904
# Keeps me alive

337
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,490
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

338
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,493
Really?

339
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,081
There is so much life in you.

340
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:57,712
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

341
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,426
- I'm Andy.
- I'm Linda.

342
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,970
Emotional larceny?

343
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:10,892
We talked about how passion didn't matter
as much as comfort and stability.

344
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,143
- That's bullshit.
- No kidding.

345
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,563
- Sorry.
- It's cool.

346
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,069
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

347
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,113
I did the same thing.

348
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,908
One day, one of you goes for
groceries and never comes back.

349
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,117
I know.

350
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,077
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

351
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,412
I know.

352
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,790
- Why did I have to meet you in a club?
- I don't know.

353
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,213
Oh, I love this song.

354
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,633
# Waterfall

355
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,012
# Nothing can harm me at all

356
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,308
# My worries seem
so very small

357
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,896
# With my waterfall

358
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,776
My clothes.

359
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,822
- This is you?
- Yeah.

360
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,201
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

361
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,579
- I inherited it.
- Not sure how I feel about that.

362
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,585
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

363
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,630
- Okay. I'll call you.
- Okay. Don't forget.

364
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,090
I won't.

365
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,266
- Good night.
- Good night.

366
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,028
Good night.

367
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,364
Good night.

368
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,247
Listen, next time,
why don't you, um...

369
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,001
...park underground?

370
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,674
I should go.

371
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,122
One lucky shopper who gets a
60-second supermarket sweep.

372
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,833
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

373
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,754
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

374
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,226
Hi.

375
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:07,401
Uh, I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood...

376
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:30,466
Burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar, burglar, burg...

377
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,696
Oh!
Shh.

378
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,988
Neighbors.

379
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,910
It's Andy. Just calling to
make sure you're okay.

380
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,539
- She's okay. - I was thinking
about the conversation.

381
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,583
I think you should trust this guy,
although he's putting on moves...

382
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,920
...passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy. I know these things.

383
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,048
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

384
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:16,011
I think that you can trust him,
but be careful.

385
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,681
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

386
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,102
Starring Fred MacMurray.

387
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:30,776
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

388
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,780
- Whenever, whenever.
- You're amazing.

389
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,243
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

390
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,079
- We're being too loud.
- Huh?

391
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,377
What are you thinking right now?

392
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,175
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

393
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,720
Things happen throughout the course
of the game. Nothing you can do.

394
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,848
I don't go out to look to say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up. "

395
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,894
- Anything else, X?
- Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

396
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:27,333
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

397
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:34,715
Mm, what can I eat? I'm tired of
starving myself for this guy.

398
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,843
Salad. I'll have a salad.

399
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,184
If I call him, that's
being desperate.

400
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:51,148
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

401
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,985
If he shows up, I'll listen,
but no way do I call him.

402
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,949
Of course,
men do like to be called.

403
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:05,538
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will be
one hour, and that is officially very late.

404
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,836
He is officially very late.

405
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,552
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

406
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,680
Two out of three.

407
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,231
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

408
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:40,364
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

409
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:45,202
Forget it. I am not desperate.
I have many people to spend a Saturday with.

410
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,249
- Quit getting involved with neighbors.
- That broke us up?

411
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,043
- We're better as friends.
- Absolutely.

412
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,339
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

413
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,675
- I know.
- Except when it comes to women.

414
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,678
He likes these club-type women...

415
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,848
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

416
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,768
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

417
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,148
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

418
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,904
You're from the High Plains, Janet.

419
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,409
Hm...

420
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,078
I'm so glad I live here.

421
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,977
- Are my breasts too
small for you? - No.

422
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,481
God.

423
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:08,077
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

424
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:13,540
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

425
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,502
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

426
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,713
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

427
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,425
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

428
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,635
You know?

429
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,972
Don't lie because when you do,
your eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

430
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,773
Okay, ask me.

431
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,403
Are my breasts too small for you?

432
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,412
Sometimes.

433
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,790
When I get married,
I'm gonna change my reins

434
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,251
- A-ha
- I'm trading in my bridal

435
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,253
For a wedding band

436
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,881
She's gonna hang up her spurs
Raise some little cockleburs

437
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,051
And settle down around
the Rio Grande

438
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:10,431
Like any straight-shootin'
Hard-ridin', law-abidin'

439
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,433
Have you had implants before?

440
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,228
What do you think?

441
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,689
No.

442
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:24,611
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

443
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,032
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

444
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,826
...by graph. Right.

445
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,953
Well, what's painful?

446
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,833
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

447
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,044
...mine in particular.

448
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:45,883
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

449
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,635
All right.
Bye-bye.

450
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

451
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:56,226
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

452
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,066
How about that?

453
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,527
Hm.

454
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,115
Uh...

455
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:16,121
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

456
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,752
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

457
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,088
Yeah.

458
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,302
- Whoa. Do you jog?
- A little.

459
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,181
See, maybe, here.

460
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,561
- Split the difference?
- Split the difference.

461
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,864
# 'Cause I'm stuck by myself

462
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,701
# Touch me I'm dick

463
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:08,465
Hi, it's me. I'm tired of
doing the right thing.

464
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,135
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

465
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:12,803
Um...

466
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:17,850
I'm on the bed right now,
wearing something really outrageous.

467
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,519
I've got no underwear on.

468
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,358
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

469
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,362
I think you've got the wrong number, lady,
but I'll be right over.

470
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:43,625
- This guy plays no games.
- That's great.

471
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,835
Yeah.

472
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,630
- I've got to play this one perfectly.
- Go with it.

473
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,259
- What do your instincts tell you to do?
- Not to listen to you guys.

474
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,596
- There you go. - She doesn't want
you tugging at her bra strap.

475
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:00,475
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

476
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,022
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

477
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,276
- Should I trust him?
- Yeah.

478
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,905
- Not all guys are like Luiz.
- You're right.

479
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,992
You're right.
Steve is different.

480
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,663
Steve, just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

481
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,293
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

482
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,134
What are you thinking?

483
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:38,013
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

484
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,309
- My chest hurts.
- Uh-oh.

485
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,647
- You didn't, like, leave a note?
- No, I left my blue T-shirt by mistake.

486
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,942
- There are no mistakes.
- What?

487
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,361
What does that...? What does that mean?
Give me the phone.

488
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:58,784
Ahem. I'm going to call
my new semi-girlfriend.

489
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,495
You're gonna scare her off.

490
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,623
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

491
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,585
- Distinguish yourself
by not calling. - Yep.

492
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,799
- P.S., that's how you get her.
- No. Bailey, you don't understand.

493
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,385
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

494
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,349
You're right.

495
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,645
I gotta let this one breathe.

496
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:33,694
You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

497
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,994
- So how'd it go?
- I got the boat.

498
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,414
- The trip to Alaska's set.
- Oh, great, Linda.

499
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,417
- That is great.
- Yeah.

500
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,334
Oh, Steve on two.

501
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:56,572
Four days he waits
to call me.

502
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,927
So, what do I tell him?

503
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,222
- Tell him I went out for groceries.
- Okay.

504
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,018
She went out for groceries.

505
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,687
Uh-huh. Bye-bye.

506
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,690
He's coming right over.

507
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,860
- What do you mean, nothing?
- Nothing is wrong.

508
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,405
Really.
Thanks.

509
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,074
- I thought we connected.
- This is a small office.

510
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,661
- Is this because I didn't call?
- I don't remember. Did you call?

511
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,415
I don't know why you're being like this.
I like you. It was cool meeting you.

512
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,667
I'll call you, or you call me.

513
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,085
Look, I'm sorry if I blew
it by not calling.

514
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:45,800
You don't owe me anything.
You don't have to call me.

515
00:44:45,835 --> 00:44:48,435
- Is this about your old boyfriend
who calls? - Andy doesn't call.

516
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,645
- Probably has a ponytail, right?
- No.

517
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:54,608
- Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
- He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

518
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:04,451
- You're scared of getting close to me.
- You don't know me well enough.

519
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,745
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.

520
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,042
Look, let's not play games.

521
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,961
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

522
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,344
- What I mean is...
- I've gotta work, Steve.

523
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,515
- Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
- Bye, Steve.

524
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:41,113
Why? Why do you talk
such a good game?

525
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,418
You talk about
things that matter,

526
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,661
that get me excited,
that get me hot.

527
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,824
But it's like
you're lobotomized.

528
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:56,499
Why can't I just
protect myself?

529
00:45:57,002 --> 00:46:00,634
Why can't I just be a buddy?

530
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:06,179
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

531
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,640
It's better to be the dumper
than the dumpee.

532
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,977
Mom. Mom.
Yeah.

533
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:17,190
Listen, Mom, if he invited you to Hawaii,
yes, he wants something.

534
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:22,404
And who cares? Dad's been gone
for two years. Uh-huh.

535
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,199
Listen. Listen, Mom!

536
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:31,204
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

537
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:36,209
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

538
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,086
I rinsed them, Debbie.

539
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,840
You have to rinse off all the food
or it gets all over.

540
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,845
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

541
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:52,017
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best. Uh-huh.

542
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,235
Hi.

543
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:06,072
- This is for Expect the Best, right?
- Yeah. I brought clippings.

544
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,408
- Possible looks for my video.
- Mm.

545
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:12,829
Here we have the Edie Sedgwick.
You know?

546
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,539
Oh.

547
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,501
Pseudo Brigitte Bardot.

548
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:23,465
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

549
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,593
Mm-hm.

550
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,555
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

551
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,099
Truth?

552
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,602
Truth.

553
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:44,110
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

554
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,198
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

555
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,954
Twenty.

556
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:58,208
Ahem.
He doesn't even know me.

557
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,418
Debbie...

558
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,505
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

559
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:09,761
Okay.
Okay, I'm in your hands.

560
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,399
I am Debbie Hunt.

561
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,653
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

562
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,824
But I am not about looks.

563
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,456
Hi.

564
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:42,460
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

565
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:48,300
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

566
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,428
Oh, no druggies, please.

567
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:56,349
I'm fairly intense,
and I'm an advertising exec...

568
00:48:56,517 --> 00:49:01,730
...at KRWE-TV.
That's me.

569
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:07,235
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

570
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,247
Yeah.

571
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,085
"Debbie country. "
It's funny.

572
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,387
- "Doghouse" as an encore?
- Should be six songs.

573
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,599
- They want me to come out.
- They are just our friends.

574
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:41,853
- "Doghouse" as an encore.
- You can't start out with that.

575
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,606
Why make them clap so
we come out again?

576
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:47,400
- You don't get it.
- I agree with Cliff.

577
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:51,488
- Hey, a review of our record.
- Whoa, read it out loud.

578
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,407
"When the shirtless
Cliff starts to sing... "

579
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:58,495
Wait a minute, man. I don't want
to hear anything negative.

580
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,165
Go on.

581
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,273
"Other than that he was ably
backed by Stone and Jeff...

582
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,151
...and drummer Eddie Vedder. "
That's good. That's a good review.

583
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:36,199
- A compliment for us is a
compliment for you. - No, man.

584
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,577
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

585
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,165
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

586
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,877
This weekend, we rock Portland.

587
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,130
Yeah!

588
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,763
Okay, I know you're in love,
but are you sure you want to do this?

589
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,766
Yep.
My mind is made up.

590
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,769
Want to read a magazine?

591
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,022
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

592
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,608
I didn't want you to go alone.

593
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,749
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

594
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:31,504
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

595
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,799
...I wanted a guy with...

596
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,512
...looks, security, caring.

597
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,890
Someone with their own place.

598
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,312
Someone who said, "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

599
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,524
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

600
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:52,942
And someone who loves me.

601
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:59,032
- Tall order.
- Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

602
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,950
What is it now?

603
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,959
Someone who says,
"gesundheit" when I sneeze,

604
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:08,632
although I prefer "bless you. "
It's nicer.

605
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,462
- Janet, sorry you had to wait.
- Dr. Jamison.

606
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,839
This is my friend, Steve.

607
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,259
- Doctor.
- Hi, Steve. Come on in.

608
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,845
Hey, last chance.

609
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,977
Here we go.

610
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:32,607
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

611
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,527
...in three years of being an HMO.

612
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:40,907
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

613
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,910
I think you're perfect.

614
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:49,999
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate you
the way you are, then you have to ask:

615
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,462
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

616
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,423
Wow.

617
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,218
What's that mean, "wow"?

618
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,763
- Did my check bounce?
- No.

619
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,391
Janet...

620
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,394
...I really have a feeling about you.

621
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,693
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

622
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,444
Okay.

623
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:24,576
- I still feel good about what I said.
- Oh, no, you should. It's good.

624
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,249
- Can I say something to you?
- Sure.

625
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,961
Your face wants a different part,
your hair.

626
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,590
- My hair?
- Yeah.

627
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,720
Yeah, there you go.

628
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,594
Mm. Now you look
vaguely rocking.

629
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:50,125
I mean c'mon, you are
a happening guy, you know?

630
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,525
You're Dr. Jamison...
You've got like, like nice eyes,

631
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,484
and you've got those great
trustworthy eyebrows...

632
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:03,031
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

633
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,074
Yeah.

634
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:12,874
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

636
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,585
See, I don't know how to have fun.

637
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:20,214
I'm 33 years old,
and I don't know how to have fun.

638
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,390
There.
Now was that fun or what?

639
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,019
Yeah, that was fun.

640
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,828
- Doc.
- Yeah, I know, the operation.

641
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,587
I want Cliff to like
me the way I am.

642
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,342
Thanks.

643
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,434
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

644
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:19,023
High in the sky,
the only male bees, the drones...

645
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,777
- So Portland, maybe it
wasn't our city. - Shh.

646
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,447
- Man, where are the anthems
of our youth? - Shh.

647
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,159
What happened to music
that meant something?

648
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,997
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

649
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,755
Where is the
"Misty Mountain Hop"?

650
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:41,428
Where is the "Smoke on the Water"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

651
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,466
- We're not going out tonight, are we?
- Look at this.

652
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:51,597
These bands are like well-designed bottles
of bleach. It's beer and lifestyle music.

653
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:56,978
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

654
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,480
...I don't know, I mean, what?

655
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,443
We could just take a bath.

656
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:09,032
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

657
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,702
The yellowjacket wasp
has come looking for food.

658
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,788
The alarm is sounded.

659
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,629
They pour into
the European hives.

660
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:29,594
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend.

661
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:37,643
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

662
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:43,649
I don't have to be here.
I... I could just break up with him.

663
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:56,037
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

664
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:04,504
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

665
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,499
Hi!

666
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:46,003
Hi.
Did I overreact?

667
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,215
Do you know who this is?

668
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,874
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

669
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:30,506
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

670
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:36,053
I can't figure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

671
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:41,726
- I'm a little late this month, that's all.
- Well, how...? How late?

672
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,857
- Late.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

673
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,668
- Steve Dunne.
- Yeah.

674
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,254
- Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.
- Doug, hi.

675
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:14,717
- What is up? How you doing, man?
- Great, man.

676
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,970
You know how much homework I missed
because of you?

677
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,516
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

678
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:27,230
We're throwing down tonight on Aloha Street.
It's gonna be insane.

679
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,191
- Would you do a little
wheels of steel? - Oh, no.

680
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:31,984
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

681
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,571
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

682
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,115
What's so funny about...?
Peace, peace, peace

683
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,159
Love and under...
Peace, peace, peace

684
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:43,204
What does a brother understand...?
Peace, peace

685
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,040
Peace, understand, peace, peace

686
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,378
You're the best, man!
You are the king. You are the king.

687
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,756
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

688
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,051
Of course, you may be busy.

689
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,892
Ten minutes, then we pour X into B.
If it's blue...

690
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,396
- Then we have a big talk.
- Yeah. Heh.

691
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:13,401
# I nearly lost you there

692
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,487
- I have some time right now.
- Then let's talk right now.

693
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,698
- Okay.
- Okay.

694
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:22,535
- My body knows it's gonna be blue.
- It's not gonna be blue.

695
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:24,912
- It is not gonna be blue.
- You're right.

696
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,706
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

697
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:29,375
Really?
Oh.

698
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,173
- Do you know where my other shoes are?
- No, maybe they're by the door.

699
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,593
- That would be wild.
- What?

700
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,804
Having a kid.

701
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,601
- If you were pregnant.
- If I were pregnant, which I'm not.

702
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,730
And I wouldn't expect you
to deal with it anyway.

703
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,526
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

704
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,824
To friendship.

705
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,460
- That's bluish, right?
- It's fairly blue.

706
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:15,296
- Well...
- Put it against something blue.

707
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,549
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Uh...

708
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,552
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

709
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,804
- Oh.
- White.

710
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,730
- What are you gonna do today?
- Meet the deputy mayor.

711
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:38,652
- Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
- I have stuff to do. Do... Or call you...

712
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,237
- Okay.
- Bye.

713
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,907
- Bye.
- Bye.

714
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,037
- Finally...
- Interesting.

715
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:52,291
...if we get the single car
driver on the supertrain,

716
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:56,682
we can change the city.
It's all in the proposal.

717
01:02:03,095 --> 01:02:07,306
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

718
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:09,767
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

719
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,270
Thank you.

720
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:19,652
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

721
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:25,324
I'd like to kind of leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

722
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:30,538
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

723
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:36,127
All right, these are the
men who want me.

724
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:40,881
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

725
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:45,511
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

726
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,932
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

727
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:55,271
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

728
01:02:55,522 --> 01:03:00,734
I'm a very meticulous person in
appearance and also very precise.

729
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:04,029
If two people really believe
in each other...

730
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,992
...that love can go around the world
and through their souls.

731
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,286
But love is very delicate.

732
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:14,832
In fact, if you're both not very careful
and nurturing, that love can:

733
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,252
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

734
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:23,048
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

735
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,343
I like the way the world looks
from a bicycle.

736
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:31,515
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

737
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:35,394
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

738
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:40,941
I am very, very, very lonely.

739
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,993
- Who?
- Definitely the bicycle guy.

740
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,913
The bicycle guy.

741
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,290
He's like your soul mate.

742
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,043
Guy with the bicycle.

743
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,563
Nice outfit.

744
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,484
- Is he late?
- Yeah.

745
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:28,072
- Yeah, but I expect the best.
- Yeah.

746
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:33,285
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

747
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,580
- There's another Sea Merchant?
- Yeah, the new one.

748
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,415
Oh, no.

749
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,378
- On your right!
- On your right!

750
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:46,465
- On your right!
- On your right!

751
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:04,483
Excuse me, was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

752
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,486
Yes, and he left you a message:

753
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:10,906
"I got your address from Expect the Best.
I'll meet you at your house. "

754
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:15,202
- Great.
- He was hot. Tsss.

755
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,926
Desperation,
it's the world's worst cologne.

756
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,514
- Out of salt.
- You are good at that.

757
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,975
- This is the key to popcorn.
- Is it?

758
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:41,103
- Swirl with the bowl.
- Good, put the bowl down.

759
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,063
- Let's make some more.
- You want more?

760
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,273
Ow.
Ow.

761
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,358
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

762
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,873
- More popcorn.
- Stop, stop, stop.

763
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,250
- What, what, what?
- Stop, stop, stop.

764
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,502
- Want more?
- How does this work?

765
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,048
- Um, do you want butter?
- Do I want butter?

766
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

767
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,509
- Debbie.
- Jamie.

768
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,598
- Wow, you represent well in real life.
- Thanks a lot. So do you.

769
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,058
Thank you.

770
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,603
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

771
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,898
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

772
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,817
- Pamela. I'm Pamela.
- Oh, you're Pamela.

773
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:33,530
Pamela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

774
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:39,036
- No, Jamie and I, we're making popcorn.
- We're making popcorn with Kermit.

775
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,207
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

776
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,752
- Just for a second.
- Okay. All right.

777
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,253
Okay.

778
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,713
Sure.

779
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,762
- We always said separate lives, Pam.
- It's no biggie, all right?

780
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,265
- It's a major biggie!
- Look, I knew him first.

781
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:04,186
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

782
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,273
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

783
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:12,236
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

784
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:17,700
- I will make popcorn with whomever I want.
- You've made popcorn with half the city!

785
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,786
At least I don't have
to chase the popcorn.

786
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,750
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

787
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:30,963
Remember how you told me to tell you when
you're being plastic? You're being plastic.

788
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,298
This is so unfair.

789
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,176
- How much do you want for him?
- Two hundred dollars.

790
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,096
- Outrageous.
- That's what I paid.

791
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,723
- Seventy-five.
- One-fifty.

792
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,933
Eighty, and I'll do the
dishes all month.

793
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,143
- Deal.
- Deal.

794
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,228
- Fine.
- Fine.

795
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,820
- We need to talk.
- I think we do.

796
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,697
There's something I need to say.

797
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:57,906
- You want out.
- Let's get married.

798
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,700
- What?
- What?

799
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:03,412
Everyone's together for
the wrong reasons...

800
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,875
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

801
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,543
- Oh, God.
- What?

802
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,504
Don't make me remember
this chilidog forever.

803
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:16,258
Remember it.
Make that a historic chilidog.

804
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,262
Take your time.
Think about it.

805
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:26,602
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

806
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,442
- I want to be logical.
- Okay.

807
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,278
Say we're married, it's a year from now,
we have the kid...

808
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:41,492
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

809
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:46,121
I've got work. I've got that coastal trip
to Alaska, and you've got your thing.

810
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:51,543
I want to be logical. I think I
can love you and still be logical.

811
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,546
What?
What is that look?

812
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,718
Someone who really cares about you,
it must scare you to death.

813
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,972
Forget logic.

814
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,602
What's in your heart?

815
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,690
I want to do it.

816
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,445
- This is life telling us something.
- So that's a yes?

817
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,197
Yes.

818
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,620
- You're gonna feel good about this.
- Oh, really?

819
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,729
Mom, I wanna get out!

820
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:33,193
Mom, can't we get out?

821
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,381
- Did we make the right decision?
- I don't know.

822
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:40,133
Please, Mom!

823
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,385
- Yes.
- Yes.

824
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:42,636
- Yes.
- Yes.

825
01:09:44,973 --> 01:09:47,182
Xavier McDaniel almost
made the All-Star team.

826
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,143
- Why does he pick a fight
with every player? - Like?

827
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,770
Like Charles Barkley.

828
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,357
- That's a Bobby Van.
- Who's Bobby Van?

829
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,734
He was the host
of Make Me Laugh.

830
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,868
I never got to finish that chilidog,
you know?

831
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,786
That light's on yellow way too long.

832
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,008
You okay?

833
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,678
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

834
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,889
Huh?
Are you all right?

835
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,309
Are you all right?
Let's get out.

836
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,185
Come on, let's get out.

837
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,230
James.

838
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,942
James.

839
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,157
- Who's James?
- Uh, I don't know.

840
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,660
Honey?

841
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:54,583
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

842
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:59,087
- Is this a conversation you
had earlier? - Yes.

843
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,174
It's a good sign.

844
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:05,677
- What?
- Hey, hey.

845
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,013
- Hey.
- Hi.

846
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,433
Hey. Hi. We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

847
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,610
I lost it, right?
It's all over.

848
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,826
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

849
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,247
- Linda?
- I lost the baby.

850
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,752
Will you look at me?

851
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:47,427
I was flunking high school, I was 45
pounds overweight, had a dead-end job.

852
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,557
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

853
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:53,767
- Hey.
- Hi.

854
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:58,146
- How are you doing today?
- I'm better. I'm better.

855
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,734
I think I've read every single
magazine in the world.

856
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:08,407
- Did you go to work today?
- No. It's been two weeks.

857
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,951
I think they're going to fire me.

858
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:19,126
- I need some time alone.
- Alone?

859
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,961
Yeah.

860
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:26,133
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

861
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,760
I know it can change your life.

862
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:33,056
I'd like to share with you a poem
I think is real special.

863
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,184
I think I should take
that research trip.

864
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:43,025
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

865
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,737
I know I'm right about this.

866
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,782
It's just a month.
It's just work.

867
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,953
See you in a month!

868
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,749
I'll miss you!

869
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:09,384
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

870
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:15,015
Give me another chance.
One... Two minutes. Come on.

871
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,854
- Hey. This'll be great.
- Oh.

872
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:23,607
- You're gonna love me for this.
- Mm.

873
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,990
I installed your new stereo.

874
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,078
Oh.
Great.

875
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:56,389
Yeah.
Yeah.

876
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,767
# Out of your mind you are

877
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,480
#Can't find a way
to get back in

878
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,357
Yeah.

879
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,277
# Broken thinkin', broken mind

880
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:22,249
# I'm a jinx, I'm a jinx
Bad luck follows everywhere

881
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:29,923
- I'll replace the windows.
- Thanks.

882
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:58,535
Work.
Work has never been better.

883
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,167
I miss her.

884
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,049
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

885
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,526
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome back.

886
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,361
- You look great.
- You too.

887
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:35,864
How are you? How was it?

888
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,699
- It was really good.
- Yeah?

889
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,117
Yeah, really good.

890
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,579
- You want to go home? Out someplace?
- Whatever.

891
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:48,543
- Let me think of the place...
- There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

892
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,492
- The 3-2-1? We could go...
- Yeah.

893
01:15:50,605 --> 01:15:53,321
- Costas is all right.
- Yeah. I don't really care.

894
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,827
Jesus.

895
01:16:03,364 --> 01:16:06,723
- We both could sink from all the
pressure in the air. - I know.

896
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:11,066
- I really got into my job again.
- I did too. I've been working my ass off.

897
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:15,654
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

898
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,656
That's great.

899
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,246
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

900
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,583
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

901
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,048
Great.

902
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:38,635
Friends.

903
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:44,432
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

904
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,147
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

905
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,487
That obnoxious mime?

906
01:17:06,977 --> 01:17:11,359
He was right.
Love disappears.

907
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,274
# Lying like needles

908
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:37,527
# On forest earth

909
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:40,155
# Euphoric rush

910
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,199
# Trees bend to pray for us

911
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,786
# I'm sputtering

912
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:50,081
# Like cold machines

913
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:53,543
# Late for the birth

914
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,837
# Ritual!

915
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,049
# Ritual!

916
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,719
# Ritual! #

917
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,014
Come on, man!
Let's go!

918
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:07,724
We got people out here!

919
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,644
- Hello.
- I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

920
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,949
Linda.
It's me.

921
01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:18,241
Uh, I had to call you.

922
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,905
It's about midnight.
I was just having many beers...

923
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:24,574
...and I wanted to say...

924
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,161
...what I should have
said at the dock.

925
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,953
I fucking chickened out.
I...

926
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:36,610
I lied when I acted casual, like Mr. Casual,
and I should have said it.

927
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,479
You...

928
01:18:39,537 --> 01:18:41,160
belong...

929
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,906
with...

930
01:18:43,248 --> 01:18:45,328
me!

931
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,014
We belong together and...

932
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:51,726
And what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

933
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:55,021
...I proposed only because you
were pregnant. What's that about?

934
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,232
I've got to go piss!

935
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,152
- I've got to go...
- Hey, this is not the bathroom!

936
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:06,324
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

937
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:11,621
I think we made a big mistake,
because we had good times and bad times...

938
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,623
...but we had times.

939
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,419
And I would like to start over.

940
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,338
I would like to be new to you.

941
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:24,843
I wanna be new to you.
I wanna be Mr. New...

942
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,139
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

943
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,350
And...

944
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,433
And if you really needed
to know how I feel,

945
01:19:36,576 --> 01:19:39,829
how I really feel,
that's how I feel. I love you.

946
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:44,564
And, uh, that's something
you should know, so...

947
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:55,623
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

948
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,420
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

949
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,188
Ugh...

950
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,692
This thing just eats tapes.

951
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:39,052
We're talking about 900,000 to a
million people by the time it's done...

952
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,322
...most of them single-car drivers.

953
01:20:41,357 --> 01:20:46,090
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

954
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:49,260
- So it's a train.
- A supertrain.

955
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:53,556
I've been burned by this
train business before.

956
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:57,477
- You people all seem to forget.
- We can change this city.

957
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:59,938
People love their cars.

958
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,776
Yes.
But, uh...

959
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:07,529
- But if you give them great...
- Coffee.

960
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,949
Coffee...
And great music. If you...

961
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,786
I'll put it to you like this,
and then I'll thank you for your time.

962
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:16,329
Mm-hm.

963
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,790
My answer is...

964
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,043
...no.

965
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,712
Hi.
May I help you?

966
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:11,593
One ticket to Cabo San Lucas through
Los Angeles, first class, please. And, uh...

967
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:18,266
Could you seat me next
to a single guy?

968
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:24,480
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

969
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,191
Thank you.

970
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,407
Tell me everything there
is to know about you.

971
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,286
I've got a special feeling about you.

972
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,915
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

973
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:47,420
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
His dad picks him up at the airport.

974
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,882
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

975
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,384
Look at those fantastic earrings.

976
01:22:55,846 --> 01:23:01,100
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

977
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:05,980
She got back two weeks ago.

978
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,108
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

979
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:13,529
...she sends back, just to be mysterious.
I don't know, games.

980
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:16,240
He wants her to
move to Mexico...

981
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:20,411
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

982
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,463
Oh, thanks.

983
01:23:35,062 --> 01:23:38,043
Tomorrow, I gotta sneak in there
and spell her name in rose petals.

984
01:23:38,182 --> 01:23:40,645
Do you believe this job?

985
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:14,006
Hm. It's so easy to fall
back into old patterns.

986
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,385
Back with Andy.
One week and we're already like...

987
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:22,306
...one of those old couples who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

988
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,309
What am I doing?

989
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,812
Why did I chicken out?

990
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:32,400
Do you have the?

991
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,654
Thanks.

992
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:44,829
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

993
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,458
At least I'm not out there dating.

994
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:53,421
- Love you.
- Love you too.

995
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:03,574
- What?
- Hi.

996
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:04,867
Hey.

997
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:16,921
Hey. I was worried about you.

998
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:22,635
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

999
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:26,013
Steve, I think you're going
through a phase.

1000
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,225
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

1001
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:33,104
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

1002
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:37,233
- At all.
- Steve, you're wigging.

1003
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,946
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

1004
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:50,872
This is hang time. I'm just, uh...
I'm just regrouping.

1005
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,625
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

1006
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:58,754
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

1007
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:04,093
...how I listened to my instincts and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

1008
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:09,765
Well, I just wanted to
bring you your mail.

1009
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:16,522
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you...

1010
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,233
...but things do turn around, Steve.

1011
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,237
I mean, I don't even
think about Cliff anymore.

1012
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:26,157
I'm having the best time ever,
on my terms.

1013
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:29,410
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

1014
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,370
- Really?
- Yeah. Heh-heh.

1015
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:35,291
Paid off my loan. Got all my architecture
classes. My first project...

1016
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:38,920
...is to redesign the fountain
so we can sit in it.

1017
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,173
- That's good news.
- It is.

1018
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:50,306
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

1019
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:56,103
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

1020
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,189
Forget it.

1021
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,066
Tell you what.

1022
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,819
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

1023
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:08,407
...something good and nice that I want
to share with you or something...

1024
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:12,828
- Uh-huh.
- I will knock four times, okay?

1025
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:17,041
It's gonna be our secret code.

1026
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,836
- How?
- Okay? What?

1027
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,129
- How?
- How what?

1028
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,965
How will you knock?

1029
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:25,883
Oh.

1030
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,388
Like that.

1031
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,058
Okay.

1032
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:40,022
Take care of yourself, Steve.
Please.

1033
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:01,127
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a scorching couple.

1034
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,716
But in this one, neighbors.

1035
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,666
- Hi.
- Hi.

1036
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:43,836
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

1037
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:45,046
I know.

1038
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,549
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

1039
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,513
I...

1040
01:29:55,891 --> 01:30:01,645
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

1041
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:05,983
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

1042
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:10,696
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

1043
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:15,117
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

1044
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:18,329
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

1045
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,669
- Cliff, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1046
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:32,510
I miss you.
The way you used to look at me...

1047
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:36,889
- Cliff, don't. I'm finally over you.
- Really?

1048
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:43,020
Yeah. Heh-heh. I mean, you know,
I still really do like you, you know?

1049
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,815
I think you're very...

1050
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,567
What?

1051
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,319
Entertaining.

1052
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,909
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

1053
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:00,871
Janet, you rock my world.

1054
01:31:55,969 --> 01:32:00,764
# I'm walking down
the avenue

1055
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,766
# Ho-hoo-ho

1056
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:08,564
# And I'm looking at
the garbage cans

1057
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:12,067
# Hoo-hoo-hoo
Ho-ho-ho

1058
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:18,240
# I'm laughing at
the people I see

1059
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,842
Something like that.
I'm playing with the lyrics.

1060
01:32:22,047 --> 01:32:25,501
It's not set in stone.
Anyway, I'm working on it.

1061
01:32:25,536 --> 01:32:28,876
But give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

1062
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,545
...but give me a call, huh?

1063
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:38,761
Talk to me, talk to me.
Forty résumés, bring me back something.

1064
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:40,888
Here we go.

1065
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:05,329
Hi.

1066
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,415
I was just nowhere
near your neighborhood.

1067
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:17,091
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

1068
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:22,179
What took you so long?

1069
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,141
I was stuck in traffic.

1070
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:22,698
Well, that's the way it happens around here.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

1071
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:25,117
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

1072
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:27,911
- Coming down. Look out.
- No problem.

1073
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:35,169
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

1074
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:38,839
I don't know, for a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

1075
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:43,969
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

1076
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:48,265
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

1077
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:52,227
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

1078
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:04,239
- Hey.
- Hey. Going out?

1079
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,868
- Yep. You?
- Yeah.

1080
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:13,957
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

1081
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,502
Thanks.

1082
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,967
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

1083
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,907
Does everybody go through this?

1084
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,576
No, I think just us.

1085
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:52,121
I'm going to be celibate forever.

1086
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,623
I could spend my life
with that person.

1087
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,251
She's a girl in a car.
All you see is her head.

1088
01:35:57,419 --> 01:35:58,669
I know my type.

1089
01:35:58,837 --> 01:36:02,172
- Met someone new today.
- She's more my type than yours.

1090
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:06,343
- You always say they're your type.
- You should try living alone.

1091
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:09,972
- I can't sleep when I'm alone.
- It took her two dates.

1092
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,808
I just thought I'd call, from hell.

1093
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:17,187
- You said that I said...
- I don't play games.

1094
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:22,109
I can't believe I
feel this way!

1095
01:36:22,584 --> 01:36:28,311
