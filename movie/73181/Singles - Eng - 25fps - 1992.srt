1
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:10,134
I was living in this duplex.
For the first time, I was alone.

2
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:16,695
No dorm, no roommates,
my own place. I was so happy.

3
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,737
I had my own parking space.

4
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,498
Where I come from,
they don't keep them in cages.

5
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:46,133
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.

6
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,700
-Hello.
-Need some help?

7
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:07,295
No, l...
Well, yeah, thanks.

8
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,254
I'm from Spain.

9
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:21,891
-Really? Which part?
-Galicia.

10
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,532
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
I like Seattle.

11
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:29,774
"U-Dub."
That's what people call it here.

12
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:33,616
Finally, a local tells me
some secrets.

13
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,456
You don't have to stay.
This is gonna take some time.

14
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,771
Where else do I have to go?

15
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:45,935
In one week, I have to go back
to Spain. My visa runs out.

16
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,217
U-Dub.

17
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,129
This is Linda Powell from
the Seattle Environmental Council.

18
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:24,735
Okay, great. Thank you. Bye-bye.

19
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,940
Yes, that's right,
there's another spill in Bellingham.

20
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,854
We gotta get somebody out there...

21
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,570
Ruth, how long have I been saying
there are no guys?

22
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,060
Forever.

23
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,850
I met one. I met one
when I was least expecting it.

24
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,454
You held out on me.

25
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,135
He's an engineering student
from Spain.

26
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:49,010
His visa runs out in two days. He's...

27
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,017
He's like a comet. What do I do?

28
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,300
I wish you could stay.

29
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,420
If I overstay my visa,
I can't come back for five years.

30
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,780
-Were you ever gonna come back?
-Well, now I have a reason.

31
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:09,859
I want you to have this.

32
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,294
I wish I was better able to tell you
what I am thinking.

33
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:20,137
But this is a symbol of our future.

34
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:27,656
I want to return in two months
and see you again.

35
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:37,012
I don't really have much
to give you, but...

36
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,499
It's important to me.

37
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,733
Use this when you get back.

38
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,817
You'll always have a parking space.

39
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,250
Hello.

40
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:11,460
Don't wake up. I'm getting
on the plane. I wanted to say bye.

41
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:18,015
-I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
-Goodbye, honey. I miss you already.

42
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:23,890
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he left?

43
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:29,931
It's amazing. We can't hide things
in language. We speak in basics.

44
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,656
"Basics"?

45
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:37,134
If I married him, he could live here.
I'd always have someone to go out with.

46
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,572
You're talking
about marrying this guy?

47
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,899
I'm tired of all the games.

48
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:50,654
If you were married,
would we still go out dancing?

49
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:54,413
-We will always go out dancing.
-What?!

50
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,170
We will always go out dancing!

51
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:56,819
This is the Genie. Can't go wrong
with this garage-door opener.

52
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:01,657
Here's the Liftrex and the Liftrex
Super. Might be more than you need.

53
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,893
And, of course,
the Linear pocket pager, beeper...

54
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,497
...garage-door opener combo.

55
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:13,380
Give me the best one you have.
I'll never lose it again.

56
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:29,370
I recently broke up with Jennifer,
my last girlfriend.

57
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,692
I did it in a crowded restaurant.

58
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:37,139
She just stared at me with that look:
"How can you pass me up?"

59
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:40,976
I told her we weren't right,
all the stuff we both knew.

60
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:45,498
I realized I was wrong, tried to get
back with her. She won't see me.

61
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:48,175
Now she's with Tony.

62
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:54,095
Tony knows my friend Bailey, who's
friends with Tony's other girl, Rita.

63
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:57,492
Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.

64
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:01,290
So do I tell Jennifer I know
Tony's going out with Rita...

65
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,692
...or do I tell Rita I know
about Tony and Jennifer?

66
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,251
Tony will tell Jennifer I was
dating Rita when I was with her.

67
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,857
How does stuff get so complicated?
I don't know.

68
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:17,774
Sometimes I wish it was as simple as
this postcard somebody sent me once.

69
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,611
Isn't that great?

70
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,931
I don't know. I think...

71
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,376
Cliff! I'm talking here, man.

72
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,372
I'm back to the beginning.

73
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,578
My dad left home when I was 8.
He said to me:

74
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:44,177
"Have fun. Stay single."

75
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,539
I was 8.

76
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,335
My mom's a teacher. She took me
to a doctor to learn about sex.

77
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,616
He was from Boston.

78
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:57,855
The father and the mother
have finally learned to come together.

79
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:01,809
The father inserts his penis...

80
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:05,815
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?

81
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:13,176
The father inserts the penis
into the mother's vagina.

82
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:18,893
This is called intercourse,
and what comes out is called sperm.

83
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:24,016
And then, the man keeps moving until
something squirts out of his penis.

84
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,979
-What?
-Yeah, what comes out?

85
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:30,497
-Spam!
-Oh, man!

86
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:37,176
So maybe it was never simple.
I'll tell you this...

87
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:42,210
...for the next three years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.

88
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:46,135
Work is the only thing
I have complete control over.

89
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:48,533
Work.

90
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,493
I gotta go.

91
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:21,374
I'm 23. Remember how old 23
seemed when you were little?

92
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:26,012
I thought people would be traveling
in air locks and I'd have five kids.

93
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,900
Here I am, 23.

94
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,770
Things are...
They're basically the same.

95
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:36,411
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.

96
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:41,530
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.

97
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:46,536
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.

98
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:05,697
His band put out an independent album
last month. He's a good artist too.

99
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,093
He's like a Renaissance man.

100
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,775
I'm so glad he moved into my building.

101
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,818
Janet. What's the ordeal?

102
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:46,936
Your machine wasn't on, and I was
supposed to see you Saturday but...

103
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:50,650
So I just thought I'd come by
and say, hi.

104
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,216
-Hi.
-Hey.

105
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:57,420
-So how about this weekend?
-This weekend we're really busy.

106
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,776
-We got that show, right?
-Yeah, that show.

107
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,614
-We got these guys coming from L.A.
-Great.

108
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,090
-It's gonna be rocking.
-Bye, Cliff.

109
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,650
-So come over after.
-Deal.

110
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:13,814
Look, Janet, you know
I see other people still, right?

111
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,854
You do know that, don't you?

112
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,497
You don't fool me.

113
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,698
Janet, I could not
be fooling you less.

114
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,139
Cliff, you gotta move your truck, man.

115
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,174
I know what you're thinking.
We connected.

116
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:34,653
And when you make the connection,
chemistry takes care of itself.

117
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:39,451
So sit back and enjoy it because
you know when it's real. This is real.

118
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:42,658
We just don't even have to discuss it.

119
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:46,532
Janet, you're spazzing off on me.

120
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:53,216
Hey, Cliff, while we're young.

121
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:08,100
So I'll see you Saturday, and then
I'll help you with your speakers.

122
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,334
What can I say, man?
She's crazy about me.

123
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,091
Check it out, my new Gortec watch.

124
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,658
I can store 20 numbers.
Tonight, I'll fill it.

125
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,972
All or nothing.
Tonight, I'll be the super me.

126
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:32,778
What if the super you meets the super
her, and the super her rejects you?

127
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,330
-Then it's no problem.
-Why?

128
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,937
Because it was never you.
It was just an act.

129
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:44,171
-I live my life like a French movie.
-What?

130
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:48,292
Webster and 24th, it should be here.

131
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,578
Let's ask this clown
where the club is.

132
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,580
Hey, man...

133
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,891
...where's De Soto?

134
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:03,611
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.

135
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:07,490
Well, give me a ride,
and I'll show you.

136
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:11,015
Where's De Soto? Our car broke down.

137
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,059
I'll tell you about love.
Love disappears, baby.

138
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,295
When I've been broke,
babe has been off like a prom dress.

139
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:24,816
Maybe it's the girls you choose.

140
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,620
Maybe I've been hurt,
or I've been dogged!

141
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:31,535
-Know where this place is?
-Do I look like a Thomas Guide?

142
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,896
-You really shouldn't speak.
-Yes.

143
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:36,291
-Where do you work?
-I'm a maître d' .

144
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:39,658
-Department of Transportation.
-Solving the gridlock.

145
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:42,016
I build airplanes.

146
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:13,380
-Hey.
-Hello.

147
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,900
My friend and I have this argument,
and here it is.

148
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,621
He says when you're
at a place like this...

149
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,898
...you can't just be yourself,
you need an act.

150
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,575
So anyway, I saw you standing there...

151
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,173
...so I thought,
A: I could just leave you alone.

152
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:41,337
B: I could come up with an act,
or C: I could just be myself.

153
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,778
I chose C.

154
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,330
What do you think?

155
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:50,619
I think that
A: You have an act...

156
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:55,491
...and that
B: Not having an act is your act.

157
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,819
Thank you.

158
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:10,740
Cliff, any comments on the Seattle
sound and Citizen Dick's place in it?

159
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:14,530
I don't like to reduce us just
to being part of Seattle.

160
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,976
I think of us expanding more.

161
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,814
We're huge in Europe right now.

162
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,815
We've got records...
A big record just broke in Belgium.

163
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:33,133
A song like "Touch Me, I'm Dick"
is about what?

164
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:37,260
I think "Touch Me, I'm Dick, "
in essence, speaks for itself.

165
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:41,892
I think, you know, that's basically
what the song is about.

166
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:43,653
It's about, you know...

167
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,336
A lot of people might think
it's actually about...

168
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,140
...my name is Dick,
and you can touch me...

169
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:53,737
...but I think, you know,
it can be seen either way.

170
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,056
-Hey, excuse me! Hello.
-Hi.

171
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,735
-Want to meet up later?
-Where you going?

172
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,893
-Anywhere you're going.
-Anywhere you're going.

173
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,892
-We're going home.
-Going home.

174
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,053
-Do you have a...?
-See you.

175
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,136
"Anywhere you're going."

176
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,054
Always get their numbers.
I got 20 numbers.

177
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:16,530
Twenty numbers.

178
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:20,933
Bailey, you got 20 numbers
of 20 girls that you will never call...

179
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:23,979
...never go out with,
never see in the daylight.

180
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:29,056
Twenty numbers that exist only to make
you feel like you can get 20 numbers.

181
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,416
-Watch the volume.
-Sorry. Tinnitus.

182
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:35,460
-Club disease.
-You kids are all going to be deaf.

183
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,770
Bailey.

184
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,379
This is my night.

185
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,652
-What?
-Look.

186
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,570
Linda, don't look over.

187
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,818
Cliff, I need another double latte,
no cream, skim milk, decaf.

188
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:37,014
I'm going to use that video date
you got me last Christmas.

189
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,695
-It was a joke.
-I know. I know.

190
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,934
You think it's something desperate
people do. You are wrong!

191
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:48,333
Expect the Best is the best
video-dating in the country. Hi!

192
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,140
Debbie Hunt.
Call me before I go to Cabo.

193
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:54,338
-Your medication, Miss Hunt.
-Thank you.

194
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:58,736
You make the greatest coffee.
Doesn't he make...? You...

195
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:02,775
My roommate has no domestic...
Guys just don't know...

196
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:09,211
-Did you get the tunnel stuff?
-I'll call you back.

197
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:13,499
The l-90 construction is behind.
No green time from the exits.

198
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,812
The Times asked why
there's gridlock on the l-5.

199
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:20,053
It's God's way of saying,
"Listen to the radio."

200
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,735
Did you read my proposal?
What'd you think?

201
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,540
I liked it.
You have to move it past Stu.

202
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,850
-Stu?
-After lunch.

203
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:29,489
After lunch, okay. After lunch, Stu.

204
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:32,812
-Ted, what's up?
-Making music with my fingers.

205
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:36,178
And what a beautiful sound it is.

206
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:48,378
Linda Powell, Steve Dunne. Hey.

207
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,739
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
Yeah, that was me.

208
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,779
Listen, you want to get
some dinner or...?

209
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,092
Busy. How about some lunch?
Have a lunch.

210
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,740
Coffee?

211
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:04,054
Water? How about some water?

212
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:08,658
I'll meet you where you're having
lunch, and we'll have some water.

213
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:12,740
I think that this whole decade
will be about cleaning up.

214
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:16,940
Our project spent last year studying
the Alaskan Exxon spill.

215
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:23,051
And now... And now
with all the Exxon kickbacks, it's...

216
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:26,418
-God, yes. The worst.
-Yes.

217
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:31,211
I'm trying to put together a group
to go study the whole coast.

218
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:34,612
I'm having a little trouble
trying to get a boat.

219
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,658
I think it will work out.

220
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,693
-What?
-There's just no privacy anymore.

221
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,369
I thought he was literally
gonna swallow her.

222
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,697
-Me too.
-My God.

223
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,852
Do you know what time it is?

224
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,932
-Yeah, 3:30.
-Oh, I'm so late.

225
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:59,138
-I'm glad your lunch date didn't show.
-Me too.

226
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:02,816
-Did you really have a lunch date?
-No.

227
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,971
-Maybe...
-I'm getting over somebody.

228
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:09,656
-Nothing big.
-I think it's a bad time to get...

229
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,493
-Okay.
-Okay.

230
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:15,531
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.

231
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:19,011
Okay. Thanks.

232
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,340
Thanks.

233
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,258
I really like your take
on the supertrain.

234
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:49,094
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me...

235
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,573
She opened my car-door button.
Unmistakable sign.

236
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,857
I like this girl.

237
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,450
Gotta handle this one really well.

238
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:02,614
The thing I like about you the best
is that you listen to me.

239
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:07,571
-You're a realist-slash-dreamer.
-Thanks.

240
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,900
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.

241
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:19,455
That some jerk could trash the Mona
Lisa or an ocean or someone's life.

242
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:24,019
So who are your neighbors?

243
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:28,531
That's Bailey, right there.
He's a maître d' .

244
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,261
He keeps us all on free meals.

245
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:35,409
And on the corner there,
that's Debbie Hunt.

246
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:40,131
She actually consumes men
instead of food.

247
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:46,930
And that is Cliff.
He delivers flowers, has four jobs...

248
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:50,059
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.

249
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,416
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.

250
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,335
She works there too. She's
saving for architecture school.

251
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,696
Cliff and Janet.

252
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,334
That's it.

253
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:08,257
You sound like me talking
about my family.

254
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:12,571
Wanna go upstairs
while your stuff is still drying?

255
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,580
That's a good picture of you.

256
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:35,771
Let me ask you a question.
You think about traffic?

257
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:41,419
Because I do, constantly. Traffic
is caused by the single car driver.

258
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,096
900,000 single people
get in their cars every morning.

259
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:48,173
They drive and wonder why
there's gridlock.

260
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:52,254
This is what I've been working on.
If you had a supertrain...

261
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:57,700
...you give people a reason to get out
of their cars. Coffee, great music...

262
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:00,580
...they will park and ride.
I know they will.

263
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:03,301
But I still love my car, though.

264
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,531
Well... Oh.

265
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:10,011
The Sonics.
They've got a good team this year.

266
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:12,695
Good thing they traded
Xavier McDaniel.

267
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:17,139
-Is he a boxer or a basketball player?
-You dare to rip the X-Man.

268
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:23,139
"Kiss at the Hotel de Ville."
You have this too. I have this.

269
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:27,340
And albums.
Oh, I miss albums.

270
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:33,293
-I was a deejay in college.
-Really?

271
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:36,294
That's why I still have records.

272
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:52,900
So any boyfriends?

273
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:56,337
You don't want to know.
I've had bad luck.

274
00:26:56,861 --> 00:27:02,333
But there was this one guy, Rich.
All my girlfriends loved him.

275
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:06,292
That stuff I told you
about the money I inherited?

276
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:10,340
I made that up. Plus, I got
back together with Lynn last night.

277
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,538
So you probably want to go ahead
and freak out.

278
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:20,972
Oh, man. That was
like a professional hit.

279
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,497
I didn't wanna get close
to anybody for a long time.

280
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:25,696
And then l...

281
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:28,250
-I'm talking too much.
-No, go ahead.

282
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:32,096
Well, I thought for sure I would
meet someone in college.

283
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:37,096
A perfect combination of Mel Gibson
and Holden Caulfield...

284
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:41,732
...and the sexual revolution
would just sweep us both away.

285
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,176
I was a semester too late.

286
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:06,132
Hi.

287
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,974
Condoms. They're free.

288
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:32,370
You know, it's okay
to loathe these people.

289
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,338
Really?

290
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:39,140
There is so much life in you.

291
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:44,136
And so much emotional larceny
in these others.

292
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,613
-I'm Andy.
-I'm Linda.

293
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:51,698
Emotional larceny?

294
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:56,776
We talked about how passion didn't
matter as much as comfort, stability.

295
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:58,897
-That's bullshit.
-No kidding.

296
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,256
-Sorry.
-It's cool.

297
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:07,499
We lived together for two years.
We're still friends, but...

298
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,253
I did the same thing.

299
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:13,300
One day, one of you goes
for groceries and never comes back.

300
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,498
Everyone I know wants
everything to be easy.

301
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:20,894
-Why did I have to meet you in a club?
-I don't know.

302
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:26,376
Oh, I love this song.

303
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,571
My clothes.

304
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:50,370
This is you?

305
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,658
This gas-guzzling monster?
The environmentalist?

306
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:56,893
-I inherited it.
-Not sure how I feel about that.

307
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,652
So let's maybe do something
this weekend or...

308
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:05,574
-Okay. I'll call you.
-Okay. Don't forget.

309
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,969
I won't.

310
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,100
Good night.

311
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,019
Good night.

312
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,250
Good night.

313
00:30:35,341 --> 00:30:37,809
Listen, next time, why don't you...

314
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:41,415
...park underground?

315
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,813
I should go.

316
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:20,573
Grab whatever you can.
Keep whatever you want.

317
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:24,336
It's all yours free,
only at Shop for Less.

318
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:46,053
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

319
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:08,173
Burglar, burglar, burglar,
burglar, burglar.

320
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,810
Neighbors.

321
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:35,177
It's Andy. Just calling
to make sure you're okay.

322
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,980
I was thinking about the conversation.

323
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,894
Trust him, although
he's putting on moves.

324
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,894
Passive-aggressively speaking.
I'm a guy.

325
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:46,859
I don't like that I know them,
but I know.

326
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:50,855
I think that you can trust him,
but you certainly want to...

327
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:54,411
If he doesn't treat you right,
I'll kick his ass.

328
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:58,653
Starring Fred MacMurray.

329
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:05,698
Can you wait?
Just a little longer. Okay?

330
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:09,854
-Whenever, whenever.
-You're amazing.

331
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,775
I feel like I'm being pulled
inside you.

332
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:16,853
We're being too loud.

333
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:23,740
What are you thinking
right now?

334
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,456
I play good, hard-nosed basketball.

335
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:31,499
Things happen in the game.
Nothing you can do.

336
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:34,858
I don't go and say,
"I'm gonna beat this guy up."

337
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:38,730
-Anything else, X?
-Yes. Steve, don't come yet.

338
00:33:54,701 --> 00:34:00,253
God, I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?

339
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:07,334
What can I eat? I'm tired
of starving myself for this guy.

340
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:10,334
Salad. I'll have a salad.

341
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:17,660
If I call him, that's being desperate.

342
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:23,100
He's late or he forgot. I refuse to
call him to remind him he forgot.

343
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,776
If he shows up, I'll listen.
No way do I call him.

344
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,531
Of course, men do like to be called.

345
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:36,890
I'll call him in 10 minutes. That will
be one hour, and that is very late.

346
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,930
He is offiicially very late.

347
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:50,334
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.

348
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,337
Two out of three.

349
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:02,495
Wait. Did no basket mean call him
or don't call him?

350
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,291
Busy. That's a sign.
That's fate saying don't call.

351
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:14,932
Forget it. I am not desperate. I have
many people to spend time with.

352
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:19,776
-Quit getting involved with neighbors.
-That broke us up?

353
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,171
-We're better as friends.
-Absolutely.

354
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:26,254
The thing about Cliff is,
he has all this fierce integrity.

355
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:28,651
-I know.
-Except when it comes to women.

356
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:31,699
He likes these club-type women...

357
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:34,739
...these huge, hourglass,
Amazon women.

358
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:40,017
It's great you're together,
but you've got to protect yourself.

359
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,853
So I'm not an Amazon woman?

360
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:48,220
You're from the high plains, Janet.

361
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:56,056
I'm so glad I live here.

362
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:18,976
-Are my breasts too small for you?
-No.

363
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:22,337
God.

364
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:34,020
Because, I mean, I look around,
and all I see are these...

365
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:39,209
...posters and billboards
and magazines and TV shows...

366
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:42,134
...all with these women
with huge breasts.

367
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,338
I guess I just...
I guess I just wanted to ask.

368
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:48,937
Is that what men really want?
Is that what you want?

369
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,250
You know?

370
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:55,416
Don't lie because when you do, your
eye twitches, and I know it anyway.

371
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:02,901
Okay, ask me.

372
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:07,339
Are my breasts too small for you?

373
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:15,890
Sometimes.

374
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,776
Have you had implants before?

375
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,736
What do you think?

376
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,099
No.

377
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:47,450
Yes. Well, you take a couple of days
and make up your mind.

378
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:50,897
We skew the size specifically
to what you want...

379
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,529
...by graph. Right.

380
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:55,771
Well, what's painful?

381
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,373
It can be mildly painful, and certainly
safety is on everybody's mind...

382
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,532
...mine in particular.

383
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:08,174
Right. Okay, you take a couple
of days and think about it.

384
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:11,373
All right. Bye-bye.

385
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:14,381
-Hi.
-Hi.

386
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:18,700
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a couple of days.

387
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:23,696
How about that?

388
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:37,178
Maybe for your frame,
something a little less hourglass.

389
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:42,576
If you're going to have the operation,
you know, have the operation.

390
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:50,573
-Whoa. Do you jog?
-A little.

391
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:54,496
See, maybe, here.

392
00:38:56,061 --> 00:39:00,179
-Split the difference?
-Split the difference.

393
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:27,100
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing.

394
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:30,412
I'm tired of waiting for you
to call me.

395
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:36,376
I'm on the bed right now, wearing
something really outrageous.

396
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,971
I've got no underwear on.

397
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:44,538
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, Cliff.

398
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:49,777
I think you've got the wrong number,
lady, but I'll be right over.

399
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,779
-This guy plays no games.
-That's great.

400
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,175
Yeah.

401
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:05,612
-I've got to play this one perfectly.
-Go with it.

402
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,137
-What do your instincts say?
-Not to listen to you guys.

403
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:12,418
-There you go.
-Don't tug at her bra strap.

404
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:17,177
She wants mystery, drama, excitement.
I know women.

405
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,374
I don't want drama or excitement.
I just want to trust him.

406
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:25,420
-Should I trust him?
-Yeah.

407
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:29,779
-Not all guys are like Luiz.
-You're right.

408
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:33,013
You're right. Steve is different.

409
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:37,419
Just follow your instincts.
Don't treat this like casual sex.

410
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:41,973
Casual sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's lethal. It's over.

411
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,252
What are you thinking?

412
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:54,660
If I had a conversation with God,
I would ask him to create this girl.

413
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:57,295
My chest hurts.

414
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:01,460
-You didn't, like, leave a note?
-No, I left my blue T-shirt.

415
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,619
-There are no mistakes.
-What?

416
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:08,257
What is that? What's that mean?
Give me the phone.

417
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:13,091
I'm going to call my
new semigirlfriend.

418
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:15,690
You're gonna scare her off.

419
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:18,699
She's beautiful.
Anyone would call her.

420
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,490
-Distinguish yourself by not calling.
-Yep.

421
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:27,013
-P.S., that's how you get her.
-No, Bailey, you don't understand.

422
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,774
Am I the only one that remembers
your last three girlfriends?

423
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:36,377
You're right.

424
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,331
I gotta let this one breathe.

425
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:47,418
Yes. You're concerned about dioxins.
Let me give you Greenpeace's number.

426
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:54,534
-So how'd it go?
-I got the boat.

427
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:57,813
-The trip to Alaska's set.
-Oh, great, Linda.

428
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:00,700
-That is great.
-Yeah.

429
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:07,970
-Oh, Steve on two.
-Four days he waits to call me.

430
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:10,775
So, what do I tell him?

431
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:14,769
-Tell him I went out for groceries.
-Okay.

432
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:17,571
She went out for groceries.

433
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:20,619
Bye-bye.

434
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:23,335
He's coming right over.

435
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,055
-What do you mean, nothing?
-Nothing is wrong.

436
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:29,059
Really. Thanks.

437
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:32,014
-We connected.
-This is a small office.

438
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,219
-Is this because I didn't call?
-Did you call?

439
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:38,771
I don't know why you're
being like this. I like you.

440
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:42,172
I'll call you, or you call me.

441
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:54,698
-I'm sorry if I blew it by not calling.
-You don't owe me anything.

442
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:58,251
-Is this about your ex who calls?
-Andy doesn't.

443
00:42:58,421 --> 00:42:59,740
-Ponytail, right?
-No.

444
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:04,179
-Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.
-He is not Mr. Sensitive Ponytail Man.

445
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:13,371
-You're scared of getting close to me.
-You don't know me.

446
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:16,579
-I think I do.
-No, you don't.

447
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,891
Look, let's not play games.

448
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:25,652
Games? If I was playing games,
I would have waited a week to call.

449
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:30,778
-What I mean is...
-I've gotta work, Steve.

450
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:34,769
-Linda? I left my blue T-shirt at...
-Bye, Steve.

451
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:49,215
Why? Why do you talk such a good game?

452
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:55,729
You talk about things that matter,
that get me excited, that get me hot.

453
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:03,251
But it's like you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?

454
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:07,977
Why can't I just be a buddy?

455
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:12,812
Glad I caught this one in time.
I can't leave myself open.

456
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:15,177
It's better to be the dumper.

457
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,379
Mom... Mom! Yeah.

458
00:44:18,581 --> 00:44:23,371
Listen, Mom, if he invited you
to Hawaii, yes, he wants something.

459
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:28,775
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for two years.

460
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:32,016
Listen. Listen, Mom!

461
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:36,618
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
Do you think you could hold it down?

462
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:41,616
Wait, Mom. Rinse your dishes before
you put them in the dishwasher.

463
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:43,413
I rinsed them, Debbie.

464
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:47,011
You have to rinse off
the food or it gets all over.

465
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:51,692
I found this big, little chunky thing
on my glass. No biggie.

466
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:56,776
So. Yeah, wish me luck on my video
for Expect the Best.

467
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:06,569
Hi.

468
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:10,256
-This is for Expect the Best, right?
-I brought clippings.

469
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,412
Possible looks for my video.

470
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:16,734
Here we have
the Edie Sedgwick. You know?

471
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:21,220
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.

472
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:27,378
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed millionairess.

473
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:33,737
And I love these earrings
that nobody loves but me.

474
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:36,173
Truth?

475
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,578
Truth.

476
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:46,731
I will create your new look.
I will have men dying at your feet.

477
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:50,657
Ten bucks extra,
and Brian will shoot your video.

478
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,173
Twenty.

479
00:45:57,461 --> 00:46:00,259
He doesn't even know me.

480
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,372
Debbie...

481
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:06,620
...he is only like the next
Martin Scor-ceese.

482
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:11,332
Okay. Okay, I'm in your hands.

483
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:23,459
I am Debbie Hunt.

484
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,531
If you want to see how I look,
rewind and freeze-frame.

485
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:31,531
But I am not about looks.

486
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,860
Hi.

487
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:42,690
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.

488
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:48,299
My goals are serenity and knowledge
and men who can understand me.

489
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:51,295
Oh, no druggies, please.

490
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:55,693
I'm fairly intense, and
I'm an advertising exec...

491
00:46:55,861 --> 00:47:01,174
...at KRWE-TV. That's me.

492
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:06,978
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie country.

493
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,973
Yeah.

494
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:22,615
"Debbie country." It's funny.

495
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,501
-"Doghouse" as an encore?
-Six songs.

496
00:47:32,661 --> 00:47:35,573
-They want me.
-They are just our friends.

497
00:47:35,781 --> 00:47:39,660
-"Doghouse" as an encore.
-You can't start out with that.

498
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:42,289
Why make them clap
so we come out again?

499
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,975
-You don't get it.
-I agree with Cliff.

500
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:48,895
-Hey, a review of our record.
-Whoa, read it out loud.

501
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:51,695
"When the shirtless Cliff
starts to sing..."

502
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:56,810
Wait a minute, man. I don't
want to hear anything negative.

503
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:59,131
Go on.

504
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:23,218
Other than that, "He was ably backed
by Stone and Jeff...

505
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:27,374
...and drummer Eddie Vedder."
That's good. That's a good review.

506
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:32,257
-A compliment for us is one for you.
-No, man.

507
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,857
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.

508
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:39,411
We will not retreat.
This band is unstoppable.

509
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:42,971
This weekend, we rock Portland.

510
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,972
Yeah!

511
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:53,412
Okay, are you sure
you want to do this?

512
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:56,971
Yep. My mind is made up.

513
00:48:57,421 --> 00:48:59,616
Want to read a magazine?

514
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:02,978
Thanks for doing this with me, Steve.

515
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:05,900
I didn't want you to go alone.

516
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:20,457
Tell me, from a girl's point of view,
what do you want from a guy?

517
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:24,819
Well, when I first moved
out here from Tucson...

518
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,973
...I wanted a guy with...

519
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:32,499
...Iooks, security, caring.

520
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:35,255
Someone with their own place.

521
00:49:35,461 --> 00:49:39,977
Someone who said "bless you"
or "gesundheit" when I sneezed.

522
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:44,020
Someone who liked the same
things as me, but not exactly.

523
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:46,775
And someone who loves me.

524
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:51,211
-Tall order.
-Yeah, I scaled it down a little.

525
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,776
What is it now?

526
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:58,419
Someone who says "gesundheit, "
although I prefer "bless you."

527
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,253
It's nicer.

528
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:04,096
-Janet, sorry you had to wait.
-Dr. Jamison.

529
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,372
This is my friend, Steve.

530
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:09,658
-Doctor.
-Hi, Steve. Come on in.

531
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:12,853
Hey, last chance.

532
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,456
Here we go.

533
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:23,097
I'm going to say something
that I haven't said...

534
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:26,890
...in three years of being an HMO.

535
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:32,212
I will perform the operation,
but I don't think you need it.

536
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:34,258
I think you're perfect.

537
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:39,899
If your boyfriend doesn't appreciate
you the way you are, then ask:

538
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:44,976
"Are you his Miss Right,
or are you his Miss Maybe?"

539
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:47,572
Wow.

540
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:50,255
What's that mean, "wow"?

541
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:54,056
-Did my check bounce?
-No.

542
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,813
Janet...

543
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:59,978
...I really have
a feeling about you.

544
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:05,690
Thanks, but I love my boyfriend.

545
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,778
Okay.

546
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:13,252
-I still feel good about what I said.
-Oh, no, you should. It's good.

547
00:51:16,661 --> 00:51:19,653
-Can I say something to you?
-Sure.

548
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:23,217
Your face wants
a different part, your hair.

549
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:27,249
-My hair?
-Yeah.

550
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:31,620
Yeah, there you go.

551
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,891
Now you look vaguely rocking.

552
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:36,774
You are a happening guy, you know?

553
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,620
You're Dr. Jamison.

554
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:45,777
You've got nice eyes, and you've got
those great trustworthy eyebrows...

555
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:50,133
...and you're a surgeon, man.
Many, many babes are into that.

556
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,093
Yeah.

557
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:54,536
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:59,576
No, really. Listen, I have friends
who would love you.

559
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:02,176
See, I don't know how to have fun.

560
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:06,619
I'm 33 years old, and I don't
know how to have fun.

561
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:16,175
There. Now was that fun or what?

562
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:18,891
Yeah, that was fun.

563
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:36,571
-Doc.
-Yeah, I know, the operation.

564
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:44,976
I want Cliff to like me the way I am.

565
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,573
Thanks.

566
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:57,657
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.

567
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:03,020
High in the sky, the only
male bees, the drones...

568
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:06,617
So Portland, maybe it wasn't our city.

569
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:10,137
Man, where are the anthems
of our youth?

570
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:13,694
What happened to music
that meant something?

571
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:17,376
The Who at the Kingdome
or Kiss at the Coliseum.

572
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:23,889
Where is the "Misty Mountain Hop"?
Where is the "Iron Man" of today?

573
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:28,370
-We're not going out tonight, are we?
-Look at this.

574
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:34,935
These bands are bottles of bleach.
It's beer and lifestyle music.

575
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:39,414
It's like the next world war's
gonna be sponsored by...

576
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:42,380
...I don't know, I mean, what?

577
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:45,617
We could just take a bath.

578
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:50,980
Just remember one thing,
we are loved in Belgium and in Italy.

579
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,491
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.

580
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:57,450
The alarm is sounded.

581
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:11,181
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm playing this weekend...

582
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:18,416
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

583
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:24,770
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.

584
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:36,054
I've always been able to do this.
Break up and never look back.

585
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:44,778
Being alone,
there's a certain dignity to it.

586
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:19,649
Hi!

587
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:24,576
Hi, did I overreact?

588
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:27,052
Do you know who this is?

589
00:55:56,181 --> 00:56:00,174
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.

590
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:06,660
But whenever things are at their best,
I start waiting for them to fall apart.

591
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:12,612
I can't fiigure out if I do it to myself
or if life does it for me.

592
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:18,379
-I'm a bit late this month, that's all.
-Well, how...? How late?

593
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:22,059
Late.

594
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:42,101
-Steve Dunne.
-Yeah.

595
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:44,576
Doug Hughley. Mr. Deegan's class.

596
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,859
-What is up? How you doing, man?
-Okay, man.

597
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,973
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?

598
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:56,333
I loved your radio show.
That was the best. Thanks, man.

599
00:56:56,541 --> 00:57:00,853
We're throwing down tonight
on Aloha Street. It's gonna be insane.

600
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:03,694
-Would you do some wheels of steel?
-Oh, no.

601
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:05,420
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

602
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:10,570
You're the only man I know who can mix
Elvis Costello and Public Enemy.

603
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:23,054
You're the best, man!
You are the king.

604
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,972
You gotta be there, man.
You must be there!

605
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:30,780
Of course, you may be busy.

606
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:36,977
Ten minutes and we pour
X into B. If it's blue...

607
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:40,776
-Then we have a big talk.
-Yeah.

608
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:50,013
-I have some time right now.
-Then let's talk right now.

609
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:53,856
-My body knows it's going to be blue.
-It's not gonna be blue.

610
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:56,177
-It won't be blue.
-You're right.

611
00:57:56,341 --> 00:58:00,459
I'm probably sterile.
It runs in my family.

612
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:07,781
-Do you know where my other shoes are?
-No, maybe they're by the door.

613
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:10,258
-That would be wild.
-What?

614
00:58:10,461 --> 00:58:12,850
Having a kid.

615
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:17,770
-lf you were pregnant.
-lf I were pregnant, but I'm not.

616
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,974
And I would not expect you
to deal with it anyway.

617
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:25,539
Well, I'd be with you.
We'd deal with it.

618
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:31,575
To friendship.

619
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:41,778
-That's bluish, right?
-It's fairly blue.

620
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:44,489
-Well...
-Put it against something blue.

621
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:47,574
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

622
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:51,979
Well, wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.

623
00:58:57,821 --> 00:59:01,211
-What are you gonna do today?
-Meet the deputy mayor.

624
00:59:01,381 --> 00:59:06,899
-Sets up the thing with the real mayor.
-I have stuff to do. Do, or call you...

625
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:08,415
-Okay.
-Bye.

626
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:10,970
-Bye.
-Bye.

627
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:15,894
-Finally...
-Interesting.

628
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:22,091
...if we get the single car driver on
the supertrain, we can change the city.

629
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:24,980
It's all in the proposal.

630
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:34,380
Well, flirts with brilliance.
Wish it were up to me.

631
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:38,176
Let me get you 15 minutes
with the mayor.

632
00:59:38,861 --> 00:59:40,089
Thank you.

633
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:46,210
Basically, that's kind of what
we're all about, give or take a little.

634
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:51,660
I'd kind of like to leave it up to you.
Figure out what you'd like to do.

635
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:56,651
I think that will be great. Yeah.
You've explained it really well.

636
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,014
All right, these
are the men who want me.

637
01:00:02,221 --> 01:00:06,578
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man.

638
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:11,013
I have a lot of tender feelings
waiting for the right woman.

639
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:15,254
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this.

640
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:20,376
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
My painting is displayed behind me.

641
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:25,615
I'm a very meticulous person
in appearance and also very precise.

642
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:28,779
If two people really
believe in each other...

643
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:32,570
...love can go around the world
and through their souls.

644
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:34,772
But love is very delicate.

645
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:39,133
In fact, if you're both not very
nurturing, that love can:

646
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:42,413
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.

647
01:00:42,661 --> 01:00:47,018
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.

648
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:50,179
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.

649
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:55,131
I'm looking for someone who feels
the same way I do about a bicycle.

650
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:58,856
Am I too intense?
I can be intensely laid-back too.

651
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:04,181
I am very, very, very lonely.

652
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:14,578
-Who?
-Definitely the bicycle guy.

653
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:16,613
The bicycle guy.

654
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:19,773
He's like your soul mate.

655
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:21,534
Guy with the bicycle.

656
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,975
Nice outfit.

657
01:01:42,341 --> 01:01:44,980
-Is he late?
-Yeah.

658
01:01:45,221 --> 01:01:49,373
-Yeah, but I expect the best.
-Yeah.

659
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:54,092
Why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is happening.

660
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:57,537
-There's another Sea Merchant?
-Yeah, the new one.

661
01:01:57,741 --> 01:01:59,299
Oh, no.

662
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:03,094
-On your right!
-On your right!

663
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:07,573
-On your right!
-On your right!

664
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:24,298
Was there a Jamie
looking for a Debbie Hunt?

665
01:02:24,501 --> 01:02:27,174
Yes, and he left you a message:

666
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:31,613
"I got your address from Expect
the Best. I'll be at your house."

667
01:02:31,821 --> 01:02:34,574
He was hot.

668
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:49,660
Desperation, it's the world's
worst cologne.

669
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,057
-Lot of salt.
-You are good at that.

670
01:02:54,221 --> 01:02:56,416
-This is the key to popcorn.
-Is it?

671
01:02:56,581 --> 01:02:59,414
-Swirl with the bowl.
-Good, put the bowl down.

672
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:02,095
-Let's make some more.
-You want more?

673
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,456
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

674
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:18,380
-More popcorn.
-Stop, stop, stop.

675
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,657
-What, what, what?
-Stop, stop, stop.

676
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,812
-Want more?
-How does this work?

677
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:26,220
-Do you want butter?
-Do I want butter?

678
01:03:26,381 --> 01:03:27,575
-Hi.
-Hi.

679
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:29,538
-Debbie.
-Jamie.

680
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:34,417
-Wow, you represent well in real life.
-Thanks a lot. So do you.

681
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,815
Thank you.

682
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:39,212
When I missed you,
I just buzzed down.

683
01:03:39,461 --> 01:03:42,373
Look who I ran into,
Pammy from U-Dub.

684
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:45,175
-Pamela. I'm Pamela.
-Oh, you're Pamela.

685
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:49,693
Pam-ela, did you see that package
out on the porch for you?

686
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:54,975
-No, Jamie and l, we're making popcorn.
-Yeah, popcorn with Kermit.

687
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:58,970
I would love to show you
this package on the porch.

688
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:02,378
-Just for a second.
-Okay. All right.

689
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:03,815
-Okay.
-See you.

690
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,209
Sure.

691
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:11,979
-We always said, separate lives, Pam.
-It's no biggie, all right?

692
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:15,338
-It's a major biggie!
-Look, I knew him first.

693
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:19,090
I guess that gives you the right
to bone him in my kitchen.

694
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:23,450
If I wanted that guy,
I wouldn't need a video date.

695
01:04:23,661 --> 01:04:26,812
You'd wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!

696
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:32,051
-I make popcorn with whomever I want.
-You've done it with half the city!

697
01:04:32,221 --> 01:04:35,019
At least I don't have to chase
the popcorn.

698
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:40,731
I don't think we should
take this vacation together.

699
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:44,780
Remember how you told me to
tell you when you're being plastic?

700
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:47,012
This is so unfair.

701
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:49,775
-How much do you want for him?
-$200.

702
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:52,571
-Outrageous.
-That's what I paid.

703
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:54,134
-Seventy-five.
-150.

704
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:56,252
80 and I'll do the dishes all month.

705
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:57,410
-Deal.
-Deal.

706
01:04:57,581 --> 01:04:58,616
-Fine.
-Fine.

707
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:07,631
-We need to talk.
-I think we do.

708
01:05:07,795 --> 01:05:09,706
There's something I need to say.

709
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:12,150
-Let's get married...
-You want out.

710
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:15,868
Everyone's together
for the wrong reasons...

711
01:05:16,035 --> 01:05:20,153
...or they bail out.
This is life telling us something.

712
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:21,748
-Oh, God.
-What?

713
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:24,594
Don't make me remember
this chilidog.

714
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:29,147
Remember it. Make that
a historic chilidog.

715
01:05:29,515 --> 01:05:32,473
Take your time. Think about it.

716
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:38,745
You don't even have to use words,
just take a bite if the answer is yes.

717
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:44,671
-I want to be logical.
-Okay.

718
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:47,395
Say we're married, we have the kid...

719
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:52,390
...will we be anything like we are now?
It's like the great unknown.

720
01:05:52,555 --> 01:05:56,833
I've got that coastal trip to Alaska,
and you've got your thing.

721
01:05:56,995 --> 01:06:02,023
I want to be logical. I think
I can love you and still be logical.

722
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:05,744
What? What is that look?

723
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:11,145
Someone who really cares about you
must scare you to death.

724
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,347
Forget logic.

725
01:06:16,635 --> 01:06:18,387
What's in your heart?

726
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:23,954
I want to do it.

727
01:06:24,555 --> 01:06:27,831
-This is life telling us something.
-So that's a yes?

728
01:06:27,995 --> 01:06:30,589
Yes.

729
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,665
-You're gonna feel good about this.
-Oh, really?

730
01:06:35,995 --> 01:06:42,230
Mom, I wanna get out!
Mom, can't we get out?

731
01:06:42,635 --> 01:06:45,991
-Did we make the right decision?
-I don't know.

732
01:06:46,155 --> 01:06:48,623
Please, Mom!

733
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:49,824
-Yes.
-Yes.

734
01:06:50,035 --> 01:06:51,024
-Yes.
-Yes.

735
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:55,390
Xavier McDaniel
made the All-Star team.

736
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,234
-Why does he pick fights with players?
-Like?

737
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,471
Like Charles Barkley.

738
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:03,229
-That's a Bobby Van.
-Who's Bobby Van?

739
01:07:03,635 --> 01:07:06,547
He was the host of Make Me Laugh.

740
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:13,311
I never got to finish
that chilidog, you know?

741
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:16,672
That light's on yellow
way too long.

742
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:28,345
You, okay?

743
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:31,353
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

744
01:07:31,595 --> 01:07:33,472
Are you all right?

745
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:36,752
Are you all right? Let's get out.

746
01:07:36,915 --> 01:07:38,553
Come on, let's get out.

747
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:42,346
James.

748
01:07:43,515 --> 01:07:45,028
James.

749
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:51,753
-Who's James?
-I don't know.

750
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,353
Honey?

751
01:07:54,675 --> 01:08:00,033
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a player.

752
01:08:00,595 --> 01:08:05,385
-This a conversation you had earlier?
-Yes.

753
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:06,988
It's a good sign.

754
01:08:07,275 --> 01:08:10,665
-What?
-Hey.

755
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:12,906
-Hey.
-Hi.

756
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:16,704
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospital.

757
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,951
I lost it, right? It's all over.

758
01:08:29,315 --> 01:08:34,867
If we can't make it through this,
if you do not know you're not alone...

759
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:39,074
-Linda?
-I lost the baby.

760
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:42,393
Will you look at me?

761
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,714
I was flunking high school,
overweight, had a dead-end job.

762
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:55,631
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright...

763
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:56,784
-Hey.
-Hi.

764
01:08:56,955 --> 01:09:01,745
-How are you doing today?
-I'm better. I'm better.

765
01:09:01,915 --> 01:09:06,033
I think I've read every
single magazine in the world.

766
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:10,824
-Did you go to work today?
-No. It's been two weeks.

767
01:09:10,995 --> 01:09:13,873
I think they're going to fire me.

768
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:21,114
-I need some time alone.
-Alone?

769
01:09:21,275 --> 01:09:23,266
Yeah.

770
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:28,266
I have a new emotion
every five seconds.

771
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:37,911
I think I should take
that research trip.

772
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:44,465
I should just be out somewhere
in the middle of the ocean, alone.

773
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:47,588
I know I'm right about this.

774
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:51,464
It's just a month. It's just work.

775
01:09:53,955 --> 01:09:55,468
See you in a month!

776
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:59,463
I'll miss you!

777
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:09,311
Hey, Janet. Come here.
I got a present for you.

778
01:10:10,075 --> 01:10:15,195
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes. Come on.

779
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:20,311
-Hey. This'll be great.
-Oh.

780
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:23,308
You're gonna love me for this.

781
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:30,984
I installed your new stereo.

782
01:10:31,155 --> 01:10:35,433
Oh. Great.

783
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:53,863
Yeah.

784
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:03,271
Yeah.

785
01:11:22,315 --> 01:11:27,150
-I'll replace the windows.
-Thanks.

786
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:54,555
Work. Work has never been better.

787
01:11:58,595 --> 01:12:00,904
I miss her.

788
01:12:04,995 --> 01:12:08,749
What are we going to say to each other
when she gets back?

789
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:25,632
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome back.

790
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:27,387
-You look great.
-You too.

791
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,785
How are you? How was it?

792
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:31,547
-It was really good.
-Yeah?

793
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:32,909
Yeah, really good.

794
01:12:33,075 --> 01:12:36,226
-You want to go home? Out someplace?
-Whatever.

795
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:41,947
-Let me think of the place...
-There's Costas, I guess, or whatever.

796
01:12:42,115 --> 01:12:46,745
-The 3-2-1? We could go... Or Costas...
-Whatever. I don't really care.

797
01:12:51,515 --> 01:12:57,590
Jesus. We both could sink
from all the pressure in the air.

798
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:59,154
I know.

799
01:12:59,315 --> 01:13:03,547
-I really got into my job again.
-Me too. I was working my ass off.

800
01:13:03,795 --> 01:13:07,947
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was real exciting.

801
01:13:08,195 --> 01:13:10,265
That's great.

802
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:16,188
We don't have to try and be
what we were.

803
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:20,354
Thanks. I've been thinking
the same thing.

804
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:26,990
Great.

805
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,345
Friends.

806
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:36,787
Let's be the first people in history
to say it and really mean it.

807
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:42,474
How do you always say
the perfect thing?

808
01:13:54,355 --> 01:14:00,749
That obnoxious mime?
Was right. Love disappears.

809
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,787
-Come on, man!
-Let's go!

810
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:55,434
We got people out here!

811
01:14:55,675 --> 01:14:59,190
-Hello.
-I gotta go piss, man! Let's go!

812
01:14:59,355 --> 01:15:05,430
Linda. It's me. I had to call you.

813
01:15:05,595 --> 01:15:09,031
It's about midnight. I was just
having many beers and...

814
01:15:09,195 --> 01:15:11,584
...I wanted to say...

815
01:15:12,515 --> 01:15:15,029
What I should have said at the dock.

816
01:15:15,195 --> 01:15:21,065
I fucking chickened out. I lied when
I acted casual, like Mr. Casual...

817
01:15:21,235 --> 01:15:23,749
...and I should have said it.

818
01:15:24,275 --> 01:15:30,669
You belong with me!

819
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:34,073
We belong together and...

820
01:15:34,315 --> 01:15:37,625
...and what really pissed me off
is that you thought...

821
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,787
...I proposed only because
you were pregnant.

822
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:42,912
I've got to go piss!

823
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:46,670
-I've got to go...
-Hey, this is not the bathroom!

824
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:51,625
And maybe if I'd said this at the dock,
it would make a difference because...

825
01:15:51,795 --> 01:15:56,710
I think we made a big mistake because
we had good times and bad times...

826
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,627
...but we had times.

827
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:02,265
And I would like to start over.

828
01:16:02,435 --> 01:16:05,074
I would like to be new to you.

829
01:16:05,235 --> 01:16:09,114
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New...

830
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:14,030
...so call me back if you want to,
but this is the last time I'll call.

831
01:16:17,715 --> 01:16:23,631
And if you really needed to know how
I really feel, that's it. I love you.

832
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:27,344
And... That's something
you should know, so...

833
01:16:34,955 --> 01:16:38,914
I won't bother you again,
so good night and goodbye and...

834
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:43,512
...I love you. Call me back. Goodbye.

835
01:17:01,835 --> 01:17:05,305
This thing just eats tapes.

836
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:21,629
We're talking about 900,000 to
a million people by the time it's done.

837
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:26,909
Provide an environment safer and better
than their cars. Why not, Mr. Mayor?

838
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:31,273
-So it's a train.
-A supertrain.

839
01:17:31,435 --> 01:17:34,472
I've been burned by this
train business before.

840
01:17:34,635 --> 01:17:38,230
-You people all seem to forget.
-We can change this city.

841
01:17:38,395 --> 01:17:40,590
People love their cars.

842
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:45,228
Yes. But...

843
01:17:45,395 --> 01:17:47,863
-But if you give them great...
-Coffee.

844
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:51,152
Coffee... And great music. If you...

845
01:17:51,395 --> 01:17:56,549
I'll put it to you like this, and then
I'll thank you for your time.

846
01:17:56,795 --> 01:17:58,387
My answer is...

847
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:01,711
...no.

848
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:43,588
Hi. May I help you?

849
01:18:43,915 --> 01:18:49,228
Ticket to Cabo San Lucas through Los
Angeles, first class, please. And...

850
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:55,631
Could you seat me next to a single guy?

851
01:18:58,635 --> 01:19:01,593
I think I'll put you in seat 3C.

852
01:19:02,155 --> 01:19:04,350
Thank you.

853
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:11,790
Tell me everything there is to know
about you.

854
01:19:12,355 --> 01:19:14,823
I've got a special feeling about you.

855
01:19:15,715 --> 01:19:19,264
Don't feel bad about her.
I'll tell you what happened.

856
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:23,428
Kid talks her ear off the whole flight.
Dad picks him up.

857
01:19:23,595 --> 01:19:26,905
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are:

858
01:19:27,235 --> 01:19:29,829
Look at those fantastic earrings.

859
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:36,708
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.

860
01:19:39,915 --> 01:19:41,394
Got back two weeks ago.

861
01:19:41,555 --> 01:19:44,991
He sends her the big basket every day.
Every third one...

862
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:49,194
...she sends back, just to be
mysterious. I don't know, games.

863
01:19:49,355 --> 01:19:51,391
He wants her to move to Mexico...

864
01:19:51,555 --> 01:19:55,867
...and if she gets a job at the TV
station down there, she's going.

865
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:05,627
Oh, thanks.

866
01:20:08,755 --> 01:20:14,830
Tomorrow, I gotta spell her name in
rose petals. Do you believe this job?

867
01:20:43,675 --> 01:20:46,633
It's so easy to fall back into
old patterns.

868
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:49,867
Back with Andy. One week
and we're already like...

869
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:55,667
...one of those old couples, who sit
around in Denny's and don't speak.

870
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:57,473
What am I doing?

871
01:20:57,635 --> 01:21:00,308
Why did I chicken out?

872
01:21:02,915 --> 01:21:04,268
Do you have the...?

873
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:16,185
No, this is good. Being with Andy
is like being alone. Together.

874
01:21:17,315 --> 01:21:20,307
At least I'm not out there dating.

875
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:24,991
-Love you.
-Love you too.

876
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:31,709
-What?
-Hi.

877
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:32,944
Hey.

878
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:44,506
Hey. I was worried about you.

879
01:22:45,435 --> 01:22:49,986
I'm fine. I am great! Been working.
I read half of Exodus.

880
01:22:50,235 --> 01:22:53,227
Steve, I think you're
going through a phase.

881
01:22:53,395 --> 01:22:56,307
Do you realize, Janet,
that in modern society...

882
01:22:56,475 --> 01:23:01,503
...there is almost no need
to leave the house?

883
01:23:01,675 --> 01:23:03,984
-At all.
-Steve, you're wigging.

884
01:23:05,275 --> 01:23:08,506
I'm not wigging.
What, you think I'm wigging?

885
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:17,074
This is hang time. I'm just...
I'm just regrouping.

886
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:20,671
I'm spending some time with myself,
getting stronger.

887
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:24,624
Thinking about... Regrouping.
I'm thinking about...

888
01:23:24,795 --> 01:23:30,427
...how I listened to my instincts, and
they were wrong. The opposite of right.

889
01:23:31,915 --> 01:23:35,191
Well, I just wanted to bring you
your mail.

890
01:23:37,075 --> 01:23:41,546
And maybe this isn't the right time
to share this with you, but...

891
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:44,275
...things do turn around, Steve.

892
01:23:44,435 --> 01:23:48,110
I mean, I don't even think
about Cliff anymore.

893
01:23:48,355 --> 01:23:50,915
I'm having the best time,
on my terms.

894
01:23:51,075 --> 01:23:54,033
You know what else?
I'm going back to school.

895
01:23:54,275 --> 01:23:55,913
-Really?
-Yeah.

896
01:23:56,315 --> 01:23:59,671
Got all my architecture classes.
My first project is...

897
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:03,145
...redesigning the fountain so we
can sit in it.

898
01:24:03,395 --> 01:24:06,273
-That's good news.
-It is.

899
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:14,584
People need people, Steve.
It's got nothing to do with sex.

900
01:24:15,035 --> 01:24:19,631
Maybe 40 percent. Sixty percent.
Forget it.

901
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,627
Forget it.

902
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:24,309
Tell you what.

903
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:27,035
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...

904
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:32,747
...something good and nice that I
want to share with you or something...

905
01:24:32,915 --> 01:24:35,668
I will knock four times, okay?

906
01:24:35,835 --> 01:24:40,545
It's gonna be our secret code.

907
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:43,354
-How?
-Okay? What?

908
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:44,584
-How?
-How what?

909
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:46,711
How will you knock?

910
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,706
Oh.

911
01:24:50,755 --> 01:24:54,191
Like that.

912
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,425
Okay.

913
01:24:57,955 --> 01:25:02,312
Take care of yourself, Steve. Please.

914
01:25:18,475 --> 01:25:21,990
In a parallel universe,
we're probably a great couple.

915
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,952
But in this one...

916
01:25:26,115 --> 01:25:27,343
Neighbors.

917
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,706
-Hi.
-Hi.

918
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,947
You get my message last night?
Because I called.

919
01:26:03,115 --> 01:26:04,104
I know.

920
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:10,189
You know, I didn't appreciate you,
even though I thought I did.

921
01:26:14,515 --> 01:26:20,033
I used to live out by the airport,
underneath the flight patterns.

922
01:26:20,195 --> 01:26:24,188
It was really noisy with the planes
going by all day.

923
01:26:24,355 --> 01:26:28,712
I used to have cookouts, and no one
would come because of the noise.

924
01:26:29,115 --> 01:26:32,949
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved...

925
01:26:33,115 --> 01:26:36,027
...I missed the noise.
I missed those planes.

926
01:26:39,155 --> 01:26:43,068
-Cliff, what are you talking about?
-I don't know.

927
01:26:44,795 --> 01:26:49,630
I miss you. The way
you used to look at me...

928
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:53,834
-Don't. I'm finally over you.
-Really?

929
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:59,707
Yeah. I mean, you know, I still really
do like you, you know?

930
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:02,788
I think you're very...

931
01:27:03,555 --> 01:27:05,034
What?

932
01:27:05,715 --> 01:27:06,704
Entertaining.

933
01:27:10,395 --> 01:27:13,034
That's me. I gotta go.
My break's over.

934
01:27:14,435 --> 01:27:16,824
Janet, you rock my world.

935
01:28:09,675 --> 01:28:14,669
I'm walking down the avenue

936
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:23,226
And I'm looking at the garbage cans

937
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:31,025
I'm laughing at the people I see

938
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:37,385
Something like that. I'm playing
with the lyrics. It's not set in stone.

939
01:28:37,555 --> 01:28:41,230
Give me a call. I don't know
what you're doing tonight...

940
01:28:41,395 --> 01:28:43,784
...but give me a call, huh?

941
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:50,714
Talk to me, talk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.

942
01:28:50,955 --> 01:28:53,105
Here we go.

943
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,185
Hi.

944
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:19,711
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.

945
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:27,987
I don't need to be your girlfriend.
I just want to know you again.

946
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:32,353
What took you so long?

947
01:29:34,475 --> 01:29:36,147
I was stuck in traffic.

948
01:30:26,315 --> 01:30:30,388
Well, that's the way it happens.
Steve's moving out tomorrow.

949
01:30:30,555 --> 01:30:32,705
They're finding a place,
and I'm happy for them.

950
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:36,629
-Coming down. Look out.
-No problem.

951
01:30:36,795 --> 01:30:42,347
I may live here forever. That's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.

952
01:30:42,515 --> 01:30:45,871
For a lot of people,
living alone is a nasty hang.

953
01:30:46,035 --> 01:30:50,790
Not for me.
My music is all the juice I'll need.

954
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:55,904
I'm a self-contained unit.
I'm a solo artist.

955
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:59,465
Well, I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.

956
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:10,232
-Hey.
-Hey. Going out?

957
01:31:10,395 --> 01:31:14,388
-Yep. You?
-Yeah.

958
01:31:14,555 --> 01:31:20,187
That's a very nice hat, and I don't mean
that in an Eddie Haskell kind of way.

959
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,664
Thanks.

960
01:31:26,475 --> 01:31:29,626
-Bless you.
-Thank you.

961
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:51,150
Does everybody go through this?

962
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:54,352
No, I think, just us.

963
01:31:54,515 --> 01:31:56,471
I'm going to be celibate forever.

964
01:31:56,635 --> 01:31:59,354
I could spend my life with that person.

965
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:02,427
-All you see is her head, Tommy.
-I know my type.

966
01:32:02,595 --> 01:32:06,031
-Met someone new today.
-She's more my type than yours.

967
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:10,234
-You always say they're your type.
-Tell me I'm not like Shelly.

968
01:32:10,395 --> 01:32:13,273
-She should try living alone...
-lt took two dates...

969
01:32:13,435 --> 01:32:15,995
Hi, it's me. I just thought I'd call...

970
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:21,149
-You said that I said...
-I don't play games.

971
01:32:22,555 --> 01:32:24,910
I can't believe I feel this way!
