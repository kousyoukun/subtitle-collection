1
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:40,205
? Hey, Mister Tambourine Man ?

2
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,242
? Play a song for me ?

3
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:47,279
- ? In the jingle-jangle morning... ?
- " B."

4
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:50,588
- ? I'll come following... ?
- " A."

5
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,720
Man:
You having fun, sweetheart?

6
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,855
Girl:
Yes.

7
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,492
Ahh.

8
00:00:57,534 --> 00:01:00,503
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

9
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:03,165
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

10
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:05,367
Yeah? Let me see.

11
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:07,876
- Wow. Another one?
- ( banging at door )

12
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:10,379
- Yes.
- Woman: Honey?

13
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,244
That's two today.

14
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,147
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:15,617
- ( banging )
- Honey?

16
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:18,644
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

17
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,384
I thought you and I were the help.

18
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:23,688
( banging )

19
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,457
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

20
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:29,158
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

21
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,723
( laughs )

22
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:32,598
Mommy, look at-

23
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,193
( grunts )

24
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,505
No!

25
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,013
No! Ahh!

26
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:52,650
Oh! No no no!

27
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:55,249
You can't fight fate.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,228
( grunts )

29
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,762
( screaming )

30
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:10,034
Man: We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

31
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:14,442
Oh! Oh no!

32
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,872
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

33
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,713
Just shut the fuck up!

34
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,190
( whimpering )

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,192
No!

36
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:37,426
- It's cool.
- ( zips pants )

37
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,025
Kids like me.

38
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:42,162
No! Heather!

39
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,833
( garbled crying )

40
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,502
No no!

41
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,341
( sobbing )

42
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:59,651
( distant siren wails )

43
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,988
( horn honking )

44
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,753
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'

45
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:40,285
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

46
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,763
- Willis?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,891
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

48
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,958
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

49
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:47,594
when he committed the murder.

50
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,606
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

51
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,904
- It’s actually 96%.
- 96% now?

52
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,308
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

53
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,313
( chuckles )

54
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:59,941
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

55
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,450
You do know better.

56
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:03,952
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

57
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,819
Woman:
They filed a motion to dismiss,

58
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,619
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

59
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,125
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

60
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,753
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

61
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,764
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

62
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,028
- What else have we got?
- Nick: She's right.

63
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,592
- Mr. Rice?
- RICO's designed for this kind of thing.

64
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,265
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

65
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,570
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

66
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,805
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
I was running this room.

67
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,313
She's already done the leg-work.
I’ll oversee it.

68
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,315
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

69
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:34,577
( both laughing )

70
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:37,984
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

71
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,886
( mouthing )

72
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,161
Cantrell wants to see you.

73
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,526
All right, I’ll be right there.

74
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:51,158
No, Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

75
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,026
You still torturing Bringham?

76
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,334
Nick: Let's just say I’m less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

77
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,930
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

78
00:04:57,974 --> 00:04:59,271
I went to Fordham night school.

79
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:01,573
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

80
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,135
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

81
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,477
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

82
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,416
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, George?

83
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:11,443
The Shelton case-
where are we?

84
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,352
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

85
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,981
Ahh.

86
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,753
Bad news. What now?

87
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:19,660
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

88
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:22,688
- It’s an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

89
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:26,498
- However you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

90
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:29,334
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

91
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,465
You need to tell the husband.

92
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:33,975
Okay.
That's part of my job.

93
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,070
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

94
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,774
What?

95
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,448
Do you trust me?

96
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,483
Do you trust me, Clyde?

97
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,291
Yeah, of course.

98
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:57,299
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

99
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,893
With Darby's testimony,

100
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,767
Ames will go
to death row.

101
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,077
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

102
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,605
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

103
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,482
- In what degree?
- Third.

104
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,181
He serves, what?
Five years...

105
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:21,850
at best?

106
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,826
I don't understand.
I’m sorry.

107
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,025
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

108
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,932
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

109
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,129
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

110
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,400
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

111
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,929
We had the blood on his shirt-

112
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,805
It’s covered under
the same rule.

113
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:41,400
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

114
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:45,141
It’s not conclusive, Clyde.

115
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,715
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

116
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:53,881
I saw them do it.
I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

117
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:57,120
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

118
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,856
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

119
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,524
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

120
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:05,762
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

121
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,703
And then we'd have nothing.

122
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,332
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

123
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:13,365
and then both of them could
end up going free.

124
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,970
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

125
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,311
- You know that.
- It’s not what you know, Clyde.

126
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,782
It’s what you can
prove in court.

127
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,988
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

128
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,356
Please don't make a deal with this man.
He's a monster-

129
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,953
I’m sorry, the deal is done.
I’m sorry.

130
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,122
I made the deal.

131
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,997
What?
How could you do that?

132
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,901
This is just how
the justice system works.

133
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:46,000
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

134
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,840
but this is a victory for us.

135
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,946
Woman:
Your office has certified this agreement?

136
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:56,417
Yes, Your Honor.

137
00:07:56,452 --> 00:08:00,445
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

138
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,391
No, Your Honor.
No insights.

139
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:06,361
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

140
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:09,887
unimpeded by continuances.
A trial date is imminent.

141
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:12,093
( cell phone rings )

142
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,865
Yeah?

143
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,498
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

144
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,939
- We've been over this-
- I’m sorry.

145
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,306
- and over this, over this...

146
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:23,210
Yeah, I had some
exigent business I-

147
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,009
Next time it's mine.

148
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:31,885
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

149
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:33,889
Are you married?

150
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:39,194
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

151
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,968
I wish ill for no man,

152
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:50,837
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

153
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:54,206
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

154
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,483
Nick.

155
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:04,077
Cantrell: Once you make a decision,
live with it- move on.

156
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,554
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

157
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,752
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

158
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,157
Look, there's some of them
right now.

159
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,357
Isn’t this where you tell me
some type of old fable

160
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:17,332
or wives' tale-

161
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,334
All right, all right, I got one.

162
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:21,461
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant to
walk behind him

163
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:23,096
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

164
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,403
And this servant's only job

165
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,069
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

166
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,637
"You're only a man.
You're only a man. "

167
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,114
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

168
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,741
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

169
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:35,773
That's good.

170
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,342
Nick: I don't think you even know
what that story means.

171
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,581
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

172
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,317
Okay, I got this now.

173
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:44,224
( all clamoring )

174
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,161
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

175
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,891
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

176
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,058
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

177
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,762
He has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

178
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,397
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

179
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,930
to ensure that justice
will be served.

180
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,806
Woman:
Did you make any kind of-

181
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,640
Man: Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

182
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:09,381
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

183
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:12,512
It’s nice when
the system works, right?

184
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,750
Get away from me.

185
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,054
Officer:
Move. Move.

186
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,336
Let's go.

187
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,534
( sighs )

188
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,799
Nuh-uh, what happened?

189
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,033
What happened to what?

190
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,938
What's wrong?

191
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:12,539
You call my job boring. " C-"?

192
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:14,014
Yes.

193
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:18,515
Well...
okay now...

194
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,545
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

195
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,320
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

196
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,420
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

197
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:29,761
- Please?
- ( sighs )

198
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,994
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

199
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,899
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

200
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,871
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

201
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,340
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

202
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,275
Language.

203
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,245
- Your mother's a hardass, but-
- ( laughing )

204
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,770
I’m right here.

205
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:49,581
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

206
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:52,451
Woman: I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

207
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,149
Nick: Ahh!

208
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,852
Anybody seen my phone?

209
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:05,727
- Hey, have you seen my phone?
- It’s not strapped to your hand?

210
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,827
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

211
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,735
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

212
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,399
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

213
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,374
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,207
I can't, honey.
I’m running late.

215
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,735
Okay.

216
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,943
All right, here- Mmm.

217
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,780
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

218
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,445
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,580
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

220
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,420
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

221
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,392
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

222
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:34,453
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recital this afternoon?

223
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:39,458
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

224
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,333
Video's not the same, Nick.

225
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,464
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

226
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:47,305
See? It’s all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

227
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:49,174
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

228
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,146
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah. 'Cause he wants us to be safe.

229
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,115
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

230
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,482
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

231
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,420
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

232
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,090
You know she's
10 years old, right?

233
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,615
- You know that?
- I know that.

234
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,184
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

235
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,321
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

236
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:10,195
Don't do this, come on.

237
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,097
I can't come today.

238
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,568
You know you have not been
to one recital-

239
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,366
- How many has she had?
- Enough.

240
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:18,771
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

241
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:23,006
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

242
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,240
I love you.

243
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,805
All right?

244
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,010
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

245
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:30,279
- Love you too!
- Bye.

246
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,310
Love you.

247
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,413
Huh.

248
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:37,153
- So how's Chip?
- It’s Chester.

249
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:38,785
What happened to Chip?
I liked Chip.

250
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,625
There is no Chip.

251
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:43,063
And now there's no Chester.
He kept calling.

252
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,658
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept cancelling.

253
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,669
My caseload's crazy.

254
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,536
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

255
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:53,098
Yeah, I do. I...

256
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,769
What's it like?

257
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,142
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

258
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,477
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

259
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,278
Does it bother you?

260
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,978
Not anymore.

261
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:24,503
( heart monitor beeping )

262
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:42,721
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

263
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,421
What are you doing, Reynolds?
Why you here? Your DVD player broken?

264
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:50,558
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

265
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,692
You just getting a little press?

266
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:58,068
Breathe.

267
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,477
Ames:
What I did- it was wrong.

268
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,592
I should have never been there.

269
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:24,429
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

270
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,930
The wrong man's dying here today.

271
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:34,239
That's all.

272
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,249
( cello continues )

273
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,393
( monitor beeping )

274
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,278
( grunts )

275
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,479
Ahh! Fuck!

276
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,193
Ahhh!

277
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:03,788
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

278
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:06,096
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

279
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,366
Ahhh!

280
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,508
( consistent beeping )

281
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,818
Man: What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

282
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,946
We'll keep you informed.

283
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,287
You okay? Huh?

284
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,053
Yeah.

285
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,129
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

286
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:36,461
What are we calling this?

287
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:38,295
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

288
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,267
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law school.

289
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,770
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

290
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:45,035
It’s designed to be pain-free.

291
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,668
It’s three drugs administered
in a specific order.

292
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,940
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

293
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:51,411
that the machine was corrupted.

294
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,678
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

295
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:57,277
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

296
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,914
but I’m gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

297
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,083
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

298
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,423
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

299
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,725
Man: Right there.

300
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:09,526
"Can't fight fate. "

301
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,396
Cantrell:
What is it, Nick?

302
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,924
During the home invasion,
Ames's accomplice

303
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,199
said to one of the vics,
"You can't fight fate. "

304
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:19,469
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

305
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,543
I can't remember his name, though.

306
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:25,240
Detective: Have a look at this-
your guy?

307
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,748
- Nick: Clarence James Darby.
- Detective: He's a cutie.

308
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,808
- You got history with him?
- Nick: Put him away.

309
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,582
All right, three years.
That the going rate for murder these days?

310
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:34,282
There was extenuating
circumstances.

311
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,850
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

312
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,555
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

313
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,587
You expect him to come back
a model citizen?

314
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,191
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

315
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:46,826
I could keep them
locked up longer.

316
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,996
TV reporter: Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

317
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:51,096
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

318
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,665
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

319
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,370
his name, Rupert Ames.

320
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,002
Female reporter:
All we know at this point

321
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,377
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

322
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:02,349
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

323
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:05,979
- ( laughing )
- ( cell phone plays heavy metal )

324
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,585
Yeah?

325
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:12,992
- Disguised voice: Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

326
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,122
That's strike three for you:
coke on the table,

327
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:18,827
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

328
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,430
Who the fuck is this?

329
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,235
Voice: Look out your window,
south side.

330
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,436
- Is this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

331
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,878
- ( siren wailing )
- South side.

332
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:37,642
Motherfucker.

333
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:40,484
Shit. Out of the way!

334
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,924
( firing )

335
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,969
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

336
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:57,904
He's heading north!
Go go!

337
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,568
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

338
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,639
( sirens wailing )

339
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,910
( cell phone plays heavy metal )

340
00:20:08,951 --> 00:20:11,579
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

341
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,020
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

342
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:17,924
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

343
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,825
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

344
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:21,489
I want to keep you
out of prison.

345
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,431
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

346
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:27,526
- Why?
- There's a cop car there with a cop in it.

347
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,002
What the fuck?

348
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:31,835
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

349
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:33,535
so you'd better move.

350
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:54,753
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

351
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,957
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

352
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:58,159
- Okay!
- Do it.

353
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,532
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

354
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,400
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

355
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,429
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

356
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,942
Do it! Go go go!

357
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,644
( siren wailing )

358
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,519
Get the fuck out.

359
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,164
Let's go.

360
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:35,260
Get the fuck down there!

361
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:39,400
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

362
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:42,899
- I’ll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

363
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:45,778
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Oh oh oh.

364
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:48,408
You don't mind if
I take this, do you?

365
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,782
My guardian angel.

366
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:52,946
I am impressed.

367
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:57,015
You know why I’ll never see
my wife and little girl again?

368
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,092
'Cause you took 'em from me.

369
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,599
( gun squirts )

370
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:09,092
( groans )

371
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:13,306
You remember me?

372
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:17,075
Sure you do.

373
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:19,979
You came over to my house
once before.

374
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:21,846
You don't remember?

375
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:28,347
This tetrodotoxin...

376
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:32,054
should be nicely into
your system by now.

377
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:35,996
It’s isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

378
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:39,592
So it paralyzes you,

379
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,762
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

380
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,999
perfectly intact.

381
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,305
In other words, you can't move...

382
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:52,072
but you feel everything.

383
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:57,575
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

384
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:00,554
And you're about to
experience more of that

385
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,183
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

386
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,420
( Darby grunts )

387
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,363
( heart monitor beeping )

388
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:10,888
( Darby grunting )

389
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,527
These are tourniquets

390
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,733
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

391
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,140
Saline solution-

392
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,701
that should keep us going.

393
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:28,011
Clamps- nice and secure.

394
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:32,152
Comfortable?

395
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,781
You really are shaking.

396
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:37,223
Sure you're all right?

397
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:41,658
You'll love this-

398
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,857
adrenaline.

399
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:47,960
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

400
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,106
- ( straining )
- There you go.

401
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,234
How's that feel? Good?

402
00:23:56,745 --> 00:24:00,044
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

403
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,277
so bear with me.

404
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,080
( Darby gagging )

405
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:12,090
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

406
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:16,931
Scalpel...

407
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:19,195
for your eyelids,

408
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,896
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

409
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:26,365
You see,

410
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:30,242
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

411
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:33,611
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

412
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:39,878
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

413
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,380
Oh!

414
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:47,862
And look-
I made this especially for you.

415
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,626
( crank grinding )

416
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:54,362
You like it?
Yeah, I didn't want you to miss anything.

417
00:24:55,537 --> 00:25:00,201
Now you have the best
view in the house.

418
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:02,233
- You hear that?
- ( heart monitor beeping )

419
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:05,440
Your heart is beating so fast.

420
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,647
No, me too.

421
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,242
Okay.

422
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:17,316
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

423
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:22,727
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

424
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:26,291
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

425
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,667
See, I wasn't lying

426
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:33,470
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

427
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:38,502
That was the truth.

428
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,949
( groans )

429
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,682
( whirring )

430
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,054
( Darby grunting )

431
00:25:56,698 --> 00:26:00,225
- ( saw buzzing )
- ( muffled groaning )

432
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,240
- Thanks for the car.
- ( keys jangle )

433
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:40,335
Sarah: Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

434
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,003
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

435
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,909
Don't need to see 'em.

436
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:47,675
Okay.

437
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,146
- What's bothering you?
- It’s Darby.

438
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:59,354
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

439
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:01,624
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

440
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,756
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

441
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:06,232
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

442
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,599
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

443
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:13,165
I’m just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

444
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:16,835
- ( dripping )
- ( camera clicking )

445
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,249
Jesus Christ.

446
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,846
( man coughing )

447
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:33,393
- ( phone ringing )
- Rice.

448
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:36,454
Detective:
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

449
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:39,558
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

450
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,603
Sarah:
They found him in about 25 pieces:

451
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:47,301
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

452
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:49,333
- Nick: Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

453
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:52,437
- Cantrell: I see your wheels turning.
- Nick: Think motive- who has one?

454
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,142
Cantrell: The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

455
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:57,048
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

456
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,643
- What else?
- He's a tinkerer-

457
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,589
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents

458
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:04,182
that made him some money.

459
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,388
He liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

460
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:11,024
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

461
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,261
chemical plants,
rail yards.

462
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,792
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

463
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:17,964
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

464
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,551
( sirens wailing )

465
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,392
( indistinct police radio )

466
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,428
( helicopter hovering )

467
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,344
Freeze!

468
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,753
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

469
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:43,585
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

470
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:12,743
( officers chattering )

471
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:22,959
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

472
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:25,397
Detective:
Is this guy a lawyer?

473
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:26,798
No.

474
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,728
He's an engineer.

475
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:33,798
Sarah:
Nick, look at this.

476
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,014
Cantrell: We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confession.

477
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:15,948
He give you any trouble
on the way in?

478
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,451
No, nothing.

479
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:20,079
He wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

480
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,548
( ringing )

481
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,757
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

482
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,734
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

483
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:40,133
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

484
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:42,904
- Please?
- No, not you.

485
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,708
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

486
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,908
- Please?
- No, not now.

487
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,008
Okay.

488
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,453
Uh-huh, yes.

489
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:57,457
Yes, absolutely.

490
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,741
Mommy!

491
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:23,673
( door buzzing )

492
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,046
( door slams )

493
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:34,653
( static )

494
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:38,029
Don't worry, he's just disarming the guy,
letting him feel easy.

495
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:42,332
What I’m about to tell you
I don't want anybody else to hear.

496
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,271
As a prosecutor, I’m breaking
all the rules right now,

497
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:48,173
and I don't give a damn
because I’m a father.

498
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:50,234
I have a little girl.

499
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,078
And what you did... bravo.

500
00:32:55,883 --> 00:33:00,320
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

501
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:04,951
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

502
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,494
With that being said...

503
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,764
I have a job to do.

504
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,566
I’m gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

505
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:23,475
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

506
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:25,638
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

507
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:27,808
Yes, sir.

508
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:29,749
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

509
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:33,515
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

510
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,021
Yes.

511
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:38,389
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

512
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,488
I wanted him dead.

513
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,327
He killed my wife and child.

514
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:47,528
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

515
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,261
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

516
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:54,365
They both deserved to die.

517
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,072
So you arranged
both of those murders?

518
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,770
Yes, I planned it...

519
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:04,478
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

520
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,780
All right.

521
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:11,951
I guess we're done here.

522
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:14,560
Counselor?

523
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:20,095
You might want to cancel
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

524
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,899
Excuse me?

525
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,303
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

526
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:28,103
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

527
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,706
We're done here.
We have your confession.

528
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,113
Mmm. Oh, you do?

529
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:36,912
On tape.

530
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,920
See, in our profession,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

531
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,855
Oh, really?
I don't think so. Let's think back.

532
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,755
What did I say?

533
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,852
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

534
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:50,261
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

535
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,096
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

536
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,931
I think most people
would agree with that.

537
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,268
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

538
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:01,798
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

539
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:04,505
None of these are
an admission of guilt, Nick.

540
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:07,412
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

541
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:11,009
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

542
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:12,519
Didn't you tell me that once?

543
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:14,111
The only problem with your theory

544
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,350
is that Darby's property was
found on your property.

545
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,621
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

546
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,891
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

547
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,091
Isn’t Darby involved
in the drug trade?

548
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,000
That's an unsavory world.
I bet you a jury would agree.

549
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:31,163
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

550
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:33,070
You know, Clyde,

551
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:36,270
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

552
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,040
Let's stop fucking around.

553
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,140
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

554
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,777
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

555
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:47,151
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

556
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:51,491
Well, that's easy.

557
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:55,053
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

558
00:35:55,096 --> 00:35:57,360
So I've come to make mine.

559
00:35:57,398 --> 00:36:02,097
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

560
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:04,366
You just have to
give me something in return.

561
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:07,533
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

562
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,010
A bed.

563
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,078
- But a nice bed.
- ( Nick laughing )

564
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:17,550
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

565
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:19,280
- Very simple.
- ( cell phone ringing )

566
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,050
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

567
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:24,216
- It’s making me crazy.
- ( phone beeps off )

568
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:27,022
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

569
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,222
See, I don't deal
with prison conditions.

570
00:36:29,263 --> 00:36:31,754
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

571
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:34,666
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

572
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:38,302
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

573
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,706
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

574
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,300
- that's the one.
- I’ve seen the commercial.

575
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:44,868
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

576
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,971
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

577
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,845
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

578
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,316
- I’ll be able to focus
on anything

579
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:52,581
until I’ve had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

580
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,111
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

581
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:57,021
So that's the deal:

582
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:00,789
you get me my bed,
you get your confession.

583
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,592
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

584
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:06,031
How about...

585
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,898
fuck no.

586
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:14,966
( door buzzing )

587
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,013
Hey, what are you doing?

588
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:22,242
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

589
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,480
A mattress? He doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

590
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,750
Take your ego out of it, Nick.
Shelton's got a point: this case is shit.

591
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:31,349
We need a confession.
And a mattress for a murder confession?

592
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:33,860
- That's a pretty good deal.
- He's playing us, Jonas.

593
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:35,385
Well, then we will play him.

594
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,192
Nick?

595
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:39,961
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

596
00:37:40,001 --> 00:37:42,970
I need to finish up here and then
I will be home as soon as I can.

597
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:45,029
Listen to me:
the things on this video-

598
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:47,870
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

599
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:49,274
Please come home.

600
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,269
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

601
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,145
- Okay.
- ... and that I love her.

602
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:56,308
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

603
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,318
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

604
00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,513
It was covered with something.
I couldn't see.

605
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:03,648
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I’ll come home as fast as I can, okay?

606
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,750
Okay.

607
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:09,092
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

608
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,758
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

609
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,330
He recorded it?
We've got him.

610
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,827
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confession.

611
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:21,273
You still want to bargain
with this man?

612
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,573
The art of the possible, Warden.

613
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:25,306
Make the deal.

614
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,507
( inmates shouting )

615
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:30,813
Man:
Hey, come on, man! Give us one!

616
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,786
( all heckling )

617
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:46,756
Back problem, Warden-
the worst.

618
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:49,429
You got bigger problems than that.

619
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,234
It’s the have-nots in here, son.

620
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:55,800
I don't know that I want
to be the one " have. "

621
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:01,210
Turn around.

622
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,046
I don't think he likes me.

623
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:09,352
( keys rattling )

624
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,255
Nice bed.

625
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:15,221
Thank you.

626
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:17,662
It’s a single.

627
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:20,958
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

628
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,163
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

629
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:26,332
So I dug a little deeper and
I found something from his missing years:

630
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:29,866
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

631
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,743
- And his real estate?
- He bought nine properties

632
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,805
under his own name,
then he transferred them

633
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:36,282
to some corporation in Panama.

634
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:38,308
We can't get to the addresses.

635
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:39,979
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

636
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,579
So I’m gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

637
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:45,080
That's a waste of time. He wanted us
to find it and find him there.

638
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:47,390
It’s the industrial stuff
that's curious.

639
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:50,124
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

640
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:52,655
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

641
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,396
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

642
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,630
Got it.

643
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:11,583
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- Hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

644
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,486
- Night light?
- Isn’t she too old for a night light?

645
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,013
Yeah, I left a night light.

646
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,855
- Good.
- Look,

647
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:21,054
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

648
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:23,393
- Okay.
- It’s some sort of horror film-

649
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:25,126
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

650
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,031
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

651
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,558
Yeah. And you?

652
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:31,628
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

653
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,799
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

654
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:35,741
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

655
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,471
Nick is always okay.

656
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:43,005
Always- I’m extra good.

657
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:47,513
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

658
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:49,420
and his potential flight risk,

659
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:52,893
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

660
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:56,795
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your Honor.

661
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:03,493
Judge: Seeing as how you've waived
your right to counsel, Mr. Shelton,

662
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:05,835
do you have anything to say?

663
00:41:05,873 --> 00:41:07,864
Mr. Shelton?

664
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,575
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. -

665
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:14,979
Yes yes yes, Your Honor.

666
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,916
- Should I stand?
- Please.

667
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:29,319
Your Honor, I’m a law-abiding citizen.

668
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:31,354
I’m just a regular guy.

669
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:34,333
I am not a flight risk.

670
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:36,928
And this is my first alleged offense.

671
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:41,670
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

672
00:41:43,077 --> 00:41:45,409
Now in these circumstances,

673
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:48,142
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

674
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,878
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

675
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:54,945
then I find it highly prejudicial,
even constitutionally offensive,

676
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:57,514
to keep me detained without bail.

677
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,719
It’s a slippery slope,
Your Honor.

678
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,957
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

679
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:05,625
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

680
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:09,898
would be Day V. McDonough,
docket #041325.

681
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:16,701
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

682
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:21,177
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confession.

683
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:24,381
Has he given it, Mr. Rice?

684
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:25,885
No, Your Honor.

685
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,753
Well, then in my opinion,

686
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:31,690
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

687
00:42:31,725 --> 00:42:34,956
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

688
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:37,429
Your Honor,
I would caution you not to do that.

689
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:40,228
( laughing )
Thank you.

690
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,859
Excuse me?

691
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:44,700
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

692
00:42:44,738 --> 00:42:46,729
You see, this is what
I’m talking about.

693
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,800
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

694
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:53,370
This is why we're here
in the first place.

695
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:57,417
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

696
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,420
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

697
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,319
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

698
00:43:02,356 --> 00:43:05,223
Because apparently
I just killed two people,

699
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:08,717
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

700
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:11,253
How misguided are you?

701
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:14,756
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

702
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:18,169
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

703
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:20,673
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I’m warning you, Mr. Shelton!

704
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,733
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

705
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:25,244
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

706
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:27,713
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

707
00:43:27,748 --> 00:43:29,147
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

708
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:31,048
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

709
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:33,315
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

710
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:36,289
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

711
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:39,087
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

712
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:41,321
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

713
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:44,627
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

714
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:45,893
Bailiff.

715
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,764
Clyde:
Hey, see you later, Nick.

716
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:51,164
Nick:
Insanity?

717
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:55,274
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

718
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,245
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confession.

719
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:01,942
And I- I meant it.

720
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:04,348
- I saw a movie today.
- You did?

721
00:44:04,385 --> 00:44:07,149
My daughter saw the same movie.

722
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,179
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus evil?

723
00:44:10,224 --> 00:44:12,055
I don't have to.

724
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:15,755
Well, that's what this movie was about:
good conquering evil,

725
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:18,162
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

726
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,428
I didn't get that.

727
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:23,561
I’m gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

728
00:44:23,604 --> 00:44:27,301
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

729
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:29,172
Fair enough.

730
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,939
You did get me my bed.

731
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:34,504
A deal's a deal.

732
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:37,210
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

733
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:39,048
Yes, that was me.

734
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:41,919
( sighs )

735
00:44:41,955 --> 00:44:44,981
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

736
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:47,016
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

737
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:49,325
Not good enough, Clyde.
I need specifics.

738
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:55,233
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

739
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:56,736
his toes with tin snips,

740
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,364
his balls with a hacksaw,

741
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:02,705
and his penis with a box cutter.

742
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,506
How's that for specifics?

743
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:06,978
And Ames?

744
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:10,814
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

745
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:13,149
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

746
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:16,213
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

747
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,724
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

748
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:22,991
with something a little more...
deliberate.

749
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:26,595
Well, I’m tired of
hearing your bullshit.

750
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,567
I got everything I need.

751
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,935
What now?

752
00:45:30,971 --> 00:45:32,871
I go home;
you go to prison.

753
00:45:32,906 --> 00:45:35,534
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

754
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:37,874
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

755
00:45:37,911 --> 00:45:39,435
What if I had another
confession to make?

756
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,141
Call a priest.

757
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:43,172
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick,

758
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:46,448
so you would have to
give me something in return.

759
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:53,184
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

760
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:57,027
So for lunch, I would love
a 20 oz. porterhouse steak,

761
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:59,726
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

762
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,567
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

763
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:06,038
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

764
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:10,266
I’ll tell you what:
can I have my iPod as well?

765
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,473
I’d love a little bit
of music with my meal.

766
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:16,506
First rule of negotiating, Clyde:
you gotta have something to bargain with.

767
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,951
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

768
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:28,361
- Open it.
- ( door buzzes )

769
00:46:30,964 --> 00:46:33,057
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

770
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,931
Darby's attorney.

771
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:37,596
Tell me you located him.

772
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:41,199
I’ve got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

773
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:43,266
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

774
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,302
Clyde: Well, looks like I’ve got
something to bargain with after all, Nick.

775
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,746
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

776
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:53,776
I’ll tell you exactly where he is.

777
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:57,780
Just bring me my meal and
my music at 1:00 exactly.

778
00:46:57,825 --> 00:47:00,293
1:00 sharp.

779
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,591
1:00, Nick.

780
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:18,608
- That's good, right there.
- ( dog barking )

781
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:22,206
( indistinct police radio )

782
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:24,080
All right, up!

783
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:34,088
- It’s 12:55.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

784
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:36,118
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

785
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:39,189
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

786
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,565
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

787
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,797
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

788
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,702
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

789
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,969
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

790
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,908
Check it again.

791
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,510
Inmate:
Are you shitting me with this?!

792
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,018
( all screaming )

793
00:47:59,052 --> 00:48:00,644
This motherfucker!

794
00:48:03,023 --> 00:48:05,116
( shouting )

795
00:48:05,158 --> 00:48:07,820
Man, come on!
I’m fucking hungry!

796
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:15,935
Steamed asparagus,

797
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:18,836
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

798
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,402
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

799
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,703
Mmm!

800
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:32,915
Hmm.

801
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,012
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

802
00:48:37,424 --> 00:48:40,393
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

803
00:48:40,427 --> 00:48:43,624
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

804
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,396
- Hey, what time is it?
- It’s 1:00.

805
00:48:50,837 --> 00:48:52,566
Is that right, Nick?

806
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:56,269
- It’s 1:08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

807
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,778
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

808
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:00,541
when you can't even
be honest with me?

809
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:03,482
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

810
00:49:04,618 --> 00:49:06,643
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

811
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:08,120
Silverware.

812
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:10,385
You get a spork.

813
00:49:11,391 --> 00:49:13,416
Idiot.

814
00:49:15,896 --> 00:49:17,420
Thanks.

815
00:49:26,373 --> 00:49:28,341
Come on, Clyde.

816
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,775
Okay.

817
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:37,648
Here we go:

818
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:40,949
39N57'...

819
00:49:40,988 --> 00:49:42,751
04",

820
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:46,418
075W10'22".

821
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,257
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

822
00:49:48,295 --> 00:49:51,025
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

823
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:53,828
- Open the door!
- Inmate: Where's my lunch, motherfucker?

824
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:02,807
I’ll take a ground unit!

825
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:17,513
( jazz music playing )

826
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,954
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

827
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:26,693
I’m gonna get the fuck up,

828
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,792
I’m gonna cock back
my right hand,

829
00:50:28,835 --> 00:50:32,293
and I’m gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. How about that?

830
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,171
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

831
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:45,249
Here, enjoy.
Have some pasta.

832
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:47,480
It’s good.

833
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,318
What about some steak?
You want steak?

834
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:51,051
- Mmm.
- Here, have some steak.

835
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,286
Here's a big piece for you.

836
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:55,419
There you go.

837
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,564
Good, huh?

838
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:12,637
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

839
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:17,245
I did what I had to do.

840
00:51:22,422 --> 00:51:24,583
So you got a girl or something?

841
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:30,095
Mmm, it's a long story.

842
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:36,092
Pilot, how much longer?

843
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:39,196
- ETA: Two minutes.
- ( indistinct helicopter radio )

844
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:44,703
How about you?
You have a girl?

845
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:47,236
- Got a few girls back home.
- Oh, yeah?

846
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,111
- Yeah.
- ( laughs )

847
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:52,141
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

848
00:51:57,324 --> 00:52:01,351
( siren wailing )

849
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:08,198
This is- it's Reynolds's.

850
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:11,793
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

851
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:16,004
( funk music playing )

852
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,615
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

853
00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:29,849
- He's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

854
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:34,088
He's gone, Nick.
He's gone.

855
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:36,254
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

856
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:39,993
Detective: He's got IV lines
going to his-

857
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,228
He's got him cuffed!

858
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:45,830
Nick: Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

859
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:49,705
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

860
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:50,767
Shit.

861
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:54,473
Oh, God, I’m so happy.

862
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:57,210
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

863
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,242
Here, wanna take a shot at this?

864
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,482
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

865
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:04,922
- No.
- ( music grows louder )

866
00:53:09,462 --> 00:53:12,192
( heavy metal blares )

867
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,902
Inmate:
Oh, shit! Check this out!

868
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:29,848
( all shouting )

869
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:32,181
He's crazy!

870
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:33,709
Don't stop now, partner!

871
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:36,916
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

872
00:53:36,957 --> 00:53:41,257
- Take it off!
- ( siren wailing )

873
00:53:41,294 --> 00:53:43,922
( heavy metal continues )

874
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:49,766
( inmates shouting )

875
00:53:58,578 --> 00:54:02,105
( music continues )

876
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:04,378
- ( music stops )
- ( siren wails )

877
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:13,852
I need a shower, Warden.

878
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:15,657
Get him out of there!

879
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:21,158
Nick:
Dunnigan, what time do you have?

880
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,897
- 1:37.
- Took us roughly 15 minutes to get here.

881
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,929
Yeah?

882
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,602
Reynolds's air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15.

883
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:33,545
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

884
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,104
Fuck this guy, Nick.

885
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:39,050
He wants to play games,
we can play games too.

886
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:41,315
We need to take the gloves off.

887
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,254
No.

888
00:54:44,257 --> 00:54:47,226
( helicopter hovering )

889
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,388
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

890
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:54,423
The warden is furious.
He's moving him to solitary.

891
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:56,662
That's all I know right now.

892
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:14,548
( door closes, keys jangle )

893
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:21,119
( door slides closed, locks )

894
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,809
( footsteps approach )

895
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:45,214
( keys jangle )

896
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:54,760
We found Reynolds.

897
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:57,854
It was too late,
from what I hear.

898
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:01,993
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

899
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:04,833
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

900
00:56:04,871 --> 00:56:07,533
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

901
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:10,236
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

902
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,974
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

903
00:56:17,017 --> 00:56:18,985
No.

904
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:23,319
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

905
00:56:23,356 --> 00:56:26,723
We made a deal, you and I:
1:00 PM.

906
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,957
That's a pretty important principle
I’d like you start learning, Nick:

907
00:56:29,996 --> 00:56:32,055
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

908
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:35,090
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

909
00:56:35,135 --> 00:56:38,832
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

910
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:48,038
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

911
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:50,743
about you killing in their name?

912
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,172
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

913
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,472
They're dead.

914
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:36,857
( door slamming )

915
00:57:38,631 --> 00:57:40,792
( footsteps recede )

916
00:57:59,452 --> 00:58:01,511
- ( knocking )
- Hey, Nick?

917
00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:03,920
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

918
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:07,620
He's looking for some sort of
legal precedent that I’m not sure exists.

919
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,786
- But?
- But...

920
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:10,352
I think I may have found
a way around it.

921
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:12,626
- I’m gonna call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

922
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:14,895
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

923
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:16,765
Something else Cantrell said.

924
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:20,796
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

925
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:25,208
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

926
00:58:25,245 --> 00:58:28,237
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

927
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,644
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

928
00:58:33,686 --> 00:58:36,450
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

929
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:37,979
Who might that be?

930
00:58:38,024 --> 00:58:41,858
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

931
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,270
So Clyde finally lost it?

932
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:58,504
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

933
00:58:58,545 --> 00:59:00,911
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

934
00:59:00,947 --> 00:59:04,815
Okay, first of all,
I was never here and we never spoke.

935
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:07,649
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

936
00:59:07,687 --> 00:59:10,451
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I’m a spy.

937
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:14,017
Clyde is a brain.
He's a think-tank type guy.

938
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,722
His specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

939
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,231
Is this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

940
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:20,527
We kill people.

941
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:23,331
He figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

942
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:26,736
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

943
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,401
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

944
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:32,138
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

945
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:35,909
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

946
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:37,746
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

947
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:39,342
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

948
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:42,411
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

949
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,480
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

950
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:47,357
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

951
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:49,384
put in a necktie.

952
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:52,193
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

953
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:54,894
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

954
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,401
choked to death.

955
00:59:58,037 --> 01:00:01,268
What I’m saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

956
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,899
everything that you're doing.

957
01:00:02,942 --> 01:00:05,137
Nick: No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

958
01:00:05,178 --> 01:00:08,477
Man: If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

959
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:12,245
He's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

960
01:00:13,286 --> 01:00:15,754
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

961
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:17,312
( banging )

962
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:19,018
No.

963
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,754
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

964
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:26,398
If I were you,
I’d be looking for the next piece.

965
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:29,060
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

966
01:00:29,102 --> 01:00:31,332
he's gonna be coming after you.

967
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:36,468
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

968
01:00:38,544 --> 01:00:41,411
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

969
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:46,183
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

970
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:48,779
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

971
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:58,490
( phone ringing )

972
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:03,460
- Hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

973
01:01:03,503 --> 01:01:05,403
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

974
01:01:05,438 --> 01:01:07,531
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

975
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:10,371
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

976
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,275
He's worse than we thought.

977
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:14,780
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

978
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,782
Yeah.

979
01:01:16,816 --> 01:01:20,274
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

980
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,346
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

981
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,289
Sorry about this, Sarah.

982
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:34,756
Judge Burch:
I can't supersede the penal code.

983
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:36,462
You've already got him in solitary.

984
01:01:36,502 --> 01:01:38,800
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

985
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:40,669
We just want to limit his options;

986
01:01:40,707 --> 01:01:42,538
give him less contact,
less access,

987
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:45,908
even if it's just rescinding
his mandatory exercise period for a week.

988
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:48,345
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

989
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:50,645
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

990
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:54,346
that helps you rationalize it,
Your Honor.

991
01:01:55,988 --> 01:01:57,455
So let me get this straight:

992
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,323
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

993
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,124
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

994
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:05,255
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen?

995
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:10,525
( clears throat )

996
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:14,631
Okay. I’m game.

997
01:02:15,641 --> 01:02:19,771
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

998
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:25,045
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Wait, you're gonna take that,

999
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:27,245
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

1000
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:30,517
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

1001
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:33,582
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

1002
01:02:35,962 --> 01:02:37,429
- Hello?
- ( bullet zings )

1003
01:02:39,966 --> 01:02:41,763
Oh my God.

1004
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,463
Nick:
Back out. Back out.

1005
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:57,808
( door buzzes )

1006
01:03:06,225 --> 01:03:08,352
So you're killing judges now?

1007
01:03:08,394 --> 01:03:12,592
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

1008
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:15,430
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

1009
01:03:15,468 --> 01:03:17,265
Vengeance?

1010
01:03:19,105 --> 01:03:22,131
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

1011
01:03:22,175 --> 01:03:24,006
What else could it be?

1012
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:28,343
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

1013
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:32,181
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

1014
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:36,245
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to school, 8:15?

1015
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:40,191
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

1016
01:03:40,226 --> 01:03:43,093
You even think about
touching my family-

1017
01:03:43,129 --> 01:03:46,758
you even think about touching
my family...

1018
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,566
I do my job.

1019
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,010
I’m the best at it.

1020
01:04:00,046 --> 01:04:02,537
- It works.
- You were doing your job

1021
01:04:02,582 --> 01:04:06,916
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

1022
01:04:06,953 --> 01:04:10,252
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

1023
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:13,019
You at war with the whole world?
It’s not gonna bring anybody back.

1024
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,586
No, I’m at war with this-

1025
01:04:16,629 --> 01:04:19,757
this- this broken thing-

1026
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:21,926
this thing that brought
you and I together.

1027
01:04:21,968 --> 01:04:24,596
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

1028
01:04:24,637 --> 01:04:27,037
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

1029
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:29,769
You and whoever else
you have helping you

1030
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,800
are gonna pay.

1031
01:04:33,546 --> 01:04:38,347
I don't think you have any idea
who's helping me or what I’m doing.

1032
01:04:38,384 --> 01:04:39,715
It’s a matter of time.

1033
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:42,084
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

1034
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:45,249
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

1035
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,418
Do tell.

1036
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:51,825
I would like to...

1037
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:53,729
but I would rather show you.

1038
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:59,897
I still have faith in you,
so I’m gonna give you one last chance.

1039
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:01,304
Here's the deal:

1040
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,970
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

1041
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:08,810
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

1042
01:05:11,384 --> 01:05:14,251
Or I kill everyone.

1043
01:05:25,731 --> 01:05:27,631
- Hello?
- Nick: Yeah, Sarah,

1044
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,761
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

1045
01:05:30,803 --> 01:05:34,170
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

1046
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,071
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

1047
01:05:36,108 --> 01:05:39,407
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

1048
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:40,969
We're moving in.

1049
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,258
Stop looking at your watch.

1050
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:05,266
Anything from your friend?

1051
01:06:05,304 --> 01:06:07,101
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1052
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:10,199
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

1053
01:06:10,242 --> 01:06:12,233
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

1054
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:15,736
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

1055
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:17,180
Does that help?

1056
01:06:21,487 --> 01:06:25,685
So we match sales prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

1057
01:06:25,725 --> 01:06:28,387
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

1058
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:31,885
Okay, I got it.

1059
01:06:40,473 --> 01:06:43,499
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

1060
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,913
Would you do it
the same way now?

1061
01:06:48,948 --> 01:06:51,348
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

1062
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:57,212
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

1063
01:06:57,256 --> 01:07:01,124
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

1064
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:06,087
I don't know.

1065
01:07:06,132 --> 01:07:08,760
I’m 35, Nick.

1066
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:12,498
And there are things- there are
possibilities that I’m not gonna have now.

1067
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:17,775
And it's okay.
I know it's part of the deal.

1068
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:22,573
And don't get me wrong.
I love working for you.

1069
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:29,881
But I just want to make sure
I gave up those things

1070
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,255
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

1071
01:08:27,747 --> 01:08:29,578
( sighs )

1072
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:50,165
All right.

1073
01:08:50,202 --> 01:08:52,602
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

1074
01:08:52,638 --> 01:08:55,232
He's not the All Powerful.
He's just well-prepared.

1075
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:57,367
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

1076
01:08:57,409 --> 01:09:01,277
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1077
01:09:01,313 --> 01:09:02,610
Okay?

1078
01:09:12,825 --> 01:09:16,488
Man: Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

1079
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:33,875
Hey, Nick, get some rest.

1080
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:38,282
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

1081
01:09:38,317 --> 01:09:41,514
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1082
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:44,348
'Night, Jonas.

1083
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,533
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1084
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:00,562
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

1085
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:03,866
Ahh!

1086
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:12,878
Ahh!

1087
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:15,546
- ( car alarms going off )
- Sarah.

1088
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,625
Sarah.

1089
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:46,614
( siren wailing )

1090
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:57,386
Female reporter: In the past 48 hours,
six officials from the Justice Department

1091
01:10:57,429 --> 01:11:00,956
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

1092
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,833
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

1093
01:11:03,869 --> 01:11:06,861
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

1094
01:11:06,906 --> 01:11:08,771
systematically murdered.

1095
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:11,867
We'll continue to follow this story
and bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1096
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:18,975
Nick, I’m sorry to have to
do this now, but we've got something here.

1097
01:11:19,018 --> 01:11:21,885
Found this right outside the wall-

1098
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:23,855
radio beacon-

1099
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:26,551
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

1100
01:11:26,592 --> 01:11:29,356
Dunnigan: Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

1101
01:11:29,395 --> 01:11:32,922
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1102
01:11:32,965 --> 01:11:34,626
Real precise stuff too.

1103
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,897
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

1104
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:39,666
- Cantrell: What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

1105
01:11:39,705 --> 01:11:42,367
It’s clean-
hadn't been touched.

1106
01:11:43,575 --> 01:11:45,566
I gotta go.

1107
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:55,353
Woman:
Jesus Christ.

1108
01:11:55,387 --> 01:11:58,356
( inaudible talking )

1109
01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:05,994
Privacy, please.

1110
01:12:07,633 --> 01:12:10,761
So let me get this straight:

1111
01:12:10,803 --> 01:12:13,829
not only do we
know who did it,

1112
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:18,138
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

1113
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:23,677
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

1114
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:27,880
The press is gonna kill us.

1115
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,911
Can someone explain this to me?

1116
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:31,513
We can't yet.

1117
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:40,296
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

1118
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,596
It’s complicated, April.

1119
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:45,262
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

1120
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:47,898
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

1121
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,740
I’m not having
this conversation.

1122
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:55,406
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

1123
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,715
We'll release a statement saying
we have suspects, we're following leads-

1124
01:13:04,757 --> 01:13:07,851
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

1125
01:13:07,893 --> 01:13:11,852
we are gonna stop this guy.
He's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1126
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:19,366
I’m assigning security to
each of you from now on.

1127
01:13:23,642 --> 01:13:26,202
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

1128
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:35,215
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

1129
01:13:35,254 --> 01:13:37,017
Daddy, are you coming?

1130
01:13:37,056 --> 01:13:40,082
Oh, yeah, of course.

1131
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,355
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

1132
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:48,157
- Man: We need to go!
- I love you.

1133
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,134
Come on, baby.

1134
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:52,433
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

1135
01:13:57,342 --> 01:14:00,072
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

1136
01:14:00,112 --> 01:14:02,945
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

1137
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,694
( door buzzing )

1138
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:59,660
( gate slams )

1139
01:15:03,242 --> 01:15:05,369
You should have taken my deal.

1140
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:14,184
That's six fucking innocent people.
Is that how you want to play it? Huh?

1141
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:17,211
It’s okay.
It’s okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1142
01:15:17,256 --> 01:15:20,157
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

1143
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:21,819
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

1144
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,795
What if I had said, " Well,
let's take them to trial"? Huh?

1145
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:26,627
Then I would say
you're making progress.

1146
01:15:26,665 --> 01:15:30,123
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1147
01:15:30,169 --> 01:15:32,637
Don't you get that?

1148
01:15:32,671 --> 01:15:34,002
Fuck.

1149
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:36,473
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

1150
01:15:36,508 --> 01:15:39,375
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

1151
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,311
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1152
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:43,280
I keep my head up.

1153
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:46,944
And you will end this.

1154
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:50,982
I’m just getting warmed up.

1155
01:15:51,023 --> 01:15:55,050
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

1156
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,528
I’m gonna pull
the whole thing down.

1157
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,630
I’m gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1158
01:16:07,673 --> 01:16:10,335
down on your head.

1159
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,843
It’s gonna be Biblical.

1160
01:16:30,162 --> 01:16:33,461
Cantrell:
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1161
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:36,764
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1162
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:41,535
Absolutely not.

1163
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:46,109
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

1164
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:53,646
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

1165
01:16:53,685 --> 01:16:56,017
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

1166
01:17:01,426 --> 01:17:04,020
- ( indistinct police radio )
- ( cars starting )

1167
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:08,723
Man:
Everybody stay sharp.

1168
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,428
We're on the move.

1169
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:29,374
- We all right?
- Dunnigan: It’s dead.

1170
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,473
Electrical system's fried.

1171
01:18:31,516 --> 01:18:33,711
Man over radio:
What's going on back there?

1172
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:38,882
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

1173
01:18:47,265 --> 01:18:49,631
What the fuck is that?

1174
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,336
Get down, get down!

1175
01:19:17,562 --> 01:19:19,894
Jonas! Jonas!

1176
01:19:20,899 --> 01:19:22,594
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

1177
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,529
Nick:
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1178
01:19:26,571 --> 01:19:29,438
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

1179
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:31,601
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1180
01:19:31,643 --> 01:19:32,974
Dunnigan:
Please listen to me!

1181
01:19:36,915 --> 01:19:38,644
Jonas!

1182
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:40,514
Jonas.

1183
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:03,408
I told you to handle this.

1184
01:20:03,442 --> 01:20:05,342
You didn't.

1185
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:07,072
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1186
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:10,639
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

1187
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:14,344
One of my friends
was just murdered.

1188
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:19,449
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1189
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:22,392
What I should do is fire you.

1190
01:20:22,427 --> 01:20:24,793
Hmm?
Right now.

1191
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:28,799
I resign.

1192
01:20:28,834 --> 01:20:33,100
- Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1193
01:20:37,809 --> 01:20:39,276
No.

1194
01:20:40,345 --> 01:20:43,041
I’m not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

1195
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:47,711
I’m not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1196
01:20:47,752 --> 01:20:50,186
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

1197
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:53,316
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1198
01:20:53,358 --> 01:20:56,725
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

1199
01:20:58,296 --> 01:21:00,958
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1200
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:02,967
Repeat after me.

1201
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,060
- I, Nicolas Rice...
- I, Nicolas Rice...

1202
01:21:05,103 --> 01:21:07,230
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... do solemnly swear...

1203
01:21:07,272 --> 01:21:09,297
- ... that I will support...
- ... that I will support...

1204
01:21:09,341 --> 01:21:10,603
- ... obey...
- ... obey...

1205
01:21:10,642 --> 01:21:13,270
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

1206
01:21:13,311 --> 01:21:15,336
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

1207
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,508
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1208
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:30,452
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to school.

1209
01:21:30,495 --> 01:21:32,963
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

1210
01:21:32,998 --> 01:21:37,264
So I’m implementing the emergency
provision of the Philadelphia code.

1211
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:38,826
We're gonna lock this city down.

1212
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:42,328
Starting now, no one moves in
this city unrestricted.

1213
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:44,934
I want a show of force
for the public-

1214
01:21:44,976 --> 01:21:47,740
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

1215
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:49,770
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1216
01:21:49,814 --> 01:21:52,408
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1217
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,816
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

1218
01:21:54,853 --> 01:21:58,084
that this city is secure
and under our control.

1219
01:22:01,092 --> 01:22:02,855
Okay.

1220
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:12,031
Okay, Clyde.
I get it.

1221
01:22:15,807 --> 01:22:18,970
Dunnigan: Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1222
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:22,309
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

1223
01:22:22,347 --> 01:22:23,678
Can you believe that?

1224
01:22:23,715 --> 01:22:26,741
Damn thing had video, night vision-
you name it.

1225
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:29,982
It’s like military API,
for Christ's sakes.

1226
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:33,013
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1227
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:34,992
I think he's saving you for last.

1228
01:22:37,729 --> 01:22:40,027
Nick, I’m serious.

1229
01:22:41,766 --> 01:22:44,701
I appreciate the insight.

1230
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:48,205
( alarm sounding )

1231
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,766
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

1232
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:56,777
I may have a way-

1233
01:22:56,815 --> 01:23:00,376
something a friend
is helping me out with.

1234
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:02,010
Who's your friend?

1235
01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:04,749
A friend named Chester.
I’ll call you back.

1236
01:23:06,591 --> 01:23:08,786
Thank you, Sarah.

1237
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:16,094
( dialing )

1238
01:23:16,134 --> 01:23:19,001
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

1239
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:22,370
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

1240
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:50,331
Motherfucker.

1241
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,645
You're kidding me, right?

1242
01:24:11,656 --> 01:24:14,090
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1243
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:17,151
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1244
01:24:17,195 --> 01:24:19,129
Yeah.

1245
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:22,290
( metal scraping )

1246
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:25,393
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1247
01:24:26,738 --> 01:24:30,196
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civil rights.

1248
01:24:32,143 --> 01:24:35,169
( laughs )
Yes!

1249
01:24:35,213 --> 01:24:37,773
( grunting )

1250
01:24:37,816 --> 01:24:40,148
( door sliding open )

1251
01:25:04,743 --> 01:25:07,837
( bats squeak )

1252
01:25:14,018 --> 01:25:16,179
( metal clanging )

1253
01:25:20,058 --> 01:25:22,492
There's got to be
something in here.

1254
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:24,290
Dunnigan: Yeah.

1255
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:42,774
Remember this from
outside the house?

1256
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:51,284
Yeah.

1257
01:25:51,322 --> 01:25:53,313
Get that right there.

1258
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:56,452
- ( flips switch )
- ( motor humming )

1259
01:26:09,908 --> 01:26:12,468
Dunnigan:
Un-fucking-believable.

1260
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:28,419
Look at this.

1261
01:26:33,865 --> 01:26:35,560
Nick:
Watch your step.

1262
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:43,530
This guy tunneled into prison?

1263
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:57,110
( train brakes screeching )

1264
01:26:57,155 --> 01:26:59,248
( flips switch )

1265
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,690
Nick:
Oh, shit.

1266
01:27:09,834 --> 01:27:11,825
Dunnigan:
Fuck- Semtex.

1267
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,532
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

1268
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:36,452
( loud rumbling )

1269
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:45,464
Nick:
He tunneled into every cell.

1270
01:27:45,503 --> 01:27:47,266
Over here.

1271
01:27:53,544 --> 01:27:56,274
He wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

1272
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:59,078
Surprise, motherfucker.

1273
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,505
( metal clanging )

1274
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:45,296
- He's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

1275
01:28:45,331 --> 01:28:48,094
( indistinct police radio )

1276
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:52,499
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1277
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:54,232
Oh, long story.

1278
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,332
- ( metal detector beeping )
- Stop right there, sir.

1279
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,570
Let me see your ID, please.

1280
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:01,942
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1281
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,414
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

1282
01:29:06,184 --> 01:29:07,981
Something going on tonight?

1283
01:29:08,019 --> 01:29:11,352
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

1284
01:29:18,963 --> 01:29:21,056
Look at this.

1285
01:29:21,099 --> 01:29:23,567
He tapped into the prison cameras.

1286
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:25,660
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1287
01:29:31,376 --> 01:29:32,968
Nick:
Von Clausewitz.

1288
01:29:37,448 --> 01:29:39,075
Look at that.

1289
01:29:46,391 --> 01:29:48,222
He's at City Hall.

1290
01:29:49,627 --> 01:29:51,754
You're free to go, sir.

1291
01:29:51,796 --> 01:29:54,788
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

1292
01:29:56,334 --> 01:29:58,825
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

1293
01:30:00,405 --> 01:30:02,532
Dunnigan:
Get ready to evacuate the building.

1294
01:30:02,573 --> 01:30:04,666
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1295
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:06,199
Bad idea.
Have them come in soft.

1296
01:30:06,244 --> 01:30:08,769
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

1297
01:30:16,187 --> 01:30:18,178
( drill whirring )

1298
01:30:32,603 --> 01:30:34,833
Hey.

1299
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:39,272
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

1300
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:41,574
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

1301
01:30:41,612 --> 01:30:43,341
You're looking at it.

1302
01:30:43,381 --> 01:30:46,714
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

1303
01:30:46,751 --> 01:30:48,275
We'll call.

1304
01:30:53,324 --> 01:30:54,916
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

1305
01:30:54,959 --> 01:30:57,553
- He's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

1306
01:30:57,595 --> 01:30:59,688
What's going on here tonight?

1307
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,198
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

1308
01:31:02,233 --> 01:31:03,962
6th floor- caucus room.

1309
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:10,802
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

1310
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:13,174
Directly below the caucus room.

1311
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:16,806
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

1312
01:31:38,903 --> 01:31:41,064
Where is he?

1313
01:31:41,105 --> 01:31:43,665
What the fuck are we looking for?

1314
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:46,074
Wait wait wait.

1315
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:47,372
Right there.

1316
01:31:47,411 --> 01:31:49,971
Garza: Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

1317
01:31:51,415 --> 01:31:54,213
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1318
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,228
( indistinct police radio )

1319
01:32:18,809 --> 01:32:21,073
( rustling )

1320
01:32:23,948 --> 01:32:26,746
( drilling )

1321
01:32:33,024 --> 01:32:35,015
Can I see your ID, please?

1322
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:44,564
All right, next car, pull forward!

1323
01:33:19,203 --> 01:33:22,730
Garza:
Malglinite.

1324
01:33:22,773 --> 01:33:25,469
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

1325
01:33:25,509 --> 01:33:27,477
and the one above us.

1326
01:33:27,511 --> 01:33:31,607
Looks like it's - looks like it's triggered
by this cell phone here.

1327
01:33:31,649 --> 01:33:35,847
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

1328
01:33:35,886 --> 01:33:39,845
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

1329
01:33:40,858 --> 01:33:43,292
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1330
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:45,261
- I’m calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

1331
01:33:45,296 --> 01:33:48,697
Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

1332
01:33:48,733 --> 01:33:51,429
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1333
01:33:53,904 --> 01:33:56,031
So what do we do?

1334
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:08,208
Man:
Wait a second.

1335
01:34:08,252 --> 01:34:10,049
We've got something.

1336
01:34:10,087 --> 01:34:11,952
Man over radio:
He's pulling up.

1337
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,388
( presses button )

1338
01:34:31,642 --> 01:34:34,167
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1339
01:34:40,618 --> 01:34:42,518
Mayor:
I have one simple question.

1340
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:47,881
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1341
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:52,260
Now I refuse to believe

1342
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:56,733
that one man is smarter
than Homeland Security,

1343
01:34:56,767 --> 01:35:01,204
the FBI, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

1344
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:03,502
I don't care how we do it,

1345
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:07,068
or what kind of obscure legal
justification we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1346
01:35:07,111 --> 01:35:10,444
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1347
01:35:10,481 --> 01:35:14,508
I am sure that there is a provision
of the Homeland Security Act

1348
01:35:14,552 --> 01:35:17,112
that we can activate.

1349
01:35:17,154 --> 01:35:20,453
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1350
01:35:27,031 --> 01:35:28,623
Nick: Clyde?

1351
01:35:32,937 --> 01:35:35,235
Nick.

1352
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:37,399
I wasn't expecting company.

1353
01:35:40,745 --> 01:35:43,942
Yeah, I would have-
I would have cleaned up a little.

1354
01:35:43,981 --> 01:35:46,814
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

1355
01:35:52,656 --> 01:35:56,717
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

1356
01:35:56,761 --> 01:35:59,127
Well, that's how winners play.

1357
01:35:59,163 --> 01:36:02,496
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

1358
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:05,992
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1359
01:36:06,036 --> 01:36:07,867
Yeah, I did.

1360
01:36:07,905 --> 01:36:10,396
It’s the end of the road
for you now.

1361
01:36:14,745 --> 01:36:17,509
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

1362
01:36:17,548 --> 01:36:19,448
Thank you.

1363
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:22,714
You know, I’m glad you finally
get to appreciate

1364
01:36:22,753 --> 01:36:24,778
some of the effort that
I put into all of this.

1365
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:27,120
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1366
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:28,523
You made it.

1367
01:36:28,559 --> 01:36:30,459
No, people still don't get it.

1368
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:34,157
They don't appreciate what I’m trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1369
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:36,189
A man I cared about
once told me

1370
01:36:36,233 --> 01:36:38,667
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

1371
01:36:38,702 --> 01:36:41,466
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

1372
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:44,406
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I’m giving you a way out.

1373
01:36:44,442 --> 01:36:46,034
Big difference.

1374
01:36:46,076 --> 01:36:48,271
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

1375
01:36:48,312 --> 01:36:52,043
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

1376
01:36:52,082 --> 01:36:53,811
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

1377
01:36:54,819 --> 01:36:57,219
I’m doing the right thing, Nick.

1378
01:36:59,223 --> 01:37:01,054
You just have to see it that way.

1379
01:37:01,091 --> 01:37:02,683
By murdering all those people,

1380
01:37:02,726 --> 01:37:05,695
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

1381
01:37:05,729 --> 01:37:09,165
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1382
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:20,570
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deal?

1383
01:37:20,611 --> 01:37:23,671
One final offer?
Is that what it is?

1384
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:30,279
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1385
01:37:30,321 --> 01:37:32,516
You taught me that.

1386
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:40,730
Finally.

1387
01:37:42,867 --> 01:37:45,631
Well done. Bravo.

1388
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:48,729
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

1389
01:37:48,772 --> 01:37:51,036
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decision

1390
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:53,737
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

1391
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:19,527
I’m sorry, Nick.

1392
01:38:22,072 --> 01:38:24,006
Me too.

1393
01:38:26,744 --> 01:38:28,177
( beeps )

1394
01:38:34,151 --> 01:38:36,142
- ( locking )
- Like I said, Clyde,

1395
01:38:36,186 --> 01:38:39,246
it's a decision you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

1396
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:42,748
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.

1397
01:38:44,628 --> 01:38:47,495
( lock rustling )

1398
01:38:52,636 --> 01:38:54,763
( phone ringing )

1399
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:01,339
( alarm beeping )

1400
01:41:31,328 --> 01:41:33,922
( rock music playing )

1401
01:41:54,051 --> 01:41:56,576
? Ain't seen a night ?

1402
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,453
? Things work out right ?

1403
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:02,982
? Go by ?

1404
01:42:05,095 --> 01:42:07,495
? Things on my mind ?

1405
01:42:07,531 --> 01:42:10,193
? And I just don't have the time ?

1406
01:42:10,234 --> 01:42:13,795
? And it don't seem right ?

1407
01:42:16,406 --> 01:42:18,772
? Ain't seen a day ?

1408
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:21,744
? That I don't hear people say ?

1409
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:24,839
? They know they're gonna die ?

1410
01:42:27,885 --> 01:42:30,683
? This may seem a little bit crazy ?

1411
01:42:30,721 --> 01:42:35,090
? But I don't think you
should be so lazy ?

1412
01:42:39,096 --> 01:42:41,758
? If you think
you've heard this before ?

1413
01:42:41,799 --> 01:42:47,362
? Well, stick around,
I’m gonna tell you more ?

1414
01:44:14,057 --> 01:44:17,026
? One just like the other ?

1415
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:19,119
? Sin's a good man's brother ?

1416
01:44:19,162 --> 01:44:22,723
? But is that right? ?

1417
01:44:25,269 --> 01:44:27,965
? You tell me that I don't ?

1418
01:44:28,005 --> 01:44:30,269
? Then I say I won't ?

1419
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:34,107
? But then I might ?

1420
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:39,547
? You said this is the way
it's supposed to be ?

1421
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:42,279
? But it just don't seem
right to me ?

1422
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:46,278
? And that's outta sight ?

1423
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:50,791
? Some folks need an education ?

1424
01:44:50,827 --> 01:44:55,321
? Don't give up
or we'll lose the nation ?

1425
01:44:59,269 --> 01:45:02,170
? You say we need a revolution? ?

1426
01:45:02,205 --> 01:45:07,575
? It seems to be
the only solution. ?
