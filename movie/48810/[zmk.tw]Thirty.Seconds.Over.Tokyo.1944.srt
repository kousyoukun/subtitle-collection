00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:25,200
片名：东京上空三十秒

2
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,300
你好，请稍等。您的电话，上校
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.

3
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,900
谢谢
Thank you.

4
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,100
你好，约克上校吗？请讲
Hello. Captain York, please.

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,900
你知道，这件事如果计划周密
You know, if this thing works out,

6
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,600
将会给我们驻守在从巴丹半岛到新加坡的小伙子们极大的鼓舞
it might give our boys all the way from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,400
并把那些日本人赶回他们的小岛上去
And it may pull a lot of Japs back to their islands.

8
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
- 一定会的，将军
- It'll work out, General.
- 我也相信
- I'm sure it will

9
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,100
喂，约克，我是杜利德
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.

10
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,300
约克，我要你准备好24架B-25轰炸机和志愿飞行员
York, I want you to get 24 B-25s with volunteer crews

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,100
尽快调遣到埃格林空军基地
down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.

12
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,100
这项任务会让他们远离国土三个月
The job will take them out of the country for about three months.

13
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,100
告诉他们这是一项秘密任务
Tell them it's a secret mission.

14
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,000
到达那里之前他们是不会知道目的地的
They won't know where they're going until they get there.

15
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
对，志愿飞行员
That's right, volunteers.

16
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,600
告诉他们不准向任何人谈起, 这是命令
Tell them they're not to talk to anybody. That's an order.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,300
我过几天就会来。好的
I'll join you in a few days. Right.

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,500
02241呼叫埃格林指挥塔
Zero-two-two-four-one to Eglin Tower.

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,900
3架B-25请求飞行和降落指示
Three B-25s request traffic and landing instructions.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,100
请讲
Go ahead.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
41军，请靠左飞行
<i>Army four-one. The left-hand pattern.</i>

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
风向，北偏东北
<i>Wind direction north by northeast.</i>

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,300
在3号跑道降落
<i>Land on runway number three.</i>

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,300
那是个机场吧？
There's the field all right.

25
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,900
嘿，你们见过这么宽的跑道吗？
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
它的确很大啊
She's big all right.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
你完全可以闭着眼睛着陆
You could almost close your eyes and get in.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
我真想知道，我们会从这儿飞往哪里
And I'd give plenty to know where we go from here.


29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,900
我也想知道
Yeah, so would I.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,900
嘿，先别降落，我去拿相机
Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
机鼻的景色怎么样，克勒文？
How does she look from the nose, Clever?

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,300
太棒了，佛罗里达、棕榈树、美洲鳄、泳装美人
Great. Florida, palm trees, alligators, bathing beauties.

33
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,900
嘿，撒切尔，看一下脚下的景色怎么样
Hey, Thatcher, have a look at some real country.


34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,400
没有比令斯漂亮，长官
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,400
这次飞行带饼干了吗，撒切尔？
Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher?

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,000
是的，长官，带了，飞跃山脉时我很难受，但我还是挺过来了
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming over the mountains, but I hung on.

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,500
- 02241
- Zero-two-two-four-one to flight. 
- 嘿，等会儿
- Hey, wait a minute.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
我们先等会儿，把飞行梯队编好
We'll go around, make an echelon right

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,200
先飞到机场上空，然后再解散梯队做得漂亮点
<i>once over the field, then break away. Let's make it pretty.</i>

40
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
但愿好运
Here's for luck.

41
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,400
关闭
Switch is off!

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,000
- 5分25秒，还不赖
- 5:25. Not bad time
- 我们走了
- Yeah, we moved.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,400
最好去报修一下左边的引擎，它的声音有点刺耳
Better write that left engine up. She sounded a little rough.

44
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,300
我干得不错吧，劳森？
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
你的降落真完美，给我一种艺术的视觉享受
You really made a nice break away. Gave me kind of an artistic angle.

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,800
总有一天我要干一次坠毁降落，这样你就能看上真正的电影了
Some day I'll do a crash landing so you can get a real movie.

47
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,400
撒切尔说佛罗里达比不上比令斯
Thatcher says that Florida can't compare to Billings.

48
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,100
撒切尔是觉得，任何超过300人的地方…
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks that any place with more than 300 people

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,400
- 便很拥挤了
- is overcrowded.
- 是根据最近一次人口普查的，长官
- Oh, according to the last census, sir,

50
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,600
比令斯有16,300人口
Billings has a population of 16,380.

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
16,000，不会吧，撒切尔，你一定把郊区算进去了
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must be thinking of Greater Billings.

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,400
不，他说对了，克勒文，他们把乡间的奶牛算进去了
No, he's right, Clever. They count the cows up in that country.

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,700
- 对不起，长官
- Sorry, sir.
- 什么事？
- Yes.

54
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,600
- 机场禁止照相
- Cameras aren't allowed on the field.
- 什么？
- What?

55
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,800
是的，长官
That's right, sir.

56
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,100
许多秘密工事都在这里，这是很严肃的纪律
A lot of secret work goes on here, and they're very strict about it.

57
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,900
我根本没看见有什么秘密工事
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.

58
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,800
那么我只好向指挥官报告了，长官
Then I'll have to report youto the Commanding Officer, sir.

59
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
这是我的职责
Those are my orders.

60
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,700
好吧。好吧
Okay. Okay.

61
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,600
瞧，布里.霍尔斯通还和我们在一起
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.

62
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
我还在想明天之前，你不会把那个笨蛋叫上的
We were afraid you wouldn't get that turkey in till tomorrow.

63
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,400
为什么？那家伙飞得挺好的
Why, that baby flies so pretty


64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,700
最后200英里我们很平稳
we floated the last 200 miles.

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
- 你们准备好了吗？
- Are you guys ready?
- 好了，来吧，布里克
- Yeah. Come on, Brick.

66
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,400
撒切尔，我去去就来，还要告诉你的住处
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back and tell you where your quarters are.

67
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,700
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,500
戴维，有什么想法？说说看
Come on, Davey, you've got an idea. What's the dope?

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
- 我们从这儿会到哪儿去？
- Where do we go from here?
- 我告诉过你了
- I already told you.

70
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,300
他们只说了我们会离开本土
All they said was that it'd take us out of the country,

71
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,700
我们会离开3个月，而且还有一定的危险
we'd be gone about three months and that it'd be dangerous.

72
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,500
听着，我从乔兰德尔那里，得到了真实内幕
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
他说我们是要组成巡逻中队，去保卫巴拿马运河
He says they're forming patrol squadrons to guard the Canal.

74
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,000
运河巡逻有什么危险？
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?

75
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,400
那么，我们担心什么呢？
Well, what are we worrying about?

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,900
当我们报到时，斯基就会告诉我们内幕了
Ski will give us all the dope when we check in anyhow.

77
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
三架飞机到，长官，霍尔斯通、劳森和我
Three ships in, sir. Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
- 好的，你们的飞机还好吧？
- Good. Your ships okay?
- 是的，长官
- Yes, sir.

79
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,400
坐吧
Sit down.

80
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
我们住哪，斯基？
Where we staying, Ski?

81
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
政府在附近租了间旅馆
The government's leased a hotel near here.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
他们叫军官俱乐部
They call it the Officers' Club.

83
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,000
带来的家眷也可以待在那里
The men whose wives are coming can stay there.

84
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
其他军官的住处在5号兵营
The other officers' quarters are in Barracks 5.

85
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,200
艾米来了吗？
Is Emmy coming down?

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,700
- 她几天之后到
- She'll be here in a couple of days.
- 斯基，撒切尔住哪？
- Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?

87
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,000
招募兵被安排在12号兵营
The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12.

88
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,200
好的
Okay.

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
- 还有其他事吗？
- Anything else?
- 没了
- Nope?

90
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
至少明早之前没事了
At least, not until tomorrow morning.

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,900
那好，我们再会
Well, we'll be seeing you.

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,800
喂，斯基，大伙儿都很想知道发生什么了
Say, Ski, the guys are all crazy to know what's up.

93
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
你和我知道的差不多
You know as much about it as I do.

94
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,100
明早我们就会得到更多消息了
We may be given more information in the morning.

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,700
快瞧，伙计，谁来了
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
好！好！好！看来我必须去了
Well, well, well, plant me now and dig me later,

97
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,500
如果不是伦道夫.菲尔德的缘故。怎么样，哥们？
if it isn't the pride of Randolph Field. How are you, boy?

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
最近不错，我们一听到这个兴奋的消息
Great, Shorty. The minute we heard that razzmatazz,

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,500
就知道你肯定就在这附近
we knew you must be somewhere around.

100
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,800
- 你也是自愿参与这次行动的
- You volunteer for this deal, too?
- 那是当然
- Sure enough.

101
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,700
他们把我安排在明尼阿波利斯,一个我见过最冷的地方
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis. Coldest country I ever did see.


102
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,500
我极力想去任何一个，能让我重返阳光的地方
I'd have volunteered for anything to get back in the sunshine.

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,400
- 你去过哪？
- Where you been?
- 哥伦比亚、南卡罗莱纳
- Columbia, South Carolina.

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
- 鲍勃
- Bob!
- 你好，特德
- Hello, Ted.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,300
你们互相认识？
You guys know each other?

106
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,100
我们一起认识的凯利，就这样
Oh, we just went through Kelly together, that's all.

107
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,900
- 当然，鲍勃是我婚礼的伴郎
- Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding.
- 婚礼
- Wedding?

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,900
没有人再告诉我什么了
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
你们搞在一起多久了？
How long you been balled up and chained down?

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
再过五六天就六个月了
Six months, in five more days.

111
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,600
让我大吃一惊啊，别骗我啊
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.

112
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,400
戴维，你在这儿怎么样啊？
Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here?

113
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
- 布里克
- Brick!
- 嗨，唐
- Hi, Don.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,900
- 我还以为你在打潜水艇呢
- I thought you were hunting subs.
- 是啊，打沉过一艘
- Was. Got me one, too.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
- 你也参与这项任务
- You in on this deal?
- 当然，我有一批不错的队员
- Sure. I've got a swell crew

116
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,100
看起来好像会有什么大任务，不是吗？
and it looked like it was going to be something, so why not?


117
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,500
- 我们的行动，有什么想法吗？
- Any ideas what we might be up to?
- 哦，只是预感
- Oh, just a hunch.

118
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,400
是吗？快说说看
Yeah? Well, give.

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
南部海域赶走那些蠢蛋
South Seas. Knock ourselves off a few meatballs.

120
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,000
三点
Three.

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,500
好家伙，庄家得两点
Honest man. Dealer takes two.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,500
- 我刚才想到
- You know, I just got an idea.
- 想到什么？
- About what?

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
想到我们会去的地方
About where we might be going.

124
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
- 行程看起来会…
- The way it looks to... 
- 不会不会，算了
- No, that's not right. Forget it.

125
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,600
得两点
Says two.

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,400
- 我也有一个猜想
- You know, I've got an idea too.
- 什么？
- Yeah?


127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
我觉得，你肯定是第一个来到这里…
I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope

128
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,900
并且是知道内情的人
to have come in on this deal in the first place.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
为什么这样认为？
What kind of a crack is that?

130
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,100
我不知道你结婚了，有一个不错的女孩
Oh, I don't know. You're married. You've got a swell girl.

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
如果我是你的话，就绝不会去冒风险
I never would have stuck my neck out if I were in your boots.

132
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,100
滚开，你说两点
Go away. You say two?

133
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
再跟两点
And up two.

134
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
那些人又被刷掉了
Those guys are off again.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,700
起来，起来。你们以为你们是谁啊
Hey, stand up there. Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,600
你们飞机上配有导航员吗？
Have you ever carried a navigator in your ship before, Spike?

137
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,500
我也没有，直到我们参与了这次行动
Neither have I, until I volunteered for this job.

138
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,600
我们就快知道一些奇妙的消息了，我有一种感党
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff, all right. I kind of got a feeling.


139
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,300
拿我们去对付那些臭鸡貂
Shoot me for a pole cat.

140
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,400
我看见两个精力充沛的人，背靠背…
Do I see two red-blooded citizens lying on their backsides

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
还唱着得克萨斯赞歌
while the Texas anthem is being rendered?

142
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,300
起立，所有人
On your feet, men.

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
感觉怎么样？最近你来自佛吉尼亚吧？
What are you beefing about, Shorty? You're from Virginia.

144
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,000
是的，聪明鬼
That's right, sharp cat,

145
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,000
但我德州的这个朋友在这，而且经常不守规矩
but my pal here, he's from Texas, and he takes offense easy.


146
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,800
- 你好，乔
- Hello, Joe.
- 你好，乔伊斯，我得到一些消息
- Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.

147
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,700
嘿，你们几个，安静些
Hey, you guys, shut up!

148
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
安静，小伙子们。听着，吉米.杜利德要来了
Quiet, fellows. Listen. Jimmy Doolittle's down here

149
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,900
他现在是陆军中校
and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
吉米.杜利德是南加州的
Jimmy Doolittle! A southern boy from Southern California.

151
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,300
让我们为吉米.杜利德唱一曲“德州之眼”吧
<i>Let's have Eyes of Texas for Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.</i>

152
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,300
立正
Attention!

153
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,100
先生，杜利德中校
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,600
请坐
As you were.

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
你们是自愿到这儿的
You men are here because you've volunteered.

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,300
你们被告知，这将会是一次危险的任务
You have been told it's a dangerous mission.

157
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,500
现在我不会再告诉你们更多，但我想再强调危险
I can't tell you any more than that now, but I want to emphasize the danger.

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,400
当下最重要的是严守秘密
The most important thing at the moment is secrecy.

159
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,600
我不想你们去告诉你们的妻子，这里有些什么
I don't want you to even tell your wives what you see down here.

160
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,700
如果你们觉得猜到了，将要去哪儿…
And if you think you've guessed where you're going,

161
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,100
你那肯定是错的，但甚至这猜测都不要谈论
you're probably wrong. But don't even talk about your guess.

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,500
如果这次任务的一丁点消息走漏了的话…
If the slightest word about this mission gets around,

163
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,500
你们的生命甚至数以万计人的生命，都将置于危险之中
you will endanger not only your own lives, but the lives of thousands of other men.

164
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,100
现在，我想问你们一个问题
Now I want to ask you a question.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,700
有人试着谈起这些事情吗？
Has anybody tried to talk to you about this?

166
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,600
很好，如果基地内外的任何人…
Good. If anybody on the field or off the field

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,400
试看要问起你们关于…
tries to engage you in conversation


168
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,400
为什么你们来这里，不管多么友善…
as to why you're here, no matter how innocently,

169
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,200
我要你们记住他的名字，然后告诉我
I want you to get his name and give it to me

170
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,400
我会把它交给联邦调查局
and I'll turn it over to the FBI.

171
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,700
这将是一次你们经历过的最艰苦的训练
This is going to be the toughest training you've ever had.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,200
你们将会在同一艘船上和同一批人在一起
You will have the same crew all the way through and the same ship.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,100
任何失败的机组将会被剔除
And the man or the ship that fails will be dropped.

174
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,200
你们将会驾驶你们觉得不可能的用B-25飞行的方法
You're going to do things with a B-25 you thought were impossible.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,500
现在，如果你们有任何杂念，我建议你们趁早放弃
Now, if any of you have any doubts, I'd like you to drop out right now

176
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
我保证你们没有人会想得更糟
and I promise you that no one will ever think the worse of you.

177
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,000
如果你们的妻儿或其他什么…
If you have wives or children or any other considerations

178
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,400
让你们在危机中时刻牵挂着，很正常
that might get on your nerves in a crisis, it's perfectly all right.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,600
事实上，放弃是你们的职责
As a matter of fact, it's your duty to drop out.

180
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,000
很好，我们将进行尽可能多的谈话，就这样吧
Very well. We'll have these talks as often as possible. That's all.

181
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
今早开始，我们将进行定向飞行
We're going up this morning for an orientation flight.

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,200
有四个辅助机场，一、二、三、四
There are four auxiliary fields. One, two, three, four.

183
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
依次全部找到它们
Line them up and locate them all.

184
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,900
我不知道会使用哪一个来进行，我们的机密试验…
We don't know which we're going to use for our confidential experiments,

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,900
所以自己都去熟悉熟悉
so familiarize yourselves with all of them.

186
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,200
先自己去转转。等一会儿我们再集台
Look over the countryside, and we'll meet here again

187
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,400
下午三点半，还有问题吗？
at 3:30 this afternoon. Are there any questions?

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
长官，我引擎中的塞子正在更换中
Sir, the plugs are being changed in my engines.

189
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,900
为了节省时间，我能搭琼斯的飞机吗？
To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship?

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,300
可以，史密斯。你们可以去自己的飞机了
Right, Smith. All right. You can go to your ship now.

191
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
对我来说，你很长时间都没去…
It looks to me like it's going to be a long time

192
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300
比令斯主干道游荡了，撒切尔
before you swing down Main Street of Billings again, Thatcher.

193
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,000
在比令斯，长官，主干道是明尼苏达大街
In Billings, sir, the main street is Minnesota Avenue.

194
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,200
你知道，那个人很当真的
You know, that guy really means business.

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,200
- 他让我有点出汗
- He had me sweating a little.
- 我也是
- Yeah, me too.

196
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,900
- 劳森中尉？
- Lieutenant Lawson?
- 是的
- Yes.

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
有人看见你在J大街的陆军消费合作社前，长官
Someone to see you out in front of the PX at J Street, sir.

198
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,200
谢谢，我想会是谁…
Thanks. I wonder who would...

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
我马上就来
I'll be right back.

200
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,200
爱伦
Ellen!

201
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,900
- 你从哪儿来？
- Where did you come from?
- 我开到卡罗莱纳来给你个惊喜
- I drove to Carolina to surprise you.

202
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,300
- 他们告诉我你在这里
- And then they told me you're down here.
- 是吗？还好吧
- Well, how are you?

203
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,700
凑合，谢谢，你怎么样？
I'm just fine, thank you. And how are you bearing up?

204
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
还好，你一点都没变
Oh, great. You look just the same.

205
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,900
当然没变，你不能总是期望立刻就变
Well, of course I do. You can't expect any change this soon.

206
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,800
- 什么意思？
- What's the joke?
- 没什么
- Nothing.

207
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,200
没想到你这么搞笑
Except you're so funny.

208
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
告诉我亲爱的，你惊讶吗？
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?

209
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,100
我简直不敢相信我的眼睛，等会儿，我去给你买点喝的
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here, let me buy you a drink.

210
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
真高兴见到你
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

211
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
来，我们到处走走
Come on, let's go around here.

212
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
告诉我甜心，为什么你这么可人？
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?

213
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,500
我找到了一个如此帅气的小伙子，我必须得这样啊
I had to be if I were going to get such a good looking fellow.

214
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,500
我有千言万语想对你说
You know, there's a lot of things I want to talk over with you.

215
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,200
说吧，你真的很惊讶吗？
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?

216
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
其实不是非常
Well, no, not exactly.

217
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,100
你知道吗？当你睁开双眼时就会变成这样
You know, you go into something like this with your eyes open.

218
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,500
- 自然你得抓住机会
- Naturally you've got to take your chances.
- I see.
- 我知道

219
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,200
这样看着它不是有些冷漠吗？
Isn't that kind of a cold-blooded way to look at it?

220
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
快别发疯了，你真的有点冷漠了
Oh, now, don't get mad. You've got to be cold-blooded about it.

221
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,300
这对我来说是最重要的事
This is the most important thing that's ever happened to me.

222
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
- 那我呢？
- What about me?
- 你也是啊
- Well, you're in on it, too.

223
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,300
- 这就是我为什么想说一说的原因
- That's why I want to talk it over.
- 真慷慨啊，说吧，特德
- That's very generous. Go on, Ted.

224
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,700
那么，首先我们得保守秘密
Well, in the first place, we've got to keep it a secret.

225
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,900
- 我也不是要你从心底发誓
- I don't want you to tell a soul.
- 你是，我是说，你…
- You're not, I mean, you...

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,700
你不希望这一切发生，是吗？
You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you?

227
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,100
哦，是的，当然
Oh, no, of course not.

228
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
但这是军事机密，我有我的纪律
But it's a military secret, I've got my orders.

229
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,300
军事…比如，你说的…
Military... Say, what are you talking about?

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,900
比如我自愿参与的这项任务，你收到我的信了吗？
Well, this job I volunteered for. Didn't you get my letter?

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
- 没有，你收到我的了吗？
- No. Didn't you get mine?
- 没有
- No.

232
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
我觉得这很可笑，但是…
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...

233
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,200
- 嗨，劳森，特德.劳森
- Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson!
- 到
- Here.

234
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,200
你们藏起来干什么？
What are you hiding out...

235
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,600
- 爱伦，什么时候来的？
- Ellen, when did you get here?
- 5分钟前，我的伴娘还好吧？
- Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?

236
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
很好，只是我不得不打断你们了
Great. Only I'm going to have to break this up.

237
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
杜利德来视察我们起飞了
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.

238
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,100
好，晚饭时我来找你
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.

239
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,500
顺着路下去一英里半有家旅馆
There's a hotel about a mile and a half down the road.

240
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,200
我还没去过呢，但他们说你一定能找到的
I haven't seen it yet, but they tell me you can't miss it.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,600
- 我会找到的
- I'll find it.
- 很抱歉这样行事匆忙
- I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.


242
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,700
别忘了晚餐
Don't forget dinner.

243
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,300
有人捡到我的信了吗？
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,300
是的，长官，我今早捡到的，我都快忘了
Yes, sir. I did this morning. I forgot all about it.

245
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,700
- 好的，把它拿来
- Well, bring it up.
- 是的
- Yes, sir.

246
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,500
对不起，长官
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,900
好的，谢谢，你来开好吗，达文波特？
Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport.

248
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,000
好的
Sure.

249
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,300
哇，我有孩子了
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!

250
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
是爱伦写的
Hey, it's from Ellen.

251
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,900
她就要是…我是说，我就要当爸爸了
She's going to be... I mean, I'm going to be a father.

252
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,700
你好，飞行员
Hello, flyer.

253
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,300
对不起叫醒你们
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

254
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,600
我没睡着，真的，我在假寐冥思
I wasn't sleeping, really. I was just dozing and thinking.

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,300
我没能赶回来吃晚餐，真对不起，我们有太多的检验工作
I'm sorry I didn't get back for dinner. We had a lot of checking to do.

256
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,900
你肯定觉得，我今早就是个大笨蛋
You must've thought I was an awful dope this morning.

257
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,300
我直到后来才收到你的信，所以那时我根本不知道
But I didn't get your letter until later, so I didn't know.

258
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
我知道，坐吧
I know. Sit down.


259
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,400
- 我认为孩子的事太美妙了
- I think it's swell about the baby.
- 我知道你会这样的，我一点也不担心
- I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.

260
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
你知道 ，这真好玩
You know, it's going to seem funny.

261
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,000
我不在乎男孩女孩，一点都不重要
I don't care whether it's a boy or a girl. Not that much.

262
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,500
我只要你一切都好，我是认真的
I just want you to be okay. It's pretty serious.

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
- 什么这么好笑
- Well, what's so funny?
- 我刚才在想
- I was just thinking.

264
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,900
这里你在准备完成些，非常困难的任务…
Here you're getting ready to go off on something really tough,

265
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
那里还在牵挂着我
and you're worrying about me.

266
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,700
如果我是你，肯定都吓死了
If I were in your spot, I'd be scared to death.

267
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,900
- 我觉得我就是这样的
- But I guess I am anyhow.
- 纯粹的例行公事，飞行员
- Purely routine stuff, flyer.

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,100
这是每个女孩子生中都要经的一两次
The kind of job every girl takes on once or twice in her life.

269
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,300
你为何不躺下？
Why don't you lie down?

270
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,300
你知道吗，爱伦？
You know, Ellen,

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,100
拥有你我已经心满意足
I'm kind of glad I got you.

272
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,000
我想这就是我刚才睡觉时想的
I guess that's what I was thinking about in my sleep.

273
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
快把我吓住了
It almost frightened me.

274
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,900
就好像我在想，如果我们没有相遇会怎样
It seemed that I was thinking, "What if I'd never met him?"

275
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
有一点是…
Well, for one thing

276
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900
你不会遍行全国…
you wouldn't be traipsing around the country

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
从一个空军基地到另一个努力地找我
from one airfield to another trying to catch up with me.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
还有就是…
And for another,

279
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
你不会在战争之际怀上了一个孩子
you wouldn't be having a baby right in the middle of a war.

280
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
不是，不是那样
3Oh, no, it wasn't that.

281
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,200
我在想如果我没有遇见你…
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,

282
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,100
我的生命中便没有人能像你一样和我如此亲近
I'd never have felt really close to anybody, never in my whole life.

283
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,300
结婚六月，相聚不到两周
Married six months and together less than two weeks.

284
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,900
这不是我说的亲近
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.

285
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,300
特德，你不觉得就是这样吗？
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.

286
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,300
两人远在天边，却心有所属…
If people can be close when they're far away from each other,

287
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,900
那才是应该有的
well, that's what it should be.

288
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
是是，我也这么想
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,300
抱紧我
Cuddle me.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
我想起了上个圣诞节
I was thinking about last Christmas.

291
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,200
在波特兰汽车旅馆立的那棵圣诞树
The tree we set up in that Portland auto court.

292
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,800
- 那间屋子不是很小吗？
- Wasn't it an awful little room?
- 是啊
- Yeah.

293
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
我们在准备圣诞晚餐
And the Christmas dinner we were planning on.

294
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,300
然后你把煤气用光了
And then you ran out of gas and landed in the mud up in lllwaco,

295
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,300
我再见你已是圣诞节之后了
Christmas Eve and Christmas were all over before I saw you again.

296
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,500
对，真的很难熬，但无论如何我都挺过来了
Yeah, that was tough. But I got a scarf out of it, anyhow.

297
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,200
这并不和我们的计划一致
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.

298
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,500
这是我们的第一个圣诞节,在一个遥远地地方
It was our first Christmas, and somewhere way off,

299
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,300
什么地方不重要
it didn't matter where,

300
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,200
只要我有了你，特德,这是我一生中最美好的一个圣涎
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was the nicest Christmas of my life.

301
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,900
爱伦，你今生注定会嫁给一个飞行员的从我看见你的第一眼起就这样想了
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen. I knew that the minute I first saw you.

302
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
事实上，这就是我嫁给你的理由
As a matter of fact that's why I married you.

303
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,500
- 我想对你说句告白
- You know, I've got a confession to make.
- 什么？
- What?

304
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,700
事实是，不是你娶了我,是我嫁给了你
The truth is, you didn't marry me. I married you.

305
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,300
是吗？
Oh, you did, eh?

306
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
我在洛杉矾城市学院国书馆第一次看见你…
The first time I saw you in the library at LACC,

307
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,400
我就对自己说：噢，他会是我的
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me. "

308
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
从那时起
And from then on,

309
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,300
从那一个个美好的夜晚,到离开那个爱荷达的小镇
clear up to the night we got the judge out of bed in that little Idaho town,

310
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,200
没有什么是偶然，特德
nothing was an accident, Ted.

311
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,600
都是我设计的
I planned it that way.

312
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,300
- 你觉得你很聪慧，是吗？
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
- 我自己也不确定
- I'm not sure whether I do or not.

313
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
你瞧，你并没有表现出十足的战斗力
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.

314
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
我想你也在考虑孩子
I suppose you figured out on that baby, too?

315
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,500
那是你根本不可能知道的,飞行员根本不知道
That's something you'll never know, flyer, you'll never know.

316
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,700
这几天小伙子们都熬得很晚啊
Boys are working late these nights.

317
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,900
是啊，你认为你们会离开多久？
Yes. Do you have any idea how long you'll be gone?

318
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,700
但只要任务结束,我就会去要求一个假期
But as soon as this job is over, I'm going to ask for a leave.


319
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,700
也许两到三周
Two, maybe three weeks.


320
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,000
我们可以度蜜月了,以前你不是总提起吗？
We'll have that honeymoon you're always talking about.

321
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,400
是的，就我们仨
Yes, just the three of us.

322
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,300
特德
Ted.

323
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,700
我真希望我不要长得又肥又丑,就像芝加哥肥婆一样
I do hope I don't get big and fat like that lady in Chicago.

324
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,600
我想要你们每个人都知道一些其他人的工作
I want each one of you to know something about the other man's job.

325
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,400
飞行员会担负飞机上的一切任务
The pilots will practice every job on the plane.

326
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,700
导航员要学学投弹手的工作
等等

327
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,200
以防你们当中有人被击中
Navigators will learn the work of bombardiers and so forth.

328
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,200
还有一件事
That's in case any of you get shot up.

329
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
不可避免的事,你们当中的某些飞机…
It is inevitable that some of your planes

330
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,500
会落入敌人手中
are going to fall into the hands of the enemy.

331
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,100
出于这样的考虑，我命令你们拆掉诺登投弹瞄准器
For this reason, I have ordered your Norden bombsights removed.

332
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,600
格里宁上校研发了一种简易瞄准器, 很适合你们的
Captain Greening has designed a sight which will be perfect for our job.

333
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,300
如果没什么问题了，那么就请约克上校来说说
If there are no questions, I'll ask Captain York to take over.

334
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,500
刚才我说过，我们去巴西巡逻
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.

335
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,200
那么为什么我们要拆掉诺登投弹瞄准器？
Yeah, but what about taking the Norden Bombsight out?

336
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,400
如果我们是去打击潜艇的话，根本不可能被敌机击中
There's no chance of falling into the hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs.

337
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,600
- 我从不那样认为
- I hadn't thought of that.
- 那都是杜利德的鬼话，是吧？
- That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?

338
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,400
以防你们当中有人被击中被灿烂的阳光击中
"Just in case any of us are shot up," a bundle of sunshine.

339
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,600
哦，那是特德，特德
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!

340
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,400
我们第一次结婚时乔治也这样嗡嗡从我身边开过
George used to buzz me when we were first married.

341
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,400
他再也不那样了，这是不允许的
He doesn't do it any more. They're not supposed to.

342
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,800
- 我怀疑他是否还爱我
- I wonder if he still loves me.
- 我可一点也不担心
- I wouldn't worry about that.

343
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,000
每次斯基有了一架新飞机就像爱上了它似的
Every time Ski gets a new ship he has a terrible love affair with it,

344
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,600
但他总会回到我身边的
but he always comes back to me,

345
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,200
尤其是当他饿得咕咕叫时
especially when he's hungry.

346
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,100
想想看他们会离开三个月
Just think, they'll be gone three months.

347
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,500
我想我会在国防工厂找到一份工作
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.

348
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,800
我真的不能忍受坐在一间小公寓，无尽等待，无所事事
I couldn't stand just sitting around in some little apartment and waiting.

349
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
你打算怎么办，爱伦？
What are you going to do, Ellen?

350
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,500
我想静下心来，因为我有孩子了
Oh, I'm just going to sit around and have a baby.

351
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,000
- 一个孩子
- A baby!
- 一个孩子
- A baby!

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
爱伦，为什么不告诉我们？
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?

353
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,900
我不知道，或许我一直没想好怎么说直到刚才
I don't know. I guess I just never thought of a way till now.

354
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,400
既然这样了，说说也不难啊
As it turns out, it wasn't hard to tell at all.

355
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,600
好吧，我也有了一个孩子了
Well, I'm going to have one, too.

356
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,100
- 是么
- What?
- 真的吗？
- Really?


357
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,300
珍，我觉得这样太棒了
Gee, I think it's wonderful.

358
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,000
乔治和我商量过的，但现在他走了…
George and I have talked about it, but, well, with him away and all,

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,100
- 我想我可能太害怕了
 I guess I'm just too scared.
- 我也害怕，但是…
- I thought I would be too, but...

360
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,900
特德和我猜想珍珠港事件后的每一件事…
Well, Ted and I figured that everything since Pearl Harbor

361
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
都如此顺利
has just been so much velvet.

362
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,200
我想如果他发生了什么事…
And then I guessed that if anything should happen to him,

363
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
我知道不会发生的
only I know nothing will,

364
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,600
我就会把小孩生下来，这就是特德仍然活着的希望
I'd have the baby, and that would be a little bit of Ted still living.

365
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,500
我有时想知道，等一切都结束了，我们会怎样
I sometimes wonder how we'll feel when it's all over.

366
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,000
试想，在某个地方安顿下来找一件小房子…
Just think, being able to settle down in a little house somewhere

367
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
抚养你们的小孩，无忧无虑
and raise your children and never be in doubt about anything.

368
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,100
我对现在的生活…
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts

369
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,400
倒想打一个问号.
that we have right now.

370
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,500
比如，他会回来吃晚饭吗？
For example, will he or will he not be home for dinner?

371
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
我们将要进行本次训练中最机密的一部分
We're about to enter the most secret part of our training.

372
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,800
机场周边都部署了巡逻，所以没人能打扰你们
This field is patrolled on all sides so no one can disturb you at your work.

373
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,100
先生们，这是米勒海军上尉
Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.

374
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,400
他将指示你们的起飞
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

375
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,200
除了正常的B-25在1500英尺内以90英里的时速起飞…
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

376
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,700
他还会教你们…
he's going to show you how to do it

377
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,900
全负荷炸弹和汽油时，在500英尺内以50英里的时速起飞
with a full load of bombs and gas in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

378
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,100
你们将尝试短距离起飞
You will attempt no short takeoffs

379
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,100
从埃格林空军基地，大家都可以看到
from Eglin Field, where people can see you.

380
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,000
米勒海军上尉还会给你们一些海军礼仪讲座
Lieutenant Miller will also give you a few short talks on naval etiquette.

381
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
如果我说的这些让你们现在觉察到了有关你们的目的地…
Now, if this gives you any hints as to your destination

382
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,000
和此次任务的蛛丝马迹…
or as to what kind of work you're going to do,

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,700
不要在下面议论
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

384
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
接下来的时间我要交给米勒海军上尉
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

385
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,200
先生们
Gentlemen,

386
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,700
这些旗子距离起点有…
those flags out there are at 

387
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,500
100、200、300、400和500英尺远
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet from the starting line.

388
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,000
训练场中间的这些线是引导你们起飞的
The line down the center of the field is to guide you in your takeoff.

389
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,900
你们的任务不允许有任何的背离
The kind of work you're going to do won't permit any deviations.

390
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,400
现在记住，在你松开刹车之前，要把动力推到最大
Now, the whole idea is to get up full power before you release your brakes.

391
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,600
然后开始以最大转率加压
Then start, at maximum r. p. m., manifold pressure

392
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,900
让机翼侧翼立起来
and with your wing flaps all the way down.

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
你们要加快发动机转率，直到你认为它快要燃烧起来为止
You'll have to rev your motors until you think they're going to burn up.

394
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,700
然后如果它们向右倾斜
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

395
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
声音和感觉比指令更重要
and that's a matter of sound and feel more than instruments,

396
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
放开刹车去见上帝吧
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

397
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,500
我不想你们第一次都去尝试这样
I don't expect any of you to do it the first time.

398
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
- 格雷
- Gray.
- 是，长官
- Yes, sir.

399
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
你和门奇是不是想第一个试试
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

400
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
剩下的人待在地面评判你们的表现，观测一下风速
The rest of us will stay on the ground, mark your takeoff and check the wind.

401
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
是，长官
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,200
我觉得最开始我们可以从观看、试飞中学到…
I think at first we can learn as much by watching trial runs

403
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
和实际飞行一样多的东西
as by actually flying the ships.

404
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,300
那么我们就在这里排好队，看看他们怎么表现
So let's all line up over here and see how he does.

405
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,000
- 地表风速怎样，斯基？
- What kind of surface wind, Ski?
- 每小时8英里
- Eight miles an hour.

406
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
他没有把引擎转速提升到足够快
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.

407
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
劳森，你接着去
Lawson, you go next.

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
记住，我们的目的是
Now remember, for our purposes,

409
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
如果你把你的一个轮子飞离地面，就足够好了
if you get your wheels a foot off the ground, that's good enough.

410
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
不需要太高，但一定要让轮子离开地面
You don't need height, but you've got to get your wheels off

411
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
但不要碰到旗子
before you hit the last flag.

412
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,000
等一会儿我们会尝试，在450英尺内收回轮子
A little later we'll try retracting the wheels at around 450 feet

413
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,400
全靠你们的发动机支撑
and relying on your motors to float the ship.

414
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,100
- 但不要那样做
- Don't try that just yet, though.
- 好的，长官
- Right, sir.

415
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,500
抓住控制杆用力拉，直到你有了坚定的信心了
Now, grab the column and pull her until you feel the inside of your backbone.

416
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,900
是，长官
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,600
你驾驶过B-25在500英尺内起飞吗？长官
Did you ever take off a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?

418
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,600
没有，但是你们可以别担心
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,000
看看劳森
Watch Lawson there.

420
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,200
你们至少得把发动机转速提到那样高，甚至更高
You'll have to rev your motors at least that high and maybe higher.

421
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,500
大约7oo英尺，他烧掉了他的尾撬，他没有来得及收起轮子
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid. Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

422
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,100
嘿兄弟，刚才的起飞真是虚惊一场啊
Brother, that takeoff was strictly on the cob.

423
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,900
你的飞机真像一只撕碎的鸭子
That airplane of yours looked exactly like a ruptured duck.

424
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
你觉得它怎么样？
How do you like this guy?

425
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,900
他起飞就像一个年迈的女士，顶着狂风行行走
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind,


426
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
终于鼓起勇气，试试真正的飞机了
and then he's got the nerve to talk about a real ship.

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
你真走运没有在一个泥泞的机场，不然你还会在这儿
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field, or you'd still be there.

428
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,400
我一点都不担心那个，你和格雷确实在忸怩作态
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey you and Gray are pushing around the sky.

429
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,400
- 撕裂的“鸭子”一切安好
- The ruptured duck will get along okay.
- 我被侮辱了，走吧，兄弟们
- Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,100
不会修很长时间的，先生
That won't take long to fix, sir.

431
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,600
撕裂的“鸭子”
Ruptured duck.

432
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
特德
Ted

433
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,200
如果是个女孩，琳达这个名字怎么样？
Don't you think Linda's a good name, if it's a girl?

434
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
哦，好，好，很好
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.

435
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,500
不，也许是尼古拉，尼古拉
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?

436
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,700
听起来很悦耳，是吧？
That has a nice sound, don't you think?

437
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,200
什么？对对
What's that? Oh, yes.

438
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,700
亲爱的，我们不要着急，现在就决定吧
Look, honey, we don't have to decide that right now, do we?

439
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,900
不用
No.

440
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,700
特德
Ted.

441
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,300
他伤得不重吧？
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?

442
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,000
- 谁？
- Who?
- 约翰尼.亚当斯
- Johnny Adams.

443
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,900
- 你怎么知道约翰尼的？
- How'd you hear about Johnny?
- 都传开了
- Those things get around.

444
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,700
- 他没有吧？
- He wasn't hurt, was he?
- 当然没有
- Of course not.

445
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,600
我不知道是怎么发生的
I don't know how those things get started.

446
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,400
每个在这个基地打听出来的消息，总要被吹捧一番
Every time a guy does a noseover on this field, it's a crack-up.

447
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,700
特德
Ted

448
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,300
你晚饭后就一直在忙来，我们出去走走
You've been working ever since dinner. Come on, let's get some air.

449
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,100
不错
It's a deal.

450
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,000
真美
Nice.

451
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,300
很抱歉，我们不能有更多的时间在一起，艾伦
I'm sorry we haven't had more time together, Ellen.

452
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,300
我们现在的时间很少,但以后都是我们的
We can spare a little. We've got all the rest of our lives.

453
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,300
对
That's right

454
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,700
什么花开了，好香啊，是吧？
Something blooming? It smells good, doesn't it?

455
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,500
- 特德
- Ted.
- 什么？
- What?

456
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,700
求你了，不要胡思乱想
Please, don't worry about anything.

457
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,000
我没有担心我只是在工作，仅此而己
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.

458
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,700
你知道，这次的任务非常重要
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.

459
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,400
你不是在担心你的任务，你担心因为你有一个妻子
You're not worried about the deal. You're worried because you've got a wife.

460
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,300
那是错的，特德
And that's wrong, Ted.

461
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,300
鲍勃格雷没有来吓唬你吧？
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been trying to scare you, has he?

462
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
- 当然没有
- Of course not.
- 那就好
- Okay.

463
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
因为没什么好担心的，没什么
Because there's nothing to worry about, nothing.

464
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,100
傻瓜，我就装作不知道
Silly, as if I didn't know that.

465
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,900
还有，如果发生了什么你会得到政府保险的全部
Besides, if anything did happen, you've got all that government insurance,

466
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,400
这样我就能照顾你和孩子很长一段时间了
that'll take care of you and the baby for a long while.

467
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,500
天哪，我在说什么无论如何也不会发生什么的
Oh, what am I talking about? Nothing's going to happen anyhow.

468
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,600
特德，看着我
Ted, look at me.

469
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,200
孩子和我不需要任何东西，除了你
That baby and I, we won't ever need anything but you.

470
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,700
我们谁都不准害怕，特德
We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted.

471
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,200
因为我们的孩子是我坚信你会回来的理由
Because the baby, the baby's why I know you're coming back to us.

472
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,900
这次我们做好一点，不然就再也听不到这样的声音了
We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll never let us hear the last of it.

473
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
好
Yeah.

474
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
- 听到那些引擎了吗？
- Hear those engines?
- 就像音乐一样
- Like music.

475
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,200
来吧，你们这些有前途的巴土司机
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.

476
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,200
十个星期以来的一个狂欢夜，来吧
It's been 10 weeks work and one night's fun. Let's go.

477
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,700
- 我把侧翼立起来了，兄弟们
- I got my flaps up, brother.
- 燃烧吧，勇敢者们
- Heat it up there, Smitty boy.

478
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,500
蒸汽的丝丝声你们要去哪？没有人拦你
Steam and sizzle. Where you're going, no one's gonna hold you tight.

479
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,600
嗨，多克，知道怎么跳舞吗？
Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance?

480
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,600
当别人拿走你的高射炮时
When they start picking flak out of your feet,

481
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,500
你应该庆幸它会得到更好的利用
you'll wish you'd put them to better use.

482
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,200
我是医生，不是爵士舞迷，肖特
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.

483
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,200
- 嗨，这是在做什么？
- Hey, what gives?
- 肖特组织的的派对
- Shorty's throwing a party.

484
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,400
派对？为什么？
A party? What for

485
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,700
有人说他是在庆祝得州宪法日
Somebody said he's celebrating Texas Constitution Day.

486
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,300
- 德州宪法日？
- Texas Constitution Day?
- 那么我也得试一下
- Say, I'm gonna sample this.

487
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:02,700
找个女孩吧，劳森
Grab your gal, Lawson.

488
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,600
不知道今天是山姆.休斯敦的生日吗？
Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday?

489
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
山姆.休斯敦
Sam Houston?

490
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,700
一个从未到过德州的人，门奇经常说起
For a guy that never saw Texas, that Manch is really sold.

491
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,500
- 你好，劳森
- Hi, Lawson.
- 你好啊，怎么想起这么放荡的？
- Hi. How did this riot get started?

492
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,000
今天是德州加入联邦纪念日
It's Texas Admission Day.

493
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,200
这不是放荡，先生，这是一场已然的战争
And that ain't no riot, mister, that's a full-fledged war.

494
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,700
- 看见艾伦了吗？
- Seen Ellen?
- 我谁都看见过的
- I've seen everybody.

495
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,800
- 你好，飞行员，
- Hello, flyer.
- 和我跳支舞吗
- My dance?

496
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,000
当然啊，我的心上人
All of them, my boy.

497
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,300
此刻起的每一只舞，直至最后
Every dance from now on out, including the last one.

498
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,000
我爱你，斯基
And I love you, Ski. 
我爱你，我爱你，我爱你
I love you, I love you, I love you.

499
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,800
这真搞笑劳森以前居然和一架德州飞机…
You know, it's a funny thing. That Lawson used to be about as graceful

500
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,100
一样高雅，快瞧他.
as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.

501
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
也许是那个女孩的缘故
Maybe the girl's got something to do with it.

502
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,900
你说上次，克勒文…
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.

503
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
有些事我打算告诉你更多
You know, there's something I mean to tell you more often,

504
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,700
- 但我一直没找到机会
- but I never seem to get the chance.
- 什么事？
- What is it?

505
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,300
只是我爱你
Just that I love you.


506
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,100
我今天收到了你母亲的一封信忘了告诉你
I got a letter from your mother this morning. Forgot to tell you.

507
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,700
她说你要自己照顾好自己
She said to take good care of you.

508
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,000
- 那我怎么样
- How am I doing?
- 比母亲曾经梦想的好
- Better than mother ever dreamed of.

509
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,500
好了，好了
Here. Here.

510
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,400
笑一笑，唱啊
Now smile and sing.

511
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,400
特德
Ted.

512
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,000
电话响了
Telephone's ringing.

513
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,900
- 电话，特德
- Telephone, Ted.
- 好的
- Oh, sure.

514
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,000
是吗，现在？好的
Yeah? Right now? Okay.

515
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,200
好
Okay.


516
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,700
行
Okay.


517
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,200
什么事？
What was it?

518
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,100
是一次夜间召集，但这是一个美妙的夜晚
Oh, just another night call. But what a night.

519
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
几点了？
What time is it?

521
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,300
3:10

522
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,200
- 心里难受吗？
- Hung-over maybe a little?
- 没什么，只是头痛病
- Oh, just a headache.

523
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,000
- 我不大适应派对的气氛
- I'm not used to party life.
- 可怜的宝贝
- Poor baby.

524
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,200
你应该睡觉了，我早饭前赶回来
You go to sleep. I'll be back by breakfast time.

525
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,700
我很困了，晚安，亲爱的
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.

526
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,200
或者说早安
Or rather, good morning.

527
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,700
如果我得到一个假期我要整整睡上六天
Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm going to sleep for six days solid.

528
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
不知道又是什么
I wonder what this is.

529
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,300
各位，你们的飞机检修好了，加满油了，准备起飞
Well, men, your ships are all serviced, gassed, and ready to go.

530
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,900
你们将轮流起飞
You will take off in shifts,

531
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,900
一批45分钟
the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.

532
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,900
约克上校会给你们准飞的指示
Captain York will give you your clearances.

533
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,100
有一件事必须清楚
Now there's one thing that must be thoroughly understood.

534
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
今早起飞后
After you take off this morning,


535
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,000
你们不允许见到任何人、和任何人说话打电话
甚至是你们的妻子
you are to see no one, speak to no one, telephone no one, not even your wife.

536
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,300
没有例外
There are no exceptions.

537
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,000
继续你们到达目的地的油耗测试
Continue your gas consumption tests to your destination.

538
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,900
你们的任务要求低空飞行
Now, the work you will be asked to do will require a little low altitude flying,

539
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,100
所以超低空飞行是完全可以的
so hedge-hopping on this trip is perfectly okay.

540
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
记住，牛仔们总是戴高帽子
Only bear in mind that cowboys wear pretty tall hats,

541
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
所以小心一点，就这样
so watch your step, men. That's all.

542
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,400
我想你们已经为你们自愿参加的任务作好了准备
I think you're very well prepared for what you volunteered to do

543
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,600
我要感谢你们辛勤而出色的表现
and I want to thank you for a lot of good hard work.

544
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,600
几天后我们再见，祝你们好运
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.

545
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,300
我想找个机会和艾伦说再见
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.

546
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
你会有的
Yeah, you will.

547
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,900
你们的目的地是阿拉梅达空军基地
Your destination is Alameda field.

548
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,700
走南方航线在圣安东尼奥补给然后前进
Take the southern route, refuel at San Antonio and march.

549
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,400
点到名后就可以开始了。第一个，霍尔斯通
As your names are called you can start. First flight, Holstrom,

550
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,000
琼斯 劳森，第二个
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...
551
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,100
- 特德
- Ted.
- 好了，宝贝，我们要出发了
- Well, this is it, honey. We're off.

552
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,300
- 什么时候？
- How soon?
- 只有时间收收东西了
- Just got time to pack.

553
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
我的B-4包在哪里？
Where's my B-4 bag?

554
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,300
- 在壁橱里，我去拿
- In the closet. I'll get it.
- Good.
- 好的

555
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,200
袜子、衬衣
Socks, shirts.

556
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,200
- 我的领带也在壁橱？
- My ties in the closet?
- 是的，我去拿
- Yes, I have them.

557
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,400
好的
Good.

558
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,000
哇，不要光着脚走进去，我打碎了个杯子
Wow! Don't go in there in your bare feet, I broke a glass.

559
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,400
好的
All right.

560
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,100
- 你忘了你的牙刷
- You forgot your toothbrush.
- 哦，见鬼
- Oh, doggone it.

561
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,500
- 都收好了吗？
- We got everything?
- 差不多了
- I think so.

562
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,700
好样的
Swell.

563
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,100
好的，做一个好女孩，照顾好孩子
Well, be a good girl and take good care of that baby.

564
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,100
- 我会的，特德
- I will, Ted.
- 也照顾好你自己
- Yourself, too.

565
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,000
特德，你走后的每一天，我都会给你写一封信
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you a letter every day you're gone,

566
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,900
我知道他们不会送达，我也不会寄出的
I know they won't deliver them. I won't even mail them.

567
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,300
但我还是要写这样我们就能保持联系了
But I'm going to write just the same.That way, we'll kind of be in touch.

568
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,400
我们就能感觉到彼此的呼吸
That way, we'll feel close.

569
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,300
再见
Goodbye.

570
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,900
再见，飞行员
Bye, flyer.

571
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,400
告诉我甜心，为什么你这么可爱？
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?

572
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,900
我找到了一个如此帅气的小伙子我必须得这样啊
I had to be if I was gonna get such a good looking fellow.

573
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,400
我会回来的
I'll be back.

574
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,300
嘿，海湾大桥正从我们的右侧离开
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.

575
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,000
嘿，海湾大桥正从我们的右侧离开
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.

576
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
海湾大桥，从它下面飞过怎样？
The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it?

577
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,000
- 为什么？
- For why?
- 那样的话我可以照些照片
- Well, so I can get some pictures.

578
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
从下往上拍摄这些超级建筑
You know, shooting up at the superstructure.

579
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
- 来吧，劳森
- Come on, Lawson.
- 不想吗？
- Do you want to?

580
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,400
- 好的，听你的，如果我可以让他高兴  
- Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy.
- Thanks.
- 谢谢

581
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,200
希望那个跨度里没有缆绳
I hope there are no cables hanging under that span.

582
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,700
我们上吧
Here we go.

583
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
让我们轮流来一次，我忘了放胶卷了
Let's take a turn and go it again. I forgot to put film in.

584
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,300
我们要去基地别忘了
We're due at the field. Forget it.

585
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,200
我再也不想试了
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.

586
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,500
嘿，快看
Hey, look.

587
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,000
麦克卢尔，看下面
McClure, take a look down there.

588
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,200
- 是航空母舰
- It's a carrier.
- 是啊，你看他的甲板
- Yeah. And look at her deck.

589
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,500
B-25的，神圣烟雾就是它了
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.

590
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,700
有点小，是吧？
Kind of small, isn't she?

591
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,200
- 飞行员呼叫投弹手
- Pilot to bombardier. Pilot
- 飞行员呼叫炮手
- to gunner. Pilot to gunner.

592
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,100
撒切尔、撒切尔
Thatcher. Thatcher.

593
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,200
又断了
It's dead again.

594
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,600
到达以后，我们最后给杜利德报告一下
We'd better report it to Doolittle when we get in.

595
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:02,000
对，还有左引擎对你来说还那样讨厌吗？
Yeah, that left engine along with it. Still seem a little rough to you?

596
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,400
我不想说了
I can't tell anymore.

597
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,000
- 你们的飞机没事吧？
- Is everything okay on your ship?
- 什么？没事没事，长官
- Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.

598
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,600
出租车已经在航母码头了，他们会照顾好你们的
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's wharf. They'll take care of you there.

599
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,100
好的，长官
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,500
他们也不等人家下车
They don't even wait until a fellow gets out.


601
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,900
- 所有的海军都是这样自以为是
- All Navy guys are cocky.
- 米勒就是海军
- Miller's a Navy guy.

602
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,100
米勒其实不是海军，他是飞行员
Well, Miller isn't exactly Navy. He's a pilot.

603
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,900
喂，飞行员
Hey, Spike.

604
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,300
- 飞行员
- Spike.
- 飞行员 什么事？
- Spike, what's the matter?

605
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
我在抱怨我的燃油泵
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump

606
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,100
杜利德叫我把它送到飞机修理棚去
and Doolittle told me to take her to the hangar.

607
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,700
你不去？
Well, then you're not going?

608
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,700
不去，其实飞机没什么毛病
No, and there's nothing really wrong with that plane.

609
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,600
- 这是我们中队最好的飞机
- It's the best ship in the squad.
- 兄弟，别大意
- Boy, that's rough.

610
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
正准备告诉他用我们的对讲机
And I nearly told him about our interphone.

611
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
你真是个无可救药的人
You would've been a cooked goose.

612
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,300
我也觉得我去看看那些海军
I think, sir, I'll go and watch those Navy guys.

613
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,000
- 他们会摔坏的
- They might bang her up or something.
- 想得不错
- That's a good idea.

614
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,500
你觉得呢？
How do you like that?

615
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,500
他们肯定会把“鸭子”弄坏
They're going to break the Duck's back sure.

616
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,200
我们怎么从那些海军手里弄到离合器
How did we get in the clutches of these Navy guys anyhow?

617
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,200
- 你们看，这真是一艘大船
- Boy, that's an awful big ship.
- 是的，去看看
- Yeah, let's take a look at her.

618
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,100
- 再见，飞行员
- So long, Spike.
- 再见，飞行员
- So long, Spike.

619
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,900
- 再见，飞行员
- Be seeing you, Spike.
- 再见，伙计们
- Goodbye, fellows.

620
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,900
劳森中尉，报到，长官
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.

621
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,500
- 伯廷勒，把劳森中尉带到…
- Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to...
- 306，长官
- 306, sir.

622
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,400
- 306
- 这边走，长官
- This way, sir.

623
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,100
待会见
See you guys later.

624
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
- 麦克卢尔中尉，报到，长官
- Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.
- 这些是你的住处，长官
- These are your quarters, sir.

625
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
这是你们的住处，长官
These are your quarters, sir.

626
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,600
怀特和费尔顿先生正在上岸假期中
Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave.

627
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,000
谢谢
Thank you.

628
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,500
你确定能找到回到甲板的路吗，长官？
Are you sure you'll be able to find your way back up to the deck, sir?


629
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,300
哦，是的，谢谢
Oh, sure. Thanks.

630
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,400
你在做什么？
What are you doing down here?

631
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,600
随便逛逛，你在做什么呢？
Oh, just looking around. What are you doing here?

632
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,500
随便逛逛
Just looking around.

633
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,100
- 你也迷路了
- Are you lost too?
- 是吗？我就像一只被逮住的老鼠
- Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.

634
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,400
我已经走了几英里了
I've been walking for miles.

635
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,400
这是我见过的最大的船
This is the biggest cockeyed ship I've ever seen.

636
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
是啊，我希望甲板能有两倍这么大
Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big.

637
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,700
吸烟灯已灭，吸烟灯已灭
<i>The smoking lamp is out. The smoking lamp is out.</i>

638
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,200
长官，吸烟灯已灭，意思是船上禁止吸烟
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means no smoking anywhere on the ship.

639
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,900
- 好的
- Okay.
- 为什么？
- Why is that?

640
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,500
因为正在补给燃料，长官，他们会告诉我们什么时候结束
Because they're refueling, sir. They'll let us know when they're through.


641
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,100
你好
Hello.

642
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,000
哟！你们终于来了
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?

643
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,400
对，我们在看看这个浴盆
Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over.

644
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,900
- 你们住得怎样？
- How are your quarters?
- 很不错
- Perfect.

645
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,700
有两个铺位和帆布床
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.

646
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,300
帆布床，跟我来，兄弟们，我让你们看看真正的房间
A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm gonna show you real quarters.

647
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,600
我是说寝室
And I mean quarters.

648
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,500
帽子 帽子
Hats. Hats.

649
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,600
- 看，这是什么？
- Well, look at what's here.
- 我们有客人来了
- Well, we have guests.

650
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,900
为什么把大家从棚户租赁区赶到这儿？
What's the idea of bringing people up here from the tenement district?

651
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,600
这里被戏谑地叫做“旗舰舱”
This is jocularly known as the admiral's cabin.

652
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,000
你们的洗澡时间快到了
Looks like you guys are going to have to start bathing.

653
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,100
还没完呢，还有其他的，跟我走
This isn't all. There's something else. Follow me.

654
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,700
非常乐意
I'd be glad to.

655
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,400
请当心那些地毯
Careful of the rugs, please.

656
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,200
里面的东西，先生们，可以让你们大饱眼福
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something to really feast your peepers on.


657
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,100
晚饭后第一个回来的人才有机会看到
The first guy turns in after dinner gets this bed for the trip.

658
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,400
你知道是谁吗？进来
You know who that'll be. Enter.

659
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,900
哪来的又脏又恶心的…快滚蛋，你这个橡皮虫
What dirty, lowlife... Come out of there, you boll weevil!

660
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,700
好吧，那给我吃玉米让我快快长大
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.

661
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,700
这些渣滓是怎么进来的？
How did all this scum get in?

662
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,200
我是在一张海军帆布床
And me in an Army cot.

663
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,900
今晚结束你死定了
That's where he'll end up, before the night's over.

664
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,600
- 我们走
- Let's get out of here.
- 噢，上尉
- Oh, Lieutenant!

665
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,000
你们去吃晚饭时
When you guys go down to dinner,

666
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,500
能带给我一份半熟的烤牛肉三明治…
would you mind bringing back a roast beef sandwich, rare,

667
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,400
和一份橘子派吗，上尉？
and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.

668
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,800
- 现在你还觉得来这里不错吗？
- Well, are you still glad you came along?
- 当然，你不是吗？
- Sure. Aren't you

669
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,200
我的这回的任务感觉怪怪的
I've got a funny feeling about this job.

670
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,300
我觉得可能事情没有我们想象的那样有把握
I think maybe it isn't going to be as much of a cinch as we figured on.

671
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,800
我也这样想过
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

672
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
我的飞机在那里，我们去看看吧
Well, my ship's over there. I think I'll go take a look at it.

673
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,400
- 鸭子，在上面
- Well, the Duck's up ahead. 
- 明早见
- I'll see you in the morning.

674
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,300
- 晚安
- Goodnight.
- 晚安
- Goodnight.

675
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,300
是谁？
Who's that?

676
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,800
- 是你吗，撒切尔？
- That you, Thatcher?
- 是的，长官
- Oh, yes, sir

677
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,900
算了吧，撒切尔
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.

678
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
这些东西拴紧了吧？
Got her pretty well lashed down, haven't they?

679
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,400
是的，他们干得不
Yes, sir. They did a good job.

680
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,800
我有点担心它
I was kind of worried about her,

681
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,100
所以我想上去看看它
so I thought I'd better come up and have a look.

682
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,400
你寂寞吗？
You lonesome?

683
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,500
我想大家都有点，长官
I guess everybody is a little, sir.

684
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,200
不要让领导操心，戴维，你的住处还不错吧？
Don't bother with the sirs, Dave. Your quarters all right?

685
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,900
- 是的，很好
- Yeah. Fine.
- 伙食也很好，不是吗？
- Grub's good, too, isn't it?

686
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,700
很长时间都没吃到这么好了
The best I've had in a long time, sir.

687
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,200
当我们回家后有什么打算吗，撒切尔？
What are you going to do when we get back home, Thatcher?

688
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,100
我在比令斯有个女孩，长官，如果能回去我会和她结婚
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir. I'm going to marry her, if we get back.

689
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,500
我们会平安返回的
Oh, we'll get back all right.

690
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,100
你好
Oh, hello.

691
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,700
- 你好
- Hello.
- 你好
- Hello.

692
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,300
我本来想上来拍几张星星的，但雾太大了
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.

693
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
太多雾了，确实
Pretty foggy, all right.

694
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,900
- 你们在这儿做什么？
- What are you guys doing here?
- 就是想呼吸点新鲜空气
- Oh, just getting a little air.

695
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,300
- 是啊，下面太无聊了
- Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below.
- 的确如此
- Yeah, it sure is.

696
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,400
你们这些人还担心这个撕裂的鸭子，就像一群老处女一
样
You guys worry over the ruptured duck like a bunch of old maids.

697
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,300
我想睡觉了
Me, I'm going to bed.

698
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,400
- 晚安
- Goodnight.
- 晚安
- Goodnight.

699
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
晚安，特德
Goodnight, Ted.

700
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,500
空气不错，是吧？
Wonderful air, isn't it?

701
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,900
吸烟灯己亮，吸烟灯己亮
<i>The smoking lamp is lit. The smoking lamp is lit.</i>

702
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,800
- 怎么了？发生什么了？
- What's wrong? What happened?
- 吹的是各就各位号
- Just battle stations.

703
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,500
日落和日出的时候，这个大家伙总会给我们惹麻烦
Around sunup and sundown the pig boats give us a little trouble

704
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
所以我们总是静静等它
so we always lay for them.

705
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,500
这是吉格.怀特，这是巴德.费尔顿
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.

706
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,600
- 很高兴见到你
- Glad to see you.
- 很高兴见到你
- Glad to see you.

707
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,800
- 你好
- How are you?
- 待会见
- See you later.

708
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,700
- 我们是在航行中吗？
- Are we underway?
- 还有5个小时
- For the last five hours.

709
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,900
很高兴和你同住，旱鸭子
Glad to have you aboard, Army.

710
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,500
总部命令各战位备战
<i>General Quarters, man your battle stations.</i>

711
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,900
陆军人员，请准备你们的飞机
<i>Army personnel, man your planes.</i>

712
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,500
小子，你们唯一可以逃离这里的方式是找一个起重机
Boy, the only way you're going to get that thing off of here is with a crane.

713
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,600
也许是，但我也在想我们可以借助自己的力量起飞
Maybe so. But we kind of think we can take off on our own power.

714
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,100
嘿，他们打哪儿来？
Hey, where'd they come from?

715
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,000
他们是护卫舰
That's what's known as an escort.

716
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,000
晚上他们已经跟着我们了
They just slipped up on us during the night.

717
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,200
海军总爱秘密行事
The Navy likes to do things quietly.

718
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,400
好像就要有一场表演似的，是吧？
Looks like it's really going to be a show, doesn't it?

719
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,300
我今天真不想让我离开床单，那张床太舒服了
Boy, did I hate to part skin from sheet this morning. What a bed.

720
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,300
对了，这是肖特.门奇、吉格.怀特和巴德.费尔顿
Oh, this is Shorty Manch. Jig White and Bud Felton

721
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,600
- 您好
- Hello
- 嗨，你们好
- Hi y'all.

722
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,700
他们很幸运可以不在“船舰舱“里睡党
This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.

723
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,300
是啊，住得很棒，就是无所事事
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations, but nothing much to do.

724
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,200
我觉得至少应该来点纸牌或是其他什么游戏
I thought there'd at least be a poker game or something going on.

725
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,100
我想他们时不时会玩的
Oh, I guess they have them every once in a while.

726
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,100
“七趾皮特”呢？你们这儿玩吗？
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever play much of that around here?

727
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,700
什么“七趾皮特”？
What's Seven-Toed Pete?

728
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,800
这是一种七张牌的游戏
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

729
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,700
- 我有时间会教你们
- I'd be glad to teach it to you some time.
- 从未听说过
- Never heard of it.

730
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,700
注意
<i>Attention, Army personnel!</i>

731
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,200
陆军人员注意，在守卫室集合
<i>Attention, Army personnel! Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

732
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,900
全军注意，在守卫室集合
<i>Attention, Army personnel! Assemble in Ward Room.</i>
- 待会见，各位
- See you later, fellows. 

733
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,100
大家好，很荣幸见到大家，我们很快就会在一起了
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows.We'll certainly have to get together soon.

734
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,900
也许我们可以玩那个扑克游戏了
Maybe we can get up that little game of poker.

735
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,100
待会见
See you later.

736
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,300
我相信他很爱玩那个扑克游戏
You know, I believe that boy wants to play poker.

737
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,700
我在想他是不是上船前带足了钱的
I wonder if they got their pay before they came aboard.

738
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,700
请坐
As you were.

739
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,400
你们不是还有剩下的疑虑吗？
For the benefit of those who haven't already guessed,

740
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,700
我们正在前往日本
we're going straight to Japan.

741
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,300
海军会把我们送到距离日本本土400英里的地方
The Navy will take us within 400 miles of the Japanese mainland.


742
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,600
我们会袭击日本的东京、横滨
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

743
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,300
神户、大阪、名古屋
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

744
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,800
这将是一次夜间行动
It'll be a night job and

745
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,300
你们可以选择你们想去的地方
you will be given the opportunity of choosing the city you prefer.

746
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,200
现在的处境很困难
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

747
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,500
中国军队准备在日占领区开辟小规模战场
The Chinese have prepared small fields just outside of Japanese occupied territory

748
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,600
我们则在空袭后登陆
for us to land on after the raid.

749
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,300
他们会给我们补给然后我们飞往重庆
They'll gas us up and we'll take off for Chungking.

750
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,700
现在起我们将会处在敌人不断攻击的危险中
From now on we're in constant danger of enemy attack.

751
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,600
如果发生地面攻击
If there should be a surface attack,

752
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
站在你们的飞机旁，带着灭火器
stand by your planes with fire extinguishers

753
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,100
让海军去对付他们
and let the Navy handle it.

754
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,000
如果发生了空中攻击起飞飞向最近的陆地
If there should be an attack by air, take off and make for the nearest land.


755
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,600
海军会提供导航信息，两天一次
The Navy will give all navigators their bearings twice a day.

756
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,100
再有就是，我还要强调…
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...

757
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,200
如果有人觉得无法胜任此次任务完全可以自动请退
If any of you feel you're not up to this job, it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

758
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,300
我们有一些后备人员，他们可以填补你们的位置
We have a few spare men and I think we can fill your place.

759
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,100
约克上校会告诉你们用飞机来干什么
Get together with Captain York and find out what to do with your planes.

760
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,300
明天下午2:30我们再见
We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

761
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
还有问题吗？
Are there any questions?

762
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,700
上校，集合时可以抽烟吗？
Colonel, do you mind if we smoke during these assemblies?

763
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,700
如果海军不反对，我没有异议，还有什么吗？
I have no objection to that if the Navy hasn't. Anything else?

764
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
解散
Dismissed.

765
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,100
48、49、50

766
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,000
51、52、53、54

767
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,800
55、56…对不起，门奇
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.

768
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,100
- 只是简单活动一下
- Just getting a little exercise.
- 是吗？我可没有
- Yeah? Well, I wasn't.

769
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,700
我在划分这个巨大的甲板
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.

770
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
9…

771
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,000
全员注意，你们很想知道我们此次任务的情况
<i>Attention, all personnel. You have been wondering about the mission we are on.</i>

772
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,200
我想你们肯定知道
<i>I think you might like to know</i>

773
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,600
大黄蜂号正开赴日本准备轰炸
<i>that the Army personnel on the Hornet are going to bomb Japan.</i>


774
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,200
我们海军将要把他们送达离敌人最近的地方
<i>We of the Navy are going to take them in as close to the enemy as possible.</i>

775
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,100
这是我们大家的机会
<i>This is a chance for all of us</i>

776
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,300
给日本人一点颜色看看
<i>to give the Japs a dose of their own medicine.</i>

777
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,400
这是一场空海军表演
<i>It's an Army-Navy show.</i>

778
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,400
让我们真诚欢迎这些将士们
<i>Let's extend every courtesy to the Army men on the Hornet</i>

779
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,600
他们将执行这次的任务
<i>who are going to do the job.</i>

780
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,900
祝好运，多多杀敌
<i>Good luck, good hunting</i>

781
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,100
但愿上帝保佑我们这次行动
<i>and may God speed us on our mission.</i>

782
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,600
来点
Have some?

783
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,000
谢谢，伙计
Thanks, buddy.

784
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,100
从没听说过“七趾皮特”玩成这样已经很运气了
You're awfully lucky for guys who never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.

785
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,500
他们告诉我佛吉尼亚也很适合打猎
They tell me Virginia's a great hunting country, too.

786
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,400
是吗？对，我们来玩，小伙子们
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.

787
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,100
- 赌多少？
- What's the bet?
- 随便你，门奇
- It's up to you, Manch.

788
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,400
他们不是说佛吉尼亚是“总统之乡”吗？
Don't they call Virginia the Mother of Presidents?

789
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,000
对，我是说…赌5个吧
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.

790
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,600
跟10个
Up ten.

791
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,300
托马斯.杰佛逊住在那里吧？
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he?

792
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,500
我放弃

793
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,600
很多人都住那里
A lot of guys lived there.

794
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,700
你们确信没玩过“七趾皮特”吗？
Are you sure you never played Seven-Toed Pete before?

795
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,200
10个，你的门奇
Makes it ten to you, Manch.

796
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,900
你们那儿的十二指肠病得到控制了吗？
Have they finally gotten that hookworm situation under control down there?

797
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,700
佛吉尼亚从来没有十二指肠病
There never has been a case of hookworm in Virginia.

798
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,700
- 我是一个对对福
- I've got a small straight.
- 我是清一色
- Mine's seven to the jack.

799
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,000
我是清对
All pink.

800
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,200
我又输了，我想睡觉了
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.

801
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,400
- 有人赢了很多钱
- Somebody's won a lot of dough.
- 一点点
- A little.

802
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,700
- 你的牌不好，门奇
- You just had a run of bad cards, Manch.
- 是啊
- Yeah.

803
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,200
我们以后再来玩
What say we get together again pretty soon?

804
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,700
当然，回头见
Oh, sure. See you later.

805
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,400
门奇，你在佛吉尼亚没有什么书吧？
Say, you haven't got any books on Virginia, have you, Manch?

806
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,000
你们陆军都是一群鸽子，我真想你在海军
You Army guys are real pigeons. I wish you were in the Navy.

807
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,500
你去睡我的地方，劳森，我想睡你这儿，如果你不介意
You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll sleep here, if you don't mind.

808
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,600
- 这是什么主意？
- What's the idea?
- 那里有如羽毛般舒适柔软？
- That thing's as soft as a feather bed.

809
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,600
但我可睡不安稳
I never could sleep in it.

810
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,700
- 不赖啊
- Yeah. It's not bad
- 谢谢
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

811
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,200
兰德尔上尉会告诉我们―些关于航母起飞的事项
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell us something about a carrier takeoff.

812
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,600
兰德尔先生
Mr. Randall.

813
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,400
从你们上飞机开始，我开始负责
From the minute you're in your planes, I'm the man to watch.

814
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,100
当你前一个人准备滑行时请尽快关掉引擎
Have your engines turning over as soon as the man in front of you starts taxiing.

815
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,200
当我要你们加快转速时我会给你们这个标志
When I want you to rev up, I'll give you this.

816
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,700
现在，如果你们的引擎运作得对我来说不好的话
Now, if your engines don't sound right to me,

817
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,900
我会要你们加大引擎转速，时间比你们认为的要长一些
I may have to keep you revved up longer than you 

818
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,900
我会来听你们的引擎，然后告诉你什么时候是最佳时机
I can hear your engines and tell when they're missing better than you can.

819
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,200
当我要你开始滑行时，我会给你这个标志
When I want you to start taxiing, I'll give you this.

820
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,900
然后你们就位我会给你们最后一次
Now you're in position. I give you a final rev.

821
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,600
然后我挥下它，你们就起飞
And when I drop it, you're off.

822
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,000
我们会让你们直飞日本，还有一件事
We'll aim you straight for Japan. One more thing.

823
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
一旦我们列队起飞
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs,

824
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,500
就不会有延误
there can be no delays.

825
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,700
如果你们的飞机停了没有立即起飞
If your plane stalls, if it doesn't start immediately,

826
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:43,900
如果你们有任何种类的任何麻烦
if you have any trouble of any kind,

827
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,400
我们将没有时间去处理
we won't have time to do anything about it.

828
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,700
舰桥会按照命令催促你们离舰
The Navy crew has orders to push the ship overboard

829
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,000
给下一架飞机让路
and make way for the next one.

830
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,200
尤里卡中尉有城市和具体目标的详尽地图和照片
Lieutenant Jurika has detailed maps and pictures of cities and specified targets.

831
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,300
尤里卡先生在日本生活了很长的时间
Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan.

832
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,200
我想他可以给我们很多东西
I think it might be a good idea if he gave you some idea

833
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
关于我们要对付的那些人
of what kind of people you're going to run up against

834
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,200
以防你们被击落
in case you're forced down.

835
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,300
尤里卡先生
Mr. Jurika.

836
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,700
我是驻日海军助理随员
I was Assistant Naval Attaché at our embassy in Japan,

837
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,300
有很长一段时间了解东方各国的经历
long enough to learn a few things about the Orient.

838
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,900
我们应该怎么做，尤里卡先生？
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?

839
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,200
我们应该怎么和那些人相处？一旦我们掉在了日本
How should we conduct ourselves in case we are forced down over Japan?

840
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,400
我的建议是不要让自己掉在了日本
My advice is, see that you're not forced down over Japan.

841
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,900
我为你们设计的路线是从这里开始
The run I've got figured out for you starts here.

842
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,900
这些烟囱是鲜红的砖石做的，你们一定能找到
The smokestacks are bright red brick, and you can't miss them.

843
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,500
日本最大的冶炼厂之一
One of the largest smelters in Japan.

844
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,700
然后沿着海岸线每十秒投一次弹
Then, following the line of the bay and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

845
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,300
你们必须清除这个和这个
you should take out this and this.

846
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,400
一次性轰炸这两座机械工厂
Both of them are machine shops owned by brothers,

847
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,300
我忘了叫什么名字，但我记得我不喜欢它们
I forget their names but I remember I didn't like them.

848
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:01,100
然后在这里你们开始丢燃烧弹，你们是怎么列队的，劳森
Then on out here to drop your incendiary. How does this line up for you, Lawson?

849
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,100
好，你去投掷燃烧弹，克勒文
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

850
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,500
我觉得路线不错，希望你们也这样认为
The run seems all right for me if it's okay for you.

851
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,600
- 我们可以完成任务
- We can take them out.
- 很好
- Fine.

852
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,000
琼斯，你们有针对这种路线的训练吗？
Jones, have you got the course laid out for this run?

853
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,300
好，到这边来，小伙子
Yes. Over here, fellows.

854
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,300
你们从这里起飞，往东京的正西方行驶
Now you'll take off about here. You go due west to Tokyo

855
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,300
以最小巡行航速，大约50英尺高度
at minimum cruising speed, flying at about 50 feet.

856
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,600
到达海岸线，上升到1500英尺
When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500 feets

857
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,500
完成轰炸后下降，离开陆地
complete your bombing run, then down again and out to sea,

858
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,200
- 屋久岛南偏东南方向
- south by southeast to Yakushima.
- 我们能带上地图吗？
- Can we take the maps with us?

859
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,000
需要的都可以拿上,上面没有作任何标注
All you need. Be sure there are no marks on them though, 

860
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,400
因为如果你们被捕 可能会泄露你们从哪儿来
which might show the Japs where you came from in case you're captured.

861
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,900
另外我给第一架飞机加了4个燃烧弹
By the way, I'm taking off first with four incendiaries.

862
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
这样东京就能为你们美丽燃烧
That should light up Tokyo pretty well for you.

863
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,200
我们到了中国降落场会不会被日本占领了？
Suppose by the time we get to China, the Japs have taken over the landing field?

864
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,600
一旦被日本占领了
if the Japs have captured it.

865
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,600
你们到达机场时中国方面会给你们发送信号
The Chinese will arrange a signal for you when you get to the field

866
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,900
如果你们一直飞行，最后燃料用尽
If that's the case you've got to keep right on going until you've run out of gas

867
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,500
然后跳伞离机，然后把飞机毁掉
then bail out and destroy your planes.

868
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,600
是的
Yes.

869
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,500
东京上空的阻塞气球，部署上有些变化
There's just been a change in the disposition

870
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,200
这个气球和这个
This balloon and this one

871
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,500
今早被移到这里和这里
were moved this morning to here and here.

872
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,700
你知道，这些气球的变化把我弄晕了
You know, the changes in those balloons threw me.

873
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,100
就象一个整天在浴缸里汗流浃背的人一样
Just think, a bunch of guys sweating all day in a sub

874
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,000
沿着东京湾走来走去
down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us

875
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,500
晚上偷偷摸摸打听气球的位置
sneaking up at night to radio balloon positions.

876
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,300
只是让我听到任何人谈论海军
Just let me hear anybody talk about the Navy again.

877
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,900
他们很不错
Boy, they're good.

878
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,500
非常不错，扑克也打得不错
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.

879
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,900
你又在说笑
Oh, you're not kidding.

880
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,200
我盼望在重庆给艾伦什么礼物
I kind of figured on getting Ellen a present in Chungking, you know,

881
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,900
和服或者什么
a kimono or something.

882
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,100
但这些海军把我的钱赢光了
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.

883
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,000
信不信由你，我只剩14美元了
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.

884
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,300
我也只有8或者10美元能给你了
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.

885
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,800
哦！不，不，我也是想想而已
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking,

886
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,500
这里一包香烟卖60美分
cigarettes sell for 60 cents a carton on the boat here.

887
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,900
但在重庆我听说有人愿意出7美元
But in Chungking, I hear the boys will pay seven bucks.

888
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
是吗？
Yeah?

889
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,300
所以我准备在“鸭子”上装满棺材钉
So I figure I may loadthe duck with coffin nails.

890
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,100
这个主意不错
Hey, that's an idea.

891
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,000
- 今晚真不错
- It's a good night for subs.
- 是啊
- Yeah.

892
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,400
这真有意恩
You know, it's funny.

893
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,600
小时候，我总是梦想去船上看看
When I was a kid I used to dream about going someplace on a ship.

894
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,400
现在我在船上了
Well, here I am.

895
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,000
正开往日本
And out there is Japan.

896
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,500
我母亲曾经有一个日本园丁
My mother had a Jap gardener once.

897
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,300
他看起来很不错就是矮点
He seemed like a nice little guy.

898
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,900
你知道，我并不恨日本人
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.

899
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,600
是有点意思，我不喜欢他们但也不恨
It's a funny thing. I don't like them, but I don't hate them.

900
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,400
我想我也是，这种感觉很复杂
I guess I don't either.You get kind of mixed up.

901
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,500
是的
Yeah.

902
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,700
这很难琢磨，但毕竟我们来了
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.

903
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,000
我最想成为一个航空工程师
All I ever wanted to be was an aeronautical engineer.

904
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,000
我40岁参军因为我觉得这是最好的学习机会
I joined the Army in '40 because I figured it was the best way to learn.

905
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,800
我不仇恨任何人
I wasn't sore at anybody.

906
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,900
但突然你就要意识到你要把一吨多的烈性炸药
But here you suddenly realize you're going to drop

907
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,200
投放到世界上最大的城市之
a ton of high explosives on one of the biggest cities in the world.

908
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,200
你有点敏感吧？
You're not getting squeamish, are you?

909
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,500
不不，当然不是
Oh, no, of course not.

910
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,000
我并不掩饰我对杀害众多平民的厌恶
I don't pretend to like the idea of killing a bunch of people

911
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,900
但如果我不把炸弹丢在他们头上
but it's the case of drop a bomb on them

912
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:13,000
不久他们就会丢在艾伦头上
or pretty soon they'll be dropping one on Ellen.

913
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,200
对啊
Yeah, that's right.

914
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,700
我在想到底有多少人能最后挺过来
I wonder how many of us will pull through.

915
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,200
哦，他们估计一半
Oh, they figure about half.

916
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,400
- 每个人都认为自己是一半当中的一个
- And everybody thinks he'll be in that half.
- 对
- Yeah.

917
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,100
- 你什么时候结婚，鲍勃？
- When are you going to get married, Bob?
- 当我找到艾伦那样好的姑娘的时候
- Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.

918
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,700
这真好，你知道，就是我们四个
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.

919
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,700
一切都结束后，我会买一个小农场
You know, when this is over I'd like to get me a small ranch.

920
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,100
养上四、五十头牛什么的
Something that'd run about 40 or 50 head of cattle.

921
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,500
一口好井，一间好房，这是给孩子们的
A nice well and a house. It'd be wonderful for kids.

922
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,200
我对农场真的很感兴趣
I've always been kind of nuts about ranches myself.

923
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,800
你知道吗？在好年景，你可以自己丰衣足食
You know, in a decent year you can make real dough

924
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
可以吃得饱饱的而且还有40头牛啊
out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.

925
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,200
- 我们为什么不去干干那些
- Why don't we do something like that?
- 你去的话那我也去
- Well, I'm game if you are.

926
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,100
- 好的，就这么说定了
- Okay, it's a deal.
- 好
- Good.

927
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,200
当然，如果我们有80头牛的话我们就可以大干一场
Of course, now if we had 80 head of cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout.

928
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,200
- 是啊，我们自己产的肉
- Yeah, and our own meat too.
- 还有，牛奶、黄油、鸡蛋
- Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs,

929
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,900
所有的一切
the whole works.

930
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,500
一个有自己一隅的人
You know, a guy who's got himself a place,

931
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,900
他是不会忧虑什么的
he doesn't have to worry about anything.

932
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,000
- 在附近打猎
- And with a little hunting near.
- 哦，当然，那很容易
- Oh, sure, that's easy.

933
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,700
天哪，战争结束，我高兴得快疯了
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.

934
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,200
紧急情况时，就不会有集合
In the event of an emergency there will be no assembly.

935
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,400
没有最后指示，我们立即就起飞
No last minute instructions. We'll just take off.

936
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,400
离开“大黄蜂号”半小时内出现发动机故障
<i>If you should develop motor trouble within a half hour after leaving the Hornet,</i>

937
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,600
请飞回船舰，并在水面降落
fly back to the ship and land in the water.

938
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,400
海军会把你们捞出来
The Navy will try to fish you out.

939
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,300
如果是半小时后发生了什么问题，你就得带着继续前进
If trouble should develop after that time, you'll have to keep right on going.

940
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,700
因为那时候战舰就要向敌方开火了
Because by that time the fleet will have to fire on any craft overhead.

941
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,700
我不希望你们用完备用燃料罐后马上扔掉
I don't want you to throw out the extra cans of gas as you use them.

942
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,700
那样会给日本日留下追踪“大黄蜂号”的线索
<i>That would leave a perfect trail for the Japs to follow back to the Hornet.</i>

943
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,000
把罐子积攒起来，一次全部扔掉
Save the cans and throw them all out at one time.

944
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,500
现在，我再重申一下我前面说的
Now let me repeat something I've said previously.

945
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,400
你们负责轰炸指定的军事目标，除此之外别无它物
You are to bomb the military targets assigned to you and nothing else.

946
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,100
当然，在这样的任务过程中不可能不伤及平民
Of course, in an operation of this kind you cannot avoid killing civilians.

947
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,100
因为战争机器是被公民操纵的
Because war plants are manned by civilians.

948
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,500
如果你们有对这种必要的伤亡有任何道德情感
If any of you have any moral feelings about this necessary killing,

949
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,600
如果你把自己当作一个谋杀者的话
if you feel that you might think of yourself afterward as a murderer,

950
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,700
我希望你能离开，我们会找人代替你
I want you to drop out. We'll find someone to take your place.

951
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,800
我保证没有人能指责你的这种情感
And I promise you that no one will blame you for your feelings.

952
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,000
除非计划有变，否则我们明晚起飞
Barring any sudden switch in plans, we'll take off tomorrow night.

953
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,100
还有一件事
There's one thing more.

954
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,600
当我们在重庆相聚时我们会安排一场派对
When we meet in Chungking I'm going to throw you a party

955
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,500
这样你们也可以和你们的孙子们提起…
that you can tell your grandchildren about.

956
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:51,400
你们是好样的，和你们在一起我感到骄檄
You're a great bunch of guys. I'm proud to be associated with you.

957
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,000
祝你们好运
Good luck.

958
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,900
- 12条香烟
- 12 cartons of cigarettes.
- 12条
- 12 cartons?

959
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
陆军都发了什么了？
Say, what gives with the Army?

960
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,900
我从未卖过这么多的香烟
I've never sold so many cigarettes in my life.

961
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,800
- 我们是烟鬼
- We're chain smokers.
- 你是在吃烟，要什么牌的？
- You must eat them. What kind will it be?

962
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,000
随便吧
Oh, any kind.

963
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,600
- 你只是想要很多烟
- You just want lots of cigarettes.
- 你猜对了
- You hit it right on the head.

964
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,000
好吧
All right.

965
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,400
共7.20美元
That'll be $7.20.

966
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,800
我们的航母特遣部队已经被敌方水面舰队发现
<i>Now hear this. Our carrier task force has been sighted by enemy surface vessels.</i>

967
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,200
所有陆军飞行员准备好你们的飞机
<i>All Army pilots and crews, man your planes for immediate takeoff.</i>

968
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,200
不到3分钟我们就能看见日本人了
There goes a Jap just three minutes after we sighted her.

969
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,600
它有2分钟的时间告诉东京它看见了什么
Yeah. That means she had two minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw.

970
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,900
注意命令，赶紧装上炸弹
<i>Now hear this. Get all bombs loaded on the double.</i>

971
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,500
- 你们都准备好了吗？
- Are you all packed?
- 准备好5天了，长官
- Have been for five days, sir.

972
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
好的，看看其他人怎么对付“鸭子”的吧
Good. Better watch how those guys handle the Duck.

973
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,700
是的，长官
I will, sir.

974
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,300
不要告诉其他人小炮塔的事
And don't tell anybody about that bumped turret.

975
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,900
我不会的，长官
I won't, sir.

976
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,000
- 我们要走了
- Hey, we're off, aren't we?  
- 耶
- Yeah!

977
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,700
哦，快炸烂他
Oh, bomb me, daddy!

978
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,300
我想所有的东西都准备好了
I think I've got everything packed.

979
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,600
- 太好了，谢谢
- Swell, thanks.
- 很抱歉，没我们没有
- I'm sorry we couldn't have

980
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,100
准备一个好的天气给你们
picked out a little better weather for you.

981
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,000
- 我们会成功的，再会，费尔顿
- We'll make it. So long, Felton.
- 狠狠揍他们一拳让他们记住
- Give them a pasting they'll never forget.

982
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,000
我们会的，谢谢你们做的一切
We will. Look, thanks for everything.

983
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,300
你们海军，你很好，再会了
You guys in the Navy, well, you're okay. Be seeing you.

984
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,000
注意命令，到飞行甲板检查，发动引擎
<i>Now hear this. Clear the flight deck to start engines.</i>

985
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,900
嘿，找我的钱呢？
Hey, how about my change?

986
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,600
他们给了我们15罐燃料油而不是10罐
They're giving us fifteen extra cans instead of ten.

987
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,600
很好，至少现在起飞能让我们在白天到达东京
Good. At least getting off now will put us over Tokyo in daylight.

988
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,700
白天不用担心阻塞气球
Don't forget about the barrage balloons in daylight too.

989
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,100
下次你就会告诉我不用担心了
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good

990
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,600
因为白天你就可以照到照片了
because you can get better pictures in the daytime.

991
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,500
- 你没开玩笑吧？
- You're not kidding about that, either.
- 让我们再检查一下
- Let's give her a final check.

992
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,400
嘿，鲍勃
Hey, Bob.

993
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,000
- 什么？
- What?
- 你在前面吗？
- Are you up ahead?

994
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,200
四号场地
Fourth spot.

995
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,900
重庆见
See you in Chungking.

996
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,500
你说的，兄弟
You said it, brother.

997
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,000
- 他们怎么样，杜利德？
- How they doing?
- 随时都可以起飞
- Doolittle will be off any second.

998
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,500
然后是胡佛、霍尔斯通、格雷然后戴维.琼斯，我们第七个
Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray and Davey Jones, we're seventh.

999
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,700
7是幸运的数字
Seven's a lucky number.

1000
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:46,300
嘿，特德，把这个带上好吗？
Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey. Put these some place, will you?

1001
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,100
- 这是什么？
- What are they?
- 唱片
- Sizzle platters.

1002
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,100
我已经装了一个留声机了，但我们没有地方放唱片
I've got the phonograph in my ship. But I haven't got room for the records.

1003
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,400
我们重庆见，跳中国的摇摆舞
We'll meet in Chungking and cut a Chinese rug.

1004
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,000
好的，肖特
Okay, Shorty.

1005
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,000
- 收好它们，麦克卢尔
- Take care of these, will you, McClure?
- 好的
- Right.

1006
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,000
- 飞行员呼叫炮手
- Pilot to gunner.
- 炮手回复飞行员，请讲，长官
- Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.

1007
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,000
如果有机会注意看一眼小炮塔
<i>Take a look at the turret if you get a chance.</i>

1008
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,400
我一直在看，长官，但还是很乱
I've been working on that, sir. She's still jammed.

1009
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,100
如果需要就用辅助燃料
We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to.

1010
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,300
好的，长官
Right, sir.

1011
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,400
我们把自己弄得一团糟，是不是，劳森？
We've got ourselves in a fine jam, haven't we, Lawson?

1012
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
现在说这些时机真好啊
Well, this is a great time to think of that.

1013
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
不是，我是说提前起飞
Oh, no, I mean having to take off ahead of schedule.

1014
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,300
对不起，达文波特，我想我有点紧张了吧
Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport. I guess maybe I'm a little on edge.

1015
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,200
- 炸弹舱检查完了吗？
- Bomb bay clear?
- 炸弹舱检查完毕

1018
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,900
他成功了，他成功了
He made it. He made it.

1019
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,200
侧翼竖立
Get your flaps up.

1020
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,900
嘿
Hey!

1021
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,900
祝你们好运，小伙子们，剩下的都交给海军了
Good luck, fellows. Hand them a couple for the Navy.

1022
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
- 我们会的，米勒
- We sure will, Miller.
- 也感谢你
- And thanks to you.

1023
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
真希望我和你在一起。再见
Wish I were going with you. So long.

1024
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,100
- 再见
- So long.
- 再见
- So long.

1025
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,500
再见，小伙子们
Goodbye, boys.

1026
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,300
- 我们前面还有四架
- Four more ahead of us.
- 启动引擎
- Let's start the engines.

1027
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
走吧
Let's go.

1028
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,100
- 右边检查完了吗？
- Clear on right?
- 右边检查完了吗？

Clear on left?

1031
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,500
检查完毕
Clear on left.

1032
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,400
这些海军在催我们走
Those Navy guys are moving up to push us over.

1033
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,900
他们不可能把我们扔出去
They're not gonna toss this ship overboard.

1034
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,200
来呀宝贝，使把劲
Come on, baby. Give.

1035
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,300
使把劲，使把劲
Give. Give.

1036
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,500

1039
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,400
鲍勃我们走了
There goes Bob.

1040
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,700
我们前面还有两架
Two more ahead of us.

1041

检查燃料加压器
Check fuel booster.

1042
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
嘿，陆军，特德
Hey, Army. Ted!

1043
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,400
给我也带些
Give them for me.

1044
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,000
我们到重庆时，会告诉他们海军也干得不错
When we get to Chungking, we'll tell them it was a Navy show too.

1045
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,600
他们会发现你们一文不值，加油干
They'll know that when they see how broke you are. Good hunting.

1046
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,600
- 炸弹舱门关闭
- Bomb bay doors closed.
- 炸弹舱关闭

- Pilot to gunner. All set, Thatcher?

1048
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,800
- 机翼下垂
- Wing flaps down.
- 机翼下垂了
- Wing flaps coming down.

1049

霍尔马科走了
There goes Hallmark.

1050
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,200
我们要走了，伙计们和你们一起真好
We're taking off, fellows. Happy landings.

1051
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,400
嘿
Phew!

1052
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,700
耶
Yeah.

1053
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,900
双侧机翼竖立
Both the flaps up.

1054
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,000
我们没有把它们放下
We didn't even have them down.

1055
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,400
- 你觉得怎么样？
- How do you like that? 
- 我想想还忘了什么
- I wonder what else we forgot.

1056
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,700
咖啡、三明治、水，够了
Coffee, sandwiches, water, plenty.

1057
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,200
飞行员呼叫炮手，撒切尔
Pilot to gunner. Thatcher.

1058
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,100
炮手回复飞行员，请讲，长官
Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.


1059
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,100
- 你还好吧，撒切尔？
- You all right, Thatcher?
- 还好，长官
- Yes, sir.

1060
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,600
你最好开始用一下那些罐子了
You'd better get started on those cans.

1061
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,500
- 我们已经用掉了40加仑了
- We've burned over 40 gallons already.
- 好的，长官
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,700
各位，我们开始上路了
Well, we're on our way.

1063
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:59,100
如果有人走狗屎运了，一定不要放过
If anybody's carrying a rabbit's foot, hang on to it tight.

1064
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,400
我们的位置，麦克卢尔
What's our position, McClure?

1065
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,900
我估计离海岸还有1小时58分钟
I figure about an hour and 58 minutes from the coast.

1066
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
听见了吗，撒切尔？我们现在可以随时遇到敌机
Get that, Thatcher? We can expect their fighters any time  now.

1067
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,200
- 保持警惕
- Keep your eyes open.
- 时刻注意，长官
- Watching, sir.

1068
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,400
什么都看不见需要试一试这个炮塔吗？
There's nothing in sight. Could we try out this turret again?

1069
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,600
好，打开继电器开关
Okay. Relay switch on.

1070
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
运转正常，先生
It works all right, sir,

1071
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,900
但如果我们遇到麻烦备用动力不能维持多久
but that emergency power's not going to hold out long if we run into trouble.

1072
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,300
那我们就关掉它
Turning it off now.

1073
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,000
- 我们离第一批人有多远？
- Turning it off now.
- 大概一小时
- About an hour.

1074
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,200
那我们真的应该想想怎么应对麻烦
Then we really can get set for trouble.

1075
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,000
是的，但是不像后面那些人遇到的那样
Yeah, but nothing like what the guys behind us are going to run into.

1076
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,400
晚上执行任务我会感觉要好一些
I'd feel a lot better on a night job.

1077
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,600
你听见左侧发动机熄火了吗？
Did you hear that left engine miss?

1078
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,500
没有，象是有人在嬉笑
No, singing like a lark.

1079
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,700
我得听听声音
I must be hearing things.

1080
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,900
领航员呼叫飞行员
Navigator to pilot.

1081
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,200
飞行员回复领航员，请讲
Pilot to Navigator. Go ahead.

1082
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,900
我们应该不久就到达日本海岸
We ought to hit the Japanese coast any minute.

1083
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,700
快看
Look.

1084
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,900
- 看见那个旗子了吗？
- See that flag?

- Yeah.

1085
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,900
- 今天节省炸弹
- Saving bombs today.
- 他们在向我们挥舞示意
- They're waving at us.

1086
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,100
他们肯定疯了
Those guys must be nuts.

1087
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,000
直飞日本海岸
Japanese coast straight ahead.

1088
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,700
富士山
Fujiyama.

1089
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,400
我们现在可以丢点铅弹
We'll be catching buckshot any second now.

1090
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,200
零式
Zeros.

1091
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,800
- 飞行员呼叫…
- Pilot to...
- 我看见了，长官
- I saw them, sir.

1092
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,300
- 要我打开炮塔的电源吗？
- Shall I turn the power on for the turret?
- 不，等一下
- No, wait a minute.

1093
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,900
我不知道他们怎么了，长官，我想他们没有看见我们
I don't know what happened to them, sir. I guess they didn't see us.

1094
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,200
既然都来了，就好好看一下
There she is fellows. Take a good gander.

1095
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,800
当我们凯旋的时候
When we get back home, the folks will want to know what

1096
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,700
人们肯定会问我们东京怎么样
Tokyo used to look like.

1097
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,700
那肯定是戴维.琼斯的工作了
That must be Davey Jones giving them the works.

1098
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,100
飞行员呼叫投弹手，投弹舱开启
Pilot to bombardier，bomb bay doors open.


1099
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,100
- 我们到了，大红烟囱
- There we are, the big red smokestack.
- 飞行员呼叫投弹手

- 准备好了
- I'm on it.

1101
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,500
他们也来了
They've got our altitude.

1102
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,200
一个
One away.

01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,600
两个

三个

01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,300
四个

1106
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:13,100
- 三架战机出现在右上方
- Six fighters just above and to the right.
- 看见了吗，撒切尔？
- Have you got them, Thatcher?

1107
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,300
准备好了，长官
Ready for them, sir.

1108
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,000
他们为何不俯冲？
Why don't they dive?

1109
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,100
他们离开了
They're going away.

1110
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,700
我们不等他们回来了，我们自己离开这儿
We're not going to wait for them to come back. We're getting out of here.

1111
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,900
好吧，我想我们挺幸运的

真头痛

Yeah, and I hope the Japs don't get there first.

1118
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,500
消息怎么样，麦克卢尔？

01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,000
我们会照顾好每个人的
We'll take care of everybody.

1242
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,900
你不会把它锯掉吧，医生？
You won't have to take it off, will you, Doc?

1243
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,200
我们不希望，但谁也说不准
We hope not. One cannot tell.

1244
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,200
你们已经走了很久了，现在你必须休息
You've had a long journey. Now you must rest.

1245
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,400
我们有的就是一点消毒水和一些绷带
All we had at our Mission was a little antiseptic fluid and some bandages.

1246
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500
但我们已经叫信使去请求药物了
But we've sent out runners for supplies.

1247
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,700
有什么办法可以让我把消息送出去吗？
Is there any way I could get a message out?

1248
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,300
我想让我母亲知道我还好
I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay.

1249
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,400
整个地区都被日本人占领了
The whole region's swarming with Japanese.

1250
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,200
你们觉得合众国知道发生在我们身上的事吗？
Well, do you think they've heard back in the States what happened to us?

1251
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,800
我们一直在听短波他们都知道了空袭
We've been listening in on short wave. They know all about the raid,

1252
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:21,500
但显然，细节并没有被披露
but apparently they're keeping the details secret

1253
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,200
要等到你们剩下的人得救以后
until the rest of your men have been saved.

1254
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:24,300
你们找到其他人了吗？
Have they found any of the others?

1255
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,300
我得到消息说，有一队人成功脱险也快到这里了
We have word that one crew will be coming through here pretty soon now.

1256
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,100
我明白，他们中间有一个医生
I understand there's a doctor among them.

1257
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:32,600
肯定是史密斯中尉那一帮人，抱歉
Oh, that must be Lieutenant Smith's crew. Excuse me.

1258
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:37,200
史密斯中尉那一帮人被解救了，长官
Lieutenant Smith's crew has been rescued, sir.

1259
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,500
史密斯他们？
Smith's?

1260
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,200
他们发现了史密斯中尉和怀特医生他们正赶过来
They found Lieutenant Smith and Doc White and they're coming here.

1261
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:46,100
唐.史密斯的人那个医生和唐.史密斯一起飞行
Don Smith's crew. The Doc was flying with Don Smith.

1262
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,600
他们现在很快就要到了
They'll be here any minute now.

1263
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,700
真有意思，是吧？
It's funny, isn't it?

1264
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,700
我的意思是克勒文走的路线也很颠簸啊
I mean the way Clever's head just keeps rocking back and forth,

1265
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,000
很颠簸
back and forth.

1266
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,200
一定是有人救了克勒文
Somebody ought to help Clever.

1267
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,900
我觉得中国人真好
I think the Chinese are a swell bunch of people

1268
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,500
但我不敢说他们的音乐
but I can't say I go for their music.

1269
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,500
肖特.门奇听到一小段这个肯定会崩溃的
Shorty Manch would go all to pieces if he heard a little of this.

1270
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,600
对
Yeah.

1271
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
劳森怎样了？
How's Lawson?

1272
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:28,700
他的腿看着很糟糕，长官
Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir.

1273
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,000
陈医生觉得里面已经坏死了
Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in.

1274
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:42,000
好像是日本零式飞机
Looks like a Jap Zero.

1275
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,500
你们应该不管我，继续走下去
You guys ought to go on and leave me.

1276
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:15,000
我经常觉得我就要死掉了我听见他们说什么了
They think I'm passed out half the time and I hear what they say.

1277
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,000
日本人正在不断逼近，你们为什么不走？
The Japs are coming closer all the time. Why don't you guys go?

1278
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:21,300
我们不在这儿逗留是因为你，劳森
We're not sticking around here because of you, Lawson.

1279
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:24,500
- 我们都不能长途旅行
- None of us here are able to travel yet.
- 我在想
- I was just thinking.

1280
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:28,700
我想我和艾伦再也不能滑雪了
I guess Ellen and I aren't going to ski anymore.

1281
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,300
那太糟了
That's too bad.

1282
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,500
我会给她讲一些有意思的东西
I was going to teach her some fancy stuff.

1283
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:37,400
别那样说，你正在恢复健康
Now don't start talking like that. You're going to pull through all right.

1284
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:42,200
你觉得一个女孩会怎样？我是说艾伦和我都很喜欢滑雪
What do you think a girl would do? I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski.

1285
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:47,000
他们把我的脚锯掉，真有点搞笑，不是吗？
Be kind of funny if they cut my leg off, wouldn't it?

1286
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,800
你为什么不试看睡会儿觉
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

1287
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:51,400
是有点搞笑
Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right.

1288
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,900
你和一个有两只胳膊两条腿的人结了婚
You marry a guy, he's got two arms and two legs.

1289
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:59,000
然后他回来了，但什么都没有了
Then he comes back and he hasn't any.

1290
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,900
- 我是张医生
- I am Dr. Chung.
- 那些小伙子呢？
- Where are the boys?

1291
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:11,200
你好，老爹
How are you, Pop?

1292
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,400
路上还好吧？
Did you have a good trip?

1293
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:19,100
- 在这儿呢
- Here they are.
- 嘿，伙计们
- Hi, fellas.

1294
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,900
- 怎么样了？
- How are you?
- 你还好吧？
- How you doing?

1295
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,800
- 你好，军士
- Hello, Sarge.
- 见到你们真高兴
- It's good to see you.

1296
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:25,900
- 天啊，你们到底发生了什么？
- Holy Joe, what happened to you guys?
- 不是很严重
- Nothing serious.

1297
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,000
“鸭子”忘记凫水了
The Duck forgot to duck.

1298
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:29,900
是啊，麦克卢尔在尽力做好他的飞行
Yeah, McClure's been trying to do his own flying ever since.

1299
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,600
真像大屠杀的幸存者
This really looks like something left over from a massacre.

1300
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,500
你们看起来也不好啊
Well, you guys don't look so good yourselves.

1301
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:35,900
闻起来也是
You don't smell so good either.

1302
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:38,600
这不是我们的错，好好洗一次澡也无济于事
Well, there's nothing wrong with us that a good bath won't fix.

1303
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,800
- 我也想这么说
- I wish we could say the same for you.
- 这儿的伙食怎么样？
- How's the grub around here?

1304
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:45,600
我想吃上等的厚牛排和法国炸洋葱
I think I'd like a good thick steak, French fried onions

1305
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,200
还有烤土豆，多加点黄油
and a baked potato with plenty of butter

1306
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,500
再来三瓶酒…
and about three bottles of beer...

1307
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,200
你只有吃豆芽之类的东西
You'll take bean sprouts and like them.

1308
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,700
- 劳森和达文波特在哪儿？
- Say, where's Lawson and Davenport?
- 他们在楼上
- They're upstairs.

1309
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:00,000
- 劳森的状况很不好
- Lawson's in pretty bad shape.
- 你最好去看看他
- You better go up and see him.

1310
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,600
他很需要你，医生
He needs you bad, Doc.

1311
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:05,500
再次见到你们，真的感觉很好
Well, it's certainly good to see you fellows again.

1312
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,200
嘿，老爹，这里的炒杂烩菜怎么样
Hey, Pop, how's the chop suey around here?

1313
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,200
他不会说英语
He doesn't speak English.

1314
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,900
对不起，老爹
I'm sorry, Pop.

1315
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:28,000
肖特跳下来时，他带上了有两把点45，一把点44来复枪
Yeah, and when Shorty jumped, he had two. 45s, a. 44 rifle,

1316
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,900
一把点22自动枪，他自己的鲁格尔手枪，一把猎刀，一把猎刀
a. 22 automatic, that Luger of his, a hunting knife, a Bowie knife

1317
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,200
- 和一柄斧子
- and an ax.
- 真走运
- What a guy.

1318
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:39,200
他把自己的衬衣里塞满了巧克力棒，但却忘了系上衣领扣
He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate bars but he forgot to button his collar.

1319
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:40,900
所以当他拉开开降绳时
So when he pulled the rip cord,

1320
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,600
他的那些糖果就掉在中国北方的土地上了
he just naturally molted candy all over North China.

1321
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:48,000
- 他的照片呢？
- What happened to his photograph?
- 和飞机一起没了
- It went down with the ship.

1322
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,300
第二天早上门奇被中国人的少见多怪吓住了
Next morning Manch scared the Chinese right out of their wits.

1323
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,800
他们不知道人类可以长这么高
They didn't know anything human grew that tall.

1324
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,500
鲍勃.格雷呢？
What about Bob Gray?

1325
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:58,900
他很好，我在想他已经动身去重庆了
He's okay. I think they moved on to Chungking.

1326
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:04,600
哦，好吧，那个家伙“我，查理”代我问你们好
Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me, Charlie" said to tell you hello.

1327
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:09,200
如果不是查理的话我们第一天就被日本人抓住了
If it hadn't been for Charlie, the Japs would have had us that first day.

1328
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:11,000
是啊，我们也是
Yeah, us too.

1329
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:15,000
总有一天我要回去和那个人并肩作战
I'd like to come back some day and fight alongside that guy. 

1330
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,100
我们也是
Me, too.

1331
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,000
好了，今天就到这儿了
Well, it's all over.

1332
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,300
让我们节省点话题留到明天
Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.

1333
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,100
一品脱半，还不错
A pint and a half, that's not bad.

1334
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,100
你们该睡觉了
You'd better get to bed now.

1335
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,400
你真是个老奶奶，医生
You're an old grandma, Doc.

1336
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:33,600
但是我会慢点的，作为对你的感激
But I'll take it slow, just as a favor to you.

1337
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:35,700
再会，劳森
Be seeing you, Lawson.

1338
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,600
谢谢医生
Thanks, Doc.

1339
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,500
腿怎么样，医生？
How's the leg, Doc?

1340
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,100
不算好，劳森
It's not good, Lawson.

1341
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:47,600
接下来的48小时要下个决断
The next forty-eight hours will tell the story.

1342
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:49,900
好吧，谢谢你
Well, thank you.

1343
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,300
- 嘿，唐
- Hey, Don.
- 哦

- Yeah?

1344
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,600
告诉杜利德，我们到了以后搞一个派对
Tell Doolittle to hold off that party till we get there.

1345
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:56,000
好的，达文波特，我们等你
Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you.

1346
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,100
- 撒切尔呢？
- Where's Thatcher?
- 他和劳森在一起，他很好
- He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out.

1347
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:04,400
我希望你在康复之前, 让我一直待在这里
I wish you would let me stay here until you're ready to go, sir.

1348
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,300
这些人会很好的照顾我的
These people will take care of us.

1349
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:10,600
你们没有理由留在附近, 而且还有可能被抓到
There's no reason for you fellows to hang around and maybe get caught.

1350
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,400
是啊，我知道，但如果日本人来了，我们迟早都要走
Yeah, I know, but I might come in handy if the Japs show up, sir.

1351
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:19,400
撒切尔，当你回到美国的时候
Thatcher, when you get back to the States,

1352
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,000
如果遇见了我的妻子
if you should run into my wife,

1353
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,000
就告诉她我很好
just tell her I'm okay.

1354
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,200
不要让她知道有什么不对劲了
Don't let her know about anything being wrong.

1355
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,700
我明白，长官
I understand, sir.

1356
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,400
代我向那个比令斯的女孩问个好
And say hello for me to that girl in Billings.

1357
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,500
我会的，长官
That I will, sir.

1358
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:43,500
- 再见
- Goodbye.
- 再见，撒切尔
- Goodbye, Thatcher.

1359
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,400
早上好
Good morning.

1360
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,900
- 早上好，劳森
- Good morning, Lawson.
- 你好，医生
- Hi, Doc.

1361
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:21,200
我尽量不伤着你，劳森，我得仔细看看伤口
I'll try not to hurt you, Lawson. I'll have a look at this.

1362
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:31,500
谢谢
Thanks.

1363
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,700
你要割下这条腿吗？
You going to take the leg, Doc?

1364
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:47,900
我想是这样的
Yeah, I think so.

1365
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:51,400
我们讨论过了，除此之外别无他法
We talked it over and there's nothing else to do.

1366
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,500
把一个人的腿割下有些不近人情
It's pretty rough to have to cut a man's leg off.

1367
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,900
但我觉得没什么事
I guess it'll be all right.

1368
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:04,400
毕竟，一只木脚就像一个高脚背的脚穿上了一只鞋
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like wearing a shoe with a high instep.

1369
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,100
什么时候开始？
When are you gonna do it?

1370
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:10,700
现在我会给你打一针
I might as well give you a shot right now.

1371
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,500
你是说你有什么东西可以让我昏过去？
You mean we have something to knock me out?

1372
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,300
我们的信使今早带来了麻醉剂
Our runners arrived with anesthetic this morning.

1373
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,500
只是脊柱麻醉，劳森
It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.

1374
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,600
腰部以下你不会有任何疼痛感, 但还是会有知觉
You won't feel anything from the waist down, but you'll be conscious.

1375
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,200
这已经是最好的了
That's the best we can do.

1376
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,000
好的
Oh, swell.

1377
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:28,900
我会仔细看着你们不会让你们多割下一点
I can watch you and make sure you don't take off too much.

1378
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,200
好的，劳森,我们要把你反转过来了
All right, Lawson. We'll have to roll you over.

1379
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,400
可能会花上一些时间
It'll take a little time to work.

1380
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,000
我们把你反过来到手术室里去
We'll get you over to the operating room.

1381
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:04,300
- 医生
- Doc?
- 是的
- Yes?

1382
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,200
- 你们会切多高？
- How high are you going to cut?
- 不会太高
- Oh, not too high.

1383
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,000
- 我会有膝盖吗，医生？
- Will I have a knee, Doc?
- 恐怕没有了，劳森
- I'm afraid not, Lawson.

1384
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,700
- 有感觉吗？
- Any feeling there?
- 没有，医生，我…
- No. Look, Doc.

1385
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:16,000
当麻醉剂作用消失前, 我们不能浪费时间
We can't waste any time, Lawson. When that anesthetic wears off,

1386
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,100
- 我们没时间了
- we haven't got any more.
- 好的，只有一件事
- Okay, but just one thing more.

1387
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,200
说吧
Yes.

1388
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:20,700
如果发生什么不测
If anything happens,

1389
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,400
不要让艾伦知道有这手术的事
don't let Ellen know anything about the operation.

1390
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,900
她最好能够以为我是完整的死去的
She might just as well think I died while all in one piece.

1391
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,700
好的，劳森。现在你没有感觉了
All right, Lawson. Now, you're not going to feel this.

1392
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,300
但你有可能紧张跳起来或是怎么的
But you might get nervous and jump or something,

1393
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,100
所以护士们要抓紧你
so the nurses are going to hold you.

1394
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,500
好的，医生
Okay, Doc.

1395
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,500
开工吧
Fire away.

1396
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:50,300
当你说：“没有膝盖”时你没开玩笑吧？
Oh, when you said "no knee," you weren't kidding.

1397
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,900
如果我切低了，一切都得重来
If I cut any lower we might have to do it again

1398
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
你的身体肯定受不了
and your system couldn't take it.

1399
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,700
麻醉效力怎么了，医生？
What're you stalling for, Doc?

1400
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,900
我们在尽力，劳森，放松一点
We're doing the best we can, Lawson. Take it easy.

1401
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,600
好的，只是再快一点
Okay. Only hurry.

1402
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:08,200
好像我能感觉到另一只脚了
It seems like I'm beginning to feel my other leg.

1403
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,600
好像我的脚能动了，医生
It seems like I can move my toes, Doc.

1404
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:27,400
我想我能转动我的脚踝了，快点，医生，我想我能转动了
I think I can move my ankle. Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can.

1405
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:32,200
快点，医生，快点
Hurry, Doc, hurry.

1406
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:45,000
- 喂
- Hello.
- 喂，艾伦
- Hello. Hello, Ellen?

1407
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,400
- 特德，你在哪儿？
- Ted, where are you?
- 我在一个木屋里
- I'm in a lumber camp.

1408
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:50,000
我必须在一个泥坑里强行着陆
I had to make a forced landing in a mud puddle.

1409
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,900
- 你没受伤吧？
- You aren't hurt, are you?
- 不，一点儿伤都没有
- No, not a scratch.

1410
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:57,200
- 你把圣诞树都装饰好了吗？
- Have you got the tree all fixed?
- 是的，特德，你真该来看看
- Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it.

1411
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:00,000
太美了
It's so beautiful.
树下有东西吗
Anything under it?

1412
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,200
- 哦是的
- Oh, yes.
- 好的，让我们打开看看
- Well, let's open them up.

1413
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:07,300
- 我们不能那样
- Oh, we can't do that.
- 我们可以，去打开
- Sure we can. Go ahead.

1414
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,600
那好吧，你这样说了
Well, if you say so

1415
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:13,600
我的飞机毁了，这个圣诞节有被骗的感党
I'm not going to be cheated out of my Christmas by a cracked up airplane.

1416
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,700
哦，特德，这是我一生中见过的…
Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful

1417
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,400
最美的一盒糖果
box of candy I've ever seen in my whole life.

1418
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:22,300
周围还有什么吗？
Good. Isn't there maybe something else lying around?

1419
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:26,900
- 让我瞧瞧，还有
- Let me see. Yes, there is.
- 好的，打开看看
- Well, open it.

1420
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,600
是一个丝巾，好像是手工制的
It's a silk scarf. And it looks like it's handmade, too.

1421
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,500
- 上面有我名字的首字母
- I'll bet it's got my initials on it.
- 这不公平
- That's not fair.

1422
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:38,100
我打开时你偷偷看了一眼
You peeked while I was making it.

1423
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,800
我是了解我的妻子啊
I just know my wife.

1424
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:43,700
- 特德，我真想你在我的身边
- Oh, Ted, I wish you were here.
- 我也是，甜心
- So do I, honey.

1425
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:46,300
今晚我会想你的
I'll be thinking of you tonight.

1426
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,100
我会坐在圣诞树下，打开收音机，放着圣诞颂歌
I'll sit in front of the tree and turn the radio on to Christmas carols

1427
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,700
不停想念你
and just think of you.

1428
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:20,700
谢谢你们，谢谢你们，童子军
Thank you. And thank you, scouts.

1429
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:25,500
我们所有人都由衷感谢你们…
I mean, all the fellows would like to thank you very much,

1430
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,000
为我们付出的所有
for everything.

1431
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:45,600
中尉，我父亲叫我把这个给你们
Lieutenant, my father has asked me to present this to you.

1432
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,900
它从15世纪开始就一直留在我们家了
It has been in our family since the fifteenth century.

1433
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:53,800
父亲让我告诉你美好的东西永远属于美丽的人
Father begs me to tell you that beauty belongs to beauty,

1434
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:57,500
让你把这个东西带给你的妻子就算是对她的敬意了
and asks that you honor him by presenting it to your wife.

1435
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:04,300
哦，谢谢，谢谢
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1436
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,000
我没想到你知道艾伦，我的妻子
I didn't know that you knew about Ellen, my wife.

1437
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,500
你说过很多次了
You spoke of her a number of times.

1438
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,500
上面写着：“这是在日本投下炸弹的美国英雄
It says, "This is an American hero who has bombed Japan.

1439
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:24,000
当他们来到中国人中间时
"Whenever he goes among the people of China,

1440
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:27,100
让他得到尊重和荣誉 
"let him be accorded respect and honor. "

1441
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:37,700
他刚从高材村来
He has just come from Kow Chai.

1442
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,500
你们有一个人被捕了
Another one of your crews has been captured

1443
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,700
日本人正朝这个方向来
and the Japanese are moving in this direction.

1444
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,900
我想过几天，劳森才能行走
I think Lawson will be able to travel in a couple of days.

1445
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,400
没有什么，医生，我现在就可以走了
There's nothing wrong with me, Doc. I can travel right now.

1446
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:49,100
我担心几天的时间太长了
I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long.

1447
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,300
这是王强
This is Wang Tsung.

1448
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:00,300
他从他们的高材村一路赶来
He has walked all the way from his native village of Kow Chai.

1449
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,900
他想送给美军盟友们一件表达敬意的礼物
And he begs the honor of presenting gifts to his American Allies.

1450
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1451
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:12,600
谢谢
Thank you.

1452
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:19,400
谢谢
Thanks.

1453
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,700
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1454
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,200
谢谢
Thank you.

1455
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:55,000
谢谢，非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1456
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:08,900
他感觉比我还糟
He felt a lot worse than I did.

1457
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:38,800
我已经感觉好多了
There, I can get along pretty well already.

1458
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,900
我必须得说，你第一次下床，康复得非常好
I should say very well for your first day out of bed.

1459
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,000
我觉得我还要小心一点
I guess, I'll have to be a little more careful.

1460
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:54,600
我可不想让人看见我这样
I don't ever want anybody to see me do that.

1461
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:59,600
我想让人看看，我有了一只新脚了
I don't want anybody to see me till I get a new leg.

1462
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,500
怀特中尉的消息
Lieutenant White, word just came.

1463
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:07,600
美军飞机将在明天下午5点从衢州机场接你们离开
The American plane will pick you up in Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00.

1464
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:08,900
太好了
Wonderful.

1465
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:16,000
他说如果我们不快点的话日本人就要捷足先登了
He says if we don't hurry, the Japanese may get there first.

1466
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,700
- 你们什么时候走？
- When are you leaving?
- 我们想待在这里
- We're going to stay here.

1467
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:18,900
我们已经很习惯了
We're quite used to it, you know.

1468
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,900
- 来，这些能派上用场
- Here. This may come in handy.
- 谢谢
- Thank you.

1469
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:22,800
你和派克先生为我们做了很多
You and Mr. Parker have done so much for us,

1470
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:23,800
我们不会忘记的
and we'll never forget it.

1471
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:24,900
- 再见，劳森
- Goodbye, Lawson.
- 再见
- Goodbye.

1472
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,100
- 祝你好运
- Good luck.
- 谢谢！先生
- Thank you, sir.

1473
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:28,900
- 再见，愿上帝保佑你
- Goodbye. God bless you.
- 再见，谢谢
- Goodbye. Thank you.

1474
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:32,700
我父亲想让我告诉你们你们的到来让他觉得很光荣
My father wishes me to tell you that you have honored us with your visit

1475
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,500
他会一直为你们的平安回国祈祷的
and that he will offer prayers for your safe return to America.

1476
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:37,100
他不和我们一起走吗？
Isn't he coming along with us?

1477
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:39,300
父亲要和他的老乡们待在一起
Father feels that he must stay with his people.

1478
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,700
这里的人们需要他
They will need him here.

1479
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:43,900
再见，先生
Goodbye, sir.

1480
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:20,200
- 再见，医生
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- 再见，先生
- Goodbye, sir.

1481
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:24,700
再见，医生，感谢你们做的一切
Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything.

1482
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:26,000
但愿我们能再次相见
I hope, sir, that we may meet again. That goes double, Doc.

1483
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,900
再见，医生，谢谢你
Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.

1484
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

1485
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,100
如果有机会到美国来，来找我好吗？
If you ever come to the States, Doctor, look me up, will you?

1486
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,100
在波特兰的黄页里找得到我
I'll be in the Portland telephone directory.

1487
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:35,900
- 荣幸之至
- With pleasure.
- 再见，医生
- Goodbye, Doctor.

1488
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,100
我很难过，中尉
I have one sorrow, Lieutenant,

1489
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,700
我们没有足够的药品来减轻你的疼痛
that we did not have the medicine to ease your pain.

1490
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:47,000
- 你救了我的命，医生
- You saved my life, Doc.
- 我希望有一天你还能回来
- I hope someday you will come back to us.

1491
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,500
我会回来的，也许不是我们自己
We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves

1492
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:52,800
有可能是像我们这样的其他人我很愿意成为他们当中的一员
but a lot of guys like us. And I'd like to be with them.

1493
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,700
- 因为你们是我们最亲近的人
- Because you're our kind of people.
- 谢谢，先生，再见
- Thank you, sir, and goodbye.

1494
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:59,600
- 你好
- Hello.
- 你好
- Hello.

1495
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,900
- 来坐下
- Go ahead, sit down.
- 谢谢
- Thank you.

1496
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:19,600
我知道你的感觉，握着试一试
I know how you feel. Take it for a while.

1497
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,100
谢谢
Thanks.

1498
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,700
感觉到了吗？
Smell that?

1499
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:48,100
那是美利坚，那是美国
That's America. That's the USA.

1500
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:53,500
每一次我航行归来时她都变得更加光彩照人
Every time I make a trip back, she smells better and better.

1501
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:55,000
是啊
Yeah.

1502
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:58,600
- 我想我知道你的意思
- I think I know what you mean.
- 我来自匹兹堡
- I'm from Pittsburgh.

1503
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:01,100
可能你觉得很怪，但是…
I know it may seem screwy to you, but

1504
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:04,100
我能隐隐约约闻到煤烟的味道
it seems to me as if I can smell some of that coal smoke

1505
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:07,600
马上就到老孟农加希拉河了，有点不可思议吧？
right off the old Monongahela River. That sound crazy?

1506
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:11,000
不，我来自加州，已经闻道橘子的味道了
No. I'm from California and I can smell orange blossoms.

1507
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:13,900
不可能，那儿太远了，绝对是来自佛罗里达的
Oh, it couldn't be, that's too far. It must come from Florida.

1508
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,600
如果你想吃的话，一定得吃加州的橘子
Oh, if you want flavor, you've got to have a California orange,

1509
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:21,200
但只是闻闻的话，佛罗里达就够了
but for smelling, Florida's just as good.

1510
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,100
喂…是的
Hello. Yes.

1511
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:45,200
什么？
What's that?

1512
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:49,800
- 等一会儿，艾伦
- Just a minute. Ellen.
- 什么？
- Yes?

1513
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:52,000
艾伦，华盛顿来的电话
Ellen, Washington on the phone.

1514
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:59,100
你好？
Hello?

1515
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:02,200
你好，我是劳森夫人
Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson.

1516
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:06,700
你好，上校，我是说杜利德将军
Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle.

1517
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:09,300
哦，我很好，谢谢
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

1518
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:12,100
不，非常兴奋，将军
No, not a bit excited, General.

1519
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:16,600
他回来了，妈妈，特德回来了，他回来了
Oh, he's back, Mother. Ted's back. He's back.

1520
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,900
好的将军，他怎么样了
Oh yes, General, how is he?

1521
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,000
哦，这个
Oh, yes.

1522
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:29,100
我能理解
I understand.

1523
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,200
我然，我接受的了
Of course, I do.

1524
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:37,100
是的，我有准备了
Yes, I'll be ready.

1525
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,600
我知道，我知道
I know, I know.

1526
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,600
你真的很好，将军
Oh, that's so nice of you, General.

1527
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:49,600
好的，谢谢哦！谢谢你，将军
Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you, General.

1528
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:51,300
谢谢
Thank you.

1529
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,000
哭出来吧，亲爱的
Just cry, darling.

1530
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:08,600
哭出来
Cry it out.

1531
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,400
他今天早上到的，妈妈
He got in this morning, Mother.

1532
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,600
杜利德将军刚才见到了他了，这是真的
General Doolittle just saw him, so it's true.

1533
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:19,000
杜利德将军给我寄了一张机票
General Doolittle's sending a plane ticket for me.

1534
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:21,000
特德不想见我
Ted doesn't want to see me.

1535
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,900
他不想见我，因为他失去了一条腿
He doesn't want to see me because he's lost his leg

1536
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,500
他甚至想把我瞒住
and he doesn't even want me to know it's happened

1537
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:29,700
他有了一只新腿并且能用以后
till he gets a new leg and learns how to use it.

1538
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,300
这都不重要
As if it would make any difference.

1539
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:36,900
只要他还活着
As if anything would make any difference to me as long as he's alive.

1540
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,600
哦，我得去见他，我得去见他
Oh, I'm going to see him, I'm going to see him.

1541
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,500
好吧
Well

1542
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,500
这意味这我们得赶紧打点行李
that means we have to get your clothes ready in a hurry.

1543
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:02,900
我的衣服从洗衣房里取回来了吗？
Have my things come back from the cleaners yet?

1544
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,300
我看我得带上这件衣服
Let's see, I'll take this suit.

1545
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:07,600
和我的蓝外套，他最喜欢了
And my blue coat. He always liked it best.

1546
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:13,400
我带不了这么多，我带不了这么多好看的衣服
I can't take any of these things. I can't take any of my pretty clothes.

1547
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,500
我穿起来不合适了
They don't fit me anymore.

1548
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:17,000
你觉得特德会注意吗？
Do you think Ted's going to pay any attention

1549
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:19,200
会注意到你穿的衣服和你的样子吗？
to what kind of clothes you wear or how you look?

1550
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:20,600
他会的
He always did.

1551
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,400
妈妈，我很害怕
Oh, Mother, I'm scared.

1552
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:25,900
没什么可怕的
There's nothing to be frightened about.

1553
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,100
很多人都失去了脚或手
Lots of people lose a leg or arm


1554
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,200
- 但还是继续过着正常人的生活
- and continue living perfectly normal lives.
- 我不是害怕特德
- I'm not scared about Ted.

1555
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:34,100
- 我害怕我自己
- I'm scared about me.
- 你自己？
- About you?

1556
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:39,400
你知道，时过境迁很多丈夫和妻子就分开了
Well, you see, most husbands and wives are together while things are changing.

1557
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:43,400
丈夫总是那样因为…因为这总是在发生
Husbands get used to things like that because, well, they're around.

1558
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:47,200
特德走了好长一段时间，这段时间我又瘦了
Ted's been gone all this time and when he went away, I was so slim.

1559
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:51,600
每次他走了，他总会这样觉得
All the time he's been gone, he's been thinking of me like that.

1560
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,800
特德爱你，爱伦，你也爱他
Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him.

1561
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:58,500
这就是你们没有人会觉察到对方变化的原因
That's why neither of you is going to notice any change when you meet.

1562
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:02,500
- 你这样认为吗，妈妈？
- Do you think so, Mother?
- 我是这样认为的
- I know so.

1563
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:14,300
还有，如果我穿这样的衣服的话
All the same, if I held my coat like this

1564
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:17,900
我走在屋子里，你不觉得有一点点…
when I walk into the room, don't you think it would hide me, just a little?

1565
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,200
把我内心隐藏起来的感觉

1566
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
你好，劳森，感觉如何？
Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling?

1567
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:34,100
- 很好，长官
- Pretty good, sir.
- 你看起来不错
- You look fine.

1568
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,400
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

1569
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:38,500
- 你不坐下吗，长官？
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- 哦，谢谢
- Yeah, thanks.

1570
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,900
- 有什么打算？
- Well, got any plans?
- 关于什么？
- About what, sir?

1571
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,400
是的，关于未来，你想做点什么？
Well, about the future. Have you decided what you're going to do?

1572
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:47,000
没怎么想，长官
Not particularly, sir.

1573
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:49,700
我一直想成为一个航空学工程师
I always wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.

1574
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:52,400
退伍以后我想我得
I always wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.

1575
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,400
重新学习
after they muster me out.

1576
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:56,400
谁说你会退伍？
Who said they'd muster you out?

1577
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,900
我对任何人都没什么用了，没有了…
Well, I won't be much use to anybody with a...

1578
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:00,700
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1579
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:04,500
你认为我们会让拥有你这样经历的人离开吗？
Do you think we'd let a man of your experience get away from us?

1580
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:08,900
- 很好，长官，谢谢
- Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you.
- 你不要谢我
- Don't thank me.

1581
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:14,000
- 我突然想到了一些事，劳森
- I just happened to think of something, Lawson.
- 什么事？长官
- Yes, sir?

1582
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:16,200
你的妻子呢？她知道你回来吗？
What about your wife? Does she knew you're back?

1583
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,700
- 不，长官
- No, sir.
- 为什么不通知？
- Why not?

1584
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:23,000
我想等我有一只新脚然后伤疤修复以后
Well, I thought I'd wait till I get my new leg and my scars fixed up.

1585
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
那样她就不会感到很震惊了
It won't be so much of a shock to her that way.

1586
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:28,700
震惊？你娶的是一个怎样的女孩？
Shock? What kind of a girl did you marry, anyway?

1587
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:31,800
她很好，长官，她是一个出色的女孩
She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl.

1588
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
那么她就应该知道…
Well then, she deserves to know.

1589
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:35,800
并且应该看见你
She deserves to see you too.

1590
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:38,600
不不，长官。如果你不介意，我会一直等下去
No, no, sir. If you don't mind, I'd rather wait.

1591
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,900
当我再次见到艾伦时我一定会盛装打扮
When I see Ellen again, I'm going to be all dressed up

1592
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
而且有了一只新腿
and have a new leg.

1593
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:46,700
带她去镇上最好的地方
And I'm going to take her out to the best place in town

1594
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:50,000
我要和她跳舞
and I'm going to dance with her.

1595
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:55,900
- 那还要等上一段时间，劳森
- That may be quite a while, Lawson.
- 不，长官
- No, sir.

1596
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:58,100
你瞧我康复得很快，可能一两个月…
You see, I'm getting along fine. And in a month or two...

1597
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:01,100
两个月你就得工作了，繁重的工作
In a month or two you'll be back at work, hard work.

1598
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:07,100
好吧，我会时常来看你的，劳森
Well, I'll try to drop in on you again, Lawson.

1599
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,700
- 希望你能来，长官
- I hope you can, sir.
- 再见
- Goodbye.

1600
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:10,000
再见，长官
Goodbye, sir

1601
02:15:16,700 --> 02:15:18,100
你妻子快生小孩了，是吧？
Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she?

1602
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:19,300
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1603
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:25,900
我也有孩子，两个，都在服役
I've got a couple of kids myself, both in the service.

1604
02:15:27,900 --> 02:15:32,000
劳森，如果我的孩子或者其他人的孩子遇到这种情况
You know, Lawson, if my kids and all the other kids who are in this thing

1605
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:36,600
都能处理自如，当然我不想看到
could fix it so this would really be the last one,

1606
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:39,300
你孩子会好起来的，是吧？
your kid would get quite a break, wouldn't he?

1607
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,300
他会的，长官
He sure would, sir.

1608
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:23,400
我不得不来
I just had to come.

1609
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:28,600
特德，特德，特德，让我来帮你
Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you.

1610
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:31,200
别这样，艾伦，会伤到孩子的
Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.

1611
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,100
当最惨烈的时候
When things were worst,

1612
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:43,900
当希望渺茫的时候
when there didn't seem to be any chance at all,

1613
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,900
我能看见你的面庞，你隽秀的面庞
I could see your face, your beautiful face.

1614
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:54,100
我知道你回来了，特德
I knew you were coming home, Ted.

1615
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,600
告诉我，亲爱的
Tell me, honey.

1616
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,200
为什么你这么可爱？
How come you're so cute?

1617
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:04,700
我找到了一个如此帅气的小伙子，我必须得这样啊
I had to be if I was going to get such a good looking fellow.
