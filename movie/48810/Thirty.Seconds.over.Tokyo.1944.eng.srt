1
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,179
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.

2
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,778
Thank you.

3
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,018
Hello. Captain York, please.

4
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,755
You know, if this thing works out,

5
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,421
it might give our boys all the way
from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.

6
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,327
And it may pull a lot of Japs
back to their islands.

7
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,332
-It'll work out, General.
-I'm sure it will.

8
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,932
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.

9
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:22,166
York, I want you to get 24 B-25s
with volunteer crews

10
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,937
down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.

11
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,974
The job will take them out of the country
for about three months.

12
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,948
Tell them it's a secret mission.

13
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,917
They won't know where they're going
until they get there.

14
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,011
That's right, volunteers.

15
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:40,485
Tell them they're not to talk to anybody.
That's an order.

16
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll join you in a few days. Right.

17
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:51,259
Zero-two-two-four-one to Eglin Tower.

18
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,805
Three B-25s request traffic
and landing instructions.

19
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:54,930
Go ahead.

20
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,975
Army four-one. The left-hand pattern.

21
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,976
Wind direction north by northeast.

22
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,205
Land on runway number three.

23
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,212
There's the field all right.

24
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,773
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?

25
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,840
She's big all right.

26
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,477
You could almost close your eyes
and get in.

27
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,613
And I'd give plenty
to know where we go from here.

28
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:11,781
Yeah, so would I.

29
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,758
Hey, don't do anything
till I get my camera.

30
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,029
How does she look from the nose, Clever?

31
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:23,194
Great. Florida, palm trees,
alligators, bathing beauties.

32
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,763
Hey, Thatcher,
have a look at some real country.

33
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,273
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.

34
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,309
Did you keep the cookies
this trip, Thatcher?

35
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,871
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble
coming over the mountains, but I hung on.

36
00:03:36,181 --> 00:03:38,376
-Zero-two-two-four-one to flight.
-Hey, wait a minute.

37
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,247
We'll go around, make an echelon right

38
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,016
once over the field, then break away.
Let's make it pretty.

39
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,549
Here's for luck.

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,250
Switch is off!

41
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:30,826
-5:25. Not bad time.
-Yeah, we moved.

42
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,303
Better write that left engine up.
She sounded a little rough.

43
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,169
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,300
You really made a nice break away.
Gave me kind of an artistic angle.

45
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,675
Some day I'll do a crash landing
so you can get a real movie.

46
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:43,271
Thatcher says that Florida
can't compare to Billings.

47
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,942
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks that
any place with more than 300 people

48
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,282
-is overcrowded.
-Oh, according to the last census, sir,

49
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,447
Billings has a population of 16,380.

50
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:55,482
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher,
you must be thinking of Greater Billings.

51
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,292
No, he's right, Clever.
They count the cows up in that country.

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,558
-Sorry, sir.
-Yes.

53
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:04,465
-Cameras aren't allowed on the field.
-What?

54
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,662
That's right, sir.

55
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,969
A lot of secret work goes on here,
and they're very strict about it.

56
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,736
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.

57
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,674
Then I'll have to report you
to the Commanding Officer, sir.

58
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,939
Those are my orders.

59
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,570
Okay. Okay.

60
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,514
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.

61
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,916
We were afraid you wouldn't
get that turkey in till tomorrow.

62
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,317
Why, that baby flies so pretty

63
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,651
we floated the last 200 miles.

64
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:27,487
-Are you guys ready?
-Yeah. Come on, Brick.

65
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,255
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back
and tell you where your quarters are.

66
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,591
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,362
Come on, Davey, you've got an idea.
What's the dope?

68
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,799
-Where do we go from here?
-I already told you.

69
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,099
All they said was
that it'd take us out of the country,

70
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,537
we'd be gone about three months
and that it'd be dangerous.

71
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,371
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.

72
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,274
He says they're forming patrol squadrons
to guard the Canal.

73
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,837
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?

74
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,212
Well, what are we worrying about?

75
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,808
Ski will give us all the dope
when we check in anyhow.

76
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,357
Three ships in, sir.
Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.

77
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,824
-Good. Your ships okay?
-Yes, sir.

78
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,156
Sit down.

79
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,554
Where we staying, Ski?

80
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,326
The government's leased
a hotel near here.

81
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,299
They call it the Officers' Club.

82
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,632
The men whose wives are coming
can stay there.

83
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:13,830
The other officers' quarters
are in Barracks 5.

84
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,998
Is Emmy coming down?

85
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,537
-She'll be here in a couple of days.
-Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?

86
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,669
The enlisted men are assigned
to Barracks 12.

87
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,105
Okay.

88
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,177
-Anything else?
-Nope?

89
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,783
At least, not until tomorrow morning.

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,784
Well, we'll be seeing you.

91
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,660
Say, Ski, the guys are all crazy
to know what's up.

92
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,733
You know as much about it as I do.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,667
We may be given more information
in the morning.

94
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,586
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!

95
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,681
Well, well, well,
plant me now and dig me later,

96
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,386
if it isn't the pride of Randolph Field.
How are you, boy?

97
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,452
Great, Shorty. The minute we heard
that razzmatazz,

98
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,327
we knew you must be somewhere around.

99
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,696
-You volunteer for this deal, too?
-Sure enough.

100
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,533
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis.
Coldest country I ever did see.

101
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,403
I'd have volunteered for anything
to get back in the sunshine.

102
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:25,204
-Where you been?
-Columbia, South Carolina.

103
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,834
-Bob!
-Hello, Ted.

104
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,140
You guys know each other?

105
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,010
Oh, we just went through Kelly together,
that's all.

106
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,778
-Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding.
-Wedding?

107
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,819
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

108
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,014
How long you been balled up
and chained down?

109
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,489
Six months, in five more days.

110
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,459
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.

111
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,154
Hey, Davey,
what are you doing down here?

112
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,821
-Brick!
-Hi, Don.

113
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,765
-I thought you were hunting subs.
-Was. Got me one, too.

114
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,859
-You in on this deal?
-Sure. I've got a swell crew

115
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,962
and it looked like
it was going to be something, so why not?

116
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,374
-Any ideas what we might be up to?
-Oh, just a hunch.

117
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,271
Yeah? Well, give.

118
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,909
South Seas.
Knock ourselves off a few meatballs.

119
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,409
Yeah?

120
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,891
Three.

121
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,401
Honest man. Dealer takes two.

122
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,395
-You know, I just got an idea.
-About what?

123
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,303
About where we might be going.

124
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:32,901
The way it looks to...
No, that's not right. Forget it.

125
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,440
Says two.

126
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,241
-You know, I've got an idea too.
-Yeah?

127
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,450
I've got an idea
you're pretty much of a dope

128
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,782
to have come in on this deal
in the first place.

129
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,048
What kind of a crack is that?

130
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:48,018
Oh, I don't know.
You're married. You've got a swell girl.

131
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,127
I never would have stuck my neck out
if I were in your boots.

132
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,993
Go away. You say two?

133
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,931
And up two.

134
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,360
Those guys are off again.

135
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,607
Hey, stand up there.
Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:15,450
Have you ever carried a navigator
in your ship before, Spike?

137
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,348
Neither have I,
until I volunteered for this job.

138
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,517
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff,
all right. I kind of got a feeling.

139
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,060
Shoot me for a pole cat.

140
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:26,222
Do I see two red-blooded citizens
lying on their backsides

141
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,289
while the Texas anthem is being rendered?

142
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,130
On your feet, men.

143
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,528
What are you beefing about, Shorty?
You're from Virginia.

144
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,901
That's right, sharp cat,

145
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,873
but my pal here, he's from Texas,
and he takes offense easy.

146
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,672
-Hello, Joe.
-Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.

147
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,610
Hey, you guys, shut up!

148
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:45,039
Quiet, fellows. Listen.
Jimmy Doolittle's down here

149
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,784
and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.

150
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,516
Jimmy Doolittle!
A southern boy from Southern California.

151
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,185
Let's have Eyes of Texas
for Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.

152
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,198
Attention!

153
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,931
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.

154
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,638
As you were.

155
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,275
You men are here
because you've volunteered.

156
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,253
You have been told
it's a dangerous mission.

157
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:27,348
I can't tell you any more than that now,
but I want to emphasize the danger.

158
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,292
The most important thing at the moment
is secrecy.

159
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:36,490
I don't want you to even tell your wives
what you see down here.

160
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,535
And if you think you've guessed
where you're going,

161
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,969
you're probably wrong.
But don't even talk about your guess.

162
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,337
If the slightest word about this mission
gets around,

163
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:48,402
you will endanger not only your own lives,
but the lives of thousands of other men.

164
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,014
Now I want to ask you a question.

165
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,620
Has anybody tried to talk to you
about this?

166
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:59,552
Good. If anybody on the field
or off the field

167
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,319
tries to engage you in conversation

168
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,260
as to why you're here,
no matter how innocently,

169
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,853
I want you to get his name
and give it to me

170
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,297
and I'll turn it over to the FBI.

171
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,542
This is going to be
the toughest training you've ever had.

172
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:25,042
You will have the same crew
all the way through and the same ship.

173
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,950
And the man or the ship that fails
will be dropped.

174
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:35,083
You're going to do things with a B-25
you thought were impossible.

175
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:39,385
Now, if any of you have any doubts,
I'd like you to drop out right now

176
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:42,456
and I promise you that no one
will ever think the worse of you.

177
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,866
If you have wives or children
or any other considerations

178
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:48,235
that might get on your nerves in a crisis,
it's perfectly all right.

179
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,400
As a matter of fact,
it's your duty to drop out.

180
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,843
Very well. We'll have these talks
as often as possible. That's all.

181
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,453
We're going up this morning
for an orientation flight.

182
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:09,051
There are four auxiliary fields.
One, two, three, four.

183
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,562
Line them up and locate them all.

184
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,793
We don't know which we're going to use
for our confidential experiments,

185
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:18,802
so familiarize yourselves with all of them.

186
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,071
Look over the countryside,
and we'll meet here again

187
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,233
at 3:30 this afternoon.
Are there any questions?

188
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,402
Sir, the plugs are being changed
in my engines.

189
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,812
To save time,
may I go along in Jones' ship?

190
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:34,181
Right, Smith. All right.
You can go to your ship now.

191
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,716
It looks to me
like it's going to be a long time

192
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,155
before you swing down
Main Street of Billings again, Thatcher.

193
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,921
In Billings, sir,
the main street is Minnesota Avenue.

194
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,058
You know, that guy really means business.

195
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:50,067
-He had me sweating a little.
-Yeah, me too.

196
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,796
-Lieutenant Lawson?
-Yes.

197
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,304
Someone to see you
out in front of the PX at J Street, sir.

198
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,034
Thanks. I wonder who would...

199
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,538
I'll be right back.

200
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,109
Ellen!

201
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,746
-Where did you come from?
-I drove to Carolina to surprise you.

202
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:16,226
-And then they told me you're down here.
-Well, how are you?

203
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,626
I'm just fine, thank you.
And how are you bearing up?

204
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,995
Oh, great. You look just the same.

205
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,797
Well, of course I do.
You can't expect any change this soon.

206
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,662
-What's the joke?
-Nothing.

207
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,104
Except you're so funny.

208
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,074
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?

209
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,942
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Here, let me buy you a drink.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,043
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

211
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,591
Come on, let's go around here.

212
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,478
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?

213
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:13,381
I had to be if I were going to get
such a good looking fellow.

214
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,381
You know, there's a lot of things
I want to talk over with you.

215
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:21,016
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?

216
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,892
Well, no, not exactly.

217
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,987
You know, you go into something like this
with your eyes open.

218
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:30,330
-Naturally you've got to take your chances.
-I see.

219
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:33,995
Isn't that kind of a cold-blooded way
to look at it?

220
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,939
Oh, now, don't get mad.
You've got to be cold-blooded about it.

221
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,203
This is the most important thing
that's ever happened to me.

222
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,245
-What about me?
-Well, you're in on it, too.

223
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,147
-That's why I want to talk it over.
-That's very generous. Go on, Ted.

224
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,548
Well, in the first place,
we've got to keep it a secret.

225
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,816
-I don't want you to tell a soul.
-You're not, I mean, you...

226
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,618
You don't wish
it hadn't happened, do you?

227
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,988
Oh, no, of course not.

228
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,323
But it's a military secret,
I've got my orders.

229
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,158
Military...
Say, what are you talking about?

230
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,790
Well, this job I volunteered for.
Didn't you get my letter?

231
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,097
-No. Didn't you get mine?
-No.

232
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,630
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...

233
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,107
-Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson!
-Here.

234
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,041
What are you hiding out...

235
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,444
-Ellen, when did you get here?
-Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?

236
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,914
Great. Only I'm going
to have to break this up.

237
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:21,349
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.

238
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,979
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.

239
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,387
There's a hotel about a mile and a half
down the road.

240
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,950
I haven't seen it yet,
but they tell me you can't miss it.

241
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:33,520
-I'll find it.
-I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.

242
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,536
Don't forget dinner.

243
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,185
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?

244
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,223
Yes, sir. I did this morning.
I forgot all about it.

245
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,623
-Well, bring it up.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:21,404
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,640
Okay. Thanks.
Take over, will you, Davenport.

248
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:24,841
Sure.

249
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:36,220
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!

250
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,283
Hey, it's from Ellen.

251
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:40,820
She's going to be...
I mean, I'm going to be a father.

252
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,578
Hello, flyer.

253
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,142
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

254
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,415
I wasn't sleeping, really.
I was just dozing and thinking.

255
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:41,189
I'm sorry I didn't get back for dinner.
We had a lot of checking to do.

256
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,754
You must've thought
I was an awful dope this morning.

257
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,065
But I didn't get your letter until later,
so I didn't know.

258
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:52,329
I know. Sit down.

259
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:06,246
-I think it's swell about the baby.
-I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.

260
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,278
You know, it's going to seem funny.

261
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,915
I don't care whether it's a boy or a girl.
Not that much.

262
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:16,418
I just want you to be okay.
It's pretty serious.

263
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,865
-Well, what's so funny?
-I was just thinking.

264
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,766
Here you're getting ready to go off
on something really tough,

265
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,098
and you're worrying about me.

266
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,573
If I were in your spot,
I'd be scared to death.

267
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:37,813
-But I guess I am anyhow.
-Purely routine stuff, flyer.

268
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:41,943
The kind of job every girl takes on
once or twice in her life.

269
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,121
Why don't you lie down?

270
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,226
You know, Ellen,

271
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,961
I'm kind of glad I got you.

272
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,831
I guess that's what I was thinking about
in my sleep.

273
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:05,098
It almost frightened me.

274
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:08,737
It seemed that I was thinking,
"What if I'd never met him?"

275
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,075
Well, for one thing

276
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,742
you wouldn't be traipsing
around the country

277
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,480
from one airfield to another
trying to catch up with me.

278
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,282
And for another,

279
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,924
you wouldn't be having a baby
right in the middle of a war.

280
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,961
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

281
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,087
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,

282
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:31,664
I'd never have felt really close to anybody,
never in my whole life.

283
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:39,138
Married six months
and together less than two weeks.

284
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,644
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.

285
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,181
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.

286
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:48,116
If people can be close
when they're far away from each other,

287
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,784
well, that's what it should be.

288
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:53,118
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

289
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,157
Cuddle me.

290
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,265
I was thinking about last Christmas.

291
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:07,031
The tree we set up
in that Portland auto court.

292
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,630
-Wasn't it an awful little room?
-Yeah.

293
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,267
And the Christmas dinner
we were planning on.

294
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:16,074
And then you ran out of gas
and landed in the mud up in lllwaco,

295
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:20,140
Christmas Eve and Christmas
were all over before I saw you again.

296
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:24,381
Yeah, that was tough.
But I got a scarf out of it, anyhow.

297
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:27,080
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.

298
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:30,355
It was our first Christmas,
and somewhere way off,

299
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:32,222
it didn't matter where,

300
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:37,097
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted,
it was the nicest Christmas of my life.

301
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,737
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen.
I knew that the minute I first saw you.

302
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,468
As a matter of fact
that's why I married you.

303
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,637
-You know, I've got a confession to make.
-What?

304
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:53,548
The truth is, you didn't marry me.
I married you.

305
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,213
Oh, you did, eh?

306
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:00,317
The first time I saw you
in the library at LACC,

307
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,224
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me."

308
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,654
And from then on,

309
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:08,130
clear up to the night we got the judge
out of bed in that little Idaho town,

310
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,064
nothing was an accident, Ted.

311
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,500
I planned it that way.

312
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,136
-You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
-I'm not sure whether I do or not.

313
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,208
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.

314
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:23,473
I suppose you figured out
on that baby, too?

315
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:27,348
That's something you'll never know, flyer,
you'll never know.

316
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,523
Boys are working late these nights.

317
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,798
Yes. Do you have any idea
how long you'll be gone?

318
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,570
But as soon as this job is over,
I'm going to ask for a leave.

319
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,542
Two, maybe three weeks.

320
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,875
We'll have that honeymoon
you're always talking about.

321
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,177
Yes, just the three of us.

322
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:03,613
Ted.

323
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:09,557
I do hope I don't get big and fat
like that lady in Chicago.

324
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,367
I want each one of you to know something
about the other man's job.

325
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,166
The pilots will practice
every job on the plane.

326
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,606
Navigators will learn
the work of bombardiers and so forth.

327
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:27,108
That's in case any of you get shot up.

328
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,112
There's one thing more.

329
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,713
It is inevitable that some of your planes

330
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,409
are going to fall
into the hands of the enemy.

331
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:35,884
For this reason, I have ordered
your Norden bombsights removed.

332
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:40,356
Captain Greening has designed a sight
which will be perfect for our job.

333
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,192
If there are no questions,
I'll ask Captain York to take over.

334
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:47,424
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.

335
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,989
Yeah, but what about
taking the Norden Bombsight out?

336
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:53,264
There's no chance of falling into the hands
of the enemy if you're hunting subs.

337
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:57,467
-I hadn't thought of that.
-That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?

338
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,273
"Just in case any of us are shot up,"
a bundle of sunshine.

339
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:09,418
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!

340
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,282
George used to buzz me
when we were first married.

341
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:15,325
He doesn't do it any more.
They're not supposed to.

342
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,553
-I wonder if he still loves me.
-I wouldn't worry about that.

343
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:21,894
Every time Ski gets a new ship
he has a terrible love affair with it,

344
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:23,524
but he always comes back to me,

345
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,125
especially when he's hungry.

346
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,036
Just think, they'll be gone three months.

347
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:30,403
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.

348
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:33,671
I couldn't stand just sitting around
in some little apartment and waiting.

349
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:34,938
What are you going to do, Ellen?

350
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:38,277
Oh, I'm just going to sit around
and have a baby.

351
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,811
-A baby!
-A baby!

352
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,408
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?

353
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,648
I don't know. I guess I just never
thought of a way till now.

354
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,282
As it turns out, it wasn't hard to tell at all.

355
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:49,451
Well, I'm going to have one, too.

356
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,960
-What?
-Really?

357
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,155
Gee, I think it's wonderful.

358
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:56,833
George and I have talked about it,
but, well, with him away and all,

359
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,995
-I guess I'm just too scared.
-I thought I would be too, but...

360
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,665
Well, Ted and I figured
that everything since Pearl Harbor

361
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,731
has just been so much velvet.

362
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,040
And then I guessed that
if anything should happen to him,

363
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,137
only I know nothing will,

364
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:14,446
I'd have the baby, and that would be
a little bit of Ted still living.

365
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:17,385
I sometimes wonder how we'll feel
when it's all over.

366
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,856
Just think, being able to settle down
in a little house somewhere

367
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:24,292
and raise your children
and never be in doubt about anything.

368
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,989
We'll probably have
exactly the same doubts

369
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,189
that we have right now.

370
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,428
For example, will he
or will he not be home for dinner?

371
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:34,237
We're about to enter
the most secret part of our training.

372
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:38,639
This field is patrolled on all sides
so no one can disturb you at your work.

373
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,973
Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Miller
of the Navy.

374
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:43,309
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

375
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:48,080
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff
in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

376
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:49,551
he's going to show you how to do it

377
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,681
with a full load of bombs and gas
in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

378
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,024
You will attempt no short takeoffs

379
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,928
from Eglin Field,
where people can see you.

380
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,632
Lieutenant Miller will also give you
a few short talks on naval etiquette.

381
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,103
Now, if this gives you any hints
as to your destination

382
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,834
or as to what kind of work
you're going to do,

383
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:13,604
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

384
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:17,147
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

385
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:21,983
Gentlemen,

386
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:28,617
those flags out there are
at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet

387
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,320
from the starting line.

388
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:33,852
The line down the center of the field
is to guide you in your takeoff.

389
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:37,765
The kind of work you're going to do
won't permit any deviations.

390
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,271
Now, the whole idea is to get up
full power before you release your brakes.

391
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,433
Then start, at maximum r.p.m.,
manifold pressure

392
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,775
and with your wing flaps
all the way down.

393
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,711
You'll have to rev your motors
until you think they're going to burn up.

394
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,543
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

395
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,584
and that's a matter of sound and feel
more than instruments,

396
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:56,517
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

397
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:59,351
I don't expect any of you
to do it the first time.

398
00:25:59,423 --> 00:26:00,856
-Gray.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,483
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

400
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,586
The rest of us will stay on the ground,
mark your takeoff and check the wind.

401
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,652
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,029
I think at first we can learn as much
by watching trial runs

403
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,863
as by actually flying the ships.

404
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:14,200
So let's all line up over here
and see how he does.

405
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,835
-What kind of surface wind, Ski?
-Eight miles an hour.

406
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,898
He didn't have his engines
revved up enough.

407
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,773
Lawson, you go next.

408
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:55,072
Now remember, for our purposes,

409
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,205
if you get your wheels a foot
off the ground, that's good enough.

410
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,146
You don't need height,
but you've got to get your wheels off

411
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,683
before you hit the last flag.

412
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,618
A little later we'll try retracting the wheels
at around 450 feet

413
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,314
and relying on your motors
to float the ship.

414
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,983
-Don't try that just yet, though.
-Right, sir.

415
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,426
Now, grab the column and pull her
until you feel the inside of your backbone.

416
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:12,792
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,514
Did you ever take off a B-25
at 500 feet, sir?

418
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,516
No. But you men will.
Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:36,883
Watch Lawson there.

420
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:41,118
You'll have to rev your motors
at least that high and maybe higher.

421
00:27:53,237 --> 00:27:58,402
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid.
Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

422
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,989
Brother, that takeoff
was strictly on the cob.

423
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:17,755
That airplane of yours looked exactly
like a ruptured duck.

424
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,227
How do you like this guy?

425
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:21,696
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind,

426
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,790
and then he's got the nerve
to talk about a real ship.

427
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,894
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field,
or you'd still be there.

428
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:31,340
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey
you and Gray are pushing around the sky.

429
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:36,345
-The ruptured duck will get along okay.
-Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.

430
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,948
That won't take long to fix, sir.

431
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,509
Ruptured duck.

432
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,663
Ted.

433
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:58,031
Don't you think Linda's a good name,
if it's a girl?

434
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,294
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.

435
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:05,333
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?

436
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,539
That has a nice sound, don't you think?

437
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,577
What's that? Oh, yes.

438
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,608
Look, honey, we don't have to decide that
right now, do we?

439
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:17,745
No.

440
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,486
Ted.

441
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:28,091
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?

442
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,925
-Who?
-Johnny Adams.

443
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:33,799
-How'd you hear about Johnny?
-Those things get around.

444
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:36,533
-He wasn't hurt, was he?
-Of course not.

445
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:38,472
I don't know how those things get started.

446
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:41,306
Every time a guy does a noseover
on this field, it's a crack-up.

447
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:42,436
Ted.

448
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:48,111
You've been working ever since dinner.
Come on, let's get some air.

449
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,986
It's a deal.

450
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:58,853
Nice.

451
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,132
I'm sorry we haven't had
more time together, Ellen.

452
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:10,100
We can spare a little.
We've got all the rest of our lives.

453
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,142
That's right.

454
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:19,473
Something blooming?
It smells good, doesn't it?

455
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:21,375
-Ted.
-What?

456
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,477
Please, don't worry about anything.

457
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:26,853
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.

458
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,585
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.

459
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,289
You're not worried about the deal.
You're worried because you've got a wife.

460
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,229
And that's wrong, Ted.

461
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:39,162
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been
trying to scare you, has he?

462
00:30:39,236 --> 00:30:41,033
-Of course not.
-Okay.

463
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,196
Because there's nothing
to worry about, nothing.

464
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,969
Silly, as if I didn't know that.

465
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,738
Besides, if anything did happen,
you've got all that government insurance,

466
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:51,269
that'll take care of you
and the baby for a long while.

467
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,383
Oh, what am I talking about?
Nothing's going to happen anyhow.

468
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,388
Ted, look at me.

469
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:04,091
That baby and I,
we won't ever need anything but you.

470
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:07,530
We mustn't either of us
be scared about it, Ted.

471
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:12,058
Because the baby, the baby's why I know
you're coming back to us.

472
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:59,776
We'd better make this one,
or Shorty'll never let us hear the last of it.

473
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,942
Yeah.

474
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,850
-Hear those engines?
-Like music.

475
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:06,073
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.

476
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,051
It's been 10 weeks work
and one night's fun. Let's go.

477
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,644
-I got my flaps up, brother.
-Heat it up there, Smitty boy.

478
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:15,351
Steam and sizzle. Where you're going,
no one's gonna hold you tight.

479
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,485
Hey there, Doc,
don't you know how to dance?

480
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,495
When they start picking flak
out of your feet,

481
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,394
you'll wish you'd put them to better use.

482
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:24,093
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.

483
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,051
-Hey, what gives?
-Shorty's throwing a party.

484
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,177
A party? What for?

485
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:46,586
Somebody said
he's celebrating Texas Constitution Day.

486
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,616
-Texas Constitution Day?
-Say, I'm gonna sample this.

487
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:02,627
Grab your gal, Lawson.

488
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,401
Don't you know
it's Sam Houston's birthday?

489
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,464
Sam Houston?

490
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,568
For a guy that never saw Texas,
that Manch is really sold.

491
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,341
-Hi, Lawson.
-Hi. How did this riot get started?

492
00:34:11,415 --> 00:34:12,905
It's Texas Admission Day.

493
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:16,077
And that ain't no riot,
mister, that's a full-fledged war.

494
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,587
-Seen Ellen?
-I've seen everybody.

495
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,636
-Hello, flyer.
-My dance?

496
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,796
All of them, my boy.

497
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,205
Every dance from now on out,
including the last one.

498
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,837
And I love you, Ski.
I love you, I love you, I love you.

499
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,751
You know, it's a funny thing.
That Lawson used to be about as graceful

500
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,986
as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.

501
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,052
Maybe the girl's
got something to do with it.

502
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,791
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.

503
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,860
You know, there's something
I mean to tell you more often,

504
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,596
-but I never seem to get the chance.
-What is it?

505
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,166
Just that I love you.

506
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,010
I got a letter from your mother
this morning. Forgot to tell you.

507
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,579
She said to take good care of you.

508
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,817
-How am I doing?
-Better than mother ever dreamed of.

509
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,406
Here. Here.

510
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,301
Now smile and sing.

511
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,300
Ted.

512
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,868
Telephone's ringing.

513
00:37:58,308 --> 00:38:01,744
-Telephone, Ted.
-Oh, sure.

514
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:13,914
Yeah? Right now? Okay.

515
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:16,083
Okay.

516
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,624
Okay.

517
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,094
What was it?

518
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,957
Oh, just another night call.
But what a night.

519
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:25,999
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,695
What time is it?

521
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,131
3:10.

522
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:34,536
-Hung-over maybe a little?
-Oh, just a headache.

523
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:37,908
-I'm not used to party life.
-Poor baby.

524
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:43,077
You go to sleep.
I'll be back by breakfast time.

525
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,722
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.

526
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,127
Or rather, good morning.

527
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:56,489
Boy, if I ever get a leave,
I'm going to sleep for six days solid.

528
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,466
I wonder what this is.

529
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:15,140
Well, men, your ships are all serviced,
gassed, and ready to go.

530
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,678
You will take off in shifts,

531
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,686
the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.

532
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:23,791
Captain York will give you
your clearances.

533
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:27,995
Now there's one thing
that must be thoroughly understood.

534
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,326
After you take off this morning,

535
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:34,860
you are to see no one, speak to no one,
telephone no one, not even your wife.

536
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,207
There are no exceptions.

537
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,902
Continue your gas consumption tests
to your destination.

538
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:47,714
Now, the work you will be asked to do
will require a little low altitude flying,

539
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:50,978
so hedge-hopping on this trip
is perfectly okay.

540
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:54,847
Only bear in mind
that cowboys wear pretty tall hats,

541
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,656
so watch your step, men. That's all.

542
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:04,293
I think you're very well prepared
for what you volunteered to do

543
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:09,369
and I want to thank you
for a lot of good hard work.

544
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,501
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.

545
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,170
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.

546
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:17,270
Yeah, you will.

547
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:19,781
Your destination is Alameda field.

548
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:24,581
Take the southern route,
refuel at San Antonio and march.

549
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:29,250
As your names are called you can start.
First flight, Holstrom,

550
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,861
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...

551
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:46,939
-Ted.
-Well, this is it, honey. We're off.

552
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,204
-How soon?
-Just got time to pack.

553
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,677
Where's my B-4 bag?

554
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:52,214
-In the closet. I'll get it.
-Good.

555
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:59,050
Socks, shirts.

556
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,092
-My ties in the closet?
-Yes, I have them.

557
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,252
Good.

558
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,837
Wow! Don't go in there in your bare feet,
I broke a glass.

559
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:17,270
All right.

560
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:20,666
-You forgot your toothbrush.
-Oh, doggone it.

561
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,342
-We got everything?
-I think so.

562
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:29,578
Swell.

563
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:45,934
Well, be a good girl
and take good care of that baby.

564
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,997
-I will, Ted.
-Yourself, too.

565
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:55,842
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you a letter
every day you're gone,

566
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,812
I know they won't deliver them.
I won't even mail them.

567
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:01,681
But I'm going to write just the same.
That way, we'll kind of be in touch.

568
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,245
That way, we'll feel close.

569
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,190
Goodbye.

570
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,764
Bye, flyer.

571
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,229
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?

572
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:27,776
I had to be if I was gonna get
such a good looking fellow.

573
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,314
I'll be back.

574
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:44,251
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.

575
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,845
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.

576
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,559
The Bay Bridge?
How about flying under it?

577
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,925
-For why?
-Well, so I can get some pictures.

578
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,021
You know,
shooting up at the superstructure.

579
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:57,032
-Come on, Lawson.
-Do you want to?

580
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,297
-Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy.
-Thanks.

581
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,097
I hope there are no cables
hanging under that span.

582
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,572
Here we go.

583
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:25,318
Let's take a turn and go it again.
I forgot to put film in.

584
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:27,192
We're due at the field. Forget it.

585
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,958
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.

586
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,397
Hey, look.

587
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,897
McClure, take a look down there.

588
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:40,074
-It's a carrier.
-Yeah. And look at her deck.

589
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:44,402
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.

590
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:46,548
Kind of small, isn't she?

591
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:51,110
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to gunner.
Pilot to gunner.

592
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:52,950
Thatcher. Thatcher.

593
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,050
It's dead again.

594
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,525
We'd better report it to Doolittle
when we get in.

595
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:01,928
Yeah, that left engine along with it.
Still seem a little rough to you?

596
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:04,330
I can't tell anymore.

597
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:16,872
-Is everything okay on your ship?
-Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.

598
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,646
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's
wharf. They'll take care of you there.

599
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,979
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,429
They don't even wait
until a fellow gets out.

601
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:42,767
-All Navy guys are cocky.
-Miller's a Navy guy.

602
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,831
Well, Miller isn't exactly Navy. He's a pilot.

603
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:00,787
Hey, Spike.

604
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,091
-Spike.
-Spike, what's the matter?

605
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:10,189
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump

606
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:11,995
and Doolittle told me to take her
to the hangar.

607
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:13,558
Well, then you're not going?

608
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:15,627
No, and there's nothing really wrong
with that plane.

609
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:18,503
-It's the best ship in the squad.
-Boy, that's rough.

610
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,543
And I nearly told him
about our interphone.

611
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,100
You would've been a cooked goose.

612
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:24,146
I think, sir,
I'll go and watch those Navy guys.

613
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,877
-They might bang her up or something.
-That's a good idea.

614
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:34,352
How do you like that?

615
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:43,425
They're going to break
the Duck's back sure.

616
00:46:43,499 --> 00:46:47,060
How did we get in the clutches
of these Navy guys anyhow?

617
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:57,971
-Boy, that's an awful big ship.
-Yeah, let's take a look at her.

618
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,916
-So long, Spike.
-So long, Spike.

619
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,714
-Be seeing you, Spike.
-Goodbye, fellows.

620
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,825
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.

621
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:13,419
-Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to...
-306, sir.

622
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,326
-306.
-This way, sir.

623
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,995
See you guys later.

624
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:20,461
Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.

625
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,428
These are your quarters, sir.

626
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,439
Mr. White and Mr. Felton
are on shore leave.

627
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,838
Thank you.

628
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,404
Are you sure you'll be able
to find your way back up to the deck, sir?

629
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,140
Oh, sure. Thanks.

630
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:09,238
What are you doing down here?

631
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:12,475
Oh, just looking around.
What are you doing here?

632
00:49:12,548 --> 00:49:14,311
Just looking around.

633
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:20,013
-Are you lost too?
-Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.

634
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,250
I've been walking for miles.

635
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:25,319
This is the biggest
cockeyed ship I've ever seen.

636
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,363
Yeah. And I wish the deck
was twice as big.

637
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,593
The smoking lamp is out.
The smoking lamp is out.

638
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:38,101
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out"
means no smoking anywhere on the ship.

639
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:39,732
-Okay.
-Why is that?

640
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:43,370
Because they're refueling, sir.
They'll let us know when they're through.

641
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:46,972
Hello.

642
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:48,880
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?

643
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:51,249
Yeah, we've just been
looking the tub over.

644
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,787
-How are your quarters?
-Perfect.

645
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,584
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.

646
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:58,650
A cot? Follow me, brothers.
I'm gonna show you real quarters.

647
00:49:58,728 --> 00:50:00,491
And I mean quarters.

648
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,330
Hats. Hats.

649
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,466
-Well, look at what's here.
-Well, we have guests.

650
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,737
What's the idea of bringing people up here
from the tenement district?

651
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:18,438
This is jocularly known
as the admiral's cabin.

652
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,874
Looks like you guys
are going to have to start bathing.

653
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,942
This isn't all.
There's something else. Follow me.

654
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,647
I'd be glad to.

655
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,250
Careful of the rugs, please.

656
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:36,094
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something
to really feast your peepers on.

657
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:39,896
The first guy turns in after dinner
gets this bed for the trip.

658
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,267
You know who that'll be. Enter.

659
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,674
What dirty, lowlife...
Come out of there, you boll weevil!

660
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:53,579
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.

661
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,715
How did all this scum get in?

662
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:57,115
And me in an Army cot.

663
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:59,746
That's where he'll end up,
before the night's over.

664
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:01,517
-Let's get out of here.
-Oh, Lieutenant!

665
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,922
When you guys go down to dinner,

666
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:05,358
would you mind
bringing back a roast beef sandwich, rare,

667
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:08,329
and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.

668
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,706
-Well, are you still glad you came along?
-Sure. Aren't you?

669
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:25,042
-I've got a funny feeling about this job.
-Yeah?

670
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:29,142
I think maybe it isn't going to be
as much of a cinch as we figured on.

671
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:31,812
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

672
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,721
Well, my ship's over there.
I think I'll go take a look at it.

673
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,280
Well, the Duck's up ahead. I'll see you in
the morning.

674
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,224
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

675
00:51:46,802 --> 00:51:48,167
Who's that?

676
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,735
-That you, Thatcher?
-Oh, yes, sir.

677
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:53,775
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.

678
00:51:56,946 --> 00:51:59,005
Got her pretty well lashed down,
haven't they?

679
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:01,311
Yes, sir. They did a good job.

680
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,710
I was kind of worried about her,

681
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:06,914
so I thought
I'd better come up and have a look.

682
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,224
You lonesome?

683
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,392
I guess everybody is a little, sir.

684
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:16,090
Don't bother with the sirs, Dave.
Your quarters all right?

685
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,796
-Yeah. Fine.
-Grub's good, too, isn't it?

686
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:21,530
The best I've had in a long time, sir.

687
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:26,272
What are you going to do
when we get back home, Thatcher?

688
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:30,938
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir.
I'm going to marry her, if we get back.

689
00:52:31,213 --> 00:52:33,408
Oh, we'll get back all right.

690
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:37,685
Oh, hello.

691
00:52:38,087 --> 00:52:39,577
-Hello.
-Hello.

692
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:46,190
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars
for a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.

693
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,321
Pretty foggy, all right.

694
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,707
-What are you guys doing here?
-Oh, just getting a little air.

695
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:05,205
-Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below.
-Yeah, it sure is.

696
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:10,276
You guys worry over the ruptured duck
like a bunch of old maids.

697
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:12,183
Me, I'm going to bed.

698
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:14,319
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

699
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,914
Goodnight, Ted.

700
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:18,393
Wonderful air, isn't it?

701
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:22,731
The smoking lamp is lit.
The smoking lamp is lit.

702
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,710
-What's wrong? What happened?
-Just battle stations.

703
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:45,447
Around sunup and sundown
the pig boats give us a little trouble

704
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:46,681
so we always lay for them.

705
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,348
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.

706
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,483
-Glad to see you.
-Glad to see you.

707
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,686
-How are you?
-See you later.

708
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,560
-Are we underway?
-For the last five hours.

709
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:57,861
Glad to have you aboard, Army.

710
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,332
General Quarters,
man your battle stations.

711
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,735
Army personnel, man your planes.

712
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,431
Boy, the only way you're going to get
that thing off of here is with a crane.

713
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:34,492
Maybe so. But we kind of think
we can take off on our own power.

714
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:36,964
Hey, where'd they come from?

715
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:39,899
That's what's known as an escort.

716
00:54:39,975 --> 00:54:41,875
They just slipped up on us
during the night.

717
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:44,208
The Navy likes to do things quietly.

718
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,306
Looks like it's really going to be a show,
doesn't it?

719
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,987
Boy, did I hate to part skin
from sheet this morning. What a bed.

720
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,083
Oh, this is Shorty Manch.
Jig White and Bud Felton.

721
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:56,522
-Hello.
-Hi y'all.

722
00:54:56,592 --> 00:54:59,584
This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom
off the admiral's cabin.

723
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:03,154
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations,
but nothing much to do.

724
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:06,057
I thought there'd at least be a poker game
or something going on.

725
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh, I guess they have them
every once in a while.

726
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,131
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever
play much of that around here?

727
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,539
What's Seven-Toed Pete?

728
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:16,669
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

729
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,579
-I'd be glad to teach it to you some time.
-Never heard of it.

730
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,548
Attention, Army personnel!

731
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:25,075
Attention, Army personnel!
Assemble in Ward Room.

732
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:26,815
-See you later, fellows.
-Assemble in Ward Room.

733
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:30,017
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows.
We'll certainly have to get together soon.

734
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:32,754
Maybe we can get up
that little game of poker.

735
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,019
See you later.

736
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:41,095
You know,
I believe that boy wants to play poker.

737
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:44,628
I wonder if they got their pay
before they came aboard.

738
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,607
As you were.

739
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,240
For the benefit of those
who haven't already guessed,

740
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,547
we're going straight to Japan.

741
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:02,221
The Navy will take us within 400 miles
of the Japanese mainland.

742
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:05,522
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

743
00:56:06,395 --> 00:56:09,796
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

744
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:13,325
It'll be a night job and

745
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:17,202
you will be given the opportunity
of choosing the city you prefer.

746
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:22,074
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

747
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:27,338
The Chinese have prepared small fields
just outside of Japanese occupied territory

748
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,441
for us to land on after the raid.

749
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,112
They'll gas us up
and we'll take off for Chungking.

750
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,555
From now on we're in constant danger
of enemy attack.

751
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:38,483
If there should be a surface attack,

752
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,552
stand by your planes
with fire extinguishers

753
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,722
and let the Navy handle it.

754
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:47,861
If there should be an attack by air,
take off and make for the nearest land.

755
00:56:48,604 --> 00:56:52,438
The Navy will give all navigators
their bearings twice a day.

756
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,974
Now once more, I want to emphasize
that if...

757
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:02,006
If any of you feel you're not up to this job,
it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

758
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:06,215
We have a few spare men
and I think we can fill your place.

759
00:57:09,124 --> 00:57:12,059
Get together with Captain York
and find out what to do with your planes.

760
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:14,152
We'll meet here
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

761
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,255
Are there any questions?

762
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:21,728
Colonel, do you mind if we smoke
during these assemblies?

763
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:29,611
I have no objection to that
if the Navy hasn't. Anything else?

764
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:30,906
Dismissed.

765
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:36,010
48, 49, 50.

766
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:39,919
51, 52, 53, 54,

767
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,720
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.

768
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:46,920
-Just getting a little exercise.
-Yeah? Well, I wasn't.

769
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,624
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.

770
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:50,889
Nine...

771
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:54,868
Attention, all personnel. You have been
wondering about the mission we are on.

772
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,063
I think you might like to know

773
00:57:56,138 --> 00:57:59,505
that the Army personnel on the Hornet
are going to bomb Japan.

774
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:03,136
We of the Navy are going to take them in
as close to the enemy as possible.

775
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:04,611
This is a chance for all of us

776
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,171
to give the Japs
a dose of their own medicine.

777
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:09,149
It's an Army-Navy show.

778
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,286
Let's extend every courtesy
to the Army men on the Hornet

779
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:14,481
who are going to do the job.

780
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,558
Good luck, good hunting

781
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,054
and may God speed us on our mission.

782
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,461
Have some?

783
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:24,755
Thanks, buddy.

784
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,665
You're awfully lucky for guys
who never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.

785
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,340
They tell me
Virginia's a great hunting country, too.

786
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:40,644
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.

787
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:43,014
-What's the bet?
-It's up to you, Manch.

788
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:45,315
Don't they call Virginia
the Mother of Presidents?

789
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:47,855
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.

790
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,448
Up ten.

791
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:51,220
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too,
didn't he?

792
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:52,351
I drop.

793
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,453
A lot of guys lived there.

794
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,556
Are you sure you never
played Seven-Toed Pete before?

795
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,157
Makes it ten to you, Manch.

796
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:02,795
Have they finally gotten that hookworm
situation under control down there?

797
00:59:02,871 --> 00:59:05,704
There never has been
a case of hookworm in Virginia.

798
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:08,572
-I've got a small straight.
-Mine's seven to the jack.

799
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:09,906
All pink.

800
00:59:10,412 --> 00:59:13,108
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.

801
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,308
-Somebody's won a lot of dough.
-A little.

802
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:17,545
-You just had a run of bad cards, Manch.
-Yeah.

803
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,052
What say we get together again
pretty soon?

804
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:20,554
Oh, sure. See you later.

805
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:24,353
Say, you haven't got any books
on Virginia, have you, Manch?

806
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:28,856
You Army guys are real pigeons.
I wish you were in the Navy.

807
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:34,267
You take the bunk, Lawson.
I'll sleep here, if you don't mind.

808
00:59:34,336 --> 00:59:37,362
-What's the idea?
-That thing's as soft as a feather bed.

809
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:39,464
I never could sleep in it.

810
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:49,542
Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

811
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:54,054
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell us
something about a carrier takeoff.

812
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,522
Mr. Randall.

813
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:02,260
From the minute you're in your planes,
I'm the man to watch.

814
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:06,995
Have your engines turning over as soon as
the man in front of you starts taxiing.

815
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:10,061
When I want you to rev up,
I'll give you this.

816
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:12,533
Now, if your engines
don't sound right to me,

817
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:15,736
I may have to keep you revved up
longer than you think necessary,

818
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:18,780
I can hear your engines and tell
when they're missing better than you can.

819
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:22,078
When I want you to start taxiing,
I'll give you this.

820
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:25,746
Now you're in position.
I give you a final rev.

821
01:00:26,722 --> 01:00:30,522
And when I drop it, you're off.

822
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,859
We'll aim you straight for Japan.
One more thing.

823
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:37,489
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs,

824
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:39,397
there can be no delays.

825
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,562
If your plane stalls,
if it doesn't start immediately,

826
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:43,798
if you have any trouble of any kind,

827
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:46,238
we won't have time
to do anything about it.

828
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:49,573
The Navy crew has orders
to push the ship overboard

829
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,875
and make way for the next one.

830
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:55,811
Lieutenant Jurika
has detailed maps and pictures

831
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,182
of cities and specified targets.

832
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:01,188
Mr. Jurika spent
a great many years in Japan.

833
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:04,221
I think it might be a good idea
if he gave you some idea

834
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,227
of what kind of people
you're going to run up against

835
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,092
in case you're forced down.

836
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,129
Mr. Jurika.

837
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:16,536
I was Assistant Naval Attach
at our embassy in Japan,

838
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:20,171
long enough to learn a few things
about the Orient.

839
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,744
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?

840
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:28,112
How should we conduct ourselves
in case we are forced down over Japan?

841
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,913
My advice is, see that you're not
forced down over Japan.

842
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,687
The run I've got figured out for you
starts here.

843
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,794
The smokestacks are bright red brick,
and you can't miss them.

844
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,387
One of the largest smelters in Japan.

845
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:46,525
Then, following the line of the bay
and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

846
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,162
you should take out this and this.

847
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,638
Both of them are machine shops
owned by brothers,

848
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:55,165
I forget their names
but I remember I didn't like them.

849
01:01:56,211 --> 01:02:00,978
Then on out here to drop your incendiary.
How does this line up for you, Lawson?

850
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:02,949
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

851
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:06,317
The run seems all right for me
if it's okay for you.

852
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:08,483
-We can take them out.
-Fine.

853
01:02:08,557 --> 01:02:10,616
Jones, have you got the course
laid out for this run?

854
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:12,683
Yes. Over here, fellows.

855
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,165
Now you'll take off about here.
You go due west to Tokyo

856
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:21,225
at minimum cruising speed,
flying at about 50 feet.

857
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:23,498
When you hit the bay,
get up to about 1,500

858
01:02:23,572 --> 01:02:26,370
complete your bombing run,
then down again and out to sea,

859
01:02:26,441 --> 01:02:30,104
-south by southeast to Yakushima.
-Can we take the maps with us?

860
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,510
All you need.

861
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,979
Be sure there are no marks
on them though,

862
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:34,606
which might show the Japs
where you came from

863
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,583
in case you're captured.

864
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,815
By the way,
I'm taking off first with four incendiaries.

865
01:02:39,888 --> 01:02:41,879
That should light up
Tokyo pretty well for you.

866
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:45,120
Suppose by the time we get to China,
the Japs have taken over the landing field?

867
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,788
The Chinese will arrange a signal for you
when you get to the field

868
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:49,524
if the Japs have captured it.

869
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:52,761
If that's the case you've got to keep
right on going until you've run out of gas

870
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:55,530
then bail out and destroy your planes.

871
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:57,463
Yes.

872
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,063
There's just been a change
in the disposition

873
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:01,632
of the barrage balloons over Tokyo.

874
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:03,640
This balloon and this one

875
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:08,206
were moved this morning
to here and here.

876
01:03:15,557 --> 01:03:18,720
You know,
the changes in those balloons threw me.

877
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:22,959
Just think, a bunch of guys
sweating all day in a sub

878
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:25,864
down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us

879
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:29,362
sneaking up at night
to radio balloon positions.

880
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:32,171
Just let me hear anybody
talk about the Navy again.

881
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,799
Boy, they're good.

882
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:37,402
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.

883
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,742
Oh, you're not kidding.

884
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:43,080
I kind of figured on getting Ellen
a present in Chungking, you know,

885
01:03:43,151 --> 01:03:44,743
a kimono or something.

886
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,981
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.

887
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,922
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.

888
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:52,155
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.

889
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:54,661
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking,

890
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,460
cigarettes sell for 60 cents a carton
on the boat here.

891
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,796
But in Chungking,
I hear the boys will pay seven bucks.

892
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:00,857
Yeah?

893
01:04:00,936 --> 01:04:03,166
So I figure I may load the duck
with coffin nails.

894
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:05,001
Hey, that's an idea.

895
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,879
-It's a good night for subs.
-Yeah.

896
01:04:13,782 --> 01:04:15,306
You know, it's funny.

897
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:19,480
When I was a kid I used to dream
about going someplace on a ship.

898
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,248
Well, here I am.

899
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,658
And out there is Japan.

900
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:27,427
My mother had a Jap gardener once.

901
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:30,196
He seemed like a nice little guy.

902
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,734
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.

903
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,497
It's a funny thing.
I don't like them, but I don't hate them.

904
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,243
I guess I don't either.
You get kind of mixed up.

905
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,369
Yeah.

906
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:46,539
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.

907
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:49,914
All I ever wanted to be
was an aeronautical engineer.

908
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,920
I joined the Army in '40 because I figured
it was the best way to learn.

909
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,684
I wasn't sore at anybody.

910
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,816
But here you suddenly realize
you're going to drop

911
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:01,056
a ton of high explosives
on one of the biggest cities in the world.

912
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:03,097
You're not getting squeamish, are you?

913
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,325
Oh, no, of course not.

914
01:05:04,399 --> 01:05:07,891
I don't pretend to like the idea
of killing a bunch of people

915
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:09,630
but it's the case of drop a bomb on them

916
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,799
or pretty soon
they'll be dropping one on Ellen.

917
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:15,671
Yeah, that's right.

918
01:05:16,311 --> 01:05:18,609
I wonder how many of us will pull through.

919
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,978
Oh, they figure about half.

920
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,209
-And everybody thinks he'll be in that half.
-Yeah.

921
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:28,950
-When are you going to get married, Bob?
-Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.

922
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,584
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.

923
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,595
You know, when this is over
I'd like to get me a small ranch.

924
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,962
Something that'd run about
40 or 50 head of cattle.

925
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,427
A nice well and a house.
It'd be wonderful for kids.

926
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:45,098
I've always been kind of nuts
about ranches myself.

927
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:46,663
You know, in a decent year
you can make real dough

928
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,676
out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.

929
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:52,103
-Why don't we do something like that?
-Well, I'm game if you are.

930
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,978
-Okay, it's a deal.
-Good.

931
01:05:56,885 --> 01:06:01,083
Of course, now if we had 80 head of cattle
we'd really have ourselves a layout.

932
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:04,091
-Yeah, and our own meat too.
-Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs,

933
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,751
the whole works.

934
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:07,353
You know,
a guy who's got himself a place,

935
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:08,794
he doesn't have to worry about anything.

936
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:12,860
-And with a little hunting near.
-Oh, sure, that's easy.

937
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,563
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.

938
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,969
In the event of an emergency
there will be no assembly.

939
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:24,307
No last minute instructions.
We'll just take off.

940
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:27,246
If you should develop motor trouble
within a half hour after leaving the Hornet,

941
01:06:27,315 --> 01:06:29,476
fly back to the ship and land in the water.

942
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:32,286
The Navy will try to fish you out.

943
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:36,121
If trouble should develop after that time,
you'll have to keep right on going.

944
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,558
Because by that time the fleet
will have to fire on any craft overhead.

945
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,620
I don't want you to throw out
the extra cans of gas as you use them.

946
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:45,632
That would leave a perfect trail
for the Japs to follow back to the Hornet.

947
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,897
Save the cans
and throw them all out at one time.

948
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:53,402
Now let me repeat something
I've said previously.

949
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:58,308
You are to bomb the military targets
assigned to you and nothing else.

950
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:04,944
Of course, in an operation of this kind
you cannot avoid killing civilians.

951
01:07:05,053 --> 01:07:07,920
Because war plants
are manned by civilians.

952
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:12,387
If any of you have any moral feelings
about this necessary killing,

953
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,522
if you feel that you might
think of yourself afterward as a murderer,

954
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:19,658
I want you to drop out.
We'll find someone to take your place.

955
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:22,669
And I promise you that no one
will blame you for your feelings.

956
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:27,868
Barring any sudden switch in plans,
we'll take off tomorrow night.

957
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,980
There's one thing more.

958
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:38,446
When we meet in Chungking
I'm going to throw you a party

959
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,421
that you can tell your grandchildren about.

960
01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:51,302
You're a great bunch of guys.
I'm proud to be associated with you.

961
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:54,769
Good luck.

962
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:59,836
-12 cartons of cigarettes.
-12 cartons?

963
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:00,899
Say, what gives with the Army?

964
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:02,775
I've never sold
so many cigarettes in my life.

965
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:05,748
-We're chain smokers.
-You must eat them. What kind will it be?

966
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:06,942
Oh, any kind.

967
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:09,486
-You just want lots of cigarettes.
-You hit it right on the head.

968
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:10,918
All right.

969
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:15,317
That'll be $7.20.

970
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,676
Now hear this. Our carrier task force has
been sighted by enemy surface vessels.

971
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:36,702
All Army pilots and crews,
man your planes for immediate takeoff.

972
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:40,048
There goes a Jap
just three minutes after we sighted her.

973
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,553
Yeah. That means she had two minutes
to tell Tokyo what she saw.

974
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,818
Now hear this.
Get all bombs loaded on the double.

975
01:08:46,891 --> 01:08:49,485
-Are you all packed?
-Have been for five days, sir.

976
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,585
Good. Better watch how those guys
handle the Duck.

977
01:08:51,662 --> 01:08:52,651
I will, sir.

978
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,220
And don't tell anybody
about that bumped turret.

979
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,765
I won't, sir.

980
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:59,866
-Hey, we're off, aren't we?
-Yeah!

981
01:08:59,937 --> 01:09:02,599
Oh, bomb me, daddy!

982
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:06,275
I think I've got everything packed.

983
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:07,503
-Swell, thanks.
-I'm sorry we couldn't have

984
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,045
picked out a little better weather for you.

985
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:11,946
-We'll make it. So long, Felton.
-Give them a pasting they'll never forget.

986
01:09:12,016 --> 01:09:14,883
We will. Look, thanks for everything.

987
01:09:14,952 --> 01:09:18,718
You guys in the Navy,
well, you're okay. Be seeing you.

988
01:09:20,191 --> 01:09:23,957
Now hear this.
Clear the flight deck to start engines.

989
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,734
Hey, how about my change?

990
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,548
They're giving us fifteen
extra cans instead of ten.

991
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:56,582
Good. At least getting off now will
put us over Tokyo in daylight.

992
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,651
Don't forget about
the barrage balloons in daylight too.

993
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:00,026
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good

994
01:10:00,097 --> 01:10:01,564
because you can get better
pictures in the daytime.

995
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:05,398
-You're not kidding about that, either.
-Let's give her a final check.

996
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,300
Hey, Bob.

997
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:14,909
-What?
-Are you up ahead?

998
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:16,139
Fourth spot.

999
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:17,646
See you in Chungking.

1000
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,305
You said it, brother.

1001
01:10:33,197 --> 01:10:35,927
-How they doing?
-Doolittle will be off any second.

1002
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,458
Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray
and Davey Jones, we're seventh.

1003
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,662
Seven's a lucky number.

1004
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:46,199
Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey.
Put these some place, will you?

1005
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:48,006
-What are they?
-Sizzle platters.

1006
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:50,979
I've got the phonograph in my ship.
But I haven't got room for the records.

1007
01:10:51,048 --> 01:10:54,313
We'll meet in Chungking
and cut a Chinese rug.

1008
01:10:54,385 --> 01:10:55,852
Okay, Shorty.

1009
01:10:58,222 --> 01:11:00,918
-Take care of these, will you, McClure?
-Right.

1010
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:04,925
-Pilot to gunner.
-Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.

1011
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:06,929
Take a look at the turret
if you get a chance.

1012
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:09,329
I've been working on that, sir.
She's still jammed.

1013
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,061
We'll use the auxiliary
power if we have to.

1014
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:12,261
Right, sir.

1015
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,270
We've got ourselves in a fine jam,
haven't we, Lawson?

1016
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:17,364
Well, this is a great time to think of that.

1017
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:19,466
Oh, no, I mean having to take off ahead
of schedule.

1018
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:23,238
Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport.
I guess maybe I'm a little on edge.

1019
01:11:23,314 --> 01:11:26,147
-Bomb bay clear?
-Bomb bays clear.

1020
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:31,385
-Clear on right?
-Clear on right.

1021
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,556
-Clear on left?
-Clear on left.

1022
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:39,616
He made it. He made it.

1023
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,123
Get your flaps up.

1024
01:13:00,711 --> 01:13:01,700
Hey!

1025
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:04,710
Good luck, fellows.
Hand them a couple for the Navy.

1026
01:13:04,782 --> 01:13:06,841
-We sure will, Miller.
-And thanks to you.

1027
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:08,976
Wish I were going with you. So long.

1028
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:10,042
-So long.
-So long.

1029
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,382
Goodbye, boys.

1030
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:29,332
-Four more ahead of us.
-Let's start the engines.

1031
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:30,430
Let's go.

1032
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:33,965
-Clear on right?
-Clear on right?

1033
01:13:34,044 --> 01:13:35,341
Clear on right.

1034
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:43,077
Clear on left?

1035
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:44,415
Clear on left.

1036
01:14:10,748 --> 01:14:13,376
Those Navy guys are moving up
to push us over.

1037
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:17,810
They're not gonna
toss this ship overboard.

1038
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:21,120
Come on, baby. Give.

1039
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,723
Give. Give.

1040
01:14:36,907 --> 01:14:38,374
Check hydraulic pressure.

1041
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:40,842
-Hydraulic pressure okay.
-Check brake pressure.

1042
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:41,900
Okay.

1043
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:44,344
There goes Bob.

1044
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:52,612
Two more ahead of us.

1045
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:54,423
Check fuel booster.

1046
01:14:54,892 --> 01:14:56,917
Hey, Army. Ted!

1047
01:14:57,828 --> 01:14:59,420
Give them for me.

1048
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,924
When we get to Chungking,
we'll tell them it was a Navy show too.

1049
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,527
They'll know that when they see
how broke you are. Good hunting.

1050
01:15:19,049 --> 01:15:21,483
-Bomb bay doors closed.
-Bomb bays closed.

1051
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:24,646
-Pilot to gunner. All set, Thatcher?
-Everything okay, sir.

1052
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:26,746
-Wing flaps down.
-Wing flaps coming down.

1053
01:15:26,824 --> 01:15:28,314
There goes Hallmark.

1054
01:15:46,243 --> 01:15:48,734
We're taking off, fellows. Happy landings.

1055
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,297
Phew!

1056
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:54,599
Yeah.

1057
01:17:04,288 --> 01:17:05,880
Both the flaps up.

1058
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:09,692
We didn't even have them down.

1059
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:12,291
How do you like that?
I wonder what else we forgot.

1060
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:14,660
Coffee, sandwiches, water, plenty.

1061
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:39,088
Pilot to gunner. Thatcher.

1062
01:17:41,058 --> 01:17:43,026
Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.

1063
01:17:43,093 --> 01:17:46,062
-You all right, Thatcher?
-Yes, sir.

1064
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:47,494
You'd better get started on those cans.

1065
01:17:47,564 --> 01:17:50,431
-We've burned over 40 gallons already.
-Yes, sir.

1066
01:17:53,637 --> 01:17:55,696
Well, we're on our way.

1067
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:58,969
If anybody's carrying a rabbit's foot,
hang on to it tight.

1068
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:16,324
What's our position, McClure?

1069
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,855
I figure about an hour and 58 minutes
from the coast.

1070
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:21,898
Get that, Thatcher? We can
expect their fighters any time now.

1071
01:18:21,965 --> 01:18:24,160
-Keep your eyes open.
-Watching, sir.

1072
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:27,327
There's nothing in sight.
Could we try out this turret again?

1073
01:18:27,404 --> 01:18:29,531
Okay. Relay switch on.

1074
01:18:36,847 --> 01:18:37,871
It works all right, sir,

1075
01:18:37,948 --> 01:18:40,678
but that emergency power's not going to
hold out long if we run into trouble.

1076
01:18:40,751 --> 01:18:42,218
Turning it off now.

1077
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,689
-How far are we behind our first gang?
-About an hour.

1078
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:48,122
Then we really can get set for trouble.

1079
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,957
Yeah, but nothing like what the guys
behind us are going to run into.

1080
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:54,726
I'd feel a lot better on a night job.

1081
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:58,527
Did you hear that left engine miss?

1082
01:18:59,102 --> 01:19:01,366
No, singing like a lark.

1083
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,668
I must be hearing things.

1084
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,808
Navigator to pilot.

1085
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,109
Pilot to Navigator. Go ahead.

1086
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:19,815
We ought to hit
the Japanese coast any minute.

1087
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:30,655
Look.

1088
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,801
-See that flag?
-Yeah.

1089
01:19:40,377 --> 01:19:43,835
-Saving bombs today.
-They're waving at us.

1090
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:46,006
Those guys must be nuts.

1091
01:19:51,755 --> 01:19:53,723
Japanese coast straight ahead.

1092
01:19:54,691 --> 01:19:55,680
Fujiyama.

1093
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:19,341
We'll be catching
buckshot any second now.

1094
01:22:17,167 --> 01:22:18,156
Zeros.

1095
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:21,765
-Pilot to...
-I saw them, sir.

1096
01:22:21,838 --> 01:22:25,239
-Shall I turn the power on for the turret?
-No, wait a minute.

1097
01:22:36,753 --> 01:22:40,814
I don't know what happened to them, sir.
I guess they didn't see us.

1098
01:23:12,322 --> 01:23:14,119
There she is fellows. Take a good gander.

1099
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,748
When we get back home,
the folks will want to know what

1100
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,588
Tokyo used to look like.

1101
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,654
That must be Davey Jones giving them
the works.

1102
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:39,039
Pilot to bombardier, bomb bay doors open.

1103
01:24:54,691 --> 01:24:58,058
-There we are, the big red smokestack.
-Pilot to bombardier,

1104
01:24:58,128 --> 01:25:00,392
-approaching smelter.
-I'm on it.

1105
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,495
They've got our altitude.

1106
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:11,033
One away.

1107
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:21,548
Two away.

1108
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:33,926
Three away.

1109
01:25:45,775 --> 01:25:47,265
Four away.

1110
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:12,595
-Six fighters just above and to the right.
-Have you got them, Thatcher?

1111
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,261
Ready for them, sir.

1112
01:26:22,145 --> 01:26:23,942
Why don't they dive?

1113
01:26:28,418 --> 01:26:29,885
They're going away.

1114
01:26:30,687 --> 01:26:34,680
We're not going to wait for them to
come back. We're getting out of here.

1115
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,892
Well, I guess maybe
we're in that lucky half.

1116
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:51,068
Not yet. Not till we get to China.

1117
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:04,109
Wow. What a headache.

1118
01:27:18,968 --> 01:27:21,596
-Were you scared?
-I'm still scared.

1119
01:27:21,938 --> 01:27:25,931
-McClure, on our course?
-On our course.

1120
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:38,715
A hundred and sixty gallons.
I hope it's enough to get us to Changchow.

1121
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:41,685
Yeah, and I hope the Japs
don't get there first.

1122
01:28:00,677 --> 01:28:02,770
What's the dope, McClure?

1123
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:05,581
About 200 miles to Changchow.

1124
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:10,585
-And we ought to hit the coast any minute.
-We'll never find it in the dark.

1125
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:13,419
Pilot to crew.

1126
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:17,721
We're going up and flying on instruments.
When the gas is gone we'll bail out.

1127
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:53,493
We'll buzz it. Maybe we can land.
Keep a lookout for rocks or logs.

1128
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,309
All set for landing.
McClure, get our guns out.

1129
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:18,979
Take off chutes and be sure your life
jackets are on. Carry your guns.

1130
01:29:19,055 --> 01:29:21,250
Wheels down. Flaps down.

1131
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,291
Air speed 135.

1132
01:29:29,866 --> 01:29:30,958
130.

1133
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:34,068
110.

1134
01:31:18,074 --> 01:31:20,065
I lost my ship.

1135
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:24,104
I lost my ship.

1136
01:31:39,128 --> 01:31:43,155
-You hurt bad?
-I don't... I don't know.

1137
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,706
I can't move my arms.

1138
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:27,069
Your leg, it's all busted up, sir.

1139
01:32:27,143 --> 01:32:29,134
Get Davenport.

1140
01:33:23,466 --> 01:33:27,197
Ted, Ted, look at me.

1141
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:29,332
That baby and I...

1142
01:33:29,405 --> 01:33:31,396
We won't ever need anything but you.

1143
01:33:31,741 --> 01:33:35,006
We mustn't either of us be scared
about it, Ted,

1144
01:33:35,077 --> 01:33:39,480
because the baby, the baby's
why I know you're coming back to us.

1145
01:33:49,525 --> 01:33:50,685
Lawson!

1146
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:15,407
Shall I shoot them, Lieutenant?

1147
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:27,286
No, hold it.

1148
01:34:27,363 --> 01:34:29,854
-But they may be Japs, sir.
-Don't shoot, Thatcher.

1149
01:34:29,932 --> 01:34:31,923
Hey! Hey!

1150
01:34:57,827 --> 01:35:01,786
He says he's Chinese.
What's that word for American?

1151
01:35:27,857 --> 01:35:29,984
That leg's got to be sewn up, sir.

1152
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:32,216
It's split wide open.

1153
01:37:03,185 --> 01:37:04,948
Me, Charlie.

1154
01:37:05,955 --> 01:37:07,013
Americans.

1155
01:37:07,089 --> 01:37:09,387
-We're Americans.
-American.

1156
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:11,651
Americans.

1157
01:37:11,927 --> 01:37:16,091
We need a doctor, and some help

1158
01:37:16,532 --> 01:37:18,898
to get to Changchow.

1159
01:37:19,869 --> 01:37:21,598
Chiang Kai-shek.

1160
01:37:22,505 --> 01:37:26,703
-We're his friends. In Chungking.
-Chungking!

1161
01:37:26,776 --> 01:37:27,936
-Yes.
-That's right.

1162
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,602
We go Chungking.

1163
01:37:30,412 --> 01:37:35,076
Chungking many, many days. Many.

1164
01:37:35,484 --> 01:37:37,679
Doctor. Doctor.

1165
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:42,549
Charlie, go, go doctor.
Charlie, bring doctor here.

1166
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:45,383
Charlie, bring doctor or we die.

1167
01:37:45,628 --> 01:37:48,188
Doctor, one li.

1168
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,830
One li, that's a Chinese mile.

1169
01:37:51,634 --> 01:37:54,933
One li. Go.

1170
01:37:55,938 --> 01:37:57,565
Bring doctor.

1171
01:37:58,774 --> 01:38:04,269
Doctor, Japanese man. Japanese doctor.

1172
01:38:05,681 --> 01:38:09,242
Maybe Japanese man, Japanese soldier,

1173
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:11,411
come here.

1174
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:15,722
Japanese man no come at night.

1175
01:38:47,823 --> 01:38:50,485
Boat, you go boat.

1176
01:39:29,765 --> 01:39:31,096
Let's go.

1177
01:40:22,551 --> 01:40:23,916
Hey, cut that out.

1178
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:42,470
I think he wants to trade
bullets with you, Thatcher.

1179
01:40:49,845 --> 01:40:50,834
Friend.

1180
01:40:52,114 --> 01:40:53,979
Charlie, friend.

1181
01:40:55,017 --> 01:40:56,746
Charlie, go. Charlie, friend.

1182
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:00,084
Sure, Charlie, friend. Goodbye, Charlie.

1183
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,967
The Japs must be all around us.

1184
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:25,669
-I wonder where the rest of the gang is?
-Scattered all over the China coast,

1185
01:41:26,715 --> 01:41:28,307
if they're alive.

1186
01:41:38,794 --> 01:41:42,753
I think I'm going to pass out.

1187
01:41:44,066 --> 01:41:47,297
-I, Ted, take you, Ellen.
-To be my lawfully wedded wife.

1188
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:48,893
To be my lawfully wedded wife.

1189
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:52,372
-To have and to cherish.
-To have and to cherish.

1190
01:41:52,441 --> 01:41:54,909
Until death us do part.

1191
01:41:57,513 --> 01:41:59,378
Until death us do part.

1192
01:41:59,448 --> 01:42:01,313
Until death us do part.

1193
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,414
Until death us do part.

1194
01:42:03,852 --> 01:42:07,083
Don't let them cut my leg off.
Please, don't let them cut my leg off.

1195
01:42:07,156 --> 01:42:10,319
-Don't let them cut my leg off.
-Lawson, stop it. Lawson.

1196
01:42:11,326 --> 01:42:12,918
-Don't.
-Lawson.

1197
01:42:16,065 --> 01:42:18,499
-What's the matter?
-You were yelling.

1198
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:39,985
Thank you.

1199
01:43:23,499 --> 01:43:25,399
My name is Foo Ling.

1200
01:43:25,968 --> 01:43:28,528
Everything we have is yours.

1201
01:43:28,737 --> 01:43:32,798
We know what you have done
and we honor you for it.

1202
01:43:33,342 --> 01:43:36,573
Our navigator has both
his shoulders broken.

1203
01:43:37,479 --> 01:43:40,073
Is there anybody who
can set them for him?

1204
01:43:40,782 --> 01:43:41,840
No one.

1205
01:43:42,484 --> 01:43:46,215
But we hope that
help will soon arrive for you.

1206
01:43:59,968 --> 01:44:01,230
Thanks.

1207
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:14,246
How are they?

1208
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:20,317
We have washed them.
They are bandaged.

1209
01:44:21,657 --> 01:44:23,352
But we have no medicines.

1210
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:25,784
Not even aspirin.

1211
01:44:28,363 --> 01:44:29,990
What's that?

1212
01:44:46,348 --> 01:44:48,543
-This is Dr. Chung.
-How do you do?

1213
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:52,678
We've come a long way
and we're going home now

1214
01:44:53,255 --> 01:44:55,155
and we've been hunting
a doctor everywhere.

1215
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:56,521
I understand.

1216
01:44:57,226 --> 01:45:00,593
Have you got anything that'll knock
them out, Doctor? They're in awful pain.

1217
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:04,530
We hope to have some medical supplies
by the time we reach my father's hospital.

1218
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,997
Hospital? Where's that?

1219
01:45:07,302 --> 01:45:10,100
In Lin Hai. About 60 li from here.

1220
01:45:10,272 --> 01:45:13,901
-I have come to take you there.
-It's a funny thing, Doctor.

1221
01:45:14,509 --> 01:45:17,967
There were a lot of planes
and we had to take off early.

1222
01:45:18,614 --> 01:45:20,741
-You see how it was.
-Of course.

1223
01:45:20,816 --> 01:45:23,080
They aren't in any shape
to make much of a trip, Doctor.

1224
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:24,516
We'll have to move them at once.

1225
01:45:24,586 --> 01:45:28,386
The Japanese captured one of your
crews yesterday, not very far from here.

1226
01:45:28,457 --> 01:45:31,824
So many planes, and we don't
know what happened to the others.

1227
01:45:34,363 --> 01:45:36,422
All up and down the Chinese Coast.

1228
01:45:36,732 --> 01:45:39,292
My countrymen are seeking
your countrymen.

1229
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:41,363
We'll bring them through.

1230
01:45:50,812 --> 01:45:52,404
I have some money.
I want to give it to you.

1231
01:45:52,514 --> 01:45:55,347
Please, Lieutenant,
you have given us enough already.

1232
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:58,318
-What?
-The bombs you dropped on Japan.

1233
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,654
Please, now try to rest.

1234
01:46:30,786 --> 01:46:34,552
The Japanese, they are in the village
we just left.

1235
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:44,727
-Chan.
-Mr. Parker.

1236
01:46:45,133 --> 01:46:46,862
-Mrs. Parker.
-Doctor Chan.

1237
01:46:53,742 --> 01:46:55,937
-How are they?
-They are very, very sick.

1238
01:46:56,011 --> 01:46:58,104
-I'll need your help.
-How close are the Japanese?

1239
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:00,648
They took Ching Ming three hours after
our departure.

1240
01:47:00,916 --> 01:47:04,010
One of the American crews has already
fallen into their hands.

1241
01:47:04,419 --> 01:47:06,683
Hadn't they better be taken straight
through to Hop Sai?

1242
01:47:06,822 --> 01:47:08,722
They couldn't stand the trip.

1243
01:47:36,118 --> 01:47:38,313
This is my father, Dr. Chung.

1244
01:47:39,488 --> 01:47:42,616
-The others, please, help them.
-Please, don't worry, Lieutenant.

1245
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:44,691
We'll take care of everybody.

1246
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,865
You won't have to take it off,
will you, Doc?

1247
01:47:57,005 --> 01:47:59,132
We hope not. One cannot tell.

1248
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:02,101
You've had a long journey.
Now you must rest.

1249
01:48:03,078 --> 01:48:06,309
All we had at our Mission was a little
antiseptic fluid and some bandages.

1250
01:48:06,381 --> 01:48:08,474
But we've sent out runners for supplies.

1251
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:10,641
Is there any way I could
get a message out?

1252
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,118
I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay.

1253
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,413
The whole region's swarming
with Japanese.

1254
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:17,117
Well, do you think they've heard back
in the States what happened to us?

1255
01:48:17,192 --> 01:48:19,786
We've been listening in on short wave.
They know all about the raid,

1256
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:21,488
but apparently they're
keeping the details secret

1257
01:48:21,563 --> 01:48:23,121
until the rest of your
men have been saved.

1258
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:24,222
Have they found any of the others?

1259
01:48:24,299 --> 01:48:27,200
We have word that one crew will be
coming through here pretty soon now.

1260
01:48:27,269 --> 01:48:29,635
I understand there's a doctor among them.

1261
01:48:29,704 --> 01:48:32,537
Oh, that must be Lieutenant Smith's crew.
Excuse me.

1262
01:48:34,509 --> 01:48:37,137
Lieutenant Smith's crew
has been rescued, sir.

1263
01:48:37,446 --> 01:48:38,470
Smith's?

1264
01:48:38,547 --> 01:48:42,142
They found Lieutenant Smith
and Doc White and they're coming here.

1265
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:46,047
Don Smith's crew.
The Doc was flying with Don Smith.

1266
01:48:47,522 --> 01:48:49,513
They'll be here any minute now.

1267
01:48:52,127 --> 01:48:53,651
It's funny, isn't it?

1268
01:48:54,262 --> 01:48:58,528
I mean the way Clever's head
just keeps rocking back and forth,

1269
01:48:58,600 --> 01:48:59,897
back and forth.

1270
01:49:00,936 --> 01:49:03,166
Somebody ought to help Clever.

1271
01:49:16,084 --> 01:49:17,847
I think the Chinese are
a swell bunch of people

1272
01:49:17,919 --> 01:49:19,443
but I can't say I go for their music.

1273
01:49:19,521 --> 01:49:22,115
Shorty Manch would go all to pieces
if he heard a little of this.

1274
01:49:22,190 --> 01:49:23,179
Yeah.

1275
01:49:24,693 --> 01:49:25,921
How's Lawson?

1276
01:49:26,628 --> 01:49:28,653
Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir.

1277
01:49:28,763 --> 01:49:30,993
Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in.

1278
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:41,942
Looks like a Jap Zero.

1279
01:50:06,835 --> 01:50:09,326
You guys ought to go on and leave me.

1280
01:50:10,372 --> 01:50:14,900
They think I'm passed out half the time
and I hear what they say.

1281
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:18,741
The Japs are coming closer all the time.
Why don't you guys go?

1282
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,210
We're not sticking around here
because of you, Lawson.

1283
01:50:21,483 --> 01:50:24,475
-None of us here are able to travel yet.
-I was just thinking.

1284
01:50:24,786 --> 01:50:27,755
I guess Ellen and I aren't
going to ski anymore.

1285
01:50:29,024 --> 01:50:30,753
That's too bad.

1286
01:50:31,893 --> 01:50:34,418
I was going to teach her some fancy stuff.

1287
01:50:34,829 --> 01:50:37,354
Now don't start talking like that.
You're going to pull through all right.

1288
01:50:37,432 --> 01:50:42,165
What do you think a girl would do?
I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski.

1289
01:50:43,872 --> 01:50:46,841
Be kind of funny if they cut my leg off,
wouldn't it?

1290
01:50:47,475 --> 01:50:48,703
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

1291
01:50:48,777 --> 01:50:51,337
Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right.

1292
01:50:51,413 --> 01:50:54,644
You marry a guy,
he's got two arms and two legs.

1293
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,915
Then he comes back and he hasn't any.

1294
01:51:08,029 --> 01:51:09,826
-I am Dr. Chung.
-Where are the boys?

1295
01:51:09,898 --> 01:51:11,058
How are you, Pop?

1296
01:51:12,867 --> 01:51:14,732
Did you have a good trip?

1297
01:51:15,804 --> 01:51:19,035
-Here they are.
-Hi, fellas.

1298
01:51:19,107 --> 01:51:20,836
-How are you?
-How you doing?

1299
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:22,740
-Hello, Sarge.
-It's good to see you.

1300
01:51:22,811 --> 01:51:25,780
-Holy Joe, what happened to you guys?
-Nothing serious.

1301
01:51:25,847 --> 01:51:26,973
The Duck forgot to duck.

1302
01:51:27,048 --> 01:51:29,846
Yeah, McClure's been trying
to do his own flying ever since.

1303
01:51:29,918 --> 01:51:32,478
This really looks like something
left over from a massacre.

1304
01:51:32,554 --> 01:51:34,385
Well, you guys don't
look so good yourselves.

1305
01:51:34,456 --> 01:51:35,753
You don't smell so good either.

1306
01:51:35,824 --> 01:51:38,588
Well, there's nothing wrong with us
that a good bath won't fix.

1307
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:41,720
-I wish we could say the same for you.
-How's the grub around here?

1308
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:45,527
I think I'd like a good thick steak,
French fried onions

1309
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,194
and a baked potato with plenty of butter

1310
01:51:48,269 --> 01:51:50,464
and about three bottles of beer...

1311
01:51:50,872 --> 01:51:53,170
You'll take bean sprouts and like them.

1312
01:51:53,908 --> 01:51:56,638
-Say, where's Lawson and Davenport?
-They're upstairs.

1313
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:59,746
-Lawson's in pretty bad shape.
-You better go up and see him.

1314
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:01,505
He needs you bad, Doc.

1315
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:05,317
Well, it's certainly good to see you
fellows again.

1316
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,746
Hey, Pop, how's the
chop suey around here?

1317
01:52:12,227 --> 01:52:14,127
He doesn't speak English.

1318
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:16,857
I'm sorry, Pop.

1319
01:52:23,004 --> 01:52:27,634
Yeah, and when Shorty jumped,
he had two .45s, a .44 rifle,

1320
01:52:27,709 --> 01:52:31,839
a .22 automatic, that Luger of his,
a hunting knife, a Bowie knife

1321
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:34,108
-and an ax.
-What a guy.

1322
01:52:35,016 --> 01:52:39,112
He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate bars
but he forgot to button his collar.

1323
01:52:39,287 --> 01:52:40,845
So when he pulled the rip cord,

1324
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:44,585
he just naturally
molted candy all over North China.

1325
01:52:44,659 --> 01:52:47,958
-What happened to his photograph?
-It went down with the ship.

1326
01:52:48,129 --> 01:52:51,223
Next morning Manch scared the Chinese
right out of their wits.

1327
01:52:51,299 --> 01:52:53,699
They didn't know anything
human grew that tall.

1328
01:52:54,035 --> 01:52:55,366
What about Bob Gray?

1329
01:52:55,437 --> 01:52:58,838
He's okay.
I think they moved on to Chungking.

1330
01:53:00,542 --> 01:53:04,478
Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me, Charlie"
said to tell you hello.

1331
01:53:05,714 --> 01:53:09,081
If it hadn't been for Charlie,
the Japs would have had us that first day.

1332
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:10,979
Yeah, us too.

1333
01:53:11,586 --> 01:53:14,851
I'd like to come back some day
and fight alongside that guy.

1334
01:53:14,923 --> 01:53:16,049
Me, too.

1335
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:17,891
Well, it's all over.

1336
01:53:18,093 --> 01:53:20,254
Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.

1337
01:53:20,962 --> 01:53:23,055
A pint and a half, that's not bad.

1338
01:53:23,898 --> 01:53:25,092
You'd better get to bed now.

1339
01:53:25,366 --> 01:53:27,357
You're an old grandma, Doc.

1340
01:53:30,605 --> 01:53:33,438
But I'll take it slow, just as a favor to you.

1341
01:53:34,008 --> 01:53:35,600
Be seeing you, Lawson.

1342
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:37,505
Thanks, Doc.

1343
01:53:39,948 --> 01:53:41,415
How's the leg, Doc?

1344
01:53:42,417 --> 01:53:44,009
It's not good, Lawson.

1345
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:47,515
The next forty-eight hours
will tell the story.

1346
01:53:48,823 --> 01:53:49,812
Well, thank you.

1347
01:53:49,891 --> 01:53:51,222
-Hey, Don.
-Yeah?

1348
01:53:51,292 --> 01:53:53,522
Tell Doolittle to hold off that party
till we get there.

1349
01:53:53,595 --> 01:53:55,859
Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you.

1350
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:59,024
-Where's Thatcher?
-He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out.

1351
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,294
Okay.

1352
01:54:00,802 --> 01:54:04,329
I wish you would let me stay here
until you're ready to go, sir.

1353
01:54:04,706 --> 01:54:06,173
These people will take care of us.

1354
01:54:06,241 --> 01:54:10,575
There's no reason for you fellows
to hang around and maybe get caught.

1355
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:14,312
Yeah, I know, but I might come in handy
if the Japs show up, sir.

1356
01:54:16,785 --> 01:54:19,345
Thatcher, when you get back
to the States,

1357
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,944
if you should run into my wife,

1358
01:54:22,323 --> 01:54:23,915
just tell her I'm okay.

1359
01:54:24,893 --> 01:54:28,192
Don't let her know
about anything being wrong.

1360
01:54:29,063 --> 01:54:30,621
I understand, sir.

1361
01:54:34,702 --> 01:54:37,330
And say hello for me
to that girl in Billings.

1362
01:54:38,006 --> 01:54:39,371
That I will, sir.

1363
01:54:40,775 --> 01:54:43,437
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Thatcher.

1364
01:55:11,206 --> 01:55:12,366
Good morning.

1365
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:15,836
-Good morning, Lawson.
-Hi, Doc.

1366
01:55:18,613 --> 01:55:21,173
I'll try not to hurt you, Lawson.
I'll have a look at this.

1367
01:55:30,425 --> 01:55:31,483
Thanks.

1368
01:55:43,638 --> 01:55:45,629
You going to take the leg, Doc?

1369
01:55:46,341 --> 01:55:47,899
Yeah, I think so.

1370
01:55:48,443 --> 01:55:51,276
We talked it over
and there's nothing else to do.

1371
01:55:53,948 --> 01:55:56,382
It's pretty rough
to have to cut a man's leg off.

1372
01:55:56,551 --> 01:55:58,849
I guess it'll be all right.

1373
01:55:59,654 --> 01:56:04,353
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like
wearing a shoe with a high instep.

1374
01:56:06,527 --> 01:56:08,051
When are you gonna do it?

1375
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:10,689
I might as well give you a shot right now.

1376
01:56:10,865 --> 01:56:12,332
You mean we have something
to knock me out?

1377
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,198
Our runners arrived with
anesthetic this morning.

1378
01:56:15,403 --> 01:56:17,337
It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.

1379
01:56:17,572 --> 01:56:20,473
You won't feel anything from
the waist down, but you'll be conscious.

1380
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:22,099
That's the best we can do.

1381
01:56:22,477 --> 01:56:23,910
Oh, swell.

1382
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:28,911
I can watch you and make sure
you don't take off too much.

1383
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:33,147
All right, Lawson.
We'll have to roll you over.

1384
01:56:46,834 --> 01:56:48,324
It'll take a little time to work.

1385
01:56:48,403 --> 01:56:50,803
We'll get you over to the operating room.

1386
01:57:02,684 --> 01:57:04,208
-Doc?
-Yes?

1387
01:57:04,452 --> 01:57:07,080
-How high are you going to cut?
-Oh, not too high.

1388
01:57:07,155 --> 01:57:09,953
-Will I have a knee, Doc?
-I'm afraid not, Lawson.

1389
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:13,586
-Any feeling there?
-No. Look, Doc.

1390
01:57:13,661 --> 01:57:15,959
We can't waste any time, Lawson.
When that anesthetic wears off,

1391
01:57:16,030 --> 01:57:18,089
-we haven't got any more.
-Okay, but just one thing more.

1392
01:57:18,166 --> 01:57:19,155
Yes.

1393
01:57:19,233 --> 01:57:20,632
If anything happens,

1394
01:57:20,702 --> 01:57:23,398
don't let Ellen know
anything about the operation.

1395
01:57:24,105 --> 01:57:27,700
She might just as well think I died
while all in one piece.

1396
01:57:28,109 --> 01:57:30,669
All right, Lawson.
Now, you're not going to feel this.

1397
01:57:30,745 --> 01:57:32,212
But you might get nervous
and jump or something,

1398
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,009
so the nurses are going to hold you.

1399
01:57:34,415 --> 01:57:35,404
Okay, Doc.

1400
01:57:36,184 --> 01:57:37,412
Fire away.

1401
01:57:46,627 --> 01:57:50,256
Oh, when you said "no knee,"
you weren't kidding.

1402
01:57:51,265 --> 01:57:52,789
If I cut any lower
we might have to do it again

1403
01:57:52,867 --> 01:57:54,960
and your system couldn't take it.

1404
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:01,602
What're you stalling for, Doc?

1405
01:58:01,676 --> 01:58:03,701
We're doing the best we can, Lawson.
Take it easy.

1406
01:58:03,778 --> 01:58:05,507
Okay. Only hurry.

1407
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:08,105
It seems like
I'm beginning to feel my other leg.

1408
01:58:16,257 --> 01:58:18,555
It seems like I can move my toes, Doc.

1409
01:58:23,798 --> 01:58:27,325
I think I can move my ankle.
Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can.

1410
01:58:29,804 --> 01:58:32,102
Hurry, Doc, hurry.

1411
01:58:42,984 --> 01:58:44,975
-Hello.
-Hello. Hello, Ellen?

1412
01:58:45,053 --> 01:58:47,283
-Ted, where are you?
-I'm in a lumber camp.

1413
01:58:47,355 --> 01:58:49,949
I had to make a forced landing
in a mud puddle.

1414
01:58:50,024 --> 01:58:52,618
-You aren't hurt, are you?
-No, not a scratch.

1415
01:58:52,794 --> 01:58:57,128
-Have you got the tree all fixed?
-Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it.

1416
01:58:57,498 --> 01:58:59,898
-It's so beautiful.
-Anything under it?

1417
01:58:59,967 --> 01:59:03,198
-Oh, yes.
-Well, let's open them up.

1418
01:59:03,271 --> 01:59:07,264
-Oh, we can't do that.
-Sure we can. Go ahead.

1419
01:59:07,475 --> 01:59:09,500
Well, if you say so.

1420
01:59:09,811 --> 01:59:13,577
I'm not going to be cheated out of my
Christmas by a cracked up airplane.

1421
01:59:13,648 --> 01:59:15,616
Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful

1422
01:59:15,683 --> 01:59:18,345
box of candy
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1423
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:22,216
Good. Isn't there maybe
something else lying around?

1424
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:26,886
-Let me see. Yes, there is.
-Well, open it.

1425
01:59:27,428 --> 01:59:31,592
It's a silk scarf. And it looks like
it's handmade, too.

1426
01:59:32,467 --> 01:59:35,436
-I'll bet it's got my initials on it.
-That's not fair.

1427
01:59:35,503 --> 01:59:38,097
You peeked while I was making it.

1428
01:59:38,406 --> 01:59:39,737
I just know my wife.

1429
01:59:39,807 --> 01:59:43,607
-Oh, Ted, I wish you were here.
-So do I, honey.

1430
01:59:44,078 --> 01:59:46,171
I'll be thinking of you tonight.

1431
01:59:46,247 --> 01:59:50,047
I'll sit in front of the tree and turn
the radio on to Christmas carols

1432
01:59:50,618 --> 01:59:52,552
and just think of you.

1433
02:01:17,138 --> 02:01:20,574
Thank you. And thank you, scouts.

1434
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:25,441
I mean, all the fellows would like
to thank you very much,

1435
02:01:26,314 --> 02:01:27,906
for everything.

1436
02:01:41,362 --> 02:01:45,492
Lieutenant, my father has asked me
to present this to you.

1437
02:01:45,733 --> 02:01:48,896
It has been in our family
since the fifteenth century.

1438
02:01:49,904 --> 02:01:53,499
Father begs me to tell you
that beauty belongs to beauty,

1439
02:01:53,874 --> 02:01:57,173
and asks that you honor him
by presenting it to your wife.

1440
02:02:01,949 --> 02:02:04,247
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1441
02:02:05,486 --> 02:02:08,944
I didn't know that you knew about
Ellen, my wife.

1442
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:12,423
You spoke of her a number of times.

1443
02:02:16,163 --> 02:02:20,463
It says, "This is an American hero
who has bombed Japan.

1444
02:02:20,968 --> 02:02:23,698
"Whenever he goes among
the people of China,

1445
02:02:23,971 --> 02:02:26,963
"let him be accorded respect and honor."

1446
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,608
He has just come from Kow Chai.

1447
02:02:37,685 --> 02:02:39,482
Another one of your crews
has been captured

1448
02:02:39,553 --> 02:02:41,612
and the Japanese are moving
in this direction.

1449
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:43,816
I think Lawson will be able to travel
in a couple of days.

1450
02:02:43,891 --> 02:02:46,359
There's nothing wrong with me, Doc.
I can travel right now.

1451
02:02:46,427 --> 02:02:48,987
I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long.

1452
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:57,294
This is Wang Tsung.

1453
02:02:57,371 --> 02:03:00,238
He has walked all the way from
his native village of Kow Chai.

1454
02:03:00,308 --> 02:03:03,869
And he begs the honor of presenting gifts
to his American Allies.

1455
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:09,308
Thank you.

1456
02:03:11,419 --> 02:03:12,511
Thank you.

1457
02:03:18,392 --> 02:03:19,381
Thanks.

1458
02:03:25,166 --> 02:03:26,690
Thank you very much.

1459
02:03:30,071 --> 02:03:31,163
Thank you.

1460
02:03:51,792 --> 02:03:54,955
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1461
02:04:06,607 --> 02:04:08,837
He felt a lot worse than I did.

1462
02:04:37,304 --> 02:04:38,737
There, I can get along pretty well already.

1463
02:04:38,806 --> 02:04:41,775
I should say very well
for your first day out of bed.

1464
02:04:49,417 --> 02:04:51,942
I guess, I'll have to be a little more careful.

1465
02:04:52,019 --> 02:04:54,544
I don't ever want anybody
to see me do that.

1466
02:04:56,123 --> 02:04:59,490
I don't want anybody to see me
till I get a new leg.

1467
02:05:02,129 --> 02:05:04,393
Lieutenant White, word just came.

1468
02:05:04,465 --> 02:05:07,525
The American plane will pick you up in
Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00.

1469
02:05:07,601 --> 02:05:08,829
Wonderful.

1470
02:05:12,773 --> 02:05:15,970
He says if we don't hurry,
the Japanese may get there first.

1471
02:05:16,043 --> 02:05:17,670
-When are you leaving?
-We're going to stay here.

1472
02:05:17,745 --> 02:05:18,871
We're quite used to it, you know.

1473
02:05:18,946 --> 02:05:20,777
-Here. This may come in handy.
-Thank you.

1474
02:05:20,848 --> 02:05:22,713
You and Mr. Parker
have done so much for us,

1475
02:05:22,783 --> 02:05:23,772
and we'll never forget it.

1476
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:24,875
-Goodbye, Lawson.
-Goodbye.

1477
02:05:24,952 --> 02:05:26,078
-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

1478
02:05:26,153 --> 02:05:28,781
-Goodbye. God bless you.
-Goodbye. Thank you.

1479
02:05:29,523 --> 02:05:32,651
My father wishes me to tell you that
you have honored us with your visit

1480
02:05:32,726 --> 02:05:35,490
and that he will offer prayers
for your safe return to America.

1481
02:05:35,563 --> 02:05:37,087
Isn't he coming along with us?

1482
02:05:37,164 --> 02:05:39,189
Father feels that he must
stay with his people.

1483
02:05:39,266 --> 02:05:40,790
They will need him here.

1484
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:43,829
Goodbye, sir.

1485
02:06:18,105 --> 02:06:20,073
-Goodbye, Doctor.
-Goodbye, sir.

1486
02:06:20,307 --> 02:06:24,607
-Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything.
-I hope, sir, that we may meet again.

1487
02:06:24,678 --> 02:06:25,872
That goes double, Doc.

1488
02:06:25,946 --> 02:06:27,811
Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.

1489
02:06:27,882 --> 02:06:28,940
Thank you.

1490
02:06:29,016 --> 02:06:31,041
If you ever come to the States,
Doctor, look me up, will you?

1491
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:33,018
I'll be in the Portland telephone directory.

1492
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,850
-With pleasure.
-Goodbye, Doctor.

1493
02:06:37,391 --> 02:06:39,086
I have one sorrow, Lieutenant,

1494
02:06:39,159 --> 02:06:42,287
that we did not have the medicine
to ease your pain.

1495
02:06:42,796 --> 02:06:46,926
-You saved my life, Doc.
-I hope someday you will come back to us.

1496
02:06:47,001 --> 02:06:49,435
We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves

1497
02:06:49,503 --> 02:06:52,336
but a lot of guys like us.
And I'd like to be with them.

1498
02:06:52,873 --> 02:06:57,606
-Because you're our kind of people.
-Thank you, sir, and goodbye.

1499
02:07:56,403 --> 02:07:59,531
-Hello.
-Hello.

1500
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:03,777
-Go ahead, sit down.
-Thank you.

1501
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:19,525
I know how you feel. Take it for a while.

1502
02:08:21,895 --> 02:08:23,021
Thanks.

1503
02:08:41,515 --> 02:08:42,641
Smell that?

1504
02:08:45,352 --> 02:08:48,014
That's America. That's the USA.

1505
02:08:50,124 --> 02:08:53,491
Every time I make a trip back,
she smells better and better.

1506
02:08:53,727 --> 02:08:54,716
Yeah.

1507
02:08:56,063 --> 02:08:58,497
-I think I know what you mean.
-I'm from Pittsburgh.

1508
02:08:58,565 --> 02:09:00,965
I know it may seem screwy to you, but

1509
02:09:01,568 --> 02:09:04,036
it seems to me as if I can smell some
of that coal smoke

1510
02:09:04,104 --> 02:09:07,540
right off the old Monongahela River.
That sound crazy?

1511
02:09:07,608 --> 02:09:10,941
No. I'm from California and
I can smell orange blossoms.

1512
02:09:11,011 --> 02:09:13,844
Oh, it couldn't be, that's too far.
It must come from Florida.

1513
02:09:13,914 --> 02:09:16,508
Oh, if you want flavor,
you've got to have a California orange,

1514
02:09:16,583 --> 02:09:20,747
but for smelling, Florida's just as good.

1515
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:42,065
Hello. Yes.

1516
02:09:44,011 --> 02:09:45,171
What's that?

1517
02:09:47,648 --> 02:09:49,741
-Just a minute. Ellen.
-Yes?

1518
02:09:49,817 --> 02:09:51,944
Ellen, Washington on the phone.

1519
02:09:58,092 --> 02:09:59,081
Hello?

1520
02:10:00,194 --> 02:10:02,162
Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson.

1521
02:10:03,363 --> 02:10:06,594
Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle.

1522
02:10:07,367 --> 02:10:09,164
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

1523
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:12,097
No, not a bit excited, General.

1524
02:10:12,573 --> 02:10:16,566
Oh, he's back, Mother.
Ted's back. He's back.

1525
02:10:17,277 --> 02:10:19,837
Oh yes, General, how is he?

1526
02:10:24,952 --> 02:10:25,941
Oh, yes.

1527
02:10:27,554 --> 02:10:29,021
I understand.

1528
02:10:30,691 --> 02:10:32,090
Of course, I do.

1529
02:10:35,028 --> 02:10:37,053
Yes, I'll be ready.

1530
02:10:38,499 --> 02:10:40,490
I know, I know.

1531
02:10:42,336 --> 02:10:44,531
Oh, that's so nice of you, General.

1532
02:10:45,472 --> 02:10:49,499
Yes, thank you.
Oh, yes, thank you, General.

1533
02:10:50,177 --> 02:10:51,269
Thank you.

1534
02:11:04,291 --> 02:11:05,986
Just cry, darling.

1535
02:11:07,261 --> 02:11:08,558
Cry it out.

1536
02:11:10,364 --> 02:11:12,355
He got in this morning, Mother.

1537
02:11:12,466 --> 02:11:15,401
General Doolittle just saw him,
so it's true.

1538
02:11:15,969 --> 02:11:18,802
General Doolittle's sending
a plane ticket for me.

1539
02:11:19,206 --> 02:11:20,969
Ted doesn't want to see me.

1540
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:23,805
He doesn't want to see me
because he's lost his leg

1541
02:11:23,877 --> 02:11:26,437
and he doesn't even want me
to know it's happened

1542
02:11:26,513 --> 02:11:29,641
till he gets a new leg
and learns how to use it.

1543
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:32,277
As if it would make any difference.

1544
02:11:32,352 --> 02:11:36,846
As if anything would make any
difference to me as long as he's alive.

1545
02:11:36,924 --> 02:11:40,519
Oh, I'm going to see him,
I'm going to see him.

1546
02:11:48,769 --> 02:11:49,758
Well,

1547
02:11:51,271 --> 02:11:54,399
that means we have to get your
clothes ready in a hurry.

1548
02:12:00,647 --> 02:12:02,877
Have my things come back from
the cleaners yet?

1549
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:04,281
Let's see, I'll take this suit.

1550
02:12:04,351 --> 02:12:07,582
And my blue coat. He always liked it best.

1551
02:12:10,157 --> 02:12:13,388
I can't take any of these things.
I can't take any of my pretty clothes.

1552
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:15,428
They don't fit me anymore.

1553
02:12:15,495 --> 02:12:16,962
Do you think Ted's going to pay
any attention

1554
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:19,123
to what kind of clothes you wear
or how you look?

1555
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:20,564
He always did.

1556
02:12:21,368 --> 02:12:23,268
Oh, Mother, I'm scared.

1557
02:12:23,604 --> 02:12:25,765
There's nothing to be frightened about.

1558
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:28,032
Lots of people lose a leg or arm

1559
02:12:28,108 --> 02:12:31,134
-and continue living perfectly normal lives.
-I'm not scared about Ted.

1560
02:12:31,245 --> 02:12:34,009
-I'm scared about me.
-About you?

1561
02:12:34,348 --> 02:12:39,342
Well, you see, most husbands and wives
are together while things are changing.

1562
02:12:39,553 --> 02:12:43,284
Husbands get used to things like that
because, well, they're around.

1563
02:12:43,657 --> 02:12:47,115
Ted's been gone all this time
and when he went away, I was so slim.

1564
02:12:47,594 --> 02:12:51,291
All the time he's been gone,
he's been thinking of me like that.

1565
02:12:51,932 --> 02:12:54,560
Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him.

1566
02:12:55,235 --> 02:12:58,329
That's why neither of you is going to
notice any change when you meet.

1567
02:12:58,505 --> 02:13:02,100
-Do you think so, Mother?
-I know so.

1568
02:13:10,817 --> 02:13:14,253
All the same, if I held my coat like this

1569
02:13:14,321 --> 02:13:17,813
when I walk into the room,
don't you think it would hide me,

1570
02:13:17,891 --> 02:13:19,153
just a little?

1571
02:13:28,936 --> 02:13:31,962
Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling?

1572
02:13:32,139 --> 02:13:33,970
-Pretty good, sir.
-You look fine.

1573
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:35,338
Thank you, sir.

1574
02:13:35,776 --> 02:13:38,142
-Won't you sit down, sir?
-Yeah, thanks.

1575
02:13:38,879 --> 02:13:42,645
-Well, got any plans?
-About what, sir?

1576
02:13:42,716 --> 02:13:45,344
Well, about the future. Have you decided
what you're going to do?

1577
02:13:45,419 --> 02:13:46,909
Not particularly, sir.

1578
02:13:46,987 --> 02:13:49,683
I always wanted
to be an aeronautical engineer.

1579
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:52,385
I suppose I'll start studying again

1580
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:54,325
after they muster me out.

1581
02:13:54,394 --> 02:13:56,385
Who said they'd muster you out?

1582
02:13:56,830 --> 02:13:58,525
Well, I won't be much use
to anybody with a...

1583
02:13:58,598 --> 02:14:00,498
What are you talking about?

1584
02:14:00,567 --> 02:14:04,094
Do you think we'd let a man
of your experience get away from us?

1585
02:14:05,038 --> 02:14:08,633
-Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

1586
02:14:11,078 --> 02:14:12,841
I just happened to think
of something, Lawson.

1587
02:14:12,913 --> 02:14:13,902
Yes, sir?

1588
02:14:14,514 --> 02:14:16,175
What about your wife?
Does she knew you're back?

1589
02:14:16,249 --> 02:14:17,614
-No, sir.
-Why not?

1590
02:14:18,385 --> 02:14:22,913
Well, I thought I'd wait till
I get my new leg and my scars fixed up.

1591
02:14:22,990 --> 02:14:24,651
It won't be so much of a shock
to her that way.

1592
02:14:24,725 --> 02:14:28,627
Shock?
What kind of a girl did you marry, anyway?

1593
02:14:28,695 --> 02:14:31,528
She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl.

1594
02:14:31,898 --> 02:14:33,923
Well then, she deserves to know.

1595
02:14:34,501 --> 02:14:35,763
She deserves to see you too.

1596
02:14:35,836 --> 02:14:38,566
No, no, sir.
If you don't mind, I'd rather wait.

1597
02:14:38,872 --> 02:14:40,840
When I see Ellen again,
I'm going to be all dressed up

1598
02:14:40,907 --> 02:14:42,875
and have a new leg.

1599
02:14:43,477 --> 02:14:46,605
And I'm going to take her out
to the best place in town

1600
02:14:47,981 --> 02:14:50,006
and I'm going to dance with her.

1601
02:14:52,552 --> 02:14:55,646
-That may be quite a while, Lawson.
-No, sir.

1602
02:14:55,722 --> 02:14:58,020
You see, I'm getting along fine.
And in a month or two...

1603
02:14:58,091 --> 02:15:00,992
In a month or two
you'll be back at work, hard work.

1604
02:15:04,798 --> 02:15:07,062
Well, I'll try to drop in
on you again, Lawson.

1605
02:15:07,134 --> 02:15:08,601
-I hope you can, sir.
-Goodbye.

1606
02:15:08,668 --> 02:15:09,965
Goodbye, sir.

1607
02:15:16,643 --> 02:15:18,042
Your wife's going to have a baby,
isn't she?

1608
02:15:18,111 --> 02:15:19,271
Yes, sir.

1609
02:15:22,716 --> 02:15:25,742
I've got a couple of kids myself,
both in the service.

1610
02:15:27,721 --> 02:15:31,885
You know, Lawson, if my kids and
all the other kids who are in this thing

1611
02:15:31,958 --> 02:15:36,588
could fix it so this would
really be the last one,

1612
02:15:36,663 --> 02:15:39,291
your kid would get quite a break,
wouldn't he?

1613
02:15:39,499 --> 02:15:41,228
He sure would, sir.

1614
02:16:20,574 --> 02:16:22,769
I just had to come.

1615
02:16:25,645 --> 02:16:28,546
Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you.

1616
02:16:28,615 --> 02:16:30,742
Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.

1617
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:41,122
When things were worst,

1618
02:16:41,194 --> 02:16:43,890
when there didn't seem
to be any chance at all,

1619
02:16:43,964 --> 02:16:47,832
I could see your face, your beautiful face.

1620
02:16:51,238 --> 02:16:54,071
I knew you were coming home, Ted.

1621
02:16:56,243 --> 02:16:57,505
Tell me, honey.

1622
02:16:58,078 --> 02:16:59,773
How come you're so cute?

1623
02:17:00,213 --> 02:17:04,650
I had to be if I was going to get such
a good looking fellow.

1624
02:17:59,739 --> 02:18:00,728
English
