1
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:55,429
你好，請稍等 您的電話，上校
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.

2
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,028
謝謝
Thank you.

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,268
你好，約克上校嗎？ 請講
Hello. Captain York, please.

4
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:04,005
你知道，這件事如果計畫周密
You know, if this thing works out,

5
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,671
將會給我們駐守在從巴丹半島 到新加坡的小夥子們極大的鼓舞
it might give our boys all the way from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.

6
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:11,577
並把那些倭人 趕回他們的小島上去
And it may pull a lot of Japs back to their islands.

7
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,582
一定會的，將軍 我也相信
- It'll work out, General. - I'm sure it will.

8
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,182
喂，約克，我是杜利德
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.

9
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:22,416
約克，我要你準備好 24架B-25轟炸機和志願飛行員
York, I want you to get 24 B-25s with volunteer crews

10
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:25,187
儘快調遣到埃格林空軍基地
down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.

11
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:29,224
這項任務會讓他們 遠離國土三個月
The job will take them out of the country for about three months.

12
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,198
告訴他們這是一項秘密任務
Tell them it's a secret mission.

13
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,167
到達那裡之前 他們是不會知道目的地的
They won't know where they're going until they get there.

14
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,261
對，志願飛行員
That's right, volunteers.

15
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:40,735
告訴他們不准向任何人談起 這是命令
Tell them they're not to talk to anybody. That's an order.

16
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:43,470
我過幾天就會來 好的
I'll join you in a few days. Right.

17
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:51,509
02241呼叫埃格林指揮塔
Zero-two-two-four-one to Eglin Tower.

18
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:54,055
3架B-25請求飛行和降落指示
Three B-25s request traffic and landing instructions.

19
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,180
請講
Go ahead.

20
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,225
41軍，請靠左飛行
<i>Army four-one. The left-hand pattern.</i>

21
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,226
風向，北偏東北
<i>Wind direction north by northeast.</i>

22
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:01,455
在3號跑道降落
<i>Land on runway number three.</i>

23
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,462
那是個機場吧？
There's the field all right.

24
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,023
嘿，你們見過這麼寬的跑道嗎？
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?

25
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,090
它的確很大啊
She's big all right.

26
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:08,727
你完全可以閉著眼睛著陸
You could almost close your eyes and get in.

27
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,863
我真想知道 我們會從這兒飛往哪裡
And I'd give plenty to know where we go from here.

28
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,031
我也想知道
Yeah, so would I.

29
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:15,008
嘿，先別降落，我去拿相機
Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera.

30
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,279
景色怎麼樣，克勒文？
How does she look from the nose, Clever?

31
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:23,444
太棒了，佛羅里達 棕櫚樹、美洲鱷、泳裝美人
Great. Florida, palm trees, alligators, bathing beauties.

32
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,013
柴契爾，看一下腳下的景色怎麼樣
Hey, Thatcher, have a look at some real country.

33
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,523
沒有比令斯漂亮，長官
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.

34
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,559
這次飛行帶餅乾了嗎，柴契爾？
Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher?

35
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:36,121
帶了，飛躍山脈時我很難受 但我還是挺過來了
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming over the mountains, but I hung on.

36
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,626
- 02241 - 嘿，等會兒
<i>- Zero-two-two-four-one to flight.</i> - Hey, wait a minute.

37
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,497
我們先等會兒，把飛行梯隊編好
We'll go around, make an echelon right

38
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,266
先飛到機場上空 然後再解散梯隊做得漂亮點
<i>once over the field, then break away.</i> <i>Let's make it pretty.</i>

39
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,799
但願好運
Here's for luck.

40
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,500
關閉
Switch is off!

41
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:31,076
5分25秒，還不賴 我們走了
- 5:25. Not bad time. - Yeah, we moved.

42
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,553
最好去報修一下左邊的引擎 它的聲音有點刺耳
Better write that left engine up. She sounded a little rough.

43
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:35,419
我幹得不錯吧，勞森？
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.

44
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,550
你的降落真完美 給我一種藝術的視覺享受
You really made a nice break away. Gave me kind of an artistic angle.

45
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:40,925
總有一天我要幹一次墜毀降落 這樣你就能看上真正的電影了
Some day I'll do a crash landing so you can get a real movie.

46
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,521
柴契爾說佛羅里達比不上比令斯
Thatcher says that Florida can't compare to Billings.

47
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:46,192
柴契爾是覺得 任何超過300人的地方…
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks that any place with more than 300 people

48
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:48,532
便很擁擠了 是根據最近一次人口普查的，長官
- is overcrowded. - Oh, according to the last census, sir,

49
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:51,697
比令斯有16,300人口
Billings has a population of 16,380.

50
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:55,732
16,000，不會吧，柴契爾 你一定把郊區算進去了
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must be thinking of Greater Billings.

51
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,542
他說對了，克勒文 他們把鄉間的奶牛算進去了
No, he's right, Clever. They count the cows up in that country.

52
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,808
- 對不起，長官 - 什麼事？
- Sorry, sir. - Yes.

53
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,715
- 機場禁止照相 - 什麼？
- Cameras aren't allowed on the field. - What?

54
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:05,912
是的，長官
That's right, sir.

55
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:09,219
許多秘密工事都在這裡 這是很嚴肅的紀律
A lot of secret work goes on here, and they're very strict about it.

56
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,986
我根本沒看見有什麼秘密工事
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.

57
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,924
那麼我只好向指揮官報告了，長官
Then I'll have to report you to the Commanding Officer, sir.

58
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,189
這是我的職責
Those are my orders.

59
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,820
好吧
Okay. Okay.

60
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,764
瞧，布裡.霍爾斯通還和我們在一起
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.

61
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,166
我還在想明天之前 你不會把那個笨蛋叫上的
We were afraid you wouldn't get that turkey in till tomorrow.

62
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,567
為什麼？那傢伙飛得挺好的
Why, that baby flies so pretty

63
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:24,901
最後200英里我們很平穩
we floated the last 200 miles.

64
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:27,737
- 你們準備好了嗎？ - 好了，來吧，布裡克
- Are you guys ready? - Yeah. Come on, Brick.

65
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,505
柴契爾，我去去就來 還要告訴你的住處
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back and tell you where your quarters are.

66
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,841
好的
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,612
大衛，有什麼想法？說說看
Come on, Davey, you've got an idea. What's the dope?

68
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,049
- 我們從這兒會到哪兒去？ - 我告訴過你了
- Where do we go from here? - I already told you.

69
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,349
他們只說了我們會離開本土
All they said was that it'd take us out of the country,

70
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,787
我們會離開3個月 而且還有一定的危險
we'd be gone about three months and that it'd be dangerous.

71
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:44,621
聽著，我從喬蘭德爾那裡 得到了真實內幕
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.

72
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:47,524
他說我們是要組成巡邏中隊 去保衛巴拿馬運河
He says they're forming patrol squadrons to guard the Canal.

73
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,087
運河巡邏有什麼危險？
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?

74
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,462
那麼，我們擔心什麼呢？
Well, what are we worrying about?

75
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,058
當我們報到時 斯基就會告訴我們內幕了
Ski will give us all the dope when we check in anyhow.

76
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,607
三架飛機到 長官霍爾斯通、勞森和我
Three ships in, sir. Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.

77
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,074
- 好的，你們的飛機還好吧？ - 是的，長官
- Good. Your ships okay? - Yes, sir.

78
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,406
坐吧
Sit down.

79
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,804
我們住哪，斯基？
Where we staying, Ski?

80
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,576
政府在附近租了間旅館
The government's leased a hotel near here.

81
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,549
他們叫軍官俱樂部
They call it the Officers' Club.

82
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,882
帶來的家眷也可以待在那裡
The men whose wives are coming can stay there.

83
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,080
其他軍官的住處在5號兵營
The other officers' quarters are in Barracks 5.

84
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,248
艾米來了嗎？
Is Emmy coming down?

85
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,787
她幾天之後到 斯基，柴契爾住哪？
- She'll be here in a couple of days. - Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?

86
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,919
招募兵被安排在12號兵營
The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12.

87
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,355
好的
Okay.

88
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:25,427
- 還有其他事嗎？ - 沒了
- Anything else? - Nope?

89
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:28,033
至少明早之前沒事了
At least, not until tomorrow morning.

90
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,034
那好，我們再會
Well, we'll be seeing you.

91
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,910
喂，斯基 大夥兒都很想知道發生什麼了
Say, Ski, the guys are all crazy to know what's up.

92
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,983
你和我知道的差不多
You know as much about it as I do.

93
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,917
明早我們就會得到更多消息了
We may be given more information in the morning.

94
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,836
快瞧，夥計，誰來了
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!

95
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:06,931
好好好 看來我必須去了
Well, well, well, plant me now and dig me later,

96
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,636
如果不是藍道夫.菲爾德的緣故 怎麼樣，哥們？
if it isn't the pride of Randolph Field. How are you, boy?

97
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,702
最近不錯 我們一聽到這個興奮的消息
Great, Shorty. The minute we heard that razzmatazz,

98
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,577
就知道你肯定就在這附近
we knew you must be somewhere around.

99
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,946
- 你也是自願參與這次行動的 - 當然
- You volunteer for this deal, too? - Sure enough.

100
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:19,783
他們把我安排在明尼阿波利斯 一個我見過最冷的地方
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis. Coldest country I ever did see.

101
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,653
我極力想去任何一個 能讓我重返陽光的地方
I'd have volunteered for anything to get back in the sunshine.

102
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,454
- 你去過哪？ - 哥倫比亞、南卡羅萊納
- Where you been? - Columbia, South Carolina.

103
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,084
- 鮑勃 - 你好，特德
- Bob! - Hello, Ted.

104
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,390
你們認識？
You guys know each other?

105
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,260
我們一起認識的凱利，就這樣
Oh, we just went through Kelly together, that's all.

106
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,028
- 當然，鮑勃是我婚禮的伴郎 - 婚禮
- Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding. - Wedding?

107
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,069
沒有人再告訴我什麼了
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

108
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,264
你們搞在一起多久了？
How long you been balled up and chained down?

109
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,739
再過五六天就六個月了
Six months, in five more days.

110
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,709
讓我大吃一驚啊 別騙我啊
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.

111
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,404
大衛，你在這兒怎麼樣啊？
Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here?

112
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,071
- 布裡克 - 嗨，唐
- Brick! - Hi, Don.

113
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:49,015
- 我還以為你在打潛水艇呢 - 是啊，打沉過一艘
- I thought you were hunting subs. - Was. Got me one, too.

114
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,109
- 你也參與這項任務 - 當然，我有一批不錯的隊員
- You in on this deal? - Sure. I've got a swell crew

115
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:54,212
看起來好像會有什麼大任務 不是嗎？
and it looked like it was going to be something, so why not?

116
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:58,624
- 我們的行動，有什麼想法嗎？ - 哦，只是預感
- Any ideas what we might be up to? - Oh, just a hunch.

117
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,521
是嗎？快說說看
Yeah? Well, give.

118
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,159
南部海域趕走那些蠢蛋
South Seas. Knock ourselves off a few meatballs.

119
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,659
Yeah?

120
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:21,141
三點
Three.

121
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,651
好傢伙，莊家得兩點
Honest man. Dealer takes two.

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,645
- 我剛才想到 - 想到什麼？
- You know, I just got an idea. - About what?

123
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:29,553
想到我們會去的地方
About where we might be going.

124
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:33,151
- 行程看起來會… - 不會不會，算了
The way it looks to... No, that's not right. Forget it.

125
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:34,690
得兩點
Says two.

126
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:37,491
- 我也有一個猜想 - 什麼？
- You know, I've got an idea too. - Yeah?

127
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,700
我覺得 你肯定是第一個來到這裡…
I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope

128
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,032
並且知道內情的
to have come in on this deal in the first place.

129
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:44,298
為什麼？
What kind of a crack is that?

130
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,268
我不知道你結婚了 有一個不錯的女孩
Oh, I don't know. You're married. You've got a swell girl.

131
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,377
如果我是你的話 就絕不會去冒風險
I never would have stuck my neck out if I were in your boots.

132
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,243
滾開 你說兩點
Go away. You say two?

133
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,181
再跟兩點
And up two.

134
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,610
那些人又被刷掉了
Those guys are off again.

135
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,857
起來，起來 你們以為你們是誰啊
Hey, stand up there. Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:15,700
你們飛機上配有導航員嗎？
Have you ever carried a navigator in your ship before, Spike?

137
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:18,598
我也沒有 直到我們參與了這次行動
Neither have I, until I volunteered for this job.

138
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:21,767
我們就快知道一些奇妙的消息了 我有一種感黨
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff, all right. I kind of got a feeling.

139
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,310
拿我們去對付那些臭雞貂
Shoot me for a pole cat.

140
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:26,472
我看見兩個精力充沛的人 背靠背…
Do I see two red-blooded citizens lying on their backsides

141
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,539
還唱著德克薩斯讚歌
while the Texas anthem is being rendered?

142
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,380
起立 你們
On your feet, men.

143
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,778
感覺怎麼樣？ 最近你來自佛吉尼亞吧？
What are you beefing about, Shorty? You're from Virginia.

144
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,151
是的，聰明鬼
That's right, sharp cat,

145
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:37,123
但我德州的這個朋友在這 而且經常不守規矩
but my pal here, he's from Texas, and he takes offense easy.

146
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,922
- 你好，喬 - 你好，喬伊絲，我得到一些消息
- Hello, Joe. - Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.

147
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,860
嘿，你們安靜些
Hey, you guys, shut up!

148
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:45,289
安靜，小夥子們 聽著，吉米.杜利德要來了
Quiet, fellows. Listen. Jimmy Doolittle's down here

149
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,034
他現在是陸軍中校
and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.

150
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,766
吉米.杜利德是南加州的
Jimmy Doolittle! A southern boy from Southern California.

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,435
讓我們為吉米.杜利德唱一曲 “德州之眼”吧
Let's have <i>Eyes of Texas</i> for Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.

152
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,448
立正
Attention!

153
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,181
大家好 杜利德中校
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.

154
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:08,888
請坐
As you were.

155
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:20,525
你們是自願到這兒的
You men are here because you've volunteered.

156
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:23,503
你們被告知 這將會是一次危險的任務
You have been told it's a dangerous mission.

157
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,598
現在我不會再告訴你們更多 但我想再強調危險
I can't tell you any more than that now, but I want to emphasize the danger.

158
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,542
當下最重要的是嚴守秘密
The most important thing at the moment is secrecy.

159
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:36,740
我不想你們去告訴你們的妻子 這裡有些什麼
I don't want you to even tell your wives what you see down here.

160
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,785
如果你們覺得猜到了 將要去哪兒…
And if you think you've guessed where you're going,

161
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,219
那肯定是錯的 但甚至這猜測都不要談論
you're probably wrong. But don't even talk about your guess.

162
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,587
如果這次任務的一丁點消息 走漏了的話…
If the slightest word about this mission gets around,

163
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:48,652
你們的生命甚至數以萬計人的生命 都將置於危險之中
you will endanger not only your own lives, but the lives of thousands of other men.

164
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:52,264
現在，我想問你們一個問題
Now I want to ask you a question.

165
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,870
有人試著談起這些事情嗎？
Has anybody tried to talk to you about this?

166
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,802
很好，如果基地內外的任何人…
Good. If anybody on the field or off the field

167
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:01,569
試看要問起你們關於…
tries to engage you in conversation

168
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:04,510
為什麼你們來這裡 不管多麼友善…
as to why you're here, no matter how innocently,

169
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,103
我要你們記住他的名字 然後告訴我
I want you to get his name and give it to me

170
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,547
我會把它交給聯邦調查局
and I'll turn it over to the FBI.

171
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,792
這將是一次你們經歷過的 最艱苦的訓練
This is going to be the toughest training you've ever had.

172
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:25,292
你們將會在同一艘船上 和同一批人在一起
You will have the same crew all the way through and the same ship.

173
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,200
任何失敗的團隊將會被剔除
And the man or the ship that fails will be dropped.

174
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:35,333
你們將會駕駛 你們覺得不可能的B-25
You're going to do things with a B-25 you thought were impossible.

175
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:39,635
如果你們有任何雜念 我建議你們趁早放棄
Now, if any of you have any doubts, I'd like you to drop out right now

176
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,706
我保證你們沒有人會想得更糟
and I promise you that no one will ever think the worse of you.

177
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,116
如果你們的妻兒或其他什麼…
If you have wives or children or any other considerations

178
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:48,485
讓你們在危機中時刻牽掛著 很正常
that might get on your nerves in a crisis, it's perfectly all right.

179
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:51,650
事實上，放棄是你們的職責
As a matter of fact, it's your duty to drop out.

180
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:59,093
很好，我們將進行盡可能多的談話 就這樣吧
Very well. We'll have these talks as often as possible. That's all.

181
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,703
今早開始，我們將進行定向飛行
We're going up this morning for an orientation flight.

182
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:09,301
有四個輔助機場 一、二、三、四
There are four auxiliary fields. One, two, three, four.

183
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,812
依次全部找到它們
Line them up and locate them all.

184
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,043
我不知道會使用哪一個來進行 我們的機密試驗…
We don't know which we're going to use for our confidential experiments,

185
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,052
所以自己都去熟悉熟悉
so familiarize yourselves with all of them.

186
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:21,321
先自己去轉轉 等一會兒我們再集台
Look over the countryside, and we'll meet here again

187
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:24,483
下午三點半，還有問題嗎？
at 3:30 this afternoon. Are there any questions?

188
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,652
長官，我引擎中的塞子正在更換中
Sir, the plugs are being changed in my engines.

189
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,062
為了節省時間 我能搭鐘斯的飛機嗎？
To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship?

190
00:12:31,132 --> 00:12:34,431
可以，史密斯 你們可以去自己的飛機了
Right, Smith. All right. You can go to your ship now.

191
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:37,966
對我來說，你很長時間都沒去…
It looks to me like it's going to be a long time

192
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,405
比令斯主幹道遊蕩了，柴契爾
before you swing down Main Street of Billings again, Thatcher.

193
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,171
在比令斯，長官 主幹道是明尼蘇達大街
In Billings, sir, the main street is Minnesota Avenue.

194
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,308
你知道，那個人很當真的
You know, that guy really means business.

195
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:50,317
- 他讓我很汗 - 我也是
- He had me sweating a little. - Yeah, me too.

196
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,046
- 勞森中尉？ - 是的
- Lieutenant Lawson? - Yes.

197
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,554
有人看見你在J大街的 陸軍消費合作社前，長官
Someone to see you out in front of the PX at J Street, sir.

198
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:57,284
謝謝，我想會是誰…
Thanks. I wonder who would...

199
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,788
我馬上就來
I'll be right back.

200
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,359
愛倫
Ellen!

201
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,996
你從哪兒來？ 我開到卡羅萊納來給你個驚喜
- Where did you come from? - I drove to Carolina to surprise you.

202
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:16,476
- 他們告訴我你在這裡 - 是嗎？還好吧
- And then they told me you're down here. - Well, how are you?

203
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,876
湊合，謝謝，你怎麼樣？
I'm just fine, thank you. And how are you bearing up?

204
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,245
還好，你一點都沒變
Oh, great. You look just the same.

205
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:25,047
當然沒變 你不能總是期望立刻就變
Well, of course I do. You can't expect any change this soon.

206
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:27,912
- 什麼意思？ - 沒什麼
- What's the joke? - Nothing.

207
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,354
沒想到你這麼搞笑
Except you're so funny.

208
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,324
告訴我親愛的，你驚訝嗎？
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?

209
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:35,192
我簡直不敢相信我的眼睛 等會兒，我去給你買點喝的
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here, let me buy you a drink.

210
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,293
真高興見到你
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

211
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,841
來，我們到處走走
Come on, let's go around here.

212
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,728
告訴我甜心，為什麼你這麼可人？
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?

213
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:13,631
我找到了一個如此帥氣的小夥子 我必須得這樣啊
I had to be if I were going to get such a good looking fellow.

214
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,631
我有千言萬語想對你說
You know, there's a lot of things I want to talk over with you.

215
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:21,266
說吧，你真的很驚訝嗎？
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?

216
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:24,142
其實不是非常
Well, no, not exactly.

217
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:27,237
你知道嗎？ 當你睜開雙眼時就會變成這樣
You know, you go into something like this with your eyes open.

218
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,580
- 自然你得抓住機會 - 我知道
- Naturally you've got to take your chances. - I see.

219
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:34,245
這樣看著它不是有些冷漠嗎？
Isn't that kind of a cold-blooded way to look at it?

220
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:37,189
快別發瘋了，你真的有點冷漠了
Oh, now, don't get mad. You've got to be cold-blooded about it.

221
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,453
這對我來說是最重要的事
This is the most important thing that's ever happened to me.

222
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,495
- 那我呢？ - 你也是啊
- What about me? - Well, you're in on it, too.

223
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:45,397
- 這就是我為什麼想說一說的原因 - 真慷慨啊，說吧，特德
- That's why I want to talk it over. - That's very generous. Go on, Ted.

224
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,798
那麼，首先我們得保守秘密
Well, in the first place, we've got to keep it a secret.

225
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:51,066
- 我也不是要你從心底發誓 - 你是，我是說，你…
- I don't want you to tell a soul. - You're not, I mean, you...

226
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,868
你不希望這一切發生，是嗎？
You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you?

227
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:54,238
是的，當然
Oh, no, of course not.

228
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,573
但這是軍事機密，我有我的紀律
But it's a military secret, I've got my orders.

229
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,408
軍事…比如，你說的…
Military... Say, what are you talking about?

230
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,040
比如我自願參與的這項任務 你收到我的信了嗎？
Well, this job I volunteered for. Didn't you get my letter?

231
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:05,347
- 沒有，你收到我的了嗎？ - 沒有
- No. Didn't you get mine? - No.

232
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,880
我覺得這很可笑，但是…
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...

233
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:11,357
- 嗨，勞森，特德.勞森 - 到
- Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson! - Here.

234
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,291
你們藏起來幹什麼？
What are you hiding out...

235
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:16,694
- 愛倫，什麼時候來的？ - 5分鐘前，我的伴娘還好吧？
- Ellen, when did you get here? - Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?

236
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,164
很好，只是我不得不打斷你們了
Great. Only I'm going to have to break this up.

237
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,599
杜利德來視察我們起飛了
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.

238
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,229
好，晚飯時我來找你
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.

239
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,637
順著路下去一英里半 有家旅館
There's a hotel about a mile and a half down the road.

240
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,200
我還沒去過呢 但他們說你一定能找到的
I haven't seen it yet, but they tell me you can't miss it.

241
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:33,770
- 我會找到的 - 很抱歉這樣行事匆忙
- I'll find it. - I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.

242
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,786
別忘了晚餐
Don't forget dinner.

243
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:58,435
有人撿到我的信了嗎？
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?

244
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:03,473
是的，長官 我今早撿到的，我都快忘了
Yes, sir. I did this morning. I forgot all about it.

245
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:05,873
- 好的，把它拿來 - 是的
- Well, bring it up. <i>- Yes, sir.</i>

246
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:21,654
對不起，長官
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,890
好的，謝謝 你來開好嗎，達文波特？
Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport.

248
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:25,091
好的
Sure.

249
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:36,470
哇，我有孩子了
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!

250
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:37,533
是愛倫寫的
Hey, it's from Ellen.

251
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:41,070
她就要是… 我是說，我就要當爸爸了
She's going to be... I mean, I'm going to be a father.

252
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,828
你好，飛行員
Hello, flyer.

253
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,392
對不起叫醒你們
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

254
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:36,665
我沒睡著，真的 我在假寐冥思
I wasn't sleeping, really. I was just dozing and thinking.

255
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:41,439
我沒能趕回來吃晚餐，真對不起 我們有太多的檢驗工作
I'm sorry I didn't get back for dinner. We had a lot of checking to do.

256
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:46,004
你肯定覺得 我今早就是個大笨蛋
You must've thought I was an awful dope this morning.

257
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:50,315
我直到後來才收到你的信 所以那時我根本不知道
But I didn't get your letter until later, so I didn't know.

258
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,579
我知道，坐吧
I know. Sit down.

259
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:06,496
孩子的事太美妙了 我知道你會這樣的，我一點也不擔心
- I think it's swell about the baby. - I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.

260
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,528
這真好玩
You know, it's going to seem funny.

261
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:13,165
我不在乎男孩女孩，一點都不重要
I don't care whether it's a boy or a girl. Not that much.

262
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:16,668
我只要你一切都好，我是認真的
I just want you to be okay. It's pretty serious.

263
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,115
什麼這麼好笑，我剛才在想
- Well, what's so funny? - I was just thinking.

264
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:26,016
這裡你在準備完成些 非常困難的任務…
Here you're getting ready to go off on something really tough,

265
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:28,348
那裡還在牽掛著我
and you're worrying about me.

266
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,823
如果我是你，肯定都嚇死了
If I were in your spot, I'd be scared to death.

267
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:38,063
我覺得我就是這樣的 純粹的例行公事，飛行員
- But I guess I am anyhow. - Purely routine stuff, flyer.

268
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:42,193
這是每個女孩子生中 都要經的一兩次
The kind of job every girl takes on once or twice in her life.

269
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,371
你為何不躺下？
Why don't you lie down?

270
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,476
你知道嗎，愛倫？
You know, Ellen,

271
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,211
擁有你我已經心滿意足
I'm kind of glad I got you.

272
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:03,081
我想這就是我剛才睡覺時想的
I guess that's what I was thinking about in my sleep.

273
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,348
快把我嚇住了
It almost frightened me.

274
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:08,987
就好像我在想 如果我們沒有相遇會怎樣
It seemed that I was thinking, "What if I'd never met him?"

275
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:12,325
有一點是…
Well, for one thing

276
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,992
你不會遍行全國…
you wouldn't be traipsing around the country

277
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,730
從一個空軍基地到另一個 努力地找我
from one airfield to another trying to catch up with me.

278
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:19,532
還有就是…
And for another,

279
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,174
你不會在戰爭之際 懷上了一個孩子
you wouldn't be having a baby right in the middle of a war.

280
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,211
不是，不是那樣
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

281
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:26,337
我在想如果我沒有遇見你…
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,

282
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:31,914
我的生命中便沒有人能像你一樣 和我如此親近
I'd never have felt really close to anybody, never in my whole life.

283
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,388
結婚六月，相聚不到兩周
Married six months and together less than two weeks.

284
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,894
這不是我說的親近
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.

285
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,431
特德，你不覺得就是這樣嗎？
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.

286
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:48,366
兩人遠在天邊，卻心有所屬…
If people can be close when they're far away from each other,

287
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:51,034
那才是應該有的
well, that's what it should be.

288
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:53,368
是是，我也這麼想
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

289
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:56,407
抱緊我
Cuddle me.

290
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,515
我想起了上個耶誕節
I was thinking about last Christmas.

291
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:07,281
在波特蘭汽車旅館 立的那棵聖誕樹
The tree we set up in that Portland auto court.

292
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:09,880
- 那間屋子不是很小嗎？ - 是啊
- Wasn't it an awful little room? - Yeah.

293
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:12,517
我們在準備聖誕晚餐
And the Christmas dinner we were planning on.

294
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:16,324
然後你把煤氣用光了
And then you ran out of gas and landed in the mud up in lllwaco,

295
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:20,390
我再見你已是耶誕節之後了
Christmas Eve and Christmas were all over before I saw you again.

296
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,631
對，真的很難熬 但無論如何我都挺過來了
Yeah, that was tough. But I got a scarf out of it, anyhow.

297
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:27,330
這並不和我們的計畫一致
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.

298
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,605
這是我們的第一個耶誕節 在一個遙遠地地方
It was our first Christmas, and somewhere way off,

299
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,472
什麼地方不重要
it didn't matter where,

300
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:37,347
只要我有了你，特德 這是我一生中最美好的一個聖涎
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was the nicest Christmas of my life.

301
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:43,987
愛倫，你今生註定會嫁給一個飛行員的 從我看見你的第一眼起就這樣想了
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen. I knew that the minute I first saw you.

302
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,718
事實上，這就是我嫁給你的理由
As a matter of fact that's why I married you.

303
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,887
- 我想對你說句告白 - 什麼？
- You know, I've got a confession to make. - What?

304
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:53,798
事實是，不是你娶了我 是我嫁給了你
The truth is, you didn't marry me. I married you.

305
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,463
是嗎？
Oh, you did, eh?

306
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:00,567
我在洛杉礬城市學院國書館 第一次看見你…
The first time I saw you in the library at LACC,

307
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,474
我就對自己說：噢，他會是我的
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me."

308
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:04,904
從那時起
And from then on,

309
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,380
從那一個個美好的夜晚 到離開那個愛荷達的小鎮
clear up to the night we got the judge out of bed in that little Idaho town,

310
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,314
沒有什麼是偶然，特德
nothing was an accident, Ted.

311
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,750
都是我設計的
I planned it that way.

312
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:17,386
- 你覺得你很聰慧，是嗎？ - 我自己也不確定
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you? - I'm not sure whether I do or not.

313
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,458
你瞧，你並沒有表現出 十足的戰鬥力
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.

314
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,723
我想你也在考慮孩子
I suppose you figured out on that baby, too?

315
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,598
那是你根本不可能知道的 飛行員根本不知道
That's something you'll never know, flyer, you'll never know.

316
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:41,773
這幾天小夥子們都熬得很晚啊
Boys are working late these nights.

317
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:47,048
是啊，你認為你們會離開多久？
Yes. Do you have any idea how long you'll be gone?

318
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,820
但只要任務結束 我就會去要求一個假期
But as soon as this job is over, I'm going to ask for a leave.

319
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,792
也許兩到三周
Two, maybe three weeks.

320
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,125
我們可以度蜜月了 以前你不是總提起嗎？
We'll have that honeymoon you're always talking about.

321
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:58,427
是的，就我們仨
Yes, just the three of us.

322
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:03,863
特德
Ted.

323
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:09,807
我真希望我不要長得又肥又醜 就像芝加哥肥婆一樣
I do hope I don't get big and fat like that lady in Chicago.

324
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:18,617
我想要你們每個人都知道一些 其他人的工作
I want each one of you to know something about the other man's job.

325
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:21,416
飛行員會擔負飛機上的一切任務
The pilots will practice every job on the plane.

326
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:24,856
導航員要學學投彈手的工作 等等
Navigators will learn the work of bombardiers and so forth.

327
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,358
以防你們當中有人被擊中
That's in case any of you get shot up.

328
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,362
還有一件事
There's one thing more.

329
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,963
不可避免的事 你們當中的某些飛機…
It is inevitable that some of your planes

330
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,659
會落入敵人手中
are going to fall into the hands of the enemy.

331
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:36,134
出於這樣的考慮，我命令你們 拆掉諾登投彈瞄準器
For this reason, I have ordered your Norden bombsights removed.

332
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:40,606
格裡甯上校研發了一種瞄準器 很適合你們的
Captain Greening has designed a sight which will be perfect for our job.

333
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,442
如果沒什麼問題了 那麼就請約克上校來說說
If there are no questions, I'll ask Captain York to take over.

334
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:47,674
剛才我說過，我們去巴西巡邏
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.

335
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:50,239
那麼為什麼我們要拆掉 諾登投彈瞄準器？
Yeah, but what about taking the Norden Bombsight out?

336
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:53,514
如果我們是去打擊潛艇的話 根本不可能被敵機擊中
There's no chance of falling into the hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs.

337
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:57,717
我從不那樣認為 那都是杜利德的鬼話，是吧？
- I hadn't thought of that. - That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?

338
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,523
以防你們當中有人被擊中 被燦爛的陽光擊中
"Just in case any of us are shot up," a bundle of sunshine.

339
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,668
哦，那是特德，特德
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!

340
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:12,532
我們第一次結婚時 喬治也這樣嗡嗡從我身邊開過
George used to buzz me when we were first married.

341
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,575
他再也不那樣了，這是不允許的
He doesn't do it any more. They're not supposed to.

342
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:18,803
我懷疑他是否還愛我 我可一點也不擔心
- I wonder if he still loves me. - I wouldn't worry about that.

343
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:22,144
每次斯基有了一架新飛機 就像愛上了它似的
Every time Ski gets a new ship he has a terrible love affair with it,

344
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,774
但他總會回到我身邊的
but he always comes back to me,

345
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:25,375
尤其是當他餓得咕咕叫時
especially when he's hungry.

346
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:28,286
想想看他們會離開三個月
Just think, they'll be gone three months.

347
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:30,653
我想我會在國防工廠 找到一份工作
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.

348
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,921
我真的不能忍受坐在一間小公寓 無盡等待，無所事事
I couldn't stand just sitting around in some little apartment and waiting.

349
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:35,188
你打算怎麼辦，愛倫？
What are you going to do, Ellen?

350
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:38,527
我想靜下心來，因為我有孩子了
Oh, I'm just going to sit around and have a baby.

351
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,061
- 一個孩子 - 一個孩子
- A baby! - A baby!

352
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:41,658
愛倫，為什麼不告訴我們？
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?

353
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:44,898
我不知道，或許我一直沒想好怎麼說 直到剛才
I don't know. I guess I just never thought of a way till now.

354
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:47,532
既然這樣了，說說也不難啊
As it turns out, it wasn't hard to tell at all.

355
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,701
我也有了一個孩子了
Well, I'm going to have one, too.

356
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:51,210
是麼，真的嗎？
- What? - Really?

357
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,405
我覺得這樣太棒了
Gee, I think it's wonderful.

358
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:57,083
喬治和我商量過的，但現在他走了…
George and I have talked about it, but, well, with him away and all,

359
00:23:57,151 --> 00:24:00,245
- 我想我可能太害怕了 - 我也害怕，但是…
- I guess I'm just too scared. - I thought I would be too, but...

360
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:02,915
特德和我猜想 珍珠港事件後的每一件事…
Well, Ted and I figured that everything since Pearl Harbor

361
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,981
都如此順利
has just been so much velvet.

362
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,290
我想如果他發生了什麼事…
And then I guessed that if anything should happen to him,

363
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:10,387
我知道不會發生的
only I know nothing will,

364
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:14,696
我就會把小孩生下來 這就是特德仍然活著的希望
I'd have the baby, and that would be a little bit of Ted still living.

365
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:17,635
我有時想知道，等一切都結束了 我們會怎樣
I sometimes wonder how we'll feel when it's all over.

366
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:21,106
在某個地方安頓下來 找一件小房子…
Just think, being able to settle down in a little house somewhere

367
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:24,542
撫養你們的小孩，無憂無慮
and raise your children and never be in doubt about anything.

368
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:26,239
我對現在的生活…
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts

369
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:27,439
倒想打一個問號
that we have right now.

370
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:30,678
比如，他會回來吃晚飯嗎？
For example, will he or will he not be home for dinner?

371
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,487
我們將要進行本次訓練中 最機密的一部分
We're about to enter the most secret part of our training.

372
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:38,889
機場周邊都部署了巡邏 所以沒人能打擾你們
This field is patrolled on all sides so no one can disturb you at your work.

373
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:41,223
同志們，這是米勒海軍上尉
Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.

374
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:43,559
他將指示你們的起飛
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

375
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:48,330
除了正常的B-25在1500英尺內 以90英里的時速起飛…
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

376
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,801
他還會教你們…
he's going to show you how to do it

377
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,931
全負荷炸彈和汽油時，在500英尺內 以50英里的時速起飛
with a full load of bombs and gas in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

378
00:24:56,477 --> 00:24:58,274
你們將嘗試短距離起飛
You will attempt no short takeoffs

379
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:01,178
從埃格林空軍基地 大家都可以看到
from Eglin Field, where people can see you.

380
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,882
米勒海軍上尉還會給你們一些 海軍禮儀講座
Lieutenant Miller will also give you a few short talks on naval etiquette.

381
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:08,353
如果我說的這些讓你們覺察到了 有關你們的目的地…
Now, if this gives you any hints as to your destination

382
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:11,084
和此次任務的蛛絲馬跡…
or as to what kind of work you're going to do,

383
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:13,854
不要在下麵議論
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

384
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:17,397
接下來的時間交給米勒海軍上尉
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

385
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,233
先生們
Gentlemen,

386
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:28,867
這些旗子距離起點有…
those flags out there are at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet

387
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,570
100、200、300、400和500英里遠
from the starting line.

388
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:34,102
訓練場中間的這些線 是引導你們起飛的
The line down the center of the field is to guide you in your takeoff.

389
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,015
你們的任務不允許有任何的背離
The kind of work you're going to do won't permit any deviations.

390
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:41,521
記住，叫離開踏板前勁踩足了
Now, the whole idea is to get up full power before you release your brakes.

391
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:44,683
然後開始以最大轉率加壓
Then start, at maximum r.p.m., manifold pressure

392
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,025
讓機翼側翼立起來
and with your wing flaps all the way down.

393
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:49,961
你們要加快電機轉率 直到你認為它快要燃燒起來為止
You'll have to rev your motors until you think they're going to burn up.

394
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,793
然後如果它們向右傾斜
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

395
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:54,834
聲音和感覺比指令更重要
and that's a matter of sound and feel more than instruments,

396
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:56,767
放開?車去見上帝吧
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

397
00:25:56,837 --> 00:25:59,601
我不想你們第一次都去嘗試這樣
I don't expect any of you to do it the first time.

398
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:01,106
- 格雷 - 到
- Gray. - Yes, sir.

399
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,733
你和門奇是不是想第一個試試
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

400
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,836
剩下的人待在裡面 評判你們的表現，觀測一下風速
The rest of us will stay on the ground, mark your takeoff and check the wind.

401
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:06,902
是
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:09,279
我覺得最開始我們可以 從觀看、試飛中學到…
I think at first we can learn as much by watching trial runs

403
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,113
和實際飛行一樣多的東西
as by actually flying the ships.

404
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:14,450
那麼我們就在這裡排好隊 看看他們怎麼表現
So let's all line up over here and see how he does.

405
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:49,085
- 地表風速怎樣，斯基？ - 每小時8英里
- What kind of surface wind, Ski? - Eight miles an hour.

406
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:52,148
他沒有把引擎轉速提升到足夠快
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.

407
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,023
勞森，你接著去
Lawson, you go next.

408
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:55,322
記住，我們的目的是
Now remember, for our purposes,

409
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:57,455
如果你把你的一個輪子飛離地面 就足夠好了
if you get your wheels a foot off the ground, that's good enough.

410
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,396
不需要太高 但一定要讓輪子離開地面
You don't need height, but you've got to get your wheels off

411
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:00,933
但不至於碰到旗子
before you hit the last flag.

412
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:03,868
等一會兒我們會嘗試 在450英里內收回輪子
A little later we'll try retracting the wheels at around 450 feet

413
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,564
全靠你們的發動機支撐
and relying on your motors to float the ship.

414
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,233
- 但不要那樣做 - 好的，長官
- Don't try that just yet, though. - Right, sir.

415
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,676
抓住控制杆用力拉 直到你有了堅定的信心了
Now, grab the column and pull her until you feel the inside of your backbone.

416
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:13,042
好的，長官
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,764
你駕駛過B-25在500英尺內起飛嗎 長官
Did you ever take off a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?

418
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:35,766
沒有，但是你們可以別擔心
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:37,133
看看勞森
Watch Lawson there.

420
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:41,368
你們至少得把發動機轉速 提到那樣高，甚至更高
You'll have to rev your motors at least that high and maybe higher.

421
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:58,652
大約7oo英尺，他燒掉了他的尾撬 沒有來得及收起輪子
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid. Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

422
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,239
嘿，剛才的起飛真是虛驚一場啊
Brother, that takeoff was strictly on the cob.

423
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:18,005
你的飛機真像一隻撕碎的鴨子
That airplane of yours looked exactly like a ruptured duck.

424
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:19,477
你覺得它怎麼樣？
How do you like this guy?

425
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,946
他起飛就像一個年邁的女土 頂著狂風
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind,

426
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:24,040
終於鼓起勇氣 試試真正的飛機了
and then he's got the nerve to talk about a real ship.

427
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:27,144
你真走運沒有在一個泥濘的機場 不然你還會在這兒
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field, or you'd still be there.

428
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:31,590
我一點都不擔心那個 你和格雷確實在忸怩作態
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey you and Gray are pushing around the sky.

429
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:36,595
撕裂的“鴨子”一切安好 我被侮辱了，走吧，兄弟們
- The ruptured duck will get along okay. - Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.

430
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,198
不會修很長時間的，先生
That won't take long to fix, sir.

431
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:43,759
撕裂的“鴨子”
Ruptured duck.

432
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,913
特德
Ted.

433
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:58,281
如果是個女孩 琳達這個名字怎麼樣？
Don't you think Linda's a good name, if it's a girl?

434
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:01,544
好，很好
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.

435
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:05,583
不，也許是尼古拉 尼古拉
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?

436
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:08,789
聽起來很悅耳，是吧？
That has a nice sound, don't you think?

437
00:29:09,596 --> 00:29:12,827
什麼？對對
What's that? Oh, yes.

438
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,858
親愛的，我們不要著急 現在就決定吧
Look, honey, we don't have to decide that right now, do we?

439
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:17,995
不用
No.

440
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:24,736
特德
Ted.

441
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:28,341
他傷得不重吧？
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?

442
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,175
- 誰？ - 約翰尼.亞當斯
- Who? - Johnny Adams.

443
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:34,049
- 你怎麼知道約翰尼的？ - 都傳開了
- How'd you hear about Johnny? - Those things get around.

444
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:36,783
- 他沒有吧？ - 當然沒有
- He wasn't hurt, was he? - Of course not.

445
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,722
我不知道是怎麼發生的
I don't know how those things get started.

446
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:41,556
每個在這個基地打聽出來的消息 總要被吹捧一番
Every time a guy does a noseover on this field, it's a crack-up.

447
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:42,686
特德
Ted.

448
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:48,361
你晚飯後就一直在忙 來，我們出去走走
You've been working ever since dinner. Come on, let's get some air.

449
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:50,236
不錯
It's a deal.

450
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,103
真美
Nice.

451
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,382
很抱歉，我們不能有 更多的時間在一起，艾倫
I'm sorry we haven't had more time together, Ellen.

452
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:10,350
我們現在的時間很少 但以後都是我們的
We can spare a little. We've got all the rest of our lives.

453
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,392
對
That's right.

454
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:19,723
什麼東西開花了 好香啊，是吧？
Something blooming? It smells good, doesn't it?

455
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:21,625
- 特德 - 什麼？
- Ted. - What?

456
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:23,727
求你了，不要胡思亂想
Please, don't worry about anything.

457
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:27,103
我沒有擔心 我只是在工作，僅此而己
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.

458
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,835
這次的任務非常重要
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.

459
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,539
你不是在擔心你的任務 你擔心因為你有一個妻子
You're not worried about the deal. You're worried because you've got a wife.

460
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,479
那是錯的，特德
And that's wrong, Ted.

461
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:39,412
鮑勃格雷沒有來嚇唬你吧？
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been trying to scare you, has he?

462
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,283
- 當然沒有 - 那就好
- Of course not. - Okay.

463
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:43,446
因為沒什麼好擔心的，沒什麼
Because there's nothing to worry about, nothing.

464
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:45,219
傻瓜，我就裝作不知道
Silly, as if I didn't know that.

465
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,988
還有，如果發生了什麼 你會得到政府保險的全部
Besides, if anything did happen, you've got all that government insurance,

466
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:51,519
這樣我就能照顧你和孩子 很長一段時間了
that'll take care of you and the baby for a long while.

467
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,633
天哪，我們在說什麼 無論如何也不會發生什麼的
Oh, what am I talking about? Nothing's going to happen anyhow.

468
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:59,638
特德，看著我
Ted, look at me.

469
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:04,341
孩子和我不需要任何東西 除了你
That baby and I, we won't ever need anything but you.

470
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:07,780
我們誰都不准害怕，特德
We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted.

471
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:12,308
因為我們的孩子 是我堅信你會回來的理由
Because the baby, the baby's why I know you're coming back to us.

472
00:31:56,863 --> 00:32:00,026
這次我們做好一點 不然就再也聽不到這樣的聲音了
We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll never let us hear the last of it.

473
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,192
好
Yeah.

474
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:36,100
聽到那些引擎了嗎？ 就像音樂一樣
- Hear those engines? - Like music.

475
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,323
來吧，你們這些有前途的巴土司機
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.

476
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,301
十個星期以來的一個狂歡夜 來吧
It's been 10 weeks work and one night's fun. Let's go.

477
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,894
我把側翼立起來了，兄弟們 燃燒吧，勇敢者們
- I got my flaps up, brother. - Heat it up there, Smitty boy.

478
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:15,601
蒸汽的絲絲聲你們要去哪 沒有人攔你
Steam and sizzle. Where you're going, no one's gonna hold you tight.

479
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:17,735
嗨，多克，知道怎麼跳舞嗎？
Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance?

480
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,745
當別人拿走你的高射炮時
When they start picking flak out of your feet,

481
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:21,644
你應該慶倖它會得到更好的利用
you'll wish you'd put them to better use.

482
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:24,343
我是醫生 不是爵士舞迷，肖特
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.

483
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,301
- 嗨，這是在做什麼？ - 肖特組織的的派對
- Hey, what gives? - Shorty's throwing a party.

484
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:43,427
派對？為什麼？
A party? What for?

485
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:46,836
有人說他是在慶祝得州憲法日
Somebody said he's celebrating Texas Constitution Day.

486
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:50,866
得州憲法日？ 那麼我也得試一下
- Texas Constitution Day? - Say, I'm gonna sample this.

487
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:02,877
找個女孩吧，勞森
Grab your gal, Lawson.

488
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:04,651
不知道今天是 山姆.休士頓的生日嗎？
Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday?

489
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,714
山姆.休士頓
Sam Houston?

490
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,818
一個從未到過得州的人 門奇經常說起
For a guy that never saw Texas, that Manch is really sold.

491
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:11,591
- 你好，勞森 - 你好啊，怎麼想起這麼放蕩的？
- Hi, Lawson. - Hi. How did this riot get started?

492
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,155
今天是得州加入聯邦紀念日
It's Texas Admission Day.

493
00:34:13,233 --> 00:34:16,327
這不是放蕩先生 這是一場已然的戰爭
And that ain't no riot, mister, that's a full-fledged war.

494
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,837
- 看見艾倫了嗎？ - 我誰都看見過的
- Seen Ellen? - I've seen everybody.

495
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:33,886
你好，飛行員，和我跳舞
- Hello, flyer. - My dance?

496
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:35,046
當然啊，我的心上人
All of them, my boy.

497
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:38,455
此刻起的每一隻舞，直至最後
Every dance from now on out, including the last one.

498
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,087
我愛你，斯基 我愛你
And I love you, Ski. I love you, I love you, I love you.

499
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:29,001
這真搞笑 勞森以前居然和一架得州飛機…
You know, it's a funny thing. That Lawson used to be about as graceful

500
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,236
一樣高雅，快瞧他
as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.

501
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,302
也許是那個女孩的緣故
Maybe the girl's got something to do with it.

502
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,041
你說上次，克勒文…
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.

503
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:42,110
有些事我打算告訴你更多
You know, there's something I mean to tell you more often,

504
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:44,846
- 但我一直沒找到機會 - 什麼事？
- but I never seem to get the chance. - What is it?

505
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:47,416
我愛你
Just that I love you.

506
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,260
我今天收到了你母親的一封信 忘了告訴你
I got a letter from your mother this morning. Forgot to tell you.

507
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,829
她說你要自己照顧好自己
She said to take good care of you.

508
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:05,067
那我怎麼樣 媽媽做夢也不會想到的好
- How am I doing? - Better than mother ever dreamed of.

509
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:26,656
好了，好了
Here. Here.

510
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,551
笑一笑，唱啊
Now smile and sing.

511
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,550
特德
Ted.

512
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:57,118
電話響了
Telephone's ringing.

513
00:37:58,558 --> 00:38:01,994
- 電話，特德 - 好的
- Telephone, Ted. - Oh, sure.

514
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:14,164
是嗎，現在？好的
Yeah? Right now? Okay.

515
00:38:14,741 --> 00:38:16,333
好
Okay.

516
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,874
行
Okay.

517
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:20,344
什麼事？
What was it?

518
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,207
是一次夜間召集 但這是一個美妙的夜晚
Oh, just another night call. But what a night.

519
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,249
對不起
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:27,945
幾點了？
What time is it?

521
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:30,381
3:10
3:10.

522
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:34,786
- 心裡難受嗎？ - 沒什麼，只是頭痛病
- Hung-over maybe a little? - Oh, just a headache.

523
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:38,158
- 我不大適應派對的氣氛 - 可憐的寶貝
- I'm not used to party life. - Poor baby.

524
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:43,327
你應該睡覺了，我早飯前趕回來
You go to sleep. I'll be back by breakfast time.

525
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,972
我很困了，晚安，親愛的
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.

526
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,377
或者說早安
Or rather, good morning.

527
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:56,739
如果我得到一個假期 我要整整睡上六天
Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm going to sleep for six days solid.

528
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:58,716
不知道又是什麼
I wonder what this is.

529
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:15,390
同志們，你們的飛機檢修好了 加滿油了，準備起飛
Well, men, your ships are all serviced, gassed, and ready to go.

530
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:17,928
你們將輪流起飛
You will take off in shifts,

531
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,936
一班45分鐘
the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.

532
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:24,041
約克上校會給你們准飛的指示
Captain York will give you your clearances.

533
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:28,245
有一件事必須清楚
Now there's one thing that must be thoroughly understood.

534
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:29,576
今早起飛後
After you take off this morning,

535
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:35,110
你們不允許見到任何人、和任何人說話打電話 甚至是你們的妻子
you are to see no one, speak to no one, telephone no one, not even your wife.

536
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:38,457
沒有例外
There are no exceptions.

537
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,152
繼續你們到達目的地的油耗測試
Continue your gas consumption tests to your destination.

538
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:47,964
你們的任務要求低海拔飛行
Now, the work you will be asked to do will require a little low altitude flying,

539
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:51,228
所以超低空飛行是完全可以的
so hedge-hopping on this trip is perfectly okay.

540
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:55,097
記住，牛仔們總是戴高帽子
Only bear in mind that cowboys wear pretty tall hats,

541
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:58,906
所以小心一點，就這樣
so watch your step, men. That's all.

542
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:04,543
我想你們已經為你們自願參加的任務 作好了準備
I think you're very well prepared for what you volunteered to do

543
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:09,619
我要感謝你們辛勤而出色的表現
and I want to thank you for a lot of good hard work.

544
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,751
幾天後再見，祝你們好運
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.

545
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:16,420
我想找個機會和艾倫說再見
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.

546
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:17,520
你會有的
Yeah, you will.

547
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:20,031
你們的目的地是 阿拉梅達空軍基地
Your destination is Alameda field.

548
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:24,831
走南方航線在聖安東尼奧補給 然後前進
Take the southern route, refuel at San Antonio and march.

549
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:29,500
點到名後就可以開始了 第一個，霍爾斯通
As your names are called you can start. First flight, Holstrom,

550
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,111
鐘斯 勞森，第二個
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...

551
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:47,189
- 特德 - 好了，寶貝，我要走了
- Ted. - Well, this is it, honey. We're off.

552
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,454
什麼時候？ 只有時間收收東西了
- How soon? - Just got time to pack.

553
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:49,927
我的B-4包在哪裡？
Where's my B-4 bag?

554
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:52,464
- 在壁櫥裡，我去拿 - 好的
- In the closet. I'll get it. - Good.

555
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:59,300
襪子、襯衣
Socks, shirts.

556
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,342
- 我的領帶也在壁櫥 - 是的，我去拿
- My ties in the closet? - Yes, I have them.

557
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,502
好的
Good.

558
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:16,087
哇，不要光著腳走進去 我打碎了個杯子
Wow! Don't go in there in your bare feet, I broke a glass.

559
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,520
好的
All right.

560
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,916
- 你忘了你的牙刷 - 見鬼
- You forgot your toothbrush. - Oh, doggone it.

561
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,592
- 都收好了嗎？ - 差不多了
- We got everything? - I think so.

562
00:41:28,668 --> 00:41:29,828
好樣的
Swell.

563
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:46,184
好的，做一個好女孩 照顧好孩子
Well, be a good girl and take good care of that baby.

564
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,247
我會的，特德，照顧好你自己
- I will, Ted. - Yourself, too.

565
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:56,092
特德，你走後的每一天 我都會給你寫一封信
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you a letter every day you're gone,

566
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:58,062
我知道他們不會送達 我也不會寄出的
I know they won't deliver them. I won't even mail them.

567
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:01,931
但我還是要寫 這樣我們就能保持聯繫了
But I'm going to write just the same. That way, we'll kind of be in touch.

568
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,495
我們就能感覺到彼此的鼻息
That way, we'll feel close.

569
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:13,440
再見
Goodbye.

570
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,014
再見，飛行員
Bye, flyer.

571
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:22,479
告訴我甜心，為什麼你這麼可人？
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?

572
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:28,026
我找到了一個如此帥氣的小夥子 我必須得這樣啊
I had to be if I was gonna get such a good looking fellow.

573
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,564
我會回來的
I'll be back.

574
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:44,501
嘿，海灣大橋正從我們的右側離開
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.

575
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,095
嘿，海灣大橋正從我們的右側離開
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.

576
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,809
海灣大橋，從它下面飛過怎樣？
The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it?

577
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:53,175
- 為什麼？ - 那樣的話我可以照些照片
- For why? - Well, so I can get some pictures.

578
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:55,271
從下往上拍攝這些超級建築
You know, shooting up at the superstructure.

579
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:57,282
來吧，勞森 不想嗎？
- Come on, Lawson. - Do you want to?

580
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,547
好的，走吧 如果我可以讓他高興  謝謝
- Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy. - Thanks.

581
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:03,347
希望那個跨度裡沒有纜繩
I hope there are no cables hanging under that span.

582
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:04,822
走
Here we go.

583
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:25,568
讓我們輪流來一次 我忘了放膠捲了
Let's take a turn and go it again. I forgot to put film in.

584
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:27,442
我們要去基地別忘了
We're due at the field. Forget it.

585
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:29,208
我再也不想試了
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.

586
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:30,647
嘿，快看
Hey, look.

587
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,147
麥克盧爾，看下麵
McClure, take a look down there.

588
00:44:37,423 --> 00:44:40,324
是航空母艦 是啊，你看他的艦板
- It's a carrier. - Yeah. And look at her deck.

589
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:44,652
B-25的，神聖煙霧就是它了
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.

590
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:46,798
有點小，是吧？
Kind of small, isn't she?

591
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:51,360
飛行員呼叫投彈手 飛行員呼叫炮手
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to gunner. Pilot to gunner.

592
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:53,200
柴契爾、柴契爾
Thatcher. Thatcher.

593
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,300
又斷了
It's dead again.

594
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,775
到達以後 我們最後給杜利德報告一下
We'd better report it to Doolittle when we get in.

595
00:44:57,844 --> 00:45:02,178
對，還有左引擎 對你來說還那樣討厭嗎？
Yeah, that left engine along with it. Still seem a little rough to you?

596
00:45:02,715 --> 00:45:04,580
我不想說了
I can't tell anymore.

597
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:17,122
- 你們的飛機沒事吧？ - 什麼？沒事沒事，長官
- Is everything okay on your ship? - Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.

598
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:20,896
計程車已經在航母碼頭了 他們會照顧好你們的
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's wharf. They'll take care of you there.

599
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:22,229
好的，長官
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:39,679
他們也不等人家下車
They don't even wait until a fellow gets out.

601
00:45:39,752 --> 00:45:43,017
所有的海軍都是這樣自以為是 米勒就是海軍
- All Navy guys are cocky. - Miller's a Navy guy.

602
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:46,081
米勒其實不是海軍，他是飛行員
Well, Miller isn't exactly Navy. He's a pilot.

603
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:01,037
喂，飛行員
Hey, Spike.

604
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:08,341
飛行員 飛行員 什麼事？
- Spike. - Spike, what's the matter?

605
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:10,439
我在抱怨我的燃油泵
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump

606
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,245
杜利德叫我把它送到 飛機修理棚去
and Doolittle told me to take her to the hangar.

607
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:13,808
你不去？
Well, then you're not going?

608
00:46:13,886 --> 00:46:15,877
不去，其實飛機沒什麼毛病
No, and there's nothing really wrong with that plane.

609
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:18,753
這是我們班最好的飛機 兄弟，別大意
- It's the best ship in the squad. - Boy, that's rough.

610
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:20,793
我正準備告訴他我們的對講機
And I nearly told him about our interphone.

611
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,350
你真是個無可救藥的人
You would've been a cooked goose.

612
00:46:22,428 --> 00:46:24,396
我也覺得我去看看那些海軍
I think, sir, I'll go and watch those Navy guys.

613
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:28,127
- 他們會摔壞的 - 想得不錯
- They might bang her up or something. - That's a good idea.

614
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:34,602
你覺得呢？
How do you like that?

615
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:43,675
他們肯定會把“鴨子”弄壞
They're going to break the Duck's back sure.

616
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:47,310
我們怎麼從那些海軍手裡 弄到離合器
How did we get in the clutches of these Navy guys anyhow?

617
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:58,221
- 你們看，這真是一艘大船 - 是的，去看看
- Boy, that's an awful big ship. - Yeah, let's take a look at her.

618
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,166
再見，飛行員 再見，飛行員
- So long, Spike. - So long, Spike.

619
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:03,964
再見，飛行員 再見，夥計們
- Be seeing you, Spike. - Goodbye, fellows.

620
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,075
勞森中尉 報告，長官
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.

621
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:13,669
- 伯廷勒，把勞森中尉帶到… - 306，長官
- Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to... - 306, sir.

622
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:15,576
306 這邊走，先生
- 306. - This way, sir.

623
00:47:16,516 --> 00:47:18,245
待會見
See you guys later.

624
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:20,711
- 麥克盧爾中尉 - 報告，長官
Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.

625
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,678
這是你們的住處，先生
These are your quarters, sir.

626
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,689
懷特和費爾頓先生正在上岸假期中
Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave.

627
00:47:57,757 --> 00:47:59,088
謝謝
Thank you.

628
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,654
你確定能找到回到甲板的路嗎，先生？
Are you sure you'll be able to find your way back up to the deck, sir?

629
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:05,390
是的，謝謝
Oh, sure. Thanks.

630
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:09,488
你在做什麼？
What are you doing down here?

631
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:12,725
隨便逛逛，你呢？
Oh, just looking around. What are you doing here?

632
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:14,561
隨便逛逛
Just looking around.

633
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:20,263
你也迷路了 是嗎？我就像一隻被逮住的老鼠
- Are you lost too? - Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.

634
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,500
我已經走了幾英里了
I've been walking for miles.

635
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:25,569
這是我見過的最大的船
This is the biggest cockeyed ship I've ever seen.

636
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:27,613
是啊，我希望甲板能有兩倍這麼大
Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big.

637
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,843
吸煙燈已滅，吸煙燈已滅
<i>The smoking lamp is out.</i> <i>The smoking lamp is out.</i>

638
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:38,351
先生，吸煙燈已滅 意思是船上禁止吸煙
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means no smoking anywhere on the ship.

639
00:49:38,424 --> 00:49:39,982
好的，為什麼？
- Okay. - Why is that?

640
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:43,620
因為正在補給燃料 先生，他們會告訴我們什麼時候結束
Because they're refueling, sir. They'll let us know when they're through.

641
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:47,222
你好
Hello.

642
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:49,130
你們終於來了
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?

643
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:51,499
對，我們在看看這個浴盆
Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over.

644
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,037
- 你們住得怎樣？ - 很不錯
- How are your quarters? - Perfect.

645
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:54,834
有兩個鋪位和帆布床
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.

646
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:58,900
帆布床，跟我來，兄弟們 我讓你們看看真正的房間
A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm gonna show you real quarters.

647
00:49:58,978 --> 00:50:00,741
我是說寢室
And I mean quarters.

648
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:04,580
帽子 帽子
Hats. Hats.

649
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,716
- 看，這是什麼？ - 我們有客人來了
- Well, look at what's here. - Well, we have guests.

650
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,987
為什麼把大家 從棚戶租賃區趕到這兒？
What's the idea of bringing people up here from the tenement district?

651
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:18,688
這裡被戲謔地叫做“旗艦艙”
This is jocularly known as the admiral's cabin.

652
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:21,124
你們的洗澡時間快到了
Looks like you guys are going to have to start bathing.

653
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,192
還沒完呢，還有其他的，跟我走
This isn't all. There's something else. Follow me.

654
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,897
非常樂意
I'd be glad to.

655
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:29,500
請當心那些地毯
Careful of the rugs, please.

656
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:36,344
裡面的東西，先生們 可以讓你們大飽眼福
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something to really feast your peepers on.

657
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:40,146
晚飯後第一個回來的人 才有機會看到
The first guy turns in after dinner gets this bed for the trip.

658
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,517
你知道是誰嗎？ 進來
You know who that'll be. Enter.

659
00:50:47,693 --> 00:50:50,924
哪來的又髒又噁心的… 快滾蛋，你這個橡皮蟲
What dirty, lowlife... Come out of there, you boll weevil!

660
00:50:50,996 --> 00:50:53,829
好吧，那給我吃玉米 讓我快快長大
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.

661
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,965
這些渣滓是怎麼進來的？
How did all this scum get in?

662
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:57,365
我是在一張海軍帆布床
And me in an Army cot.

663
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,996
今晚結束你死定了
That's where he'll end up, before the night's over.

664
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,767
- 我們走 - 噢，上尉
- Let's get out of here. - Oh, Lieutenant!

665
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,172
你們去吃晚飯時
When you guys go down to dinner,

666
00:51:03,242 --> 00:51:05,608
能帶給我一份半熟的 烤牛肉三明治…
would you mind bringing back a roast beef sandwich, rare,

667
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:08,579
和一份橘子派嗎，上尉？
and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.

668
00:51:18,691 --> 00:51:21,956
- 現在你還覺得來這裡不錯嗎？ - 當然，你不是嗎？
- Well, are you still glad you came along? - Sure. Aren't you?

669
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:25,292
我的感覺怪怪的
- I've got a funny feeling about this job. - Yeah?

670
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:29,392
我覺得可能事情沒有 我們想像的那樣有把握
I think maybe it isn't going to be as much of a cinch as we figured on.

671
00:51:29,468 --> 00:51:32,062
我也這樣想過
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

672
00:51:32,138 --> 00:51:34,971
我的飛機在那裡，我們去看看吧
Well, my ship's over there. I think I'll go take a look at it.

673
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,530
鴨子，在上面 明早見
Well, the Duck's up ahead. I'll see you in the morning.

674
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,474
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

675
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:48,417
是誰？
Who's that?

676
00:51:50,256 --> 00:51:51,985
- 是你嗎，柴契爾？ - 是的，長官
- That you, Thatcher? - Oh, yes, sir.

677
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:54,025
算了吧，柴契爾
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.

678
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:59,255
這些東西拴緊了吧？
Got her pretty well lashed down, haven't they?

679
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,561
是的，他們幹得不錯
Yes, sir. They did a good job.

680
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,960
我有點擔心它
I was kind of worried about her,

681
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:07,164
所以我想上去看看它
so I thought I'd better come up and have a look.

682
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,474
你寂寞嗎？
You lonesome?

683
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:12,642
我想大家都有點
I guess everybody is a little, sir.

684
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:16,340
不要讓領導操心 大衛，你的住處還不錯吧？
Don't bother with the sirs, Dave. Your quarters all right?

685
00:52:16,782 --> 00:52:19,046
- 是的，很好 - 吃得也很好，不是嗎？
- Yeah. Fine. - Grub's good, too, isn't it?

686
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:21,780
很長時間都沒吃到這麼好了
The best I've had in a long time, sir.

687
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:26,522
回去後怎麼打算，柴契爾？
What are you going to do when we get back home, Thatcher?

688
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:31,188
我在比令斯有個女孩，長官 如果能回去我會和她結婚
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir. I'm going to marry her, if we get back.

689
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:33,658
我們會平安返回的
Oh, we'll get back all right.

690
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:37,935
你好
Oh, hello.

691
00:52:38,337 --> 00:52:39,827
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

692
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:46,440
我本來想上來拍幾張星星的 但霧太大了
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.

693
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,571
太多霧了，確實
Pretty foggy, all right.

694
00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:00,957
- 你們在這兒做什麼？ - 就是想呼吸點新鮮空氣
- What are you guys doing here? - Oh, just getting a little air.

695
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:05,455
- 下麵太無聊了 - 的確如此
- Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below. - Yeah, it sure is.

696
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:10,526
你們這些人還擔心這個撕裂的鴨子 就像一群老處女一樣
You guys worry over the ruptured duck like a bunch of old maids.

697
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:12,433
我想睡覺了
Me, I'm going to bed.

698
00:53:13,272 --> 00:53:14,569
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

699
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,164
晚安，特德
Goodnight, Ted.

700
00:53:16,675 --> 00:53:18,643
空氣不錯，是吧？
Wonderful air, isn't it?

701
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:22,981
吸煙燈己亮，吸煙燈己亮
<i>The smoking lamp is lit.</i> <i>The smoking lamp is lit.</i>

702
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:42,960
- 怎麼了？發生什麼了？ - 戰位
- What's wrong? What happened? - Just battle stations.

703
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:45,697
日落和日出的時候 這個大東西總會給我們惹麻煩
Around sunup and sundown the pig boats give us a little trouble

704
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:46,931
所以我們總是靜靜等他
so we always lay for them.

705
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:48,598
這是吉格.懷特 這是巴德.費爾頓
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.

706
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:50,733
很高興見到你 很高興見到你
- Glad to see you. - Glad to see you.

707
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:52,936
- 你好 - 待會見
- How are you? - See you later.

708
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:55,810
我們是在航行中嗎？ 還有5個小時
- Are we underway? - For the last five hours.

709
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:58,111
很高興和你同住，士兵
Glad to have you aboard, Army.

710
00:53:58,284 --> 00:54:00,582
總部命令請戰位
<i>General Quarters,</i> <i>man your battle stations.</i>

711
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:02,985
軍隊人員，請準備你們的飛機
<i>Army personnel, man your planes.</i>

712
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,681
你們唯一可以逃離這裡的方式 是找一個起重機
Boy, the only way you're going to get that thing off of here is with a crane.

713
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:34,742
也許是，但我也在想 我們可以借助自己的力量起飛
Maybe so. But we kind of think we can take off on our own power.

714
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:37,214
嘿，他們打哪兒來？
Hey, where'd they come from?

715
00:54:38,557 --> 00:54:40,149
他們是護衛隊
That's what's known as an escort.

716
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:42,125
晚上他們已經跟著我們了
They just slipped up on us during the night.

717
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:44,458
海軍總愛秘密行事
The Navy likes to do things quietly.

718
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,556
好像就要有一場表演似的，是吧？
Looks like it's really going to be a show, doesn't it?

719
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,237
我今天真不想讓我離開床單 那張床太舒服了
Boy, did I hate to part skin from sheet this morning. What a bed.

720
00:54:53,172 --> 00:54:55,333
這是肖特.門奇、吉格.懷特 和巴德.費爾頓
Oh, this is Shorty Manch. Jig White and Bud Felton.

721
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:56,772
嗨，你們好
- Hello. - Hi y'all.

722
00:54:56,842 --> 00:54:59,834
他們很幸運 可以不在“船艦艙“裡睡黨
This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.

723
00:54:59,912 --> 00:55:03,404
是啊，住得很棒，就是無所事事
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations, but nothing much to do.

724
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:06,307
我覺得至少應該來點紙牌 或是其他什麼遊戲
I thought there'd at least be a poker game or something going on.

725
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:08,250
我想他們時不時會玩的
Oh, I guess they have them every once in a while.

726
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,381
“七趾皮特”呢？你們這兒玩嗎？
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever play much of that around here?

727
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,789
什麼“七趾皮特”？
What's Seven-Toed Pete?

728
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,919
這是一種七張牌的遊戲
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

729
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:19,829
- 我有時間會教你們 - 從未聽說過
- I'd be glad to teach it to you some time. - Never heard of it.

730
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:21,798
全軍注意
<i>Attention, Army personnel!</i>

731
00:55:21,867 --> 00:55:25,325
全軍注意 在守衛室集合
<i>Attention, Army personnel!</i> <i>Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

732
00:55:25,404 --> 00:55:27,065
全軍注意，在守衛室集合
- See you later, fellows. <i>- Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

733
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:30,267
大家好，很榮幸見到大家 我們很快就會在一起了
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows. We'll certainly have to get together soon.

734
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:33,004
也許我們可以玩那個撲克遊戲了
Maybe we can get up that little game of poker.

735
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:35,269
待會見
See you later.

736
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,345
我相信他很愛玩那個撲克遊戲
You know, I believe that boy wants to play poker.

737
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,878
我在想他是不是上船前 帶足了錢的
I wonder if they got their pay before they came aboard.

738
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,857
請坐
As you were.

739
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:55,490
你們不是還有剩下的疑慮嗎？
For the benefit of those who haven't already guessed,

740
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:57,797
我們正在前往日本
we're going straight to Japan.

741
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:02,471
海軍會把我們送到 距離日本本土400英里的地方
The Navy will take us within 400 miles of the Japanese mainland.

742
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:05,772
我們會襲擊日本的東京、橫濱
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

743
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:10,046
神戶、大阪、名古屋
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

744
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:13,575
這是一次夜間行動
It'll be a night job and

745
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:17,452
你們可以選擇 你們想去的地方
you will be given the opportunity of choosing the city you prefer.

746
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:22,324
現在的處境很困難
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

747
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:27,588
中國軍隊準備在日佔領區 開闢小規模戰場
The Chinese have prepared small fields just outside of Japanese occupied territory

748
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,691
我們則在空襲後登陸
for us to land on after the raid.

749
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,362
他們會給我們補給 然後我們飛往重慶
They'll gas us up and we'll take off for Chungking.

750
00:56:32,438 --> 00:56:35,805
現在起我們將會處在 敵人不斷攻擊的危險中
From now on we're in constant danger of enemy attack.

751
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:38,733
如果發生地面攻擊
If there should be a surface attack,

752
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:40,802
站在你們的飛機旁，帶著滅火器
stand by your planes with fire extinguishers

753
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:42,972
讓海軍去對付他們
and let the Navy handle it.

754
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:48,111
如果發生了空中攻擊 起飛飛向最近的陸地
If there should be an attack by air, take off and make for the nearest land.

755
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:52,688
海軍會提供導航資訊 兩天一次
The Navy will give all navigators their bearings twice a day.

756
00:56:54,426 --> 00:56:57,224
再有就是，我還要強調…
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...

757
00:56:57,296 --> 00:57:02,256
如果有人覺得無法勝任此次任務 完全可以自動請退
If any of you feel you're not up to this job, it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

758
00:57:02,734 --> 00:57:06,465
我們有一些後備人員 他們可以填補你們的位置
We have a few spare men and I think we can fill your place.

759
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:12,309
約克上校會告訴你們 用飛機來幹什麼
Get together with Captain York and find out what to do with your planes.

760
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:14,402
明天下午2:30我們再見
We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

761
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,505
有問題嗎？
Are there any questions?

762
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:21,978
上校，集合時可以抽煙嗎？
Colonel, do you mind if we smoke during these assemblies?

763
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:29,861
如果海軍不反對，我沒有異議 還有什麼嗎？
I have no objection to that if the Navy hasn't. Anything else?

764
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:31,156
解散
Dismissed.

765
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,260
48、49、50
48, 49, 50.

766
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:40,169
51、52、53、54
51, 52, 53, 54,

767
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:43,970
55、56…對不起，門奇
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.

768
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:47,170
- 在運動 - 是嗎？我可沒有
- Just getting a little exercise. - Yeah? Well, I wasn't.

769
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,874
我在劃分這個巨大的甲板
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.

770
00:57:50,115 --> 00:57:51,139
9…
Nine...

771
00:57:51,216 --> 00:57:55,118
全軍注意，你們很想知道 我們此次任務的情況
<i>Attention, all personnel. You have been</i> <i>wondering about the mission we are on.</i>

772
00:57:55,187 --> 00:57:56,313
我想你們肯定知道
<i>I think you might like to know</i>

773
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:59,755
大黃蜂正開赴日本準備轟炸
<i>that the Army personnel on the</i> Hornet <i>are going to bomb Japan.</i>

774
00:57:59,825 --> 00:58:03,386
我們海軍將要把他們送達 離敵人最近的地方
<i>We of the Navy are going to take them in</i> <i>as close to the enemy as possible.</i>

775
00:58:03,462 --> 00:58:04,861
這是我們大家的機會
<i>This is a chance for all of us</i>

776
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,421
給倭人一點顏色看看
<i>to give the Japs</i> <i>a dose of their own medicine.</i>

777
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:09,399
這是一場空海軍表演
<i>It's an Army-Navy show.</i>

778
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:12,536
讓我們真誠歡迎這些將士們
<i>Let's extend every courtesy</i> <i>to the Army men on the</i> Hornet

779
00:58:12,604 --> 00:58:14,731
他們將執行這次的任務
<i>who are going to do the job.</i>

780
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:17,808
好運，幹掉他們
<i>Good luck, good hunting</i>

781
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,304
但願上帝保佑我們這次行動
<i>and may God speed us on our mission.</i>

782
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,711
來點
Have some?

783
00:58:23,515 --> 00:58:25,005
謝謝，夥計
Thanks, buddy.

784
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:33,915
從沒聽說過“七趾皮特” 玩成這樣已經很運氣了
You're awfully lucky for guys who never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.

785
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,590
他們告訴我 佛吉尼亞也很適合打獵
They tell me Virginia's a great hunting country, too.

786
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:40,894
是嗎？對，我們來玩 小夥子們
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.

787
00:58:40,966 --> 00:58:43,264
- 賭多少？ - 隨便你，門奇
- What's the bet? - It's up to you, Manch.

788
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:45,565
他們不是說 佛吉尼亞是“總統之鄉”嗎？
Don't they call Virginia the Mother of Presidents?

789
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:48,105
對，我是說… 賭5個吧
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.

790
00:58:48,674 --> 00:58:49,698
跟10個
Up ten.

791
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:51,470
- 湯瑪斯.傑佛遜住在那裡吧？ - 是吧
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he?

792
00:58:51,543 --> 00:58:52,601
我放棄
I drop.

793
00:58:52,678 --> 00:58:54,703
很多人都住那裡
A lot of guys lived there.

794
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,806
你們確信沒玩過“七趾皮特”嗎？
Are you sure you never played Seven-Toed Pete before?

795
00:58:57,883 --> 00:58:59,407
10個，你的門奇
Makes it ten to you, Manch.

796
00:58:59,484 --> 00:59:03,045
你們那兒的十二指腸病 得到控制了嗎？
Have they finally gotten that hookworm situation under control down there?

797
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:05,954
佛吉尼亞從來沒有十二指腸病
There never has been a case of hookworm in Virginia.

798
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:08,822
- 我是一個對對福 - 我是清一色
- I've got a small straight. - Mine's seven to the jack.

799
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:10,156
我是清對
All pink.

800
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:13,358
我又輸了，我想睡覺了
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.

801
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,558
- 有人贏了很多錢 - 一點點
- Somebody's won a lot of dough. - A little.

802
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,795
- 你的牌不好，門奇 - 是啊
- You just had a run of bad cards, Manch. - Yeah.

803
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:19,302
我們以後再來玩
What say we get together again pretty soon?

804
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:20,804
當然，回頭見
Oh, sure. See you later.

805
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:24,603
門奇，你在佛吉尼亞 沒有什麼書吧？
Say, you haven't got any books on Virginia, have you, Manch?

806
00:59:25,477 --> 00:59:29,106
你們空軍都是一群鴿子 我真想你在海軍
You Army guys are real pigeons. I wish you were in the Navy.

807
00:59:31,116 --> 00:59:34,517
你去睡我的地方，勞森 我想睡你這兒，如果你不介意
You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll sleep here, if you don't mind.

808
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:37,612
- 為什麼？ - 那裡有如羽毛般舒適柔軟？
- What's the idea? - That thing's as soft as a feather bed.

809
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:39,714
但我可睡不安穩
I never could sleep in it.

810
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:49,792
- 不賴啊 - 謝謝
Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

811
00:59:50,402 --> 00:59:54,304
蘭德爾上尉會告訴我們—些 關於航母起飛的事項
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell us something about a carrier takeoff.

812
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,772
蘭德爾先生
Mr. Randall.

813
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:02,510
從你們上飛機開始，我開始負責
From the minute you're in your planes, I'm the man to watch.

814
01:00:02,581 --> 01:00:07,245
當你前一個人準備滑行時 請儘快關掉引擎
Have your engines turning over as soon as the man in front of you starts taxiing.

815
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:10,311
當我要你們加快轉速時 我會給你們這個
When I want you to rev up, I'll give you this.

816
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:12,783
如果你們的引擎運作得 對我來說不好的話
Now, if your engines don't sound right to me,

817
01:00:12,858 --> 01:00:15,986
我會要你們加大引擎轉速 時間比你們認為的要長一些
I may have to keep you revved up longer than you think necessary,

818
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,030
我會來聽你們的引擎 然後告訴你什麼時候是最佳時機
I can hear your engines and tell when they're missing better than you can.

819
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:22,328
當我要你開始滑行時 我會給你這個
When I want you to start taxiing, I'll give you this.

820
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,996
然後你們就位 我會給你們最後一次
Now you're in position. I give you a final rev.

821
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:30,772
然後我丟掉它，你們就起飛
And when I drop it, you're off.

822
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:35,109
我們會讓你們直飛日本 還有一件事
We'll aim you straight for Japan. One more thing.

823
01:00:35,714 --> 01:00:37,739
旦一我們列隊起飛
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs,

824
01:00:37,816 --> 01:00:39,647
就不會有延誤
there can be no delays.

825
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:42,812
如果你們的飛機停了 沒有立即起飛
If your plane stalls, if it doesn't start immediately,

826
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:44,048
如果你們有任何種類的任何麻煩
if you have any trouble of any kind,

827
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:46,488
我們沒有時間去處理
we won't have time to do anything about it.

828
01:00:46,558 --> 01:00:49,823
海軍會按照命令催促你們離艦
The Navy crew has orders to push the ship overboard

829
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:52,125
給下一艘飛機讓路
and make way for the next one.

830
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:56,061
尤里卡中尉有城市和
Lieutenant Jurika has detailed maps and pictures

831
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:58,432
具體目標的詳盡地圖和照片
of cities and specified targets.

832
01:00:58,503 --> 01:01:01,438
尤里卡先生在日本生活了 很長的時間
Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan.

833
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:04,471
我想他可以給我們很多東西
I think it might be a good idea if he gave you some idea

834
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:06,477
關於我們要對付的那些人
of what kind of people you're going to run up against

835
01:01:06,545 --> 01:01:08,342
以防你們被擊落
in case you're forced down.

836
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,379
尤里卡先生
Mr. Jurika.

837
01:01:13,385 --> 01:01:16,786
我是駐日海軍助理隨員
I was Assistant Naval Attach? at our embassy in Japan,

838
01:01:17,122 --> 01:01:20,421
有很長一段時間瞭解 東方各國的經歷
long enough to learn a few things about the Orient.

839
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:23,994
我們應該怎麼做，尤里卡先生？
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?

840
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:28,362
我們應該怎麼和那些人相處？ 一旦我們掉在了日本
How should we conduct ourselves in case we are forced down over Japan?

841
01:01:29,568 --> 01:01:33,163
我的建議是 不要把自己當作掉在了日本
My advice is, see that you're not forced down over Japan.

842
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,937
我為你們設計的路線 是從這裡開始
The run I've got figured out for you starts here.

843
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:41,044
這些煙囪是鮮紅的磚石做的 你們一定能找到
The smokestacks are bright red brick, and you can't miss them.

844
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:42,637
日本最大的熔爐之一
One of the largest smelters in Japan.

845
01:01:42,714 --> 01:01:46,775
然後沿著海岸線每十秒投一次彈
Then, following the line of the bay and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

846
01:01:46,852 --> 01:01:49,412
你們必須清除這個和這個
you should take out this and this.

847
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,888
兩座兄弟倆擁有的機械工廠
Both of them are machine shops owned by brothers,

848
01:01:51,957 --> 01:01:55,415
我忘了叫什麼名字 但我記得我不喜歡它們
I forget their names but I remember I didn't like them.

849
01:01:56,461 --> 01:02:01,228
然後在這裡你們開始丟燃燒彈 你們是怎麼列隊的，勞森
Then on out here to drop your incendiary. How does this line up for you, Lawson?

850
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:03,199
好，你去投擲燃燒彈，克勒文
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

851
01:02:03,268 --> 01:02:06,567
我覺得路線不錯 希望你們也這樣認為
The run seems all right for me if it's okay for you.

852
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:08,733
我們可以這樣實行 很好
- We can take them out. - Fine.

853
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:10,866
鐘斯，你們有針對這種路線的訓練嗎？
Jones, have you got the course laid out for this run?

854
01:02:10,942 --> 01:02:12,933
好，到這邊來，小夥子
Yes. Over here, fellows.

855
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:18,415
你們從這裡起飛 往東京的正西方行駛
Now you'll take off about here. You go due west to Tokyo

856
01:02:18,483 --> 01:02:21,475
以最小巡行航速，大約50英尺高度
at minimum cruising speed, flying at about 50 feet.

857
01:02:21,553 --> 01:02:23,748
到達海岸線，上升到1500英尺
When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500

858
01:02:23,822 --> 01:02:26,620
完成轟炸路線後下降，離開陸地
complete your bombing run, then down again and out to sea,

859
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:30,354
- 屋久島南偏東南方向 - 我們能帶上地圖嗎？
- south by southeast to Yakushima. - Can we take the maps with us?

860
01:02:30,429 --> 01:02:31,760
需要的都可以拿上
All you need.

861
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,229
上面沒有什麼標注
Be sure there are no marks on them though,

862
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:34,856
因為如果你們被捕
which might show the Japs where you came from

863
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:36,833
可能會洩露你們從哪兒來
in case you're captured.

864
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:40,065
另外我給第一架飛機 加了4個燃燒彈
By the way, I'm taking off first with four incendiaries.

865
01:02:40,138 --> 01:02:42,129
這樣東京就能為你們美麗燃燒
That should light up Tokyo pretty well for you.

866
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:45,370
我們到了中國 降落場會不會被日本佔領了？
Suppose by the time we get to China, the Japs have taken over the landing field?

867
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:48,038
一旦被日本佔領了
The Chinese will arrange a signal for you when you get to the field

868
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:49,774
你們到達機場時 中國方面會給你們安排信號
if the Japs have captured it.

869
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:53,011
如果你們一直飛行，最後燃料用盡
If that's the case you've got to keep right on going until you've run out of gas

870
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:55,780
跳傘離機，然後把飛機毀掉
then bail out and destroy your planes.

871
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:57,713
是的
Yes.

872
01:02:57,823 --> 01:02:59,313
部署上有些變化
There's just been a change in the disposition

873
01:02:59,391 --> 01:03:01,882
東京上空的阻塞氣球
of the barrage balloons over Tokyo.

874
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:03,890
這個氣球和這個
This balloon and this one

875
01:03:03,962 --> 01:03:08,456
今早被移到這裡和這裡
were moved this morning to here and here.

876
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:18,970
這些氣球的變化把我弄暈了
You know, the changes in those balloons threw me.

877
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:23,209
就象一個整天在浴缸裡 汗流浹背的人一樣
Just think, a bunch of guys sweating all day in a sub

878
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:26,114
沿著東京灣走來走去
down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us

879
01:03:26,518 --> 01:03:29,612
晚上偷偷摸摸打聽氣球的位置
sneaking up at night to radio balloon positions.

880
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:32,421
讓我聽到了很多人都在談論 海軍的聲音
Just let me hear anybody talk about the Navy again.

881
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,049
他們很不錯
Boy, they're good.

882
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:37,652
非常不錯，撲克也打得不錯
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.

883
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:39,992
你又在說笑
Oh, you're not kidding.

884
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:43,330
我盼望在重慶給艾倫什麼禮物
I kind of figured on getting Ellen a present in Chungking, you know,

885
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:44,993
和服或者什麼
a kimono or something.

886
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,231
但這些海軍把我的錢贏光了
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.

887
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:50,172
信不信由你，我只剩14美元了
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.

888
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:52,405
我也只有8或者10美元能給你了
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.

889
01:03:52,477 --> 01:03:54,911
不不，我也是想想而已
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking,

890
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,710
這裡一包香煙賣60美分
cigarettes sell for 60 cents a carton on the boat here.

891
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:00,046
但在重慶 我聽說有人願意出7美元
But in Chungking, I hear the boys will pay seven bucks.

892
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:01,107
是嗎？
Yeah?

893
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:03,416
所以我準備在“鴨子”上 裝滿棺材釘
So I figure I may load the duck with coffin nails.

894
01:04:03,488 --> 01:04:05,251
這個主意不錯
Hey, that's an idea.

895
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:12,129
- 今晚真不錯 - 是啊
- It's a good night for subs. - Yeah.

896
01:04:14,032 --> 01:04:15,556
這真有意恩
You know, it's funny.

897
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:19,730
小時候，我總是夢想去船上看看
When I was a kid I used to dream about going someplace on a ship.

898
01:04:20,906 --> 01:04:22,498
現在我來了
Well, here I am.

899
01:04:23,008 --> 01:04:24,908
正開往日本
And out there is Japan.

900
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:27,677
我母親曾經有一個日本園丁
My mother had a Jap gardener once.

901
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:30,446
他看起來很不錯
He seemed like a nice little guy.

902
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,984
你知道，我並不恨日本人
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.

903
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:39,747
是有點意思，我不喜歡他們 但也不恨
It's a funny thing. I don't like them, but I don't hate them.

904
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,493
我想我也是，這種感覺很複雜
I guess I don't either. You get kind of mixed up.

905
01:04:42,561 --> 01:04:43,619
是的
Yeah.

906
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:46,789
這很難琢磨，但畢竟我們來了
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.

907
01:04:46,865 --> 01:04:50,164
我最想成為一個航空工程師
All I ever wanted to be was an aeronautical engineer.

908
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:53,170
我40歲參軍 因為我覺得這是最好的學習機會
I joined the Army in '40 because I figured it was the best way to learn.

909
01:04:53,238 --> 01:04:55,934
我不仇恨任何人
I wasn't sore at anybody.

910
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:58,066
但突然你就要意識到 你要把一噸多的烈性炸藥
But here you suddenly realize you're going to drop

911
01:04:58,143 --> 01:05:01,306
投放到世界上最大的城市之一
a ton of high explosives on one of the biggest cities in the world.

912
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:03,347
你有點敏感吧？
You're not getting squeamish, are you?

913
01:05:03,415 --> 01:05:04,575
不不，當然不是
Oh, no, of course not.

914
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:08,141
我並不掩飾我對 殺害眾多平民的厭惡
I don't pretend to like the idea of killing a bunch of people

915
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:09,880
但如果我不把炸彈 丟在他們頭上
but it's the case of drop a bomb on them

916
01:05:09,955 --> 01:05:13,049
不久他們就會丟在艾倫頭上
or pretty soon they'll be dropping one on Ellen.

917
01:05:14,192 --> 01:05:15,921
對啊
Yeah, that's right.

918
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:18,859
我在想到底有多少人 能最後挺過來
I wonder how many of us will pull through.

919
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,228
哦，他們估計一半
Oh, they figure about half.

920
01:05:21,433 --> 01:05:24,459
- 每個人都認為自己是一半當中的一個 - 對
- And everybody thinks he'll be in that half. - Yeah.

921
01:05:24,536 --> 01:05:29,200
你什麼時候結婚，鮑勃？ 當我找到艾倫那樣好的姑娘的時候
- When are you going to get married, Bob? - Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.

922
01:05:29,274 --> 01:05:31,834
這真好，你知道，就是我們四個
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.

923
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,845
一切都結束後，我會買一個小農場
You know, when this is over I'd like to get me a small ranch.

924
01:05:34,913 --> 01:05:38,212
養四、五十頭牛什麼的
Something that'd run about 40 or 50 head of cattle.

925
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:42,677
一口好井，一間好房 這是給孩子們的
A nice well and a house. It'd be wonderful for kids.

926
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:45,348
我對農場真的很感興趣
I've always been kind of nuts about ranches myself.

927
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:46,913
在好年景，你可以自己豐衣足食
You know, in a decent year you can make real dough

928
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:48,926
可以吃得飽飽的 而且還有40頭牛啊
out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.

929
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:52,353
- 我們為什麼不去幹幹那些 - 你去的話那我也去
- Why don't we do something like that? - Well, I'm game if you are.

930
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:55,228
- 好的，就這麼說定了 - 好
- Okay, it's a deal. - Good.

931
01:05:57,135 --> 01:06:01,333
當然，如果我們有80頭牛的話 我們就可以大幹一場
Of course, now if we had 80 head of cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout.

932
01:06:01,406 --> 01:06:04,341
是啊，我們自己的肉 牛奶、黃油、雞蛋
- Yeah, and our own meat too. - Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs,

933
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:06,001
所有的一切
the whole works.

934
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:07,603
一個有自己一隅的人
You know, a guy who's got himself a place,

935
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:09,044
是不會憂慮什麼的
he doesn't have to worry about anything.

936
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:13,110
在附近打獵 當然，那很容易
- And with a little hunting near. - Oh, sure, that's easy.

937
01:06:14,152 --> 01:06:15,813
天哪，戰爭結束，我高興得快瘋了
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.

938
01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:20,219
緊急情況時，就不會有集合
In the event of an emergency there will be no assembly.

939
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:24,557
沒有最後指示，我們立即就起飛
No last minute instructions. We'll just take off.

940
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:27,496
離開“大黃蜂號”半小時內 出現發動機故障
If you should develop motor trouble within a half hour after leaving the <i>Hornet,</i>

941
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:29,726
請飛回船艦，並在水面降落
fly back to the ship and land in the water.

942
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:32,536
海軍會把你們撈出來
The Navy will try to fish you out.

943
01:06:33,038 --> 01:06:36,371
如果是半小時後發生了什麼問題 你就得帶著繼續前進
If trouble should develop after that time, you'll have to keep right on going.

944
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:39,808
因為那時候 戰艦就要向敵方開火了
Because by that time the fleet will have to fire on any craft overhead.

945
01:06:39,878 --> 01:06:42,870
我不希望你們用完 備用油氣罐後扔掉
I don't want you to throw out the extra cans of gas as you use them.

946
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:45,882
那樣會給日本日留下追蹤 “大黃蜂號”的線索
That would leave a perfect trail for the Japs to follow back to the <i>Hornet.</i>

947
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:49,147
把罐子積攢起來，一次全部扔掉
Save the cans and throw them all out at one time.

948
01:06:50,455 --> 01:06:53,652
現在，我再重申一下我前面說的
Now let me repeat something I've said previously.

949
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:58,558
你們負責轟炸指定的軍事目標 除此之外別無它物
You are to bomb the military targets assigned to you and nothing else.

950
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:05,194
當然，在這樣的任務過程中 不可能不傷及平民
Of course, in an operation of this kind you cannot avoid killing civilians.

951
01:07:05,303 --> 01:07:08,170
因為戰爭機器是被公民操縱的
Because war plants are manned by civilians.

952
01:07:09,474 --> 01:07:12,637
如果你們有對這種必要的傷亡 有任何道德情感
If any of you have any moral feelings about this necessary killing,

953
01:07:12,711 --> 01:07:16,772
如果你把自己當作一個謀殺者的話
if you feel that you might think of yourself afterward as a murderer,

954
01:07:16,848 --> 01:07:19,908
我希望你能離開，我們會找人代替你
I want you to drop out. We'll find someone to take your place.

955
01:07:19,984 --> 01:07:22,919
我保證沒有人能指責 你的這種情感
And I promise you that no one will blame you for your feelings.

956
01:07:22,987 --> 01:07:28,118
除非計畫有變，否則我們明晚起飛
Barring any sudden switch in plans, we'll take off tomorrow night.

957
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,230
還有一件事
There's one thing more.

958
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,696
當我們在重慶相聚時 我們會安排一場派對
When we meet in Chungking I'm going to throw you a party

959
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:41,671
這樣你們也可以 和你們的孫子們提起…
that you can tell your grandchildren about.

960
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:51,545
你們是好樣的 和你們在一起我感到驕檄
You're a great bunch of guys. I'm proud to be associated with you.

961
01:07:53,648 --> 01:07:55,013
祝你們好運
Good luck.

962
01:07:57,885 --> 01:08:00,080
- 12包香煙 - 12包
- 12 cartons of cigarettes. - 12 cartons?

963
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:01,143
空軍都發了什麼了？
Say, what gives with the Army?

964
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:03,019
我從未賣過這麼多的香煙
I've never sold so many cigarettes in my life.

965
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:05,992
我們是煙鬼，你是在吃煙 要什麼樣的？
- We're chain smokers. - You must eat them. What kind will it be?

966
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,186
隨便
Oh, any kind.

967
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:09,729
- 你只是想要很多煙 - 你猜對了
- You just want lots of cigarettes. - You hit it right on the head.

968
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:11,162
好吧
All right.

969
01:08:14,435 --> 01:08:15,561
共7.20美元
That'll be $7.20.

970
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:32,920
我們的航母特遣部隊 已經被敵方水面艦隊發現
<i>Now hear this. Our carrier task force has</i> <i>been sighted by enemy surface vessels.</i>

971
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:36,946
所有空軍飛行員 準備好你們的飛機
<i>All Army pilots and crews,</i> <i>man your planes for immediate takeoff.</i>

972
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:40,292
不到3分鐘 我們就能看見日本人了
There goes a Jap just three minutes after we sighted her.

973
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:43,797
它有2分鐘的時間告訴東京 它看見了什麼
Yeah. That means she had two minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw.

974
01:08:43,865 --> 01:08:47,062
聽著，趕緊裝上炸彈
<i>Now hear this.</i> <i>Get all bombs loaded on the double.</i>

975
01:08:47,135 --> 01:08:49,729
- 你們都準備好了嗎？ - 準備好5天了，長官
- Are you all packed? - Have been for five days, sir.

976
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:51,829
好的 看看其他人怎麼對付“鴨子”的吧
Good. Better watch how those guys handle the Duck.

977
01:08:51,906 --> 01:08:52,895
是的，長官
I will, sir.

978
01:08:52,974 --> 01:08:54,464
不要告訴其他人小炮塔的事
And don't tell anybody about that bumped turret.

979
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:56,009
我不會的，長官
I won't, sir.

980
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:00,110
我們要走了  耶
- Hey, we're off, aren't we? - Yeah!

981
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:02,843
哦，快炸爛他
Oh, bomb me, daddy!

982
01:09:04,585 --> 01:09:06,519
我想所有的東西都準備好了
I think I've got everything packed.

983
01:09:06,587 --> 01:09:07,747
太好了，謝謝 很抱歉，沒我們沒有
- Swell, thanks. - I'm sorry we couldn't have

984
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:09,289
準備一個好的天氣給你們
picked out a little better weather for you.

985
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:12,190
我們會成功的，再會，費爾頓 狠狠揍他們一拳讓他們記住
- We'll make it. So long, Felton. - Give them a pasting they'll never forget.

986
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:15,127
我們會的，謝謝你們做的一切
We will. Look, thanks for everything.

987
01:09:15,196 --> 01:09:18,962
你們海軍，你很好，再會了
You guys in the Navy, well, you're okay. Be seeing you.

988
01:09:20,435 --> 01:09:24,201
聽這，到飛行甲板檢查 開啟引擎
<i>Now hear this.</i> <i>Clear the flight deck to start engines.</i>

989
01:09:30,044 --> 01:09:31,978
嘿，找我的錢呢？
Hey, how about my change?

990
01:09:50,164 --> 01:09:52,792
他們給了我們15罐備用油 而不是10罐
They're giving us fifteen extra cans instead of ten.

991
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:56,826
很好，至少現在起飛能讓我們 在白天到達東京
Good. At least getting off now will put us over Tokyo in daylight.

992
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:58,895
白天不用擔心阻塞氣球
Don't forget about the barrage balloons in daylight too.

993
01:09:58,973 --> 01:10:00,270
下次你就會告訴我不用擔心了
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good

994
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:01,808

我已經裝了一個留聲機了 但我們沒有地方放唱片
I've got the phonograph in my ship. But I haven't got room for the records.

1007
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:54,557
我們重慶見，跳中國的搖擺舞
We'll meet in Chungking and cut a Chinese rug.

1008
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:56,096

I've been working on that, sir. She's still jammed.

1013
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:11,305
如果需要就用輔助燃料
We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to.

1014
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:12,505
好的，長官
<i>Right, sir.</i>

1015
01:11:13,114 --> 01:11:15,514
我們把自己弄得一團糟 是吧，勞森？
We've got ourselves in a fine jam, haven't we, Lawson?

1016
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,608
現在說這些時機真好啊

1037

他們不可能把我們扔出去
They're not gonna toss this ship overboard.

1038
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:22,038
來呀寶貝，使把勁

我們到重慶時，會告訴他們 海軍也幹得不錯
When we get to Chungking, we'll tell them it was a Navy show too.

1049
01:15:03,918 --> 01:15:07,445
他們會發現你們一文不值 加油幹

雙側機翼豎立
Both the flaps up.

1058
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:10,610
我們沒有把它們放下
We didn't even have them down.

1059
01:17:10,911 --> 01:17:13,209
- 你覺得怎麼樣？ - 我想想還忘了什麼
How do you like that? I wonder what else we forgot.

1060
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,578
咖啡、三明治、水，夠了

<i>- You all right, Thatcher?</i> - Yes, sir.

01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:59,887
如果有人走狗屎運了，一定不要放過
If anybody's carrying a rabbit's foot, hang on to it tight.

1068
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:17,242
我們的位置，麥克盧爾

1069
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:19,773
我估計離海岸還有1小時58分鐘
I figure about an hour and 58 minutes from the coast.

1070

- Keep your eyes open. - Watching, sir.

1072
01:18:25,219 --> 01:18:28,245
什麼都看不見 需要試一試這個炮塔嗎？
There's nothing in sight. Could we try out this turret again?

1073
01:18:28,322 --> 01:18:30,449
好，打開繼電器開關
Okay. Relay switch on.

1074

運轉正常，先生
It works all right, sir,

1075
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:41,596
但如果我們遇到麻煩 備用動力不能維持多久
but that emergency power's not going to hold out long if we run into trouble.

1076
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:43,136
那就關掉它
Turning it off now.

- How far are we behind our first gang? - About an hour.

1078
01:18:47,675 --> 01:18:49,040
那我們真的應該想想 怎麼應對麻煩
Then we really can get set for trouble.

1079
01:18:49,109 --> 01:18:52,875
是的，但是不像後面那些人 遇到的那樣
Yeah, but nothing like what the guys behind us are going to run into.

1080
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,644
晚上作業我感覺要好一些
I'd feel a lot better on a night job.

1081
01:18:57,284 --> 01:18:59,445
你聽見左側發動機熄火了嗎？
Did you hear that left engine miss?

1082
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,284
沒有，像是有人在嬉笑
No, singing like a lark.

1083
01:19:03,857 --> 01:19:05,586
我得聽聽聲音
I must be hearing things.

他們肯定瘋了
Those guys must be nuts.

1091

直飛日本海岸
Japanese coast straight ahead.

<i>- Shall I turn the power on for the turret?</i> - No, wait a minute.

1097
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:41,732
我不知道他們怎麼了 我想他們沒有看見我們
I don't know what happened to them, sir. I guess they didn't see us.

1098
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,037
既然都來了，就好好看一下
There she is fellows. Take a good gander.

1099
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:16,666
當我們凱旋的時候
When we get back home, the folks will want to know what

1100
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:18,506
人們肯定會問我們東京怎麼樣
Tokyo used to look like.

1101
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:51,571
那肯定是大衛.鐘斯的工作了
That must be Davey Jones giving them the works.

準備好了，長官
<i>Ready for them, sir.</i>

1112
01:26:23,063 --> 01:26:24,860
他們為何不俯衝？
Why don't they dive?

1113
01:26:29,336 --> 01:26:30,803
他們離開了
They're going away.

1114
01:26:31,605 --> 01:26:35,598
我們不等他們回來了 我們自己離開這兒
We're not going to wait for them to come back. We're getting out of here.

1115
01:26:45,318 --> 01:26:48,810
我想我們非常幸運
Well, I guess maybe we're in that lucky half.

One of the American crews has already fallen into their hands.

Hadn't they better be taken straight through to Hop Sai?

1242
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:09,640
他們受不了長途行進

You've had a long journey. Now you must rest.

1249
01:48:03,996 --> 01:48:07,227
我們團裡有的就是 一點消毒水和一些繃帶
All we had at our Mission was a little antiseptic fluid and some bandages.

1250
01:48:07,299 --> 01:48:09,392
但我們已經叫信使 去請求藥物了
But we've sent out runners for supplies.

1251
01:48:09,568 --> 01:48:11,559
有什麼辦法可以讓我 把消息送出去嗎？
Is there any way I could get a message out?

1252
01:48:11,637 --> 01:48:13,036
我想讓我母親知道我還好
I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay.

1253
01:48:13,238 --> 01:48:15,331
整個地區都被日本人佔領了
The whole region's swarming with Japanese.

1254
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,035
你們覺得合眾國知道 發生在我們身上的事嗎？
Well, do you think they've heard back in the States what happened to us?

1255
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:20,704
我們一直在聽短波 他們都知道了空襲
We've been listening in on short wave. They know all about the raid,

1256
01:48:20,779 --> 01:48:22,406
但顯然，細節並沒有被披露
but apparently they're keeping the details secret

1257
01:48:22,481 --> 01:48:24,039
要等到你們剩下的人得救以後
until the rest of your men have been saved.

1258
01:48:24,116 --> 01:48:25,140
你們找到其他人了嗎？
Have they found any of the others?

1259
01:48:25,217 --> 01:48:28,118
我得到消息說，有一隊人成功脫險 也快到這裡了
We have word that one crew will be coming through here pretty soon now.

1260
01:48:28,187 --> 01:48:30,553
我明白，他們中間有一個醫生
I understand there's a doctor among them.

1261
01:48:30,622 --> 01:48:33,455
肯定是史密斯上尉那一幫人 對不起
Oh, that must be Lieutenant Smith's crew. Excuse me.

1262
01:48:35,427 --> 01:48:38,055
史密斯上尉那一幫人 被解救了，長官
Lieutenant Smith's crew has been rescued, sir.

1263
01:48:38,363 --> 01:48:39,387
史密斯的
Smith's?

1264
01:48:39,465 --> 01:48:43,060
他們發現了史密斯和懷特醫生 他們正趕過來
They found Lieutenant Smith and Doc White and they're coming here.

1265
01:48:43,268 --> 01:48:46,965
唐.史密斯的人 那個醫生和唐.史密斯一起飛行
Don Smith's crew. The Doc was flying with Don Smith.

1266
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,431
他們快到了
They'll be here any minute now.

1267
01:48:53,045 --> 01:48:54,569
真有意思，是吧？
It's funny, isn't it?

1268
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:59,446
我的意思是 克勒文走的路線也很顛簸啊
I mean the way Clever's head just keeps rocking back and forth,

1269
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:00,815
很顛簸
back and forth.

1270
01:49:01,854 --> 01:49:04,084
一定是有人救了克勒文
Somebody ought to help Clever.

1271
01:49:17,002 --> 01:49:18,765
我覺得中國人真好
I think the Chinese are a swell bunch of people

1272
01:49:18,837 --> 01:49:20,361
但我不敢說他們的音樂
but I can't say I go for their music.

1273
01:49:20,439 --> 01:49:23,033
肖特.門奇聽到一小段這個 肯定會崩潰的
Shorty Manch would go all to pieces if he heard a little of this.

1274
01:49:23,108 --> 01:49:24,097
對
Yeah.

1275
01:49:25,611 --> 01:49:26,839
勞森怎樣了？
How's Lawson?

1276
01:49:27,546 --> 01:49:29,571
他的腳好象很糟糕，長官
Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir.

1277
01:49:29,681 --> 01:49:31,911
陳醫生覺得裡面已經壞死了
Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in.

1278
01:49:40,926 --> 01:49:42,860
好像是日本零式飛機
Looks like a Jap Zero.

1279
01:50:07,753 --> 01:50:10,244
你們應該不管我，繼續走下去
You guys ought to go on and leave me.

1280
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:15,818
我經常覺得我就要死掉了 我聽見他們說什麼了
They think I'm passed out half the time and I hear what they say.

1281
01:50:16,428 --> 01:50:19,659
日本人正在不斷逼近 你們為什麼不走？
The Japs are coming closer all the time. Why don't you guys go?

1282
01:50:19,898 --> 01:50:22,128
我們不在這兒逗留 是因為你，勞森
We're not sticking around here because of you, Lawson.

1283
01:50:22,401 --> 01:50:25,393
- 我們都不能行走了 - 我在想
- None of us here are able to travel yet. - I was just thinking.

1284
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:28,673
我想我和艾倫再也不能滑雪了
I guess Ellen and I aren't going to ski anymore.

1285
01:50:29,942 --> 01:50:31,671
那太糟了
That's too bad.

1286
01:50:32,811 --> 01:50:35,336
我會給她講一些有意思的東西
I was going to teach her some fancy stuff.

1287
01:50:35,747 --> 01:50:38,272
別那樣說，你正在恢復健康
Now don't start talking like that. You're going to pull through all right.

1288
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:43,083
你覺得一個女孩會怎樣？ 我是說艾倫和我都很喜歡滑雪
What do you think a girl would do? I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski.

1289
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:47,759
他們把我的腳鋸掉 真有點搞笑，不是嗎？
Be kind of funny if they cut my leg off, wouldn't it?

1290
01:50:48,393 --> 01:50:49,621
你為什麼不試看睡會兒覺
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

1291
01:50:49,695 --> 01:50:52,255
是有點搞笑
Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right.

1292
01:50:52,331 --> 01:50:55,562
你和一個有兩隻胳膊 兩條腿的人結了婚
You marry a guy, he's got two arms and two legs.

1293
01:50:56,568 --> 01:50:59,833
然後他回來了，但什麼都沒有了
Then he comes back and he hasn't any.

1294
01:51:08,947 --> 01:51:10,744
我是張醫生，那些小夥子呢？
- I am Dr. Chung. - Where are the boys?

1295
01:51:10,816 --> 01:51:11,976
你好，老爹
How are you, Pop?

1296
01:51:13,785 --> 01:51:15,650
路上還好吧？
Did you have a good trip?

1297
01:51:16,722 --> 01:51:19,953
在這兒呢 嘿，夥計們
- Here they are. - Hi, fellas.

1298
01:51:20,025 --> 01:51:21,754
怎麼樣了？ 你還好吧？
- How are you? - How you doing?

1299
01:51:21,827 --> 01:51:23,658
你好，軍官 見到你們真高興
- Hello, Sarge. - It's good to see you.

1300
01:51:23,729 --> 01:51:26,698
天啊，你們到底發生了什麼？ 不是很嚴重
- Holy Joe, what happened to you guys? - Nothing serious.

1301
01:51:26,765 --> 01:51:27,891
“鴨子”忘記鳧水了
The Duck forgot to duck.

1302
01:51:27,966 --> 01:51:30,764
是啊，麥克盧爾在盡力 做好他的飛行
Yeah, McClure's been trying to do his own flying ever since.

1303
01:51:30,836 --> 01:51:33,396
真像大屠殺的倖存者
This really looks like something left over from a massacre.

1304
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:35,303
你們看起來也不好啊
Well, you guys don't look so good yourselves.

1305
01:51:35,374 --> 01:51:36,671
聞起來也是
You don't smell so good either.

1306
01:51:36,742 --> 01:51:39,506
這不是我們的錯 好好洗一次澡也無濟於事
Well, there's nothing wrong with us that a good bath won't fix.

1307
01:51:39,578 --> 01:51:42,638
我也想這麼說 吃得怎麼樣？
- I wish we could say the same for you. - How's the grub around here?

1308
01:51:42,714 --> 01:51:46,445
我想吃上等的厚牛排和法國炸洋蔥
I think I'd like a good thick steak, French fried onions

1309
01:51:46,518 --> 01:51:49,112
還有烤土豆，多加點黃油
and a baked potato with plenty of butter

1310
01:51:49,187 --> 01:51:51,382
再來三瓶酒…
and about three bottles of beer...

1311
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,088
你只有吃豆芽之類的東西
You'll take bean sprouts and like them.

1312
01:51:54,826 --> 01:51:57,556
- 勞森和達文波特在哪兒？ - 他們在樓上
- Say, where's Lawson and Davenport? - They're upstairs.

1313
01:51:57,729 --> 01:52:00,664
勞森的狀況很不好 你最好去看看他
- Lawson's in pretty bad shape. - You better go up and see him.

1314
01:52:00,899 --> 01:52:02,423
他很需要你，醫生
He needs you bad, Doc.

1315
01:52:03,368 --> 01:52:06,235
再次見到你們，真的感覺很好
Well, it's certainly good to see you fellows again.

1316
01:52:06,638 --> 01:52:09,664
嘿，老爹 這裡的炒雜燴菜怎麼樣
Hey, Pop, how's the chop suey around here?

1317
01:52:13,145 --> 01:52:15,045
他不會說英語
He doesn't speak English.

1318
01:52:16,148 --> 01:52:17,775
對不起，老爹
I'm sorry, Pop.

1319
01:52:23,922 --> 01:52:28,552
肖特跳下來時 有兩把45式，一把44式來福槍
Yeah, and when Shorty jumped, he had two.45s, a.44 rifle,

1320
01:52:28,627 --> 01:52:32,757
一把22式自動槍，他自己的 魯格爾手槍，一把獵刀，一把寶蔭刀
a.22 automatic, that Luger of his, a hunting knife, a Bowie knife

1321
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:35,026
- 和一柄斧子 - 真走運
- and an ax. - What a guy.

1322
01:52:35,934 --> 01:52:40,030
他把自己的襯衣裡塞滿了巧克力棒 但卻忘了系上衣領扣
He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate bars but he forgot to button his collar.

1323
01:52:40,205 --> 01:52:41,763
所以當他拉開開降繩時
So when he pulled the rip cord,

1324
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,503
他的那些糖果就掉在 中國北方的土地上了
he just naturally molted candy all over North China.

1325
01:52:45,577 --> 01:52:48,876
- 他的照片呢？ - 和飛機一起沒了
- What happened to his photograph? - It went down with the ship.

1326
01:52:49,047 --> 01:52:52,141
第二天早上 門奇被中國人的少見多怪嚇住了
Next morning Manch scared the Chinese right out of their wits.

1327
01:52:52,217 --> 01:52:54,617
他們不知道人類可以長這麼高
They didn't know anything human grew that tall.

1328
01:52:54,953 --> 01:52:56,284
鮑勃.格雷呢？
What about Bob Gray?

1329
01:52:56,354 --> 01:52:59,755
他很好 我在想他已經動身去重慶了
He's okay. I think they moved on to Chungking.

1330
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:05,396
那個人我，查理 代我問你們好
Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me, Charlie" said to tell you hello.

1331
01:53:06,631 --> 01:53:09,998
如果不是查理的話 我們第一天就被日本人抓住了
If it hadn't been for Charlie, the Japs would have had us that first day.

1332
01:53:10,168 --> 01:53:11,897
是啊，我們也是
Yeah, us too.

1333
01:53:12,504 --> 01:53:15,769
總有一天我要回去 和那個人並肩作戰
I'd like to come back some day and fight alongside that guy.

1334
01:53:15,841 --> 01:53:16,967
我們也是
Me, too.

1335
01:53:17,342 --> 01:53:18,809
好了，今天就到這兒了
Well, it's all over.

1336
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:21,171
讓我們節省點話題 留到明天
Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.

1337
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,973
一品脫半，還不錯
A pint and a half, that's not bad.

1338
01:53:24,816 --> 01:53:26,010
你們該睡覺了
You'd better get to bed now.

1339
01:53:26,284 --> 01:53:28,275
你真是個老奶奶，醫生
You're an old grandma, Doc.

1340
01:53:31,523 --> 01:53:34,356
但是我會慢點的，作為對你的感激
But I'll take it slow, just as a favor to you.

1341
01:53:34,926 --> 01:53:36,518
再會，勞森
Be seeing you, Lawson.

1342
01:53:37,229 --> 01:53:38,423
謝謝醫生
Thanks, Doc.

1343
01:53:40,866 --> 01:53:42,333
腳怎麼樣，醫生？
How's the leg, Doc?

1344
01:53:43,335 --> 01:53:44,927
不算好，勞森
It's not good, Lawson.

1345
01:53:45,737 --> 01:53:48,433
接下來的48小時會有個決斷的
The next forty-eight hours will tell the story.

1346
01:53:49,741 --> 01:53:50,730
好吧，謝謝你
Well, thank you.

1347
01:53:50,809 --> 01:53:52,140
- 嘿，唐 - 哦
- Hey, Don. - Yeah?

1348
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:54,440
我們到了以後 叫杜利德搞一個派對
Tell Doolittle to hold off that party till we get there.

1349
01:53:54,513 --> 01:53:56,777
好的，達文波特，我們等你
Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you.

1350
01:53:56,848 --> 01:53:59,942
- 柴契爾呢？ - 他和勞森在一起，他很好
- Where's Thatcher? - He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out.

1351
01:54:00,018 --> 01:54:01,212
Okay.

1352
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:05,247
我希望你在康復之前 讓我一直待在這裡
I wish you would let me stay here until you're ready to go, sir.

1353
01:54:05,624 --> 01:54:07,091
這些人會很好的照顧我的
These people will take care of us.

1354
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:11,493
你們沒有理由留在附近 而且還有可能被抓到
There's no reason for you fellows to hang around and maybe get caught.

1355
01:54:11,897 --> 01:54:15,230
是啊，我知道，但日本人來了 我們遲早都要走
Yeah, I know, but I might come in handy if the Japs show up, sir.

1356
01:54:17,702 --> 01:54:20,262
柴契爾，當你回到美國的時候
Thatcher, when you get back to the States,

1357
01:54:20,338 --> 01:54:21,862
如果遇見了我的妻子
if you should run into my wife,

1358
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:24,833
就告訴她我很好
just tell her I'm okay.

1359
01:54:25,811 --> 01:54:29,110
不要讓她知道有什麼不對勁了
Don't let her know about anything being wrong.

1360
01:54:29,981 --> 01:54:31,539
我明白，長官
I understand, sir.

1361
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:38,248
代我向那個比令斯的女孩問個好
And say hello for me to that girl in Billings.

1362
01:54:38,924 --> 01:54:40,289
我會的，長官
That I will, sir.

1363
01:54:41,693 --> 01:54:44,355
- 再見 - 再見，柴契爾
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, Thatcher.

1364
01:55:12,123 --> 01:55:13,283
早上好
Good morning.

1365
01:55:14,125 --> 01:55:16,753
- 早上好，勞森 - 你好，醫生
- Good morning, Lawson. - Hi, Doc.

1366
01:55:19,531 --> 01:55:22,091
我儘量不傷著你，勞森 我得仔細看看這個
I'll try not to hurt you, Lawson. I'll have a look at this.

1367
01:55:31,343 --> 01:55:32,401
謝謝
Thanks.

1368
01:55:44,556 --> 01:55:46,547
你要割下這條腿嗎？
You going to take the leg, Doc?

1369
01:55:47,259 --> 01:55:48,817
我想是這樣的
Yeah, I think so.

1370
01:55:49,361 --> 01:55:52,194
我們討論過了，除此之外別無他法
We talked it over and there's nothing else to do.

1371
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:57,300
把一個人的腿割下 有些不近人情
It's pretty rough to have to cut a man's leg off.

1372
01:55:57,469 --> 01:55:59,767
但我覺得沒什麼事
I guess it'll be all right.

1373
01:56:00,572 --> 01:56:05,271
畢竟，一隻木腳就像一個高腳背的腳 穿上了一隻鞋
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like wearing a shoe with a high instep.

1374
01:56:07,445 --> 01:56:08,969
什麼時候開始？
When are you gonna do it?

1375
01:56:09,547 --> 01:56:11,606
現在我會給你打一針
I might as well give you a shot right now.

1376
01:56:11,783 --> 01:56:13,250
你是說你有什麼東西 可以讓我昏過去？
You mean we have something to knock me out?

1377
01:56:13,318 --> 01:56:16,116
我們的信使今早帶來了麻醉劑
Our runners arrived with anesthetic this morning.

1378
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:18,255
只是脊柱麻醉，勞森
It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.

1379
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:21,391
腰部以下你不會有任何疼痛感 但還是會有知覺
You won't feel anything from the waist down, but you'll be conscious.

1380
01:56:21,459 --> 01:56:23,017
這已經是最好的了
That's the best we can do.

1381
01:56:23,395 --> 01:56:24,828
好的
Oh, swell.

1382
01:56:26,598 --> 01:56:29,829
我會仔細看著你們 不會讓你們多割下一點
I can watch you and make sure you don't take off too much.

1383
01:56:31,369 --> 01:56:34,065
好的，勞森 我們要把你反轉過來了
All right, Lawson. We'll have to roll you over.

1384
01:56:47,752 --> 01:56:49,242
可能會花上一些時間
It'll take a little time to work.

1385
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:51,721
我們把你反過來到手術室裡去
We'll get you over to the operating room.

1386
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:05,125
- 醫生 - 是的
- Doc? - Yes?

1387
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,998
- 你們會切多高？ - 不會太高
- How high are you going to cut? - Oh, not too high.

1388
01:57:08,073 --> 01:57:10,871
- 我會有膝蓋嗎，醫生？ - 恐怕沒有了，勞森
- Will I have a knee, Doc? - I'm afraid not, Lawson.

1389
01:57:11,376 --> 01:57:14,504
- 有感覺嗎？ - 沒有，醫生，我…
- Any feeling there? - No. Look, Doc.

1390
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:16,877
當麻醉劑作用消失前 我們不能浪費時間
We can't waste any time, Lawson. When that anesthetic wears off,

1391
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:19,007
- 我們沒時間了 - 好的，只有一件事
- we haven't got any more. - Okay, but just one thing more.

1392
01:57:19,084 --> 01:57:20,073
說吧
Yes.

1393
01:57:20,151 --> 01:57:21,550
如果發生什麼不測
If anything happens,

1394
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:24,315
不要讓艾倫知道手術的事
don't let Ellen know anything about the operation.

1395
01:57:25,023 --> 01:57:28,618
她最好能夠以為 我是完整的死去的
She might just as well think I died while all in one piece.

1396
01:57:29,027 --> 01:57:31,587
好的，勞森 現在你沒有感覺了
All right, Lawson. Now, you're not going to feel this.

1397
01:57:31,663 --> 01:57:33,130
但你有可能緊張 跳起來或是怎麼的
But you might get nervous and jump or something,

1398
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:34,927
所以護士們要抓緊你
so the nurses are going to hold you.

1399
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:36,322
好的，醫生
Okay, Doc.

1400
01:57:37,102 --> 01:57:38,330
開工吧
Fire away.

1401
01:57:47,545 --> 01:57:51,174
當你說：“沒有膝蓋”時 你沒開玩笑吧？
Oh, when you said "no knee," you weren't kidding.

1402
01:57:52,183 --> 01:57:53,707
如果我切低了，一切都得重來
If I cut any lower we might have to do it again

1403
01:57:53,785 --> 01:57:55,878
你的身體肯定受不了
and your system couldn't take it.

1404
01:58:00,325 --> 01:58:02,520
麻醉效力怎麼了，醫生？
What're you stalling for, Doc?

1405
01:58:02,594 --> 01:58:04,619
我們在盡力，勞森，放鬆一點
We're doing the best we can, Lawson. Take it easy.

1406
01:58:04,696 --> 01:58:06,425
好的，只是再快一點
Okay. Only hurry.

1407
01:58:06,498 --> 01:58:09,023
好像我能感覺到另一隻腳了
It seems like I'm beginning to feel my other leg.

1408
01:58:17,175 --> 01:58:19,473
好像我的腳能動了，醫生
It seems like I can move my toes, Doc.

1409
01:58:24,716 --> 01:58:28,243
我想我能轉動我的腳踝了 快點，醫生，我想我能轉動了
I think I can move my ankle. Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can.

1410
01:58:30,722 --> 01:58:33,020
快點，醫生，快點
Hurry, Doc, hurry.

1411
01:58:43,902 --> 01:58:45,893
- 喂 - 喂，艾倫
<i>- Hello.</i> - Hello. Hello, Ellen?

1412
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:48,200
- 特德，你在哪兒？ - 我在一個木屋裡
<i>- Ted, where are you?</i> - I'm in a lumber camp.

1413
01:58:48,273 --> 01:58:50,867
我必須在一個泥坑裡強行著陸
I had to make a forced landing in a mud puddle.

1414
01:58:50,942 --> 01:58:53,536
- 你沒受傷吧？ - 不，一點掛傷都沒有
<i>- You aren't hurt, are you?</i> - No, not a scratch.

1415
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:58,045
- 你把聖誕樹都裝飾好了嗎？ - 是的，特德，你真該來看看
<i>- Have you got the tree all fixed?</i> - Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it.

1416
01:58:58,416 --> 01:59:00,816
太美了，樹下有東西嗎？
- It's so beautiful. <i>- Anything under it?</i>

1417
01:59:00,885 --> 01:59:04,116
- 有啊 - 好的，讓我們打開看看
- Oh, yes. <i>- Well, let's open them up.</i>

1418
01:59:04,189 --> 01:59:08,182
- 我們不能那樣 - 我們可以，去打開
- Oh, we can't do that. - Sure we can. Go ahead.

1419
01:59:08,393 --> 01:59:10,418
那好吧，你這樣說了
<i>Well, if you say so.</i>

1420
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:14,494
我的飛機毀了 這個耶誕節有被騙的感黨
I'm not going to be cheated out of my Christmas by a cracked up airplane.

1421
01:59:14,566 --> 01:59:16,534
哦，特德 這是我一生中見過的…
<i>Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful</i>

1422
01:59:16,601 --> 01:59:19,263
最美的一盒糖果
<i>box of candy</i> <i>I've ever seen in my whole life.</i>

1423
01:59:19,437 --> 01:59:23,134
周圍還有什麼嗎？
Good. Isn't there maybe something else lying around?

1424
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:27,804
- 讓我瞧瞧，還有 - 好的，打開看看
<i>- Let me see. Yes, there is.</i> - Well, open it.

1425
01:59:28,346 --> 01:59:32,510
是一個絲巾，好像是手工制的
It's a silk scarf. And it looks like it's handmade, too.

1426
01:59:33,384 --> 01:59:36,353
- 上面有我名字的首字母 - 這不公平
<i>- I'll bet it's got my initials on it.</i> - That's not fair.

1427
01:59:36,421 --> 01:59:39,015
我打開時 你偷偷看了一眼
You peeked while I was making it.

1428
01:59:39,324 --> 01:59:40,655
我是瞭解我的妻子啊
I just know my wife.

1429
01:59:40,725 --> 01:59:44,525
- 特德，我真想你在我的身邊 - 我也是，甜心
<i>- Oh, Ted, I wish you were here.</i> - So do I, honey.

1430
01:59:44,996 --> 01:59:47,089
今晚我會想你的
<i>I'll be thinking of you tonight.</i>

1431
01:59:47,165 --> 01:59:50,965
我會坐在聖誕樹下 打開收音機，放著聖誕頌歌
<i>I'll sit in front of the tree and turn</i> <i>the radio on to Christmas carols</i>

1432
01:59:51,536 --> 01:59:53,470
不停想念你
<i>and just think of you.</i>

1433
02:01:18,056 --> 02:01:21,492
謝謝你們，謝謝你們，童子軍
Thank you. And thank you, scouts.

1434
02:01:23,127 --> 02:01:26,358
我們所有人都由衷感謝你們…
I mean, all the fellows would like to thank you very much,

1435
02:01:27,232 --> 02:01:28,824
為我們付出的所有
for everything.

1436
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:46,410
上尉，我父親叫我把這個給你們
Lieutenant, my father has asked me to present this to you.

1437
02:01:46,651 --> 02:01:49,814
它從15世紀開始 就一直留在我們家了
It has been in our family since the fifteenth century.

1438
02:01:50,822 --> 02:01:54,417
父親讓我告訴你 美好的東西永遠屬於美麗的人
Father begs me to tell you that beauty belongs to beauty,

1439
02:01:54,792 --> 02:01:58,091
讓你把這個東西帶給你的妻子 就算是對她的敬意了
and asks that you honor him by presenting it to your wife.

1440
02:02:02,867 --> 02:02:05,165
謝謝，謝謝
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1441
02:02:06,404 --> 02:02:09,862
我沒想到你知道艾倫，我的妻子
I didn't know that you knew about Ellen, my wife.

1442
02:02:10,508 --> 02:02:13,341
你說過很多次了
You spoke of her a number of times.

1443
02:02:17,081 --> 02:02:21,381
上面寫著： “這是在日本投下炸彈的美國英雄
It says, "This is an American hero who has bombed Japan.

1444
02:02:21,886 --> 02:02:24,616
當他們來到中國人中間時
"Whenever he goes among the people of China,

1445
02:02:24,889 --> 02:02:27,881
請尊敬他們
"let him be accorded respect and honor."

1446
02:02:36,968 --> 02:02:38,526
他剛從高材來
He has just come from Kow Chai.

1447
02:02:38,603 --> 02:02:40,400
你們有一個人被捕了
Another one of your crews has been captured

1448
02:02:40,471 --> 02:02:42,530
日本人正朝這個方向來
and the Japanese are moving in this direction.

1449
02:02:42,607 --> 02:02:44,734
我想過幾天，勞森才能行走
I think Lawson will be able to travel in a couple of days.

1450
02:02:44,809 --> 02:02:47,277
沒有什麼，醫生 我現在就可以走了
There's nothing wrong with me, Doc. I can travel right now.

1451
02:02:47,345 --> 02:02:49,905
我擔心幾天的時間太長了
I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long.

1452
02:02:56,688 --> 02:02:58,212
這是王強
This is Wang Tsung.

1453
02:02:58,289 --> 02:03:01,156
他從他們的高材村一路趕來
He has walked all the way from his native village of Kow Chai.

1454
02:03:01,225 --> 02:03:04,786
他想送給美軍盟友們一件 表達敬意的禮物
And he begs the honor of presenting gifts to his American Allies.

1455
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,226
謝謝
Thank you.

1456
02:03:12,337 --> 02:03:13,429
謝謝
Thank you.

1457
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:20,299
謝謝
Thanks.

1458
02:03:26,084 --> 02:03:27,608
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

1459
02:03:30,988 --> 02:03:32,080
謝謝
Thank you.

1460
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:55,873
謝謝，非常感謝
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1461
02:04:07,525 --> 02:04:09,755
他感覺比我還糟
He felt a lot worse than I did.

1462
02:04:38,222 --> 02:04:39,655
我已經感覺好多了
There, I can get along pretty well already.

1463
02:04:39,724 --> 02:04:42,693
我必須得說 你第一次下床，康復得非常好
I should say very well for your first day out of bed.

1464
02:04:50,334 --> 02:04:52,859
我覺得我還要小心一點
I guess, I'll have to be a little more careful.

1465
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:55,462
我可不想讓人看見我這樣
I don't ever want anybody to see me do that.

1466
02:04:57,041 --> 02:05:00,408
我想讓人看看，我有了一隻新腳了
I don't want anybody to see me till I get a new leg.

1467
02:05:03,047 --> 02:05:05,311
懷特上尉的消息
Lieutenant White, word just came.

1468
02:05:05,383 --> 02:05:08,443
美軍飛機將在明天下午5點 從衢州機場接你們離開
The American plane will pick you up in Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00.

1469
02:05:08,519 --> 02:05:09,747
太好了
Wonderful.

1470
02:05:13,691 --> 02:05:16,888
他說如果我們不快點的話 日本人就要捷足先登了
He says if we don't hurry, the Japanese may get there first.

1471
02:05:16,961 --> 02:05:18,588
- 你們什麼時候走？ - 我們想待在這裡
- When are you leaving? - We're going to stay here.

1472
02:05:18,663 --> 02:05:19,789
我們已經很習慣了
We're quite used to it, you know.

1473
02:05:19,864 --> 02:05:21,695
- 來，這些能派上用場 - 謝謝
- Here. This may come in handy. - Thank you.

1474
02:05:21,766 --> 02:05:23,631
你和派克先生為我們做了很多
You and Mr. Parker have done so much for us,

1475
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:24,690
我們不會忘記的
and we'll never forget it.

1476
02:05:24,769 --> 02:05:25,793
- 再見，勞森 - 再見
- Goodbye, Lawson. - Goodbye.

1477
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:26,996
- 祝你好運 - 再見
- Good luck. - Thank you, sir.

1478
02:05:27,071 --> 02:05:29,699
- 再見，願上帝保佑你 - 再見，謝謝
- Goodbye. God bless you. - Goodbye. Thank you.

1479
02:05:30,441 --> 02:05:33,569
我父親想讓我告訴你們 你們的到來讓他覺得很光榮
My father wishes me to tell you that you have honored us with your visit

1480
02:05:33,644 --> 02:05:36,408
他會一直為你們的平安回國祈禱的
and that he will offer prayers for your safe return to America.

1481
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:38,005
他不和我們一起走嗎？
Isn't he coming along with us?

1482
02:05:38,082 --> 02:05:40,107
父親要和他的老鄉們待在一起
Father feels that he must stay with his people.

1483
02:05:40,184 --> 02:05:41,708
這裡的人們需要他
They will need him here.

1484
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:44,747
再見，先生
Goodbye, sir.

1485
02:06:19,023 --> 02:06:20,991
- 再見，醫生 - 再見，先生
- Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye, sir.

1486
02:06:21,225 --> 02:06:25,525
再見，醫生，感謝你們做的一切 但願我們能再次相見
- Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything. - I hope, sir, that we may meet again.

1487
02:06:25,596 --> 02:06:26,790
一定會的，醫生
That goes double, Doc.

1488
02:06:26,864 --> 02:06:28,729
再見，醫生，謝謝你
Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you.

1489
02:06:28,799 --> 02:06:29,857
謝謝你
Thank you.

1490
02:06:29,934 --> 02:06:31,959
如果有機會到美國來 來找我好嗎？
If you ever come to the States, Doctor, look me up, will you?

1491
02:06:32,036 --> 02:06:33,936
在波特蘭的黃頁裡找得到我
I'll be in the Portland telephone directory.

1492
02:06:34,038 --> 02:06:36,768
- 好的 - 再見，醫生
- With pleasure. - Goodbye, Doctor.

1493
02:06:38,309 --> 02:06:40,004
我很難過，上尉
I have one sorrow, Lieutenant,

1494
02:06:40,077 --> 02:06:43,205
我們沒有足夠的藥品 來減輕你的疼痛
that we did not have the medicine to ease your pain.

1495
02:06:43,714 --> 02:06:47,844
- 你救了我的命，醫生 - 我希望有一天你還能回來
- You saved my life, Doc. - I hope someday you will come back to us.

1496
02:06:47,919 --> 02:06:50,353
我會回來的，也許不是我們自己
We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves

1497
02:06:50,421 --> 02:06:53,254
有可能是像我們這樣的其他人 我很願意成為他們當中的一員
but a lot of guys like us. And I'd like to be with them.

1498
02:06:53,791 --> 02:06:58,524
因為你們是我們最親近的人 謝謝，先生，再見
- Because you're our kind of people. - Thank you, sir, and goodbye.

1499
02:07:57,321 --> 02:08:00,449
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

1500
02:08:01,258 --> 02:08:04,694
- 來坐下 - 謝謝
- Go ahead, sit down. - Thank you.

1501
02:08:17,508 --> 02:08:20,443
我知道你的感覺，握著試一試
I know how you feel. Take it for a while.

1502
02:08:22,813 --> 02:08:23,939
謝謝
Thanks.

1503
02:08:42,433 --> 02:08:43,559
感覺到了嗎？
Smell that?

1504
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:48,932
那是美利堅，那是美國
That's America. That's the USA.

1505
02:08:51,042 --> 02:08:54,409
每一次我航行歸來時 她都變得更加光彩照人
Every time I make a trip back, she smells better and better.

1506
02:08:54,645 --> 02:08:55,634
是啊
Yeah.

1507
02:08:56,981 --> 02:08:59,415
我想我知道你的意思 我來自匹茲堡
- I think I know what you mean. - I'm from Pittsburgh.

1508
02:08:59,483 --> 02:09:01,883
可能你覺得很怪，但是…
I know it may seem screwy to you, but

1509
02:09:02,486 --> 02:09:04,954
我能隱隱約約聞到煤煙的味道
it seems to me as if I can smell some of that coal smoke

1510
02:09:05,022 --> 02:09:08,458
馬上就到老孟農加希拉河了 有點不可思議吧？
right off the old Monongahela River. That sound crazy?

1511
02:09:08,526 --> 02:09:11,859
不，我來自加州 已經聞道橘子的味道了
No. I'm from California and I can smell orange blossoms.

1512
02:09:11,929 --> 02:09:14,762
不可能，那兒太遠了 絕對是來自佛羅里達的
Oh, it couldn't be, that's too far. It must come from Florida.

1513
02:09:14,832 --> 02:09:17,426
如果你想吃的話，一定得吃加州的橘子
Oh, if you want flavor, you've got to have a California orange,

1514
02:09:17,501 --> 02:09:21,665
但只是聞聞的話，佛羅里達就夠了
but for smelling, Florida's just as good.

1515
02:09:40,458 --> 02:09:42,983
喂…是的
Hello. Yes.

1516
02:09:44,929 --> 02:09:46,089
什麼？
What's that?

1517
02:09:48,566 --> 02:09:50,659
- 等一會兒，艾倫 - 什麼？
- Just a minute. Ellen. - Yes?

1518
02:09:50,735 --> 02:09:52,862
艾倫，華盛頓來的電話
Ellen, Washington on the phone.

1519
02:09:59,009 --> 02:09:59,998
你好
Hello?

1520
02:10:01,112 --> 02:10:03,080
你好，我是勞森夫人
Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson.

1521
02:10:04,281 --> 02:10:07,512
你好上校，杜利德上校
Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle.

1522
02:10:08,285 --> 02:10:10,082
哦，我很好，謝謝
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you.

1523
02:10:10,888 --> 02:10:13,015
非常興奮，將軍
No, not a bit excited, General.

1524
02:10:13,491 --> 02:10:17,484
他回來了，媽媽 特德回來了，他回來了
Oh, he's back, Mother. Ted's back. He's back.

1525
02:10:18,195 --> 02:10:20,755
好的將軍，他怎麼樣了
Oh yes, General, how is he?

1526
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:26,859
哦
Oh, yes.

1527
02:10:28,472 --> 02:10:29,939
我能理解
I understand.

1528
02:10:31,609 --> 02:10:33,008
我當然
Of course, I do.

1529
02:10:35,946 --> 02:10:37,971
是的，我有準備了
Yes, I'll be ready.

1530
02:10:39,416 --> 02:10:41,407
我知道，我知道
I know, I know.

1531
02:10:43,254 --> 02:10:45,449
你真的很好，將軍
Oh, that's so nice of you, General.

1532
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:50,417
好的，謝謝哦 謝謝你，將軍
Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you, General.

1533
02:10:51,095 --> 02:10:52,187
謝謝
Thank you.

1534
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:06,904
哭出來吧，親愛的
Just cry, darling.

1535
02:11:08,179 --> 02:11:09,476
哭出來
Cry it out.

1536
02:11:11,282 --> 02:11:13,273
他今天早上到的，媽媽
He got in this morning, Mother.

1537
02:11:13,384 --> 02:11:16,319
杜利德將軍剛才見到了 他這是真的
General Doolittle just saw him, so it's true.

1538
02:11:16,887 --> 02:11:19,720
杜利德將軍給我寄了一張機票
General Doolittle's sending a plane ticket for me.

1539
02:11:20,124 --> 02:11:21,887
特德不想見我
Ted doesn't want to see me.

1540
02:11:21,959 --> 02:11:24,723
他不想見我，因為他失去了一條腿
He doesn't want to see me because he's lost his leg

1541
02:11:24,795 --> 02:11:27,355
他甚至想把我瞞住
and he doesn't even want me to know it's happened

1542
02:11:27,431 --> 02:11:30,559
他有了一隻新腿並且能用以後
till he gets a new leg and learns how to use it.

1543
02:11:31,068 --> 02:11:33,195
這都不重要
As if it would make any difference.

1544
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:37,764
只要他還活著
As if anything would make any difference to me as long as he's alive.

1545
02:11:37,842 --> 02:11:41,437
哦，我得去見他，我得去見他
Oh, I'm going to see him, I'm going to see him.

1546
02:11:49,687 --> 02:11:50,676
哦
Well,

1547
02:11:52,189 --> 02:11:55,317
我們得趕緊打點行李
that means we have to get your clothes ready in a hurry.

1548
02:12:01,565 --> 02:12:03,795
我的衣服從洗衣房裡取回來了嗎？
Have my things come back from the cleaners yet?

1549
02:12:03,868 --> 02:12:05,199
我看我得帶上這件衣服
Let's see, I'll take this suit.

1550
02:12:05,269 --> 02:12:08,500
和我的藍外套，他最喜歡了
And my blue coat. He always liked it best.

1551
02:12:11,075 --> 02:12:14,306
我帶不了這麼多 我帶不了這麼多好看的衣服
I can't take any of these things. I can't take any of my pretty clothes.

1552
02:12:14,378 --> 02:12:16,346
我穿起來不合適了
They don't fit me anymore.

1553
02:12:16,413 --> 02:12:17,880
你覺得特德會注意嗎？
Do you think Ted's going to pay any attention

1554
02:12:17,948 --> 02:12:20,041
會注意到你穿的衣服 和你的樣子嗎？
to what kind of clothes you wear or how you look?

1555
02:12:20,117 --> 02:12:21,482
他會的
He always did.

1556
02:12:22,286 --> 02:12:24,186
媽媽，我很害怕
Oh, Mother, I'm scared.

1557
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:26,682
沒什麼可怕的
There's nothing to be frightened about.

1558
02:12:26,857 --> 02:12:28,950
很多人都失去了腳或手
Lots of people lose a leg or arm

1559
02:12:29,026 --> 02:12:32,052
- 但還是繼續過著正常人的生活 - 我不是害怕特德
- and continue living perfectly normal lives. - I'm not scared about Ted.

1560
02:12:32,162 --> 02:12:34,926
- 我害怕我自己 - 你自己？
- I'm scared about me. - About you?

1561
02:12:35,266 --> 02:12:40,260
你知道，時過境遷 很多丈夫和妻子就分開了
Well, you see, most husbands and wives are together while things are changing.

1562
02:12:40,471 --> 02:12:44,202
丈夫總是那樣 因為…因為這總是在發生
Husbands get used to things like that because, well, they're around.

1563
02:12:44,575 --> 02:12:48,033
特德走了好長一段時間 這段時間我又瘦了
Ted's been gone all this time and when he went away, I was so slim.

1564
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:52,209
每次他走了，他總會這樣覺得
All the time he's been gone, he's been thinking of me like that.

1565
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:55,478
特德愛你 愛倫，你也愛他
Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him.

1566
02:12:56,153 --> 02:12:59,247
這就是你們沒有人會覺察到 對方變化的原因
That's why neither of you is going to notice any change when you meet.

1567
02:12:59,423 --> 02:13:03,018
- 你這樣認為嗎，媽媽？ - 是的
- Do you think so, Mother? - I know so.

1568
02:13:11,735 --> 02:13:15,171
還有，如果我穿這樣的衣服的話
All the same, if I held my coat like this

1569
02:13:15,239 --> 02:13:18,731
我走在屋子裡 你不覺得有一點點…
when I walk into the room, don't you think it would hide me,

1570
02:13:18,809 --> 02:13:20,071
把我內心隱藏起來的感覺
just a little?

1571
02:13:29,853 --> 02:13:32,879
你好，勞森，感覺如何？
Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling?

1572
02:13:33,057 --> 02:13:34,888
- 很好，長官 - 你看起來不錯
- Pretty good, sir. - You look fine.

1573
02:13:34,959 --> 02:13:36,256
謝謝長官
Thank you, sir.

1574
02:13:36,694 --> 02:13:39,060
- 你不坐下嗎，長官？ - 哦，謝謝
- Won't you sit down, sir? - Yeah, thanks.

1575
02:13:39,797 --> 02:13:43,563
- 有什麼打算？ - 關於什麼？
- Well, got any plans? - About what, sir?

1576
02:13:43,634 --> 02:13:46,262
關於未來想做點什麼？
Well, about the future. Have you decided what you're going to do?

1577
02:13:46,337 --> 02:13:47,827
沒怎麼想，長官
Not particularly, sir.

1578
02:13:47,905 --> 02:13:50,601
我一直想成為一個航空學工程師
I always wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.

1579
02:13:51,108 --> 02:13:53,303
退伍以後
I suppose I'll start studying again

1580
02:13:53,877 --> 02:13:55,242
我想我得重新學習
after they muster me out.

1581
02:13:55,312 --> 02:13:57,303
誰說你會退伍？
Who said they'd muster you out?

1582
02:13:57,748 --> 02:13:59,443
我對任何人都沒什麼用了 沒有了…
Well, I won't be much use to anybody with a...

1583
02:13:59,516 --> 02:14:01,416
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

1584
02:14:01,485 --> 02:14:05,012
你認為我們會讓 擁有你這樣經歷的人離開嗎？
Do you think we'd let a man of your experience get away from us?

1585
02:14:05,956 --> 02:14:09,551
- 很好，長官，謝謝 - 你不要謝我
- Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you. - Don't thank me.

1586
02:14:11,996 --> 02:14:13,759
- 我突然想到了一些事，勞森
I just happened to think of something, Lawson.

1587
02:14:13,831 --> 02:14:14,820
- 什麼？
Yes, sir?

1588
02:14:15,432 --> 02:14:17,093
你的妻子呢？她知道你回來嗎？
What about your wife? Does she knew you're back?

1589
02:14:17,167 --> 02:14:18,532
- 不知道，長官 - 為什麼？
- No, sir. - Why not?

1590
02:14:19,303 --> 02:14:23,831
我想等我有一隻新腳 然後傷疤修復以後
Well, I thought I'd wait till I get my new leg and my scars fixed up.

1591
02:14:23,907 --> 02:14:25,568
那樣她就不會感到很震驚了
It won't be so much of a shock to her that way.

1592
02:14:25,642 --> 02:14:29,544
震驚？ 你娶的是一個怎樣的女孩？
Shock? What kind of a girl did you marry, anyway?

1593
02:14:29,613 --> 02:14:32,446
她很好，長官 她是一個出色的女孩
She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl.

1594
02:14:32,816 --> 02:14:34,841
那麼她就應該知道…
Well then, she deserves to know.

1595
02:14:35,419 --> 02:14:36,681
並且應該看見你
She deserves to see you too.

1596
02:14:36,754 --> 02:14:39,484
不不，長官 如果你不介意，我會一直等下去
No, no, sir. If you don't mind, I'd rather wait.

1597
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:41,758
當我再次見到艾倫時 我一定會盛裝打扮
When I see Ellen again, I'm going to be all dressed up

1598
02:14:41,825 --> 02:14:43,793
而且有了一隻新腿
and have a new leg.

1599
02:14:44,395 --> 02:14:47,523
帶她去鎮上最好的地方
And I'm going to take her out to the best place in town

1600
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:50,924
和她跳舞
and I'm going to dance with her.

1601
02:14:53,470 --> 02:14:56,564
- 那還要等上一段時間，勞森 - 不，長官
- That may be quite a while, Lawson. - No, sir.

1602
02:14:56,640 --> 02:14:58,938
你瞧我康復得很快，可能一兩個月…
You see, I'm getting along fine. And in a month or two...

1603
02:14:59,009 --> 02:15:01,910
兩個月你就得工作了 繁重的工作
In a month or two you'll be back at work, hard work.

1604
02:15:05,716 --> 02:15:07,980
好吧，我會時常來看你的，勞森
Well, I'll try to drop in on you again, Lawson.

1605
02:15:08,052 --> 02:15:09,519
- 希望你能來，長官 - 再見
- I hope you can, sir. - Goodbye.

1606
02:15:09,586 --> 02:15:10,883
再見，長官
Goodbye, sir.

1607
02:15:17,561 --> 02:15:18,960
你妻子快生小孩了，是吧？
Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she?

1608
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:20,189
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1609
02:15:23,634 --> 02:15:26,660
我也有孩子，兩個，都在服役
I've got a couple of kids myself, both in the service.

1610
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:32,803
勞森，如果我的孩子或者其他人的孩子 遇到這種情況
You know, Lawson, if my kids and all the other kids who are in this thing

1611
02:15:32,876 --> 02:15:37,506
都能處理自如，當然我不想看到
could fix it so this would really be the last one,

1612
02:15:37,581 --> 02:15:40,209
你孩子會好起來的，是吧？
your kid would get quite a break, wouldn't he?

1613
02:15:40,417 --> 02:15:42,146
他會的，長官
He sure would, sir.

1614
02:16:21,492 --> 02:16:23,687
我不得不來
I just had to come.

1615
02:16:26,563 --> 02:16:29,464
特德，特德，讓我來幫你
Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you.

1616
02:16:29,533 --> 02:16:31,660
別這樣，艾倫，會傷到孩子的
Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.

1617
02:16:40,777 --> 02:16:42,039
當最慘烈的時候
When things were worst,

1618
02:16:42,112 --> 02:16:44,808
當希望渺茫的時候
when there didn't seem to be any chance at all,

1619
02:16:44,882 --> 02:16:48,750
我能看見你的面龐，你雋秀的面龐
I could see your face, your beautiful face.

1620
02:16:52,156 --> 02:16:54,989
我知道你歸來了，特德
I knew you were coming home, Ted.

1621
02:16:57,161 --> 02:16:58,423
告訴我，親愛的
Tell me, honey.

1622
02:16:58,996 --> 02:17:00,691
為什麼你這麼可人？
