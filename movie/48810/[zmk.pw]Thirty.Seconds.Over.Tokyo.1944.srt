A lot of secret work goes on here, and they're very strict about it.

 I guess I'm just too scared.

360
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,900
�صº��Ҳ���������¼����ÿһ���¡�
Well, Ted and I figured that everything since Pearl Harbor

361
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
�����˳��
has just been so much velvet.

362
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,200
���������������ʲô�¡�
And then I guessed that if anything should happen to him,

363
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
��֪�����ᷢ����
only I know nothing will,

364
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,600
�Ҿͻ��С����������������ص���Ȼ���ŵ�ϣ��
I'd have the baby, and that would be a little bit of Ted still living.

365
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,500
����ʱ��֪������һ�ж������ˣ����ǻ�����
I sometimes wonder how we'll feel when it's all over.

366
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,000
���룬��ĳ���ط�����������һ��С���ӡ�
Just think, being able to settle down in a little house somewhere

367
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,400
�������ǵ�С������������
and raise your children and never be in doubt about anything.

368
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,100
�Ҷ����ڵ����
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts

369
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,400
�����һ���ʺ�.
that we have right now.

370
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,500

For example, will he or will he not be home for dinner?

371
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
���ǽ�Ҫ���б���ѵ��������ܵ�һ����
We're about to enter the most secret part of our training.

372
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,800
�����ܱ߶�������Ѳ�ߣ�����û���ܴ�������
This field is patrolled on all sides so no one can disturb you at your work.

373
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,100
�����ǣ��������պ�����ξ
Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.

374
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,400
����ָʾ���ǵ����
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

375
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,200
����������B-25��1500Ӣ������90Ӣ���ʱ����ɡ�
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

376
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,700
����������ǡ�
he's going to show you how to do it

377
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,900
ȫ����ը��������ʱ����500Ӣ������50Ӣ���ʱ�����
with a full load of bombs and gas in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

378
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,100
���ǽ����Զ̾������
You will attempt no short takeoffs

379
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,100
�Ӱ����ֿվ����أ���Ҷ����Կ���
from Eglin Field, where people can see you.

380
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,000
���պ�����ξ���������һЩ�������ǽ���
Lieutenant Miller will also give you a few short talks on naval etiquette.

381
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,200
�����˵����Щ���������ھ��쵽���й����ǵ�Ŀ�ĵء�
Now, if this gives you any hints as to your destination

382
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,000
�ʹ˴��������˿������
or as to what kind of work you're going to do,

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,700
��Ҫ����������
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

384
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
��������ʱ����Ҫ�������պ�����ξ
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

385
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,200
������
Gentlemen,

386
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,700
��Щ���Ӿ�������С�
those flags out there are at 

387
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,500
100��200��300��400��500Ӣ��Զ
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet from the starting line.

388
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,000
ѵ�����м����Щ��������������ɵ�
The line down the center of the field is to guide you in your takeoff.

389
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,900
���ǵ������������κεı���
The kind of work you're going to do won't permit any deviations.

390
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,400
���ڼ�ס�������ɿ�ɲ��֮ǰ��Ҫ�Ѷ����Ƶ����
Now, the whole idea is to get up full power before you release your brakes.

391
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,600
Ȼ��ʼ�����ת�ʼ�ѹ
Then start, at maximum r. p. m., manifold pressure

392
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,900
�û�������������
and with your wing flaps all the way down.

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
����Ҫ�ӿ췢����ת�ʣ�ֱ������Ϊ����Ҫȼ������Ϊֹ
You'll have to rev your motors until you think they're going to burn up.

394
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,700
Ȼ���������������б
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

395
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
�����͸о���ָ�����Ҫ
and that's a matter of sound and feel more than instruments,

396
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
�ſ�ɲ��ȥ���ϵ۰�
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

397
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,500
�Ҳ������ǵ�һ�ζ�ȥ��������
I don't expect any of you to do it the first time.

398
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
- ����
- Gray.
- �ǣ�����
- Yes, sir.

399
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,600
��������ǲ������һ������
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

400
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
ʣ�µ��˴��ڵ����������ǵı��֣��۲�һ�·���
The rest of us will stay on the ground, mark your takeoff and check the wind.

401
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
�ǣ�����
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,200
�Ҿ����ʼ���ǿ��Դӹۿ����Է���ѧ����
I think at first we can learn as much by watching trial runs

403
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
��ʵ�ʷ���һ����Ķ���
as by actually flying the ships.

404
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,300
��ô���Ǿ��������źöӣ�����������ô����
So let's all line up over here and see how he does.

405
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,000
- �ر�����������˹����
- What kind of surface wind, Ski?
- ÿСʱ8Ӣ��
- Eight miles an hour.

406
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
��û�а�����ת���������㹻��
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.

407
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
��ɭ�������ȥ
Lawson, you go next.

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,200
��ס�����ǵ�Ŀ����
Now remember, for our purposes,

409
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
���������һ�����ӷ�����棬���㹻����
if you get your wheels a foot off the ground, that's good enough.

410
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,300
����Ҫ̫�ߣ���һ��Ҫ�������뿪����
You don't need height, but you've got to get your wheels off

411
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
����Ҫ��������
before you hit the last flag.

412
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,000
��һ������ǻ᳢�ԣ���450Ӣ�����ջ�����
A little later we'll try retracting the wheels at around 450 feet

413
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,400
ȫ�����ǵķ�����֧��
and relying on your motors to float the ship.

414
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,100

- Don't try that just yet, though.

- Right, sir.

415
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,500
ץס���Ƹ���������ֱ�������˼ᶨ��������
Now, grab the column and pull her until you feel the inside of your backbone.

416
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,900
�ǣ�����
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,600
���ʻ��B-25��500Ӣ��������𣿳���
Did you ever take off a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?

418
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,600
û�У��������ǿ��Ա���
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,000

Watch Lawson there.

420
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,200
�������ٵðѷ�����ת���ᵽ�����ߣ���������
You'll have to rev your motors at least that high and maybe higher.

421
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,500
��Լ7ooӢ�ߣ����յ�������β�ˣ���û�����ü���������
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid. Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

���ֵܣ��ղŵ���������龪һ����
Brother, that takeoff was strictly on the cob.

423
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,900

That airplane of yours looked exactly like a ruptured duck.

How do you like this guy?

425
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,900

426
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900

and then he's got the nerve to talk about a real ship.

It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field, or you'd still be there.

00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,700
���Ǻ����˿��Բ��ڡ������ա���˯��
This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.

Yeah. Wonderful accommodations, but nothing much to do.

724
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,200
�Ҿ�������Ӧ������ֽ�ƻ�������ʲô��Ϸ
I thought there'd at least be a poker game or something going on.

725
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,100

Oh, I guess they have them every once in a while.

726
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,100

How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever play much of that around here?

727
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,700

What's Seven-Toed Pete?

728
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,800
����һ�������Ƶ���Ϸ
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

729
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,700

I wonder if they got their pay before they came aboard.

As you were.

739

we're going straight to Japan.

The Navy will take us within 400 miles of the Japanese mainland.


742
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,600
���ǻ�Ϯ���ձ��Ķ��������
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

744
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,800

It'll be a night job and

745
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,300
���ǿ���ѡ��������ȥ�ĵط�
you will be given the opportunity of choosing the city you prefer.

746
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,200

Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

747
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,500
�й�����׼������ռ��������С��ģս��
The Chinese have prepared small fields just outside of Japanese occupied territory

748
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,600

749
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,300

They'll gas us up and we'll take off for Chungking.

From now on we're in constant danger of enemy attack.

751
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,600

If there should be a surface attack,

752

stand by your planes with fire extinguishers

and let the Navy handle it.

754
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,000

If there should be an attack by air, take off and make for the nearest land.


755
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,600
�������ṩ������Ϣ������һ��
The Navy will give all navigators their bearings twice a day.

756
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,100
���о��ǣ��һ�Ҫǿ����
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...

757
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,200

If any of you feel you're not up to this job, it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

Are there any questions?

763
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,700

Then, following the line of the bay and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

845
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,300
���Ǳ��������������
you should take out this and this.

01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,400

Both of them are machine shops owned by brothers,

Then on out here to drop your incendiary. How does this line up for you, Lawson?

Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

850
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,500

The run seems all right for me if it's okay for you.

Yes. Over here, fellows.

854
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,300

Now you'll take off about here. You go due west to Tokyo

When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500 feets

01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,500
��ɺ�ը���½����뿪½��
complete your bombing run, then down again and out to sea,

859
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,000

By the way, I'm taking off first with four incendiaries.

862
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000

That should light up Tokyo pretty well for you.

863
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,200
���ǵ����й����䳡�᲻�ᱻ�ձ�ռ���ˣ�
Suppose by the time we get to China, the Japs have taken over the landing field?

01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,600

865
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,600

The Chinese will arrange a signal for you when you get to the field

866
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,900
�������һֱ���У����ȼ���þ�
If that's the case you've got to keep right on going until you've run out of gas

867
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,500
Ȼ����ɡ�����Ȼ��ѷɻ��ٵ�
then bail out and destroy your planes.

01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,500

01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,300

You know, it's funny.

893
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,600

903
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,000

01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,000

In the event of an emergency there will be no assembly.

There were a lot of planes and we had to take off early.

They aren't in any shape to make much of a trip, Doctor.

All up and down the Chinese Coast.

My countrymen are seeking your countrymen.

We'll bring them through.

They took Ching Ming three hours after our departure.

One of the American crews has already fallen into their hands.

1237

Hadn't they better be taken straight through to Hop Sai?

1238
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,300

They couldn't stand the trip.

This is my father, Dr. Chung.

We'll take care of everybody.

You won't have to take it off, will you, Doc?

All we had at our Mission was a little antiseptic fluid and some bandages.

01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500

Is there any way I could get a message out?

1251
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,800

We've been listening in on short wave. They know all about the raid,

They'll be here any minute now.

Somebody ought to help Clever.

Shorty Manch would go all to pieces if he heard a little of this.

he just naturally molted candy all over North China.

Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow.

A pint and a half, that's not bad.

You'd better get to bed now.

Thatcher, when you get back to the States,

if you should run into my wife,

just tell her I'm okay.

1354
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,200

Don't let her know about anything being wrong.

I understand, sir.

I'll try not to hurt you, Lawson. I'll have a look at this.

You going to take the leg, Doc?

Yeah, I think so.

1365
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:51,400

We talked it over and there's nothing else to do.

1366
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,500
��һ���˵��ȸ�����Щ��������
It's pretty rough to have to cut a man's leg off.

1367
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,900
���Ҿ���ûʲô��
I guess it'll be all right.

1368
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:04,400
�Ͼ���һֻľ�ž���һ���߽ű��ĽŴ�����һֻЬ
After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like wearing a shoe with a high instep.

01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,100
ʲôʱ��ʼ��
When are you gonna do it?

I might as well give you a shot right now.

1371
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,500

You mean we have something to knock me out?

1372
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,300

Our runners arrived with anesthetic this morning.

1373
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,500

It'll only be a spinal, Lawson.

1374
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,600
���������㲻�����κ���ʹ��, �����ǻ���֪��
You won't feel anything from the waist down, but you'll be conscious.

1375
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,200
���Ѿ�����õ���
That's the best we can do.

Oh, swell.

1377
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:28,900

I can watch you and make sure you don't take off too much.

01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,200
�õģ���ɭ,����Ҫ���㷴ת������
All right, Lawson. We'll have to roll you over.

1379
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,400
���ܻỨ��һЩʱ��
It'll take a little time to work.

1380
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,000
���ǰ��㷴��������������ȥ
We'll get you over to the operating room.

1383
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,000

1385
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:16,000
��������������ʧǰ, ���ǲ����˷�ʱ��
We can't waste any time, Lawson. When that anesthetic wears off,

1386
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,100
- ����ûʱ����
- we haven't got any more.
- �õģ�ֻ��һ����

Yes.

1388
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:20,700

If anything happens,

1389
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,400
��Ҫ�ð���֪��������������
don't let Ellen know anything about the operation.

1390
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,900

She might just as well think I died while all in one piece.

1391
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,700
�õģ���ɭ��������û�ио���
All right, Lawson. Now, you're not going to feel this.

1392
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,300
�����п��ܽ���������������ô��
But you might get nervous and jump or something,

1393
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,100
���Ի�ʿ��Ҫץ����
so the nurses are going to hold you.

1394
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,500

Okay, Doc.

1395

01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:50,300

1397
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,900
������е��ˣ�һ�ж�������
If I cut any lower we might have to do it again

1398
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000

and your system couldn't take it.

What're you stalling for, Doc?

We're doing the best we can, Lawson. Take it easy.

Who said they'd muster you out?

Well, I won't be much use to anybody with a...

What are you talking about?

Do you think we'd let a man of your experience get away from us?

What about your wife? Does she knew you're back?

Well, I thought I'd wait till I get my new leg and my scars fixed up.

It won't be so much of a shock to her that way.

Well then, she deserves to know.

She deserves to see you too.

When I see Ellen again, I'm going to be all dressed up

Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she?

You know, Lawson, if my kids and all the other kids who are in this thing

your kid would get quite a break, wouldn't he?

He sure would, sir.

Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby.

When things were worst,
