1
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,782
Damn you, Will Penny!

2
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:06,373
Steal my biscuits and
bring me no firewood!

3
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,750
What the hell's got into you?

4
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:14,378
Them biscuits ain't for you to steal.
They ain't to be ate till I say so.

5
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,296
Now, come on, give 'em back.

6
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,221
At least give me some coffee.

7
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:26,598
Bring me some firewood.

8
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,902
Go on. Pot ain't boiled yet anyhow.

9
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:09,860
Chuck! Come and get it, you
cow-nurses, or I'll throw it out!

10
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:13,775
- Chuck's on!
- Come on out, boys.

11
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:18,315
Get outta those blankets, damn you!

12
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,492
- Wearing snowshoes, Bo?
- You've been walkin' on my feet.

13
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:03,619
Old man like you belongs at the
end of the line. We do all the work.

14
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:09,130
I'm surprised you got this far.
You earned yourself a warm corner.

15
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,631
That's enough, Shorthorn.

16
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:18,797
Was you about to do something?
'Cause I'd sure clean your plough.

17
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:44,243
- Whoa!
- Ride him!

18
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,797
You stupid, jug-head bastard!

19
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,677
Last day. Make it a good one.

20
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:05,019
Get there today and
you make your bonus.

21
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,314
Get where? Ain't a bottle of whisky
or a town inside a week of here.

22
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:13,938
Save your money! Get a
spread of your own, like me.

23
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:18,362
- Money didn't get you into cattle.
- No? What did, Will?

24
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:21,870
More like a long rope and a hot iron.

25
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,116
Let's go!

26
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:15,505
Don't be afraid to ask for
help when you need it, old man.

27
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,432
It's time you did something, Will.

28
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,305
Fightin' don't get the work done.

29
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:14,939
- Something chasing you, Dutchy?
- If the augur sees you, he'll get mad.

30
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:19,447
Ja. I see where they're taking
us. Nowhere, that's where.

31
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:22,457
Nowhere at all!

32
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:39,263
Who figures it out they
put a spur there? What for?

33
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:45,722
Everybody trying to get ahead. Train
company wants to get to the cows.

34
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,849
Anse wants to get to market
first, to get top price.

35
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,863
And the poor cow-hand rides drag.

36
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:56,069
- Better than pushin' a plough.
- Ja.

37
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,512
Down steer!

38
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,814
Bigfoot! Comin' a-runnin'!

39
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,876
He busted my damn leg!

40
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:04,474
- Gimme some air, boys.
- Stand back, boys.

41
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,194
She's busted, all right.
Grab a hold of this.

42
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:20,739
- Here.
- You've been holding out on us.

43
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:24,912
That stuff's for doctoring,
not drinking. Hang on to him.

44
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,414
That's enough.

45
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:36,253
- Feels like it's smashed to pieces.
- He'll go to Kansas City with us.

46
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:40,264
He'll get a doctor there
and his train ticket home.

47
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,812
What if he can't work
for you no more, Anse?

48
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:49,395
That's the fall of the cards.
He'll get a job some place.

49
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:55,027
Ike, how did you manage that? Real
slop. But that's the way I like it.

50
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,659
You do the cooking.

51
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:02,035
I'll get a job where the horse has
the brains and does all the work.

52
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,911
Well, look who's here. Where
you been hidin', Grandpa?

53
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,169
Might not be good, but it's hot!

54
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:30,061
- You ain't fightin' proper!
- You're the one that's down.

55
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:36,905
I told you that leaky mouth
would jump up on you, Boetius!

56
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:44,199
- Won't you fight with these?
- My hands are for working.

57
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:51,341
If the Lord wanted men to fight like
dogs, He'd've give 'em teeth and claws.

58
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:56,295
He's younger than you
figure, ain't it, sonny?

59
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,640
You go to your gun,
I'll hang you right here!

60
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:11,394
- You boys wanna fight, or get paid?
- Get paid!

61
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:18,449
- If you can't write, make your mark.
- I went to four grades of school!

62
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:37,384
- Want your train ticket?
- Don't need it. Got my wagon.

63
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,558
Move on. Let the next man in.

64
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:49,644
You can't cowboy as good
as you write. Ticket?

65
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:54,447
No ticket for me. I think
I ride along with Blue.

66
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:32,612
- What's your whole name, Will?
- Penny. Will Penny.

67
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,404
- You got any family?
- No.

68
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:38,654
Another job to go to?

69
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,579
This time of year? You
know better than that.

70
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,962
You're a good steady hand.
You can be bull-nurse with me.

71
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,378
Wait here for the train
and ride to Kansas City.

72
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,924
Sure thing.

73
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:02,428
Mr Howard. Can I go
with you to Kansas City?

74
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:07,730
- You wanna see the elephant?
- Naw, hell. I've been there before.

75
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:11,852
My pa lives there.
He's gettin' pretty old.

76
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:17,821
If I don't see him on this trip,
I won't see him again at all.

77
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:22,577
I already got Will Penny.

78
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:27,912
If you wanna go, you've got
more than enough to get there.

79
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,839
Well, you're a fair man, Mr Howard.

80
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,053
I'll see you punchers some time.

81
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:41,721
- Ever been to K.C.?
- No. I guess I'll see the elephant.

82
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,723
Ja!

83
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:54,738
Wiedersehen, Will.

84
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,362
- Will. I gotta talk with you.
- Sure.

85
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,947
It's about my pa.

86
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:05,337
- So long, Anse.
- So long, Bo.

87
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:08,459
Damn haul gets longer every year.

88
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,629
See you back in cactus country.

89
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:19,967
I don't know, Bigfoot. It puts
me out of a job mighty sudden.

90
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:24,356
- North of here, Flatiron might
be hiring. - In the winter?

91
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:28,736
I wouldn't lie to you,
honest. Hold on... Look...

92
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,355
I'll give you some of
my pay. Twenty dollars!

93
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:35,367
Which one of you is coming with me?

94
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:39,914
Aw hell, go on, then.

95
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,032
Gimme ten dollars so I
don't feel like a damn fool.

96
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:48,625
- Me, Mr Howard, if it's OK.
- Come on.

97
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,089
- Much obliged, Will.
- Yeah.

98
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:05,564
You fellas got room
for one more hand?

99
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,651
So long, boys!

100
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,873
So long, boys!

101
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,484
Hey, Blue. Come on, wake up.

102
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,744
I bet there's some place in
this wilderness they got whisky.

103
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:03,293
- And beds.
- I forgot what it tastes like.

104
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:07,245
And a bath. I think I got bugs.

105
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:10,341
Just one shot.

106
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,964
I hope we can find us a job.

107
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:22,392
Not the three of us together. Ain't no
place they hire three hands in winter.

108
00:15:22,564 --> 00:15:26,776
One job's all I need. Sharing
a blanket don't make us married.

109
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:30,989
Will, I think he'll find that
Flatiron spread to hire on.

110
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:39,412
It's a damned good thing he can
cowboy, 'cause he sure can't navigate.

111
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,499
It ain't hot yet.

112
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,379
Come on! Go and get the water!

113
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,917
All right.

114
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:22,791
- What the hell...?
- It's an elk! Fresh meat!

115
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:04,083
Hey! Good shot, Blue. You got him.

116
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:08,625
- But I didn't. Didn't you?
- Didn't I...?

117
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:14,468
Ja. I shot him with my knife.

118
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:18,723
- Let's move him.
- Or somebody gonna be mad.

119
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:21,565
Madder than a stud at gelding time.

120
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:39,623
Careful. They got the sun on us.

121
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,462
Rawhiders.

122
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:49,081
Ja. It's bad business.

123
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:54,929
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

124
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,469
Name's Quint. Preacher
Quint. These here are my boys.

125
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,396
Mighty nice of you
mindin' that elk for us.

126
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:09,862
We can clean it up ourselves.

127
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:13,116
Rafe, here, handles
a knife just fine.

128
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,568
We give them the elk, ja?

129
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:20,538
We were onto it first. Next
thing, they'll want our breeches.

130
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,247
Come on, Papa. Let's kill 'em.

131
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,627
We seen a whole camp back there.
Where's the rest of the party?

132
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,585
My shot brought it down.

133
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:35,511
- Maybe we split 'im up with you.
- Shut up, Dutchy.

134
00:18:35,683 --> 00:18:40,511
Well, now. That's better.
There's five of us.

135
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,895
Countin' my woman.

136
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,984
However many there is of you,

137
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:50,613
if you was only two, that elk
might be enough to go round.

138
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:56,654
We'll work it out that way.
Then we all go away friends, ja?

139
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:59,534
There's more of us.
But we'll make do.

140
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:05,877
I don't see no more of you. Maybe
you're saying that to trick us.

141
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:11,672
Or maybe you're saying that
because you know that elk is ours.

142
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:17,018
And you're scared because the
Lord don't side with them...

143
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,696
that lies and steals.

144
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,557
The Lord sides with the righteous.

145
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:24,897
If you go away, maybe
the Lord will go easy

146
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:28,438
and forget you tried to
rob folk of what's theirs.

147
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,074
Walk away in peace.

148
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:38,119
- We leave them the damn elk!
- If they let us.

149
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,038
They killed Romulus!

150
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,894
Beware the wrath of the Lord!

151
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:47,016
He strikes down them that
have blood on their hands.

152
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:50,481
He punisheth the sinner.

153
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,276
Life for life.

154
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,573
Eye for eye.

155
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,872
Tooth for tooth.

156
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:04,504
Burnin' for burnin'.

157
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,588
Wound for wound.

158
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,713
Stripe for stripe.

159
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:16,217
Who sheddeth man's blood,

160
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:20,011
by man shall his blood be shed.

161
00:21:26,237 --> 00:21:29,024
You ain't seen the last of me!

162
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,156
Blue!

163
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:48,122
- Dutchy, what's wrong?
- I'm shot.

164
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:58,643
I think maybe I done it to myself. I
couldn't get the gun out of my pocket.

165
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:06,480
Don't you move. We'll get the wagon.

166
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:08,730
Blue!

167
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,068
- Don't forget the elk.
- Yeah.

168
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,795
Hey! Pig, pig, pig...

169
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:06,375
Is there a doctor
nearby? A man's hurt.

170
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:09,669
- Come in. Maybe I can help.
- No, thank you.

171
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:12,300
Isn't there a damn doctor close?

172
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:17,099
About a half day's fast ride
up the road. Town of... Alfred.

173
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,945
If you're bad enough to see a doctor,

174
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,665
time you get there
it's too late anyway.

175
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:27,321
- How bad's your friend
hurt? - Bad. He's gut-shot.

176
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,356
Belly-shot out here? He's
a dead man for certain.

177
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:34,784
He'll bleed to hell
before he gets to Alfred.

178
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:40,164
Hello. Name's Catron. Place is mine.

179
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,253
Got some good whisky inside.

180
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,472
Best to make him rest easy
while he waits for the end.

181
00:23:56,644 --> 00:24:00,143
Anything he drinks, on the
house. Bury him out back.

182
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:05,771
I'll carve him a nice head-marker.
Twenty-five dollars sound about right?

183
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,650
You sound almighty
sure he's gonna die.

184
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:13,699
Sure, I'm sure. Best to face
these things so you can make plans.

185
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:21,456
Dutchy? How are you makin' out?

186
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,962
Oh, Will... It hurts like hell.

187
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:30,427
- We'll go on.
- Hey, Will...

188
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:35,935
Maybe he's right, what he said...
that I die before we get there.

189
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:37,976
No, hell...

190
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:45,522
We have waited a long time
for a drink of whisky, ja?

191
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:50,272
Here is the last place
before that town, and...

192
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:55,152
you know, maybe
I'll never get there.

193
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:59,458
Will... I'd like to
have a sure drink here.

194
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:02,911
Better than a maybe drink later on.

195
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:10,087
It couldn't hurt so much, one drink.

196
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,720
Come on!

197
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:22,481
Yes, sir! Planning means a man
don't get any unhappy surprises.

198
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,944
Take your friend. You know,
and he knows, he's gonna die.

199
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:30,399
You don't have to fight over
his goods. Take that coat,

200
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:36,696
for a coat like that, I'd
give a man five, six dollars.

201
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,949
- You...!
- Will!

202
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:54,343
Give us a bottle and three glasses.

203
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:03,150
Can you pay?

204
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:07,526
You got more guts than a
man could hang on a fence.

205
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:09,773
We can pay.

206
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:33,178
How's she taste?

207
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,514
Damned if I know. But it
sure burns a dollar's worth.

208
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,981
Good, ain't it?

209
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:07,291
Ma!

210
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:13,843
- Ma!
- HG, don't shout. I can hear you.

211
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:18,096
There's a man, he's hurt.
He's lying there in a wagon.

212
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:21,058
- Is he alive?
- Sure is.

213
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:26,227
He's cussing something awful, some
words I never even heard before.

214
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:44,502
You have to get to a
doctor, immediately.

215
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:48,623
Too late for a doctor. No...

216
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:52,588
I'm just a dying cowboy.

217
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:57,012
Well... There must
be something I can do.

218
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:02,556
If, maybe, you could...

219
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:07,068
hold my hand?
- Of course.

220
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,661
- You're an angel, lady.
- Tell me, how did it happen?

221
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:18,121
Wild Indians they was, lady.

222
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:21,792
Maybe... fifty.

223
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:25,878
My friends ran away and
left me to fight them off.

224
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:29,550
Why, the cowards! That's terrible!

225
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:33,766
Ja, that's right. Them bummers.

226
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:37,635
They wait until them
Indians is all finished,

227
00:28:37,814 --> 00:28:41,645
then they come back,
and bring me here.

228
00:28:42,693 --> 00:28:44,982
Here you go, Dutchy.

229
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,990
Thanks, Will.

230
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,994
Least I can do after you
killed all them Indians.

231
00:28:55,206 --> 00:29:00,034
Are you one of the men, his
friends, who left him to the savages?

232
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:03,794
- We surely did.
- You call yourself a man?

233
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:09,208
You call yourself his friend
and then you do this to him.

234
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:15,925
If I were you, I'd never speak...
I would never speak to them again.

235
00:29:16,103 --> 00:29:18,808
Ja. Maybe I won't.

236
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,932
I cannot comprehend behaviour
like yours, I simply can't.

237
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:32,492
It's easy to figure, ma'am.
We just ain't as brave as him.

238
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,205
Dutchy's... plumb brave.

239
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes. And you leave
him to die in the cold.

240
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,833
At least bring him inside.

241
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:48,961
That won't help him, juggling
that bullet around in his innards.

242
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,716
Is that going to help him?

243
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:59,184
It may not put him back on his feet but
it won't put him in his grave either.

244
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:07,279
Is there anything more
I can do to help you?

245
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:11,863
No.

246
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:29,300
Hey, Will.

247
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:33,007
What he said, that... Schwein...

248
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:37,098
is he right, do you think?

249
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,234
- I will die?
- It happens to all of us, Dutchy.

250
00:30:43,402 --> 00:30:45,858
No, Will. You know what I mean.

251
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,073
Is now my time?

252
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:55,159
We'll get you to that doctor.

253
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:59,329
I don't know, Dutchy.
How the hell do I know?

254
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:05,121
There's a lot I ain't
done yet. Cowboyin' around.

255
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,004
Hurts like hell.

256
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:16,686
- I'll get you another drink.
- Will?

257
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:20,143
I'm only 27 years old.

258
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:36,744
- Want part of the bet?
- What bet?

259
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:40,701
He bet 50 dollars Dutchy
don't make it to... Where's it?

260
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,336
- Alfred.
- Want some of that?

261
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,832
- All you got.
- Another 50!

262
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:50,838
- You got a bet.
- Let's drink on it, like gentlemen.

263
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:53,932
How do you know what gentlemen do?

264
00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:09,822
Mr Bodine.

265
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:18,413
Mr Bodine, you promised to get us
to California before winter set in.

266
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:24,090
- That's what my husband paid you for.
- Yes, ma'am. He sure did.

267
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,261
As soon as you finish that plate,
we're leaving. Is that clear?

268
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:33,851
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:49,701
Let's have another bottle.
One of them St Louis ones.

270
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,663
- Mr Bodine!
- That'll be three dollars, ma'am.

271
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,434
Hurry up, HG.

272
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:37,622
Get your stockings.

273
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,794
Hold on.

274
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,358
- What do you think, Will?
- About what?

275
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,903
About Dutchy.

276
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:13,574
- You known him a long time?
- No.

277
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:19,494
- Why did you bet?
- Why did you?

278
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:30,504
We been working the same outfits,
three, four years running.

279
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:36,425
He's a good old boy.

280
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:39,855
And this ain't a good
way for him to go.

281
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:44,981
I'll tell you Blue, there
ain't no good way to go.

282
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:48,284
Let's drink up and get outta here.

283
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,512
- Sonny?
- Yes, sir?

284
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,359
- Where's the doctor?
- Doctor?

285
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:26,565
- They said you got a doctor here.
- Down the street. The barber's shop.

286
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,825
Where it says "Post Office".

287
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,931
Doctor? There's a man hurt out here.

288
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:59,765
How about it? He's bad shot.

289
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:03,856
Shot, hell. He's damn
near frozen to death.

290
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:12,277
He smells like a still. Did you
stop off on the way to celebrate?

291
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,573
Slow and easy. If you move too
fast, they might miss something.

292
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:24,170
Over there on the couch.

293
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,259
Better go home, John.
I'll finish you later.

294
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:52,954
If I want any help, I'll send
for you. You can go home now.

295
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:11,047
Mattie! I'll need you.

296
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:22,694
You must have taken your
own sweet time getting here.

297
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:27,156
This is my wife, Mrs Fraker.

298
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:29,483
I don't know their names.

299
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:36,122
If we straighten him out too
fast, he'll break, he's that cold.

300
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:40,504
Let's warm him up, and
then get his clothes off.

301
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,969
Why don't you boys go to the
hotel, get yourselves a bath?

302
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:52,679
Come back tomorrow morning.

303
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,648
Children. Dangerous children.

304
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:20,338
- But it's so early!
- Early, hell. The sun's up.

305
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,377
Oh. The sun's up.

306
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,134
Go along, now. I'll see you again.

307
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:31,341
Not if I see you first.

308
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:39,938
Will, are you really
that set on going?

309
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,935
I'd not care to winter here.

310
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,150
The way money goes, I'd
be sellin' my saddle.

311
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,650
But ridin' the grub line up here?

312
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,495
There's that Flatiron
spread Bigfoot spoke about.

313
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:58,079
If that don't work out, I
guess I'll head south. You?

314
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,337
I reckon I'll just
hang around a spell.

315
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:07,253
Maybe get a job bar-doggin'.
See how old Dutchy makes out.

316
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:12,306
Maybe we'll cut trails
some day, south of here.

317
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,967
Maybe so, Will.

318
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:39,588
Yeah. That's him, all right.

319
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:46,927
Ain't no way to forget him.
Not while he's alive, anyway.

320
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:51,046
- We sure as hell can fix that
in a hurry. - Not yet.

321
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,760
Plenty of time.

322
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:57,314
He ain't going nowhere
we can't find him.

323
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:02,144
And we're just gonna take
our own good time about it.

324
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,864
About carvin' him up.

325
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:10,265
You make 'im out, Alex?

326
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:19,023
- Somebody ridin' grub line, I suppose.
- That's a Flatiron horse.

327
00:41:19,193 --> 00:41:23,736
- Ain't that Bright Eyes?
- Yeah, one of old Claude's string.

328
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:42,751
- Want to talk about this?
- I found him like that.

329
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:49,179
I guess he came off and wrapped up
the whole ball of wax, right there.

330
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,726
- Old Claude was a good horsebacker.
- Pretty forky.

331
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:57,265
If you say so. I
never had the pleasure.

332
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:02,274
What brings you up here?

333
00:42:02,446 --> 00:42:05,567
- Are you the stud duck?
- That's right.

334
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:10,366
I just shoved a bunch from
Texas, put 'em on the train...

335
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:14,667
and went off the payroll.
- You're looking for a meal?

336
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:20,833
No, I'm looking for a job. One of the
Texas hands said you might be hirin'.

337
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:23,208
I'll take 'im.

338
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:26,588
He ain't comin'. I come instead.

339
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:34,182
- You must need a hand. -
Claude was a good cow-puncher.

340
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:40,395
- Mighty good man all the way round.
- Well, sure.

341
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:44,437
- That's always the way.
- What's always the way?

342
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:49,656
Let a man die, right
away he's good old Claude.

343
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:53,780
How was he before he bucked out?

344
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:03,917
You boys, go dig a proper grave.
We'll hold services for him later.

345
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:07,178
Come on over to the bunkhouse.

346
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:39,210
This here gentleman
calls himself Will Penny.

347
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:47,297
He comes ridin' around here as nice as
you please, hopin' to find a nice job.

348
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:52,430
And there lays old
Claude, just beggin' him:

349
00:43:52,603 --> 00:43:57,016
"Take mine, Mr Penny, take mine!"

350
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:02,185
Hell, that's the story
you give the big augur.

351
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:08,236
Now, we're just no-account
cow-punchers together, here.

352
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,495
Ain't no need for you
to tell us them lies.

353
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:22,336
Well, son. You dealt this hand. I
guess you'll just have to play it out.

354
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:25,545
Hold it! All of you.

355
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,265
This man's on the payroll. A
Flatiron hand, not a stranger.

356
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,435
Any eyeballing done
around here, I'll do it.

357
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:39,856
- Hell, we're just trying to help 'im.
- Yeah, like a sharp stick in the eye.

358
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:43,528
Take Claude's job, line-rider
in the ridge country.

359
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:46,616
Pay's 30 dollars a month.

360
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:50,616
Are you sure you rode line before?

361
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:54,323
Sure enough to have mighty
strong feelings about it.

362
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,743
You can tell he's done it before.

363
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:06,592
We got rules here on the Flatiron.
You hold to 'em and we'll be friends.

364
00:45:06,764 --> 00:45:11,510
Break 'em and you're out before
you can say, "Excuse me, ma'am."

365
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:14,936
First, we got no
drinkin' or gamblin'.

366
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:20,184
Cut the wolf loose all you want
in town, but not on this layout.

367
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:23,114
- Is that plain?
- Plain enough.

368
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:27,908
The pilgrims that come through:
As long as they keep movin', fine.

369
00:45:28,078 --> 00:45:32,206
If they take a beef now and
then, you don't do much either.

370
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:37,369
But you don't let nobody stop.
That's the most important thing.

371
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:41,247
Nobody stops on Flatiron range.

372
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:45,294
- What if they don't move?
- They'll move all right.

373
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:48,840
Won't nobody say nothing
about it, neither.

374
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:54,344
One of the boys'll tell you
how to get to the old shack.

375
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:58,852
Three or four days' ride.
Is there anything else?

376
00:46:00,946 --> 00:46:04,030
No. I reckon you said it all.

377
00:46:09,413 --> 00:46:15,000
About them nesters. If there's too
many to handle, come back for help.

378
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:18,620
Otherwise, I don't wanna
hear from you till spring.

379
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,106
Hello, the shack!

380
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:27,323
You may as well come on out.

381
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:31,990
This here's Flatiron
range. You can't squat here.

382
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,724
Don't... don't shoot!

383
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,935
Please! Don't shoot.

384
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:08,234
My name's Will Penny. You
remember me, ma'am, from the...

385
00:48:08,412 --> 00:48:12,162
road ranch, that
man Catron's place?

386
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:16,746
- Don't come nearer! I'm alone and...
- Ma!

387
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:23,458
The boy's right. Don't ever tell
a stranger out here you're alone.

388
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:28,263
- Where's your guide, Mr Bodine?
- He went on ahead.

389
00:48:29,684 --> 00:48:33,682
- Did he get paid?
- My husband paid him in St Louis.

390
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:37,141
He ain't comin' back,
I can promise you that.

391
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:41,102
Anybody could see he
had no stomach for it.

392
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,605
Now look at you.

393
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:48,323
You and the button, you
can't sleep in the wagon.

394
00:48:48,496 --> 00:48:50,986
Well, of course we won't.

395
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:54,250
- You can't stay here.
- Why?

396
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:58,084
This is Flatiron range.
The rules say no squatters.

397
00:48:58,256 --> 00:49:02,835
If you won't move on peaceable,
somebody will come and make you.

398
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,131
Are you gonna do that?

399
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:09,640
If I don't, they'll just send some...

400
00:49:11,896 --> 00:49:13,687
That's how it is up here.

401
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:16,476
Nobody's using this
old shack, anyway.

402
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:20,483
A line-rider uses it, son.

403
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,408
Look, there ain't no way...

404
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:26,279
Don't come any nearer.
This may go off.

405
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,529
Please, don't be scared.

406
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:35,081
I ain't gonna hurt you none.
Look, I'll be on my way.

407
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,087
Please be careful with
that damned thing, ma'am.

408
00:49:39,258 --> 00:49:42,294
I'll be gone two, three
days, maybe a week.

409
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:45,091
I gotta see how this place lays out.

410
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:50,052
That gives you plenty
of time to pack up.

411
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:54,272
When I get back, you be gone
from the line-rider's shack.

412
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,148
Mr Penny!

413
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:00,445
Who is the line-rider?

414
00:50:01,656 --> 00:50:04,193
Me. I am.

415
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:13,288
- We'll have to get more tomorrow.
- Already?

416
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,327
You want to be warm,
'specially in the morning.

417
00:50:43,783 --> 00:50:46,535
You goin' somewheres, boy?

418
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:52,621
He ain't as stout as he looks.

419
00:50:56,046 --> 00:50:57,873
Aw, hell!

420
00:51:27,245 --> 00:51:30,246
Just stand right there...

421
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:49,721
- Gimme my knife back.
- Get his boots.

422
00:51:49,894 --> 00:51:54,355
Boots hell, Papa. We're
gonna get everything here.

423
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:57,193
Come on down!

424
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:19,456
Papa!

425
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:24,387
He ain't dead yet. Ain't
we gonna get to kill him?

426
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:40,649
Oh... that's bad.

427
00:52:40,863 --> 00:52:48,077
That is bleedin' real bad.
We don't want that to happen.

428
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:53,872
I knew a fella once, his
wagon team got away with him,

429
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,838
run a wheel spoke through his middle.

430
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,544
Bled himself out, right there.

431
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,837
Don't you know how easy it was?

432
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:09,641
It was like takin' a little sleep
under a shady tree. Didn't hurt at all.

433
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:15,101
He just got kinda drowsy and...

434
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,944
just dozed off. Well...

435
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:22,987
sir, it ain't gonna
be that easy for you.

436
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,325
No, sir. Not that easy.

437
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,207
Remember me?

438
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:50,637
- Dead?
- No, he ain't dead. Leave him.

439
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:52,556
Leave him?

440
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:55,815
Leave him be. Out here by himself...

441
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:59,644
no goods...

442
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:05,863
winter comin' on. He's
gonna be a long while a-dyin'.

443
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:10,782
And all that time, he's
gonna know who done it to him.

444
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:15,667
Yes, sir. Mighty long time.

445
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:18,590
And then, he'll be dead.

446
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:33,394
Ashes to ashes,

447
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,772
dust to dust.

448
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:40,901
The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away.

449
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:44,074
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

450
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:50,157
Come on!

451
00:56:39,031 --> 00:56:41,106
- Ma.
- Yes?

452
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:47,370
- Is he gonna die?
- Well, I hope not.

453
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:51,239
HG! Go and get some water!

454
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,513
HG!

455
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:17,605
Yes, Horace?

456
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:23,946
I thought we didn't like him.

457
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,194
We don't.

458
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,992
I just couldn't let him
stay sick. It wouldn't be...

459
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,799
It wouldn't be Christian, would it?

460
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:41,670
Like the good Samaritan.

461
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:49,511
That's right.

462
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,891
I think you should eat
something. It's been three days.

463
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:32,020
That long?

464
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:39,479
Here.

465
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,367
Good...

466
00:58:43,536 --> 00:58:46,951
Thanks, I... I owe you thanks.

467
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,580
Let's be clearer. We are not friends.

468
00:58:52,377 --> 00:58:56,245
You can stay until you're
better, but when you are,

469
00:58:56,423 --> 00:58:58,712
you will, of course, leave.

470
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:09,515
Poor old cow's freezing out there.

471
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,181
You awake, mister?

472
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,649
Not really sure.

473
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:25,493
Was it the Indians? The wild Indians?

474
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:28,825
How many were there?

475
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:34,207
Hundred, maybe two hundred.

476
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:38,834
A hundred? You're telling a fib.

477
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:44,170
That's right, Button. Just a windy.

478
00:59:46,226 --> 00:59:51,054
HG, I think Mr Penny would
like to get some rest now.

479
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:08,453
Mr Penny!

480
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:15,998
Before long it'll burn so fast, I won't
be able to chop enough even two-handed!

481
01:00:16,174 --> 01:00:18,249
We worked to make you better.

482
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:21,967
You could hurt yourself
doing something unnecessary.

483
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:25,887
Unnecessary! I don't
wanna scare nobody,

484
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:29,558
but it's gonna be hell here
before winter's through.

485
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:35,233
Working eight days a week, we
won't be able to get ready for it.

486
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:37,809
Most of this wood's so damn green.

487
01:00:37,987 --> 01:00:42,282
What are we gonna do?
Winter's just hardly started.

488
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:46,444
Burn chips, I guess.

489
01:00:46,622 --> 01:00:49,159
What's chips?

490
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:55,918
Cow chips, buffalo chips. They make
a hot fire, burn slow. You know.

491
01:00:58,385 --> 01:01:00,876
No, I don't know. What's chips?

492
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:04,258
Well, chips are...

493
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:07,636
Well, they're...

494
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,887
They're just dried up...

495
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:13,940
Yeah?

496
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:19,655
Aw, hell.

497
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:24,035
I'll get the button and
go find some. Horace!

498
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:31,493
Is it true what Ma says,
you'll chase us away?

499
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:35,501
Look, Button, there's more
to it than just sittin' there.

500
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:38,508
Sit up straight, hang
on with your legs.

501
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:44,547
If they find out about you and
your ma down at the Flatiron...

502
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:47,642
If you told 'em, would
there be shootin'?

503
01:01:47,811 --> 01:01:51,560
- Might be.
- Maybe you oughta tell 'em.

504
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:55,314
- You want to see some shootin'?
- Never seen any.

505
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:57,774
I don't think you'd like it much.

506
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:00,901
How many people have you shot?

507
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:05,452
Don't think that's anything to
brag on to a nice boy like you.

508
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:08,493
Come on, sit down and rest a spell.

509
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,248
I ain't so nice. You can tell me.

510
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:17,373
Well, I guess there was a few times.

511
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,551
- How did it feel?
- Bad.

512
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,553
Bad scared before, bad sorry after.

513
01:02:24,725 --> 01:02:26,883
Ever shoot a red Indian?

514
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,896
Yeah, once. Didn't
like that much neither.

515
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:33,682
How come Indians are
all red and sunburned?

516
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:36,896
That ain't sunburn.
They come that way.

517
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:40,405
- Indians don't get sunburn much.
- How come?

518
01:02:40,575 --> 01:02:46,909
They're smart. You've seen them
sunflowers that grow in the spring?

519
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:49,370
- Yeah.
- Indians take the seeds,

520
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:55,746
grind them up into a butter and spread
it over themselves to keep the sun out.

521
01:02:55,923 --> 01:02:58,462
- Aw, no!
- Straight up truth.

522
01:02:59,428 --> 01:03:04,338
- They make do with what nature gives.
- How do you know all this?

523
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:08,099
Even a blind hog roots
up an acorn now and then.

524
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:12,517
Will you keep telling me
all these things you know?

525
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:15,692
Why, sure, Button.

526
01:03:15,861 --> 01:03:19,562
I'll have you a regular scout
in no time at all. Come on.

527
01:03:20,991 --> 01:03:23,115
Come on, boy.

528
01:03:26,914 --> 01:03:32,870
"Here comes the band. Shall we
call Mama and Sandy to see it?

529
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:39,381
"Let us stand still and hear
the men play as they pass.

530
01:03:39,553 --> 01:03:43,930
"I hope they will stop
here and play for us.

531
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,603
"See the large man in front
of the band, with his big hat.

532
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:54,232
"What has he in his hand?"

533
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:06,153
Cold on the outside
and warm on the inside.

534
01:04:07,874 --> 01:04:10,283
That's the way I hope it works.

535
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:12,999
I'm almost finished, Ma.

536
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:17,549
Why not finish tomorrow? And
then tell me what you've read.

537
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:21,337
How much has gone
from here... to here...

538
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:25,381
Right now, jump into bed.

539
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,809
- Aw, Ma!
- Hurry up.

540
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:36,643
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

541
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:40,107
- Night, Will.
- Goodnight, Button.

542
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:52,086
He reads real good.

543
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:59,425
That oughta do her.
When the snow comes hard,

544
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,631
she'll seal up even tighter.

545
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:06,057
You seem well recovered, Mr Penny.

546
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,311
Feelin' real good now.

547
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,603
I'm glad.

548
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:19,190
- Mr Penny... It's time for a bath.
- Bath!

549
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:23,276
Yes, Mr Penny.

550
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:31,833
- A bath.
- What for? I took a bath.

551
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:36,499
- When?
- Well, back there in Alfred.

552
01:05:36,675 --> 01:05:39,795
At that hotel. It was real hot, too.

553
01:05:42,013 --> 01:05:45,133
That seems like a long time ago.

554
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:51,189
It's about time for another.

555
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:54,351
So soon?

556
01:05:54,528 --> 01:05:58,988
- Mr Penny. How often do you bathe?
- What? What?

557
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,242
I said, how often do you bathe?

558
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:06,705
Eight or nine times, it... depends.

559
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:10,701
- On what?
- On the weather.

560
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:14,082
Eight or nine times a month?

561
01:06:14,257 --> 01:06:19,334
Eight or nine times a month? A year!

562
01:06:21,138 --> 01:06:23,297
- A year?
- Well, sure.

563
01:06:23,474 --> 01:06:28,303
You have a real good one when
you finish the shove up north,

564
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,058
like at the hotel in Alfred,
then one or two in the winter.

565
01:06:33,235 --> 01:06:37,695
Hope you don't catch your death.
And a couple in the spring.

566
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:42,906
And one more good one before
you start the shove up again.

567
01:06:43,078 --> 01:06:48,499
The rest depends on what kind
of water you hit on the drive.

568
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:54,421
What's wrong with that?
That's as much as anybody.

569
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,163
Not quite anybody, Mr Penny.

570
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:03,341
Now, I think that'll do.

571
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:10,145
That's hot.

572
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:20,279
Those clothes could use a
wash. May I have them, please?

573
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,570
What am I gonna wear
till they're dry?

574
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:26,866
I have some of my husband's.

575
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:32,247
You could give them to me in here.

576
01:07:56,321 --> 01:08:00,782
What are you fixin' to do in Oregon?

577
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:04,320
Farm. We're farmers, Mr Penny.

578
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:10,242
I hear that's mighty
good cow country.

579
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,504
We're not cowboys, we're farmers.

580
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,753
Good thing, too, I reckon.

581
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,051
What's that supposed to mean?

582
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:30,514
Them horses you got, neither one's
good for much except ridin' to church.

583
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,277
Jim is a perfectly good
horse, and so is Daisy.

584
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:41,909
Neither one has kicked or
bucked since the day we got them.

585
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,746
I surely believe that.

586
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:59,801
Plain truth is, I'm gonna have hell
if I don't get a decent cow horse.

587
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:03,257
- Well, get one.
- Where?

588
01:09:03,434 --> 01:09:08,511
At Flatiron, Alex'll ask what
happened to the string he gave me.

589
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:11,441
Well, tell him! It wasn't your fault.

590
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:14,610
I know that, Mrs Allen.

591
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:17,352
Well, then?

592
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:22,953
He's gonna have every hand in the
place out lookin' for them rawhiders.

593
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:25,529
I hope they do, Mr Penny.

594
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:30,119
You hope they do? Well,
ma'am, you don't know nothin'.

595
01:09:30,294 --> 01:09:35,419
First thing, they'll be here
lookin' for them horses. Then what?

596
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:38,633
Oh, I see.

597
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:50,224
Does that mean that you won't
tell them about Horace and me?

598
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:55,361
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em.

599
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:59,155
What?

600
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:03,738
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em!

601
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:54,750
It's plain you'll be staying.

602
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:56,313
Cold weather like
this, I miss it some.

603
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:07,490
You come all the way from Ohio alone?

604
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,625
Yes...

605
01:12:09,794 --> 01:12:14,208
No. With HG and... Mr Bodine.

606
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:18,877
From St Louis with him.

607
01:12:19,054 --> 01:12:21,177
You're... going on?

608
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:26,633
In the spring.

609
01:12:30,107 --> 01:12:32,396
Alone.

610
01:12:33,737 --> 01:12:36,988
Unless I find someone
to show us the way,

611
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:40,407
a guide or a...

612
01:12:40,577 --> 01:12:42,736
wagon train.

613
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:47,076
Might be your husband'll
come back lookin' for you.

614
01:12:48,627 --> 01:12:51,545
No, he won't do that.

615
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:56,968
If I was him, that's what I'd do.

616
01:12:57,136 --> 01:13:00,339
Well, you see, you're not.

617
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:09,226
I hope he doesn't. He went
ahead to start things for us,

618
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:13,444
and if he came back
for us, it would just...

619
01:13:15,822 --> 01:13:19,654
be a waste. I mean,
it would all be a waste.

620
01:13:19,826 --> 01:13:22,400
It wouldn't be very practical.

621
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:26,786
I don't know about that.

622
01:13:28,836 --> 01:13:31,790
But this is hard
country. Double hard.

623
01:13:33,883 --> 01:13:36,172
I hate it.

624
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:44,139
You couldn't turn
around, go on back home?

625
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:48,688
No, I don't think
I'd like that either.

626
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:58,446
Looks like you're caught
between the sap and the bark.

627
01:13:59,577 --> 01:14:04,120
Was it such a bad place, that town?

628
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:14,207
We don't all have the same choices. We
just don't all have the same choices.

629
01:14:18,597 --> 01:14:21,135
We did what we thought was right.

630
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:33,724
- Seems a long way to go for wood.
- Yep, reckon it is.

631
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:37,991
Looks about right.

632
01:14:53,299 --> 01:14:59,219
Here, Button, you cut it.
Right there where I marked it.

633
01:15:05,228 --> 01:15:07,766
Is it really almost Christmas?

634
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:12,149
- Pretty near.
- It's beautiful.

635
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,902
I chopped it down, all
by myself. Didn't I, Will?

636
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,315
He did it all.

637
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:21,612
Tonight, I'll make some
things to hang on it.

638
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,539
- Ma?
- Yes.

639
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,830
Next Christmas, will we be home?

640
01:15:32,632 --> 01:15:37,260
Yes, Horace. Next
Christmas, we'll be home.

641
01:15:49,233 --> 01:15:54,393
Sure glad no one's seen me do
that. Be laughed off the place.

642
01:15:54,572 --> 01:15:56,813
What? Milking?

643
01:15:56,991 --> 01:16:01,119
No self-respectin' cow-hand
would be caught milkin' a cow.

644
01:16:01,287 --> 01:16:06,708
- I won't tell anyone.
- I sure won't go braggin' on it none.

645
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,334
O Tannenbaum O Tannenbaum

646
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:19,048
Wie treu sind deine Blätter

647
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:25,475
O Tannenbaum O Tannenbaum

648
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:31,435
Wie treu sind deine Blätter

649
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:37,281
Du grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit

650
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:42,408
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit

651
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:48,037
O Tannenbaum O Tannenbaum

652
01:16:48,211 --> 01:16:53,835
Wie treu sind deine Blätter

653
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:58,172
You remembered! All the
words Grandpa taught you.

654
01:16:58,346 --> 01:17:01,467
Very nice. Let's all
sing it, in English.

655
01:17:01,642 --> 01:17:07,266
Oh Christmas tree
Oh Christmas tree...

656
01:17:11,152 --> 01:17:16,147
- I don't know them words.
- But everybody knows that one.

657
01:17:16,324 --> 01:17:21,366
- Not me.
- Don't you know any Christmas carols?

658
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:24,160
I guess not.

659
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:28,875
We'll teach him one, that'll
be our Christmas present.

660
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:37,796
Only, that'll be for tomorrow.
It's time to go to bed. Goodnight.

661
01:17:40,348 --> 01:17:42,507
Night, Will.

662
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:57,782
- Goodnight, Button.
- Goodnight.

663
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:09,369
Is it really almost Christmas?

664
01:18:09,547 --> 01:18:12,880
- Yes, Horace.
- Is it, Will?

665
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,419
- Sure enough, boy.
- Night.

666
01:18:21,058 --> 01:18:26,267
We can never repay you.
You've done so much to help us.

667
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:29,523
Ain't nobody keepin' books on it.

668
01:18:34,906 --> 01:18:40,826
- Looks like you're due a
singing lesson. - Looks like.

669
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:47,534
- Is that so funny?
- You won't think so when you hear me.

670
01:18:47,711 --> 01:18:51,661
You'll be fine with HG as
a teacher. He likes you.

671
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,510
Goes both ways.

672
01:18:54,677 --> 01:18:59,588
He's picked himself
a mean chore, though.

673
01:18:59,765 --> 01:19:02,766
Let me do that for you.

674
01:19:04,687 --> 01:19:08,685
- The sooner we start, the better.
- What?

675
01:19:08,858 --> 01:19:11,729
I'll sing a line and you follow.

676
01:19:13,905 --> 01:19:17,654
Deck the halls with
boughs of holly...

677
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:23,290
Oh, come on! For HG.

678
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:30,625
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

679
01:19:30,798 --> 01:19:35,259
Very good! Fa la la
la la, la la la la...

680
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,215
Fa la la...

681
01:19:42,185 --> 01:19:46,930
- It's plumb silly!
- Let's do the two of them together.

682
01:19:47,106 --> 01:19:54,320
Deck the halls with boughs of
holly Fa la la la la, la la la la...

683
01:19:54,490 --> 01:20:01,108
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...

684
01:20:24,146 --> 01:20:27,515
Maybe you was right
at the start of it.

685
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:31,024
Be better if I'd bed
down somewheres else.

686
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:38,576
- I think that you misjudge.
- No, I was talking about me.

687
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:42,362
So am I. I think you
misjudge yourself.

688
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:46,787
No. I ain't no better
than the rest of 'em.

689
01:20:47,962 --> 01:20:53,585
You don't know what it's like out
here, one woman for every 20, 30 men,

690
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:58,007
and she ain't likely to be
much for looks or temper.

691
01:20:58,182 --> 01:21:01,846
Someone like you... you don't know.

692
01:21:06,982 --> 01:21:09,438
Lookin' the way you do,

693
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:12,280
just...

694
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:17,155
goin' about your business, not
talkin' all the time like some...

695
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:23,364
That smile, in your voice,
when you got somethin' to say.

696
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:26,744
No, please... No.

697
01:21:33,718 --> 01:21:38,676
You do know that, do you? You know.

698
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:45,846
I suppose I do.

699
01:21:46,023 --> 01:21:50,732
I tell you I've had... some
kind of hell these last weeks.

700
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:54,437
Pure hell.

701
01:21:55,449 --> 01:21:57,525
I'm sorry.

702
01:21:57,702 --> 01:22:02,031
No. No need for you to be.

703
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:18,254
I've been alone since
I was a button like him.

704
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:21,349
No family to speak of, just...

705
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:26,595
helpin' in saloons, livin' with
this one, that one, free and easy...

706
01:22:26,774 --> 01:22:30,986
I never wanted it no other
way, never knew no other way...

707
01:22:31,153 --> 01:22:33,858
thought that's how
it's supposed to be.

708
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:40,410
Now, here you are... You and him...

709
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,586
You ain't even mine!

710
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:54,427
You got a way of makin' a
man feel like he's a man.

711
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:04,849
Reckon it's just a case of too
soon old and too late smart.

712
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:26,247
Stay, Will!

713
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:33,626
Merry Christmas!

714
01:24:10,507 --> 01:24:13,710
So. After all that time,
you still ain't dead.

715
01:24:13,885 --> 01:24:18,595
That's good. You got yourself
fixed up real nice around here.

716
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,806
Yes, sir. Real nice.

717
01:24:20,976 --> 01:24:22,352
Ma!

718
01:24:23,813 --> 01:24:26,648
Boy! Come on!

719
01:24:29,777 --> 01:24:34,653
- Boy, tell me. Is this your pa?
- No!

720
01:24:34,824 --> 01:24:38,240
- Your husband? Is he your husband?
- No... Yes!

721
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:41,911
Rejoiceth not in iniquity,
but rejoiceth in the truth.

722
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:44,917
Ask quick and the
lies come out second.

723
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:47,790
- What you gonna do?
- What we gonna do?

724
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:52,043
We gonna stay here and we
gonna rest from our labours.

725
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:58,470
But no work, see. No work because this
strong man is gonna do it all for us.

726
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:01,179
A hired hand, all our own.

727
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:06,477
Never figured on that, did
you? Our own hired hand.

728
01:25:06,649 --> 01:25:09,853
- Wait, please!
- Now, woman, look!

729
01:25:10,028 --> 01:25:14,489
Which one of my tall sons
are you gonna take up with?

730
01:25:14,658 --> 01:25:19,283
It's a hard choice, I agree.
Both fine, upstanding young men,

731
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:24,033
- righteous in the eyes of the Lord.
- Amen!

732
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:29,370
So which one? He ain't your
husband and you took up with him.

733
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:31,506
She never took up with me.

734
01:25:32,718 --> 01:25:37,760
So, you can take up with one
of my boys. Make a choice.

735
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,008
I can't... I...

736
01:25:42,646 --> 01:25:44,388
Yeah?

737
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,485
- I need time. It's a hard choice.
- Of course it's hard.

738
01:25:50,653 --> 01:25:54,948
I'll give you two days. That's
fair. Now all their fine points:

739
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:59,744
Rafe is smarter but he's meaner.
Ruf's stronger but he's dumber.

740
01:26:00,122 --> 01:26:04,618
If the Lord had put them
together, they'd be a perfect man!

741
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:07,165
Take your pick.

742
01:26:07,337 --> 01:26:12,130
Come out before you make trouble!
Get back with the woman and the boy.

743
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:14,874
- Wait!
- Come on, boy!

744
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:19,798
Now then, you! Wake him up.

745
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:23,392
You! We're gonna keep you here,

746
01:26:23,563 --> 01:26:26,932
and we're just gonna keep
workin' your butt off.

747
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:31,984
And if you misbehave, I'm
gonna let Rafe there skin you.

748
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:36,608
And I mean skin, sonny.

749
01:26:36,785 --> 01:26:42,159
He skinned a fella once down in
Texas. A mighty fine job, too.

750
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:07,475
What the hell?

751
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:09,940
Go back to sleep.

752
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:15,613
Are you all right?

753
01:29:18,829 --> 01:29:20,905
Yes.

754
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:26,455
I don't know. Some way, I
gotta get back to Flatiron.

755
01:29:31,843 --> 01:29:34,963
- They'll kill you.
- I got a plan.

756
01:29:35,138 --> 01:29:40,133
Ain't gonna be no party,
you'd have to deal with 'em.

757
01:29:44,691 --> 01:29:50,445
Will... You know what
they want from me tomorrow.

758
01:29:51,655 --> 01:29:54,573
I'll do anything. Anything.

759
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:06,083
Not now! I have to make supper.

760
01:30:06,254 --> 01:30:09,041
- When?
- In the morning, in there.

761
01:30:09,216 --> 01:30:13,463
In the morning, in
there? Just you and me?

762
01:30:13,637 --> 01:30:15,677
Just you and me.

763
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:22,135
- When? - Everybody will be busy
in the morning.

764
01:30:22,313 --> 01:30:26,014
In the morning? Where?

765
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:33,698
The lean-to. In the morning.

766
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:38,029
In the morning, in the
lean-to. I'm gonna be there.

767
01:31:14,408 --> 01:31:17,613
I can dance any one o'
ya down to your knees.

768
01:31:17,788 --> 01:31:20,326
If you don't believe me, gimme a try.

769
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:51,185
Hey, boy, get your mouth off her!

770
01:33:42,689 --> 01:33:45,311
Did you forget what you told me?

771
01:33:45,484 --> 01:33:48,022
- What...?
- What's the matter?

772
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:52,358
- Who asked you to come in here?
- You wanna know?

773
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:55,023
She did. That's who.

774
01:33:55,201 --> 01:34:00,362
You're lyin'. She didn't say that
to you, she told me to come here.

775
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:06,746
I asked both of you. I wanted to
see who would be the better man.

776
01:34:08,382 --> 01:34:10,625
And she made her decision, see?

777
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:14,466
You've been telling me a lie, girl.

778
01:35:10,531 --> 01:35:13,069
There's a woman and
a boy in the cabin.

779
01:35:13,242 --> 01:35:16,445
Trouble runs to you
like a calf to its mama.

780
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,328
Blue! What the...

781
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:24,711
You sure forget your
friends in a hurry.

782
01:35:24,879 --> 01:35:30,466
Thought you were from the Flatiron.
So glad to see you, I never looked.

783
01:35:37,059 --> 01:35:40,558
Lord was smilin' down
when he put you here.

784
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:43,849
- Lord nothin', we come lookin'
for you. - We?

785
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:57,245
- Dutchy!
- Ja. It's me, all right.

786
01:35:57,413 --> 01:36:01,458
- Doctor in Alfred said
we saved his life. - How?

787
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:06,288
Leavin' him in the wagon. It was
so cold, his blood wouldn't run.

788
01:36:06,464 --> 01:36:09,715
If we'd kept him warm,
he'd have bled right out.

789
01:36:09,885 --> 01:36:12,376
What the hell happened over there?

790
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:16,138
I need some help. Bad.

791
01:36:34,786 --> 01:36:39,413
How'd you like to get us down in
this wagon? Close to the shack.

792
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,706
Real close.

793
01:36:45,589 --> 01:36:47,629
Load the gun!

794
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,174
HG!

795
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:15,762
Get away from there! Get away!

796
01:38:33,577 --> 01:38:35,285
Will!

797
01:39:09,364 --> 01:39:13,861
- Gonna tell me about this, Penny?
- How come you fellas are here?

798
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:17,366
Your compadres come lookin' for you.

799
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:21,204
I figured you might
be planning something.

800
01:39:21,376 --> 01:39:28,340
Then one of the Lazy Bar Seven hands
said we had cattle scattered all over.

801
01:39:28,509 --> 01:39:32,127
We wondered if anybody was
takin' care of this camp.

802
01:39:32,304 --> 01:39:37,975
- I can see now why we didn't.
- You got it wrong, Alex.

803
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:40,551
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

804
01:39:42,357 --> 01:39:45,228
Them rawhiders damn near killed me.

805
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:49,150
Would have done, if it
hadn't been for that lady.

806
01:39:49,322 --> 01:39:51,197
And them?

807
01:39:51,367 --> 01:39:57,487
We come to take him back to that man
Catron, he owes us 50 dollars each.

808
01:39:57,664 --> 01:39:59,953
And them two?

809
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:04,788
Hell, I couldn't turn'em
out to winter up here alone.

810
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:07,669
That must have been some comfort.

811
01:40:07,842 --> 01:40:12,801
There's no call for that. What
would you have done in my place?

812
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:15,463
Took 'em back down to headquarters.

813
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:21,224
We'd have found work for'em till
spring, or till the wagon train comes.

814
01:40:21,398 --> 01:40:23,639
Maybe you thought of that, too.

815
01:40:24,734 --> 01:40:26,478
Reckon I did.

816
01:40:28,071 --> 01:40:31,072
We'll do that right now, then.

817
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:53,798
What happened?

818
01:40:54,015 --> 01:40:59,092
Alex has got his back
arched up. Can't blame him.

819
01:41:02,107 --> 01:41:04,183
He's sending you down below.

820
01:41:06,237 --> 01:41:09,321
You coming with us?

821
01:41:10,074 --> 01:41:14,700
You want us to go down and wait,
while you work the winter up here?

822
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,958
I ain't stayin' here.

823
01:41:25,048 --> 01:41:27,965
Will we go with you?

824
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,717
Cath...

825
01:41:33,473 --> 01:41:36,593
Shoot, you're still married!

826
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:43,900
- Pardon?
- You got a husband.

827
01:41:47,488 --> 01:41:50,607
I've never been married, really.

828
01:41:50,782 --> 01:41:56,536
He'd never notice if we never
showed up. Except for the work.

829
01:41:56,705 --> 01:42:01,912
You've been more of a father
to Horace than Reuben ever was.

830
01:42:09,511 --> 01:42:12,512
That's not it, though, is it, Will?

831
01:42:15,558 --> 01:42:18,050
Will. What is it?

832
01:42:19,522 --> 01:42:22,558
It's come on so...

833
01:42:22,733 --> 01:42:24,939
so quick, like.

834
01:42:28,364 --> 01:42:30,273
Will...

835
01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:36,029
Before I married Reuben, I had
two years to think about it.

836
01:42:36,205 --> 01:42:42,743
All that time never helped a bit. Now,
I've got a few minutes and I'm sure.

837
01:42:44,714 --> 01:42:47,003
I'm absolutely sure.

838
01:42:48,801 --> 01:42:51,921
I'm damn near 50 years old!

839
01:42:55,141 --> 01:42:56,802
Yes.

840
01:42:59,938 --> 01:43:02,264
What could we do?

841
01:43:04,026 --> 01:43:08,937
There are lots of homesteads,
all over this land.

842
01:43:09,114 --> 01:43:11,985
Will... Before...

843
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:16,205
when we talked, what
did you think we'd do?

844
01:43:19,709 --> 01:43:22,461
I don't know. I...

845
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:27,043
I never really come face
to face with it, I guess.

846
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:33,931
Will. Do you love me?

847
01:43:34,099 --> 01:43:36,970
What do I know about love?

848
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:42,850
Love? I guess you could
call it that... And more.

849
01:43:43,025 --> 01:43:46,726
I never felt like this about nobody.

850
01:43:46,904 --> 01:43:52,694
I want you, and the
button, for my own, but...

851
01:43:55,246 --> 01:43:57,239
But?

852
01:43:57,415 --> 01:44:02,291
It takes a heap of time,
years, to build up a spread.

853
01:44:02,462 --> 01:44:05,214
I don't have them years no more.

854
01:44:05,382 --> 01:44:10,377
Homestead! We'd just be startin'
up with a few measly cows.

855
01:44:10,554 --> 01:44:15,181
Come January, I'd be trying to
feed you, the button, the cattle...

856
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:20,642
- We don't have to ranch! We can farm.
- I don't know nothin' about farmin'.

857
01:44:20,815 --> 01:44:22,439
I do.

858
01:44:22,608 --> 01:44:28,113
Cath, I'm a cow-hand. Been
a cow-hand all my life.

859
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:32,575
- Scared?
- Damn right. Bad scared.

860
01:44:32,744 --> 01:44:39,364
I told you before, I lived
one way my whole life.

861
01:44:39,542 --> 01:44:43,161
What would I do?

862
01:44:43,339 --> 01:44:50,172
Try to feed you and the boy, on some
measly six-cow ranch? What would I do?

863
01:44:52,974 --> 01:44:55,050
Love us?

864
01:44:56,476 --> 01:44:58,684
Hell...

865
01:44:58,855 --> 01:45:02,305
You don't know how bad
it can be, ranchin'.

866
01:45:03,443 --> 01:45:09,398
Say I got a frostbit
foot, or broke my hand?

867
01:45:09,574 --> 01:45:14,320
Then we're starvin'. How's
love gonna stand up to that?

868
01:45:17,249 --> 01:45:19,455
It's supposed to, isn't it?

869
01:45:24,047 --> 01:45:26,124
Yeah.

870
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,715
Come closer with
you than I ever will,

871
01:45:29,887 --> 01:45:32,971
with anybody.

872
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:37,139
I seen what it was meant to be like.

873
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:41,805
But... it's too late, Cath.

874
01:45:43,693 --> 01:45:45,900
Too late for me.

875
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:54,988
I ain't a good gamble for you.

876
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:07,629
I wish luck to you,
though. I surely do that.

877
01:46:13,808 --> 01:46:16,264
I love that boy.

878
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:44,205
- Pick us up them 50 dollars?
- You bet.

879
01:46:44,382 --> 01:46:46,540
I'm quittin', Alex.

880
01:46:46,717 --> 01:46:49,090
I couldn't work here no more.

881
01:46:49,262 --> 01:46:56,059
Any money I got comin' for my time,
give it to Mrs Allen and the boy.

882
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:14,697
Is he ever comin' back, Ma?

883
01:47:14,871 --> 01:47:16,912
Is he?

884
01:47:26,049 --> 01:47:29,169
Say goodbye, Horace.

885
01:47:30,263 --> 01:47:32,303
Wave goodbye.

886
01:47:45,778 --> 01:47:47,155
Bye, Will.

887
01:47:50,409 --> 01:47:52,532
Bye, Will!

888
01:47:54,204 --> 01:47:55,580
Bye.

889
01:47:55,604 --> 01:47:56,604
.
