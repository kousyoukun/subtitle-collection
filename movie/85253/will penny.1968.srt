that elk might be enough to go round.

154
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,992
We'll work it out that way.
Then we all go away friends, ja?

155
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,754
There's more of us. But we'll make do.

156
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,836
I don't see no more of you.
Maybe you're saying that to trick us.

157
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,393
Or maybe you're saying that
because you know that elk is ours.

158
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,112
And you're scared because the Lord
don't side with them that lies and steals.

159
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,874
The Lord sides with the righteous.

160
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,077
If you go away,
maybe the Lord will go easy

161
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,471
and forget you tried to rob folk
of what's theirs.

162
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,918
Walk away in peace.

163
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,756
- We leave them the damn elk!
- If they let us.

He strikes down them

- Dutchy, what's wrong?
- I'm shot.

180
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,517
I think maybe I done it to myself.
I couldn't get the gun out of my pocket.

181

Don't you move. We'll get the wagon.

A man's hurt.

- Come in. Maybe I can help.
- No, thank you.

Isn't there a damn doctor close?

About a half day's fast ride up the road.
Town of...Alfred.

190

If you're bad enough to see a doctor,
time you get there it's too late anyway.

- How bad's your friend hurt?
- Bad. He's gut-shot.

He's a dead man for certain.

He'll bleed to hell
before he gets to Alfred.

Hello. Name's Catron. Place is mine.

195
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,838
Got some good whisky inside.

196
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,515
Best to make him rest easy
while he waits for the end.

Anything he drinks, on the house.
Bury him out back.

198

I'll carve him a nice head-marker.
Twenty-five dollars sound about right?

199

You sound almighty sure he's gonna die.

Sure, I'm sure. Best to face these things
so you can make plans.

- Hey, Will...

Maybe he's right, what he said...
that I die before we get there.

No, hell...

...you know, maybe I'll never get there.

Will...I'd like to have a sure drink here.

210

Better than a maybe drink later on.

Yes, sir! Planning means a man
don't get any unhappy surprises.

214
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,278
Take your friend. You know,
and he knows, he's gonna die.

215
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,591
You don't have to fight over his goods.
Take that coat,

216

He's lying there in a wagon.

- Is he alive?
- Sure is.

He's cussing something awful,
some words I never even heard before.

You have to get to a doctor, immediately.

something I can do.

-...hold my hand?
- Of course.

- You're an angel, lady.
- Tell me, how did it happen?

Why, the cowards! That's terrible!

Ja, that's right. Them bummers.

245
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,149
They wait until them lndians
is all finished,

246
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,995
then they come back, and bring me here.

247
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,195
Here you go, Dutchy.

248
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,957
Thanks, Will.

Least I can do
after you killed all them lndians.

250

Are you one of the men, his friends,
who left him to the savages?

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,236
- We surely did.
- You call yourself a man?

You call yourself his friend
and then you do this to him.

If I were you, I'd never speak...
I would never speak to them again.

Ja. Maybe I won't.

255
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,508
I cannot comprehend behaviour
like yours, I simply can't.

256

It's easy to figure, ma'am.
We just ain't as brave as him.

Dutchy's...plumb brave.

258
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,995
Yes. And you leave him
to die in the cold.

259
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,674
At least bring him inside.

260
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,551
That won't help him,
juggling that bullet around in his innards.

261
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,111
Is that going to help him?

262
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,354
It may not put him back on his feet
but it won't put him in his grave either.

to help you?

- I will die?
- It happens to all of us, Dutchy.

269
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,115
No, Will. You know what I mean.

don't make it to... Where's it?

And this ain't a good way for him to go.

there ain't no good way to go.

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,438
Where it says "Post Office".

308
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,433
Whoa, whoa!

309
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,597
Doctor? There's a man hurt out here.

310
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,150
How about it? He's bad shot.

311
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,074
Shot, hell.
He's damn near frozen to death.

312
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,150
He smells like a still.
Did you stop off on the way to celebrate?

313
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,188
Slow and easy. If you move too fast,
they might miss something.

314
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,555
Over there on the couch.

315
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,352
Better go home, John. I'll finish you later.

316
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,158
If I want any help, I'll send for you.
You can go home now.

317
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,510
Mattie! I'll need you.

318
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,679
You must have taken
your own sweet time getting here.

319
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,958
This is my wife, Missus Fraker.

320
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,190
I don't know their names.

321
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,556
If we straighten him out too fast,
he'll break, he's that cold.

322
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,759
Let's warm him up,
and then get his clothes off.

323
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,835
Why don't you boys go to the hotel,
get yourselves a bath?

324
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,434
Come back tomorrow morning.

325
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,789
Children. Dangerous children.

326
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,959
- But it's so early!
- Early, hell. The sun's up.

327
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,873
Oh. The sun's up.

328
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,436
Go along, now. I'll see you again.

329
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,512
Not if I see you first.

330
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,755
Will, are you really that set on going?

331
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,629
I'd not care to winter here.

332
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,712
The way money goes,
I'd be sellin' my saddle.

333
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,110
But ridin' the grub line up here?

334
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,757
There's that Flatiron spread
Bigfoot spoke about.

335
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,152
If that don't work out,
I guess I'll head south. You?

336
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,237
I reckon I'll just hang around a spell.

337
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,951
Maybe get a job bar-doggin'.
See how old Dutchy makes out.

338
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,797
Maybe we'll cut trails some day,
south of here.

339
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,349
Maybe so, Will.

340
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,311
Hey!

341
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,959
Yeah. That's him, all right.

342
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,998
Ain't no way to forget him.
Not while he's alive, anyway.

343
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,948
- We sure as hell can fix that in a hurry.
- Not yet.

344
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,551
Plenty of time.

345
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,959
He ain't going nowhere we can't find him.

346
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,591
And we're just gonna take
our own good time about it.

347
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,994
About carvin' him up.

348
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,918
You make 'im out, Alex?

349
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,317
- Somebody ridin' grub line, I suppose.
- That's a Flatiron horse.

350
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,837
- Ain't that Bright Eyes?
- Yeah, one of old Claude's string.

351
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,073
- Want to talk about this?
- I found him like that.

352
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,236
I guess he came off and wrapped up
the whole ball of wax, right there.

353
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,598
- Old Claude was a good horsebacker.
- Pretty forky.

354
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,991
If you say so. I never had the pleasure.

355
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,795
What brings you up here?

356
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,952
- Are you the stud duck?
- That's right.

357
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,555
I just shoved a bunch from Texas,
put 'em on the train...

358
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,679
-...and went off the payroll.
- You're looking for a meal?

359
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,593
No, I'm looking for a job. One of the
Texas hands said you might be hirin'.

360
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,870
I'll take 'im.

361
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,112
He ain't comin'. I come instead.

362
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,394
- You must need a hand.
- Claude was a good cow-puncher.

363
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,353
- Mighty good man all the way round.
- Well, sure.

364
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,229
- That's always the way.
- What's always the way?

365
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,234
Let a man die,
right away he's good old Claude.

366
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,189
How was he before he bucked out?

367
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,910
You boys, go dig a proper grave.
We'll hold services for him later.

368
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,038
Come on over to the bunkhouse.

369
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,756
This here gentleman
calls himself Will Penny.

370
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,511
He comes ridin' around here as nice
as you please, hopin' to find a nice job.

371
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,435
And there lays old Claude,
just beggin' him:

372
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,832
"Take mine, Mr Penny, take mine!"

373
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,789
Hell, that's the story
you give the big augur.

374
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,592
Now, we're just no-account
cow-punchers together, here.

375
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,718
Ain't no need for you to tell us them lies.

376
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,114
Well, son. You dealt this hand.
I guess you'll just have to play it out.

377
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,192
Hold it! All of you.

378
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,717
This man's on the payroll.
A Flatiron hand, not a stranger.

379
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,758
Any eyeballing done
around here, I'll do it.

380
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,916
- Hell, we're just trying to help 'im.
- Yeah, like a sharp stick in the eye.

381
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,436
Take Claude's job,
line-rider in the ridge country.

382
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,398
Pay's 30 dollars a month.

383
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,235
Are you sure you rode line before?

384
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,790
Sure enough to have
mighty strong feelings about it.

385
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,110
You can tell he's done it before.

386
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,554
We got rules here on the Flatiron.
You hold to 'em and we'll be friends.

387
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,271
Break 'em and you're out before
you can say, "Excuse me, ma'am."

388
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,557
First, we got no drinkin' or gamblin'.

389
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,589
Cut the wolf loose all you want in town,
but not on this layout.

390
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,399
- Is that plain?
- Plain enough.

391
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,997
The pilgrims that come through:
as long as they keep movin', fine.

392
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,119
If they take a beef now and then,
you don't do much either.

393
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,070
But you don't let nobody stop.
That's the most important thing.

394
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,789
Nobody stops on Flatiron range.

395
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,669
- What if they don't move?
- They'll move all right.

396
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,071
Won't nobody say
nothing about it, neither.

397
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,349
One of the boys'll tell you
how to get to the old shack.

398
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,672
Three or four days' ride.
Is there anything else?

399
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,638
No. I reckon you said it all.

400
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,158
About them nesters. If there's
too many to handle, come back for help.

401
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,630
Otherwise, I don't wanna
hear from you till spring.

You may as well come on out.

- Don't come nearer! I'm alone and...
- Ma!

413
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:25,349
The boy's right. Don't ever tell
a stranger out here you're alone.

- He went on ahead.

- My husband paid him in St Louis.

He ain't comin' back,
I can promise you that.

Anybody could see
he had no stomach for it.

Now look at you.

You and the button,
you can't sleep in the wagon.

Well, of course we won't.

- You can't stay here.
- Why?

422
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,555
This is Flatiron range.
The rules say no squatters.

423
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,111
If you won't move on peaceable,
somebody will come and make you.

Are you gonna do that?

It was like takin' a little sleep

Sit up straight, hang on with your legs.

down at the Flatiron...

- Maybe you oughta tell 'em.

to a nice boy like you.

- Bad.

Bad scared before, bad sorry after.

00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,190
Ever shoot a red lndian?

545
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,079
Yeah, once.
Didn't like that much neither.

546
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,710
How come lndians
are all red and sunburned?

547
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,792
That ain't sunburn. They come that way.

548
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,157
- lndians don't get sunburn much.
- How come?

549
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:13,395
They're smart. You've seen them
sunflowers that grow in the spring?

550
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,755
- Yeah.
- lndians take the seeds,

551
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,870
grind them up into a butter and spread it
over themselves to keep the sun out.

552
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,474
- Aw, no!
- Straight up truth.

553
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,110
- They make do with what nature gives.
- How do you know all this?

01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,716
Even a blind hog
roots up an acorn now and then.

555
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,953
Will you keep telling me
all these things you know?

556
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,998
Why, sure, Button.

557

Yes, Mr Penny.

01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,556
- A bath.
- What for? I took a bath.

582
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,032
- When?
- Well, back there in Alfred.

583
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,192
At that hotel. It was real hot, too.

584
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,312
That seems like a long time ago.

585

It's about time for another.

586
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,151
So soon?

587
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,598
- Mr Penny. How often do you bathe?
- What? What?

588
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,718
I said, how often do you bathe?

589
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,998
Eight or nine times, it...depends.

590
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,830
- On what?
- On the weather.

591
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,072
Eight or nine times a month?

592
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,109
Eight or nine times a month? A year!

593
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,910
- A year?
- Well, sure.

594
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:45,710
You have a real good one
when you finish the shove up north,

595
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:50,271
Iike at the hotel in Alfred,
then one or two in the winter.

596
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,718
Hope you don't catch your death.
And a couple in the spring.

597
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,715
And one more good one
before you start the shove up again.

598
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:05,079
The rest depends on
what kind of water you hit on the drive.

599
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:10,758
What's wrong with that?
That's as much as anybody.

600
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,388
Not quite anybody, Mr Penny.

601
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,312
Now, I think that'll do.

602
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,836
That's hot.

603
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:35,556
Those clothes could use a wash.
May I have them, please?

604
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,712
What am I gonna wear till they're dry?

605
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,872
I have some of my husband's.

606
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,032
You could give them to me in here.

607
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,398
What are you fixin' to do in Oregon?

608
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,791
Farm. We're farmers, Mr Penny.

609
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,470
I hear that's mighty good cow country.

610
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,598
We're not cowboys, we're farmers.

611
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,550
Good thing, too, I reckon.

612
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,712
What's that supposed to mean?

613
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,910
Them horses you got, neither one's
good for much except ridin' to church.

614
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,396
Jim is a perfectly good horse,
and so is Daisy.

615
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,838
Neither one has kicked or bucked
since the day we got them.

616
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,560
I surely believe that.

617
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:10,996
Plain truth is, I'm gonna have hell
if I don't get a decent cow horse.

618
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,311
- Well, get one.
- Where?

619
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,349
At Flatiron, Alex'll ask what happened
to the string he gave me.

620
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,159
Well, tell him! It wasn't your fault.

621
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,198
I know that, Missus Allen.

622
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,828
Well, then?

623
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,199
He's gonna have every hand in the place
out lookin' for them rawhiders.

624
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,669
I hope they do, Mr Penny.

625
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,072
You hope they do?
Well, ma'am, you don't know nothin'.

626
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,155
First thing, they'll be here
lookin' for them horses. Then what?

627
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,237
Oh, I see.

628
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:59,352
Does that mean that you won't tell them
about Horace and me?

629
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,279
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em.

630
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,916
What?

631
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,312
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em!

632
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,232
It's plain you'll be staying.

633
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,271
Cold weather like this, I miss it some.

634
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,990
You come all the way from Ohio alone?

635
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,037
Yes...

636
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,432
No. With HG and...Mr Bodine.

637
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,910
From St Louis with him.

638
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,116
You're...going on?

639
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,348
In the spring.

640
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,875
Alone.

641
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,277
Unless I find someone
to show us the way,

642
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,557
a guide or a...

643
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,790
...wagon train.

644
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,953
Might be your husband'll
come back lookin' for you.

645
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,238
No, he won't do that.

646
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,439
If I was him, that's what I'd do.

647
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,672
Well, you see, you're not.

648
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,194
I hope he doesn't.
He went ahead to start things for us,

649
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,239
and if he came back for us,
it would just...

650
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,195
...be a waste.
I mean, it would all be a waste.

651
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,828
It wouldn't be very practical.

652
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,034
I don't know about that.

653
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,833
But this is hard country. Double hard.

654
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,035
I hate it.

655
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,676
You couldn't turn around,
go on back home?

656
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,038
No, I don't think I'd like that either.

657
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:57,396
Looks like you're caught
between the sap and the bark.

658
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,837
Was it such a bad place, that town?

659
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:12,510
We don't all have the same choices.
We just don't all have the same choices.

660
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,154
We did what we thought was right.

661
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:31,228
- Seems a long way to go for wood.
- Yep, reckon it is.

662
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,319
Looks about right.

663
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,677
Here, Button, you cut it.
Right there where I marked it.

664
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,874
Is it really almost Christmas?

665
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,076
- Pretty near.
- It's beautiful.

666
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,676
I chopped it down, all by myself.
Didn't l, Will?

667
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,990
He did it all.

668
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,152
Tonight, I'll make some things
to hang on it.

669
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,836
- Ma?
- Yes.

670
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,992
Next Christmas, will we be home?

671
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,157
Yes, Horace.
Next Christmas, we'll be home.

672
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:48,589
Sure glad no one's seen me do that.
Be laughed off the place.

673
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,910
What? Milking?

674
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,039
No self-respectin' cow-hand
would be caught milkin' a cow.

675
01:12:55,200 --> 01:13:00,399
- I won't tell anyone.
- I sure won't go braggin' on it none.

676
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,752
# O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

677
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,233
# Wie treu sind deine Blätter

678
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,396
# O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

679
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,112
# Wie treu sind deine Blätter

680
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:29,718
# Du grünst nicht nur
Zur Sommerzeit

681
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:34,635
# Nein, auch im Winter,
wenn es schneit

682
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,033
# O Tannenbaum
O Tannenbaum

683
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,593
# Wie treu sind deine Blätter #

684
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,753
You remembered!
All the words Grandpa taught you.

685
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,912
Very nice. Let's all sing it, in English.

686
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,473
# O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree... #

687
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,990
- I don't know them words.
- But everybody knows that one.

688
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,995
- Not me.
- Don't you know any Christmas carols?

689
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,674
I guess not.

690
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,197
We'll teach him one,
that'll be our Christmas present.

691
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:27,752
Only, that'll be for tomorrow.
It's time to go to bed. Goodnight.

692
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,270
Night, Will.

693
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,918
- Goodnight, Button.
- Goodnight.

694
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,029
Is it really almost Christmas?

695
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,397
- Yes, Horace.
- Is it, Will?

696
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,791
- Sure enough, boy.
- Night.

697
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:14,234
We can never repay you.
You've done so much to help us.

698
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,358
Ain't nobody keepin' books on it.

699
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,197
- Looks like you're due a singing lesson.
- Looks like.

700
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,630
- Is that so funny?
- You won't think so when you hear me.

701
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,588
You'll be fine with HG as a teacher.
He likes you.

702
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,320
Goes both ways.

703
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,190
He's picked himself
a mean chore, though.

704
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,238
Let me do that for you.

705
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,914
- The sooner we start, the better.
- What?

706
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,833
I'll sing a line and you follow.

707
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,515
# Deck the halls
with boughs of holly... #

708
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,920
Oh, come on! For HG.

709
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,954
# Deck the halls
With boughs of holly #

710
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,398
Very good!
# Fa la la la la, la la la la...

711
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,111
# Fa la la... #

712
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,591
- It's plumb silly!
- Let's do the two of them together.

713
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:38,677
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la

714
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:45,188
# 'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la #

715
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,511
Maybe you was right at the start of it.

716
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,877
Be better if I'd bed down
somewheres else.

717
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,118
- I think that you misjudge.
- No, I was talking about me.

718
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,750
So am l. I think you misjudge yourself.

719
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,993
No. I ain't no better than the rest of 'em.

720
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:35,513
You don't know what it's like out here,
one woman for every 20, 30 men,

721
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,753
and she ain't likely to be much
for looks or temper.

722
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,435
Someone like you...you don't know.

723
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,715
Lookin' the way you do,

724
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,440
just...

725
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,116
...goin' about your business,
not talkin' all the time like some...

726
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,070
That smile, in your voice,
when you got somethin' to say.

727
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,312
No, please... No.

728
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,755
You do know that, do you?
You know.

729
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,631
I suppose I do.

730
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,316
I tell you I've had...some kind of hell
these last weeks.

731
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,869
Pure hell.

732
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,831
I'm sorry.

733
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,152
No. No need for you to be.

734
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,710
I've been alone
since I was a button like him.

735
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,678
No family to speak of, just...

736
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,709
...helpin' in saloons, livin' with this one,
that one, free and easy...

737
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,919
I never wanted it no other way,
never knew no other way,

738
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,674
thought that's how it's supposed to be.

739
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,957
Now, here you are... You and him...

740
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,880
You ain't even mine!

741
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,399
You got a way of makin' a man
feel like he's a man.

742
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,394
Reckon it's just a case
of too soon old and too late smart.

743
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,915
Stay, Will!

744
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,991
Merry Christmas!

745
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,076
(GUNSHOT)

746
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,432
So. After all that time, you still ain't dead.

747
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,116
That's good. You got yourself
fixed up real nice around here.

748
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,236
Yes, sir. Real nice.

749
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,719
Ma!

750
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,839
Boy! Come on!

751
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,516
- Boy, tell me. Is this your pa?
- No!

752
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:10,956
- Your husband? Is he your husband?
- No... Yes!

753
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,476
Rejoiceth not in iniquity,
but rejoiceth in the truth.

754
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,359
Ask quick and the lies come out second.

755
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,114
- What you gonna do?
- What we gonna do?

756
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:24,193
We gonna stay here
and we gonna rest from our labours.

757
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:30,356
But no work, see. No work because
this strong man is gonna do it all for us.

758
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,954
A hired hand, all our own.

759
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,035
Never figured on that, did you?
Our own hired hand.

760
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,272
- Wait, please!
- Now, woman, look!

761
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,718
Which one of my tall sons
are you gonna take up with?

762
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,317
It's a hard choice, I agree.
Both fine, upstanding young men,

763
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,871
- righteous in the eyes of the Lord.
- Amen!

764
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,989
So which one? He ain't your husband
and you took up with him.

765
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,037
She never took up with me.

766
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:08,035
So, you can take up
with one of my boys. Make a choice.

767
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,191
I can't... I...

768
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,392
Yeah?

769
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:20,239
- I need time. It's a hard choice.
- Of course it's hard.

770
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,518
I'll give you two days. That's fair.
Now all their fine points:

771
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,117
Rafe is smarter but he's meaner.
Ruf's stronger but he's dumber.

772
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,792
If the Lord had put them together,
they'd be a perfect man!

773
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,235
Take your pick.

774
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,996
Come out before you make trouble!
Get back with the woman and the boy.

775
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,628
- Wait!
- Come on, boy!

776
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,349
Now then, you! Wake him up.

777
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,796
You! We're gonna keep you here,

778
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,191
and we're just gonna keep
workin' your butt off.

779
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,036
And if you misbehave,
I'm gonna let Rafe there skin you.

780
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,470
And I mean skin, sonny.

781
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,794
He skinned a fella once down in Texas.
A mighty fine job, too.

782

(SNORlNG)

783
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,151
What the hell?

784
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,515
Go back to sleep.

785
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,956
Are you all right?

786
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,031
Yes.

787
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,353
I don't know. Some way,
I gotta get back to Flatiron.

788
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,512
- They'll kill you.
- I got a plan.

789
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,470
Ain't gonna be no party,
you'd have to deal with 'em.

790
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:10,358
Will... You know what they want
from me tomorrow.

791
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,318
I'll do anything. Anything.

792
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,356
Not now! I have to make supper.

793
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,193
- When?
- In the morning, in there.

794
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:32,433
In the morning, in there?
Just you and me?

795
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,556
Just you and me.

796
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,750
- When?
- Everybody will be busy in the morning.

797
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,469
In the morning? Where?

798
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,838
The lean-to. In the morning.

799
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,993
In the morning, in the lean-to.
I'm gonna be there.

800
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,589
(LlVELY MUSlC)

801
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,952
I can dance any one o' you
down to your knees.

802
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,554
If you don't believe me, gimme a try.

803
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,149
Hey, boy, get your mouth off her!

804
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,594
Did you forget what you told me?

805
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,194
- What...?
- What's the matter?

806
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:02,353
- Who asked you to come in here?
- You wanna know?

807
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,909
She did. That's who.

808
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:10,029
You're lyin'. She didn't say that to you,
she told me to come here.

809
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:16,150
I asked both of you. I wanted to see
who would be the better man.

810
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,870
And she made her decision, see?

811
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,555
You've been telling me a lie, girl.

812
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,469
Haah! Haah!

813
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,876
Rufus, look at that!

814
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,754
There's a woman and a boy in the cabin.

815
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,992
Trouble runs to you
like a calf to its mama.

816
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,798
Blue! What the...

817
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,919
You sure forget your friends in a hurry.

818
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:36,438
Thought you were from the Flatiron.
So glad to see you, I never looked.

819
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,116
Lord was smilin' down
when he put you here.

820
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,272
- Lord nothin', we come lookin' for you.
- We?

821
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,119
- Dutchy!
- Ja. It's me, all right.

822
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,159
- Doctor in Alfred said we saved his life.
- How?

823
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,791
Leavin' him in the wagon.
It was so cold, his blood wouldn't run.

824
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,077
If we'd kept him warm,
he'd have bled right out.

825
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,629
What the hell happened over there?

826
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,237
I need some help. Bad.

827
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,557
How'd you like to get us down
in this wagon? Close to the shack.

828
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,756
Real close.

829
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,436
Load the gun!

830
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,710
Haah! Get up. Haah!

831
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,679
HG!

832
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,956
Get away from there! Get away!

833
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,678
Will!

834
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,672
- Gonna tell me about this, Penny?
- How come you fellas are here?

835
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,034
Your compadres come lookin' for you.

836
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,715
I figured you might be
planning something.

837
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:24,558
Then one of the Lazy Bar Seven hands
said we had cattle scattered all over.

838
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,190
We wondered if anybody
was takin' care of this camp.

839
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:33,798
- I can see now why we didn't.
- You got it wrong, Alex.

840
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,269
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

841
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,753
Them rawhiders damn near killed me.

842
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,515
Would have done,
if it hadn't been for that lady.

843
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,477
And them?

844
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:52,510
We come to take him back to that man
Catron, he owes us 50 dollars each.

845
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,875
And them two?

846
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:59,511
Hell, I couldn't turn 'em out
to winter up here alone.

847
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,274
That must have been some comfort.

848
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,195
There's no call for that.
What would you have done in my place?

849
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,749
Took 'em back down to headquarters.

850
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,273
We'd have found work for 'em till spring,
or till the wagon train comes.

851
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,590
Maybe you thought of that, too.

852
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,312
Reckon I did.

853
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,718
We'll do that right now, then.

854
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,512
What happened?

855
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:51,589
Alex has got his back arched up.
Can't blame him.

856
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,471
He's sending you down below.

857
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,398
You coming with us?

858
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:06,557
You want us to go down and wait,
while you work the winter up here?

859
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,558
I ain't stayin' here.

860
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,278
Will we go with you?

861
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,917
Cath...

862
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,552
Shoot, you're still married!

863
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,559
- Pardon?
- You got a husband.

864
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,992
I've never been married, really.

865
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,678
He'd never notice if we never showed up.
Except for the work.

866
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,834
You've been more of a father to Horace
than Reuben ever was.

867
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,998
That's not it, though, is it, Will?

868
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,309
Will. What is it?

869
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,632
It's come on so...

870
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,916
so quick, like.

871
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,031
Will...

872
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:24,551
Before I married Reuben,
I had two years to think about it.

873
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:30,989
All that time never helped a bit. Now,
I've got a few minutes and I'm sure.

874
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,075
I'm absolutely sure.

875
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,792
I'm damn near 50 years old!

876
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,472
Yes.

877
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,710
What could we do?

878
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:56,110
There are lots of homesteads,
all over this land.

879
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,033
Will... Before...

880
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:03,079
when we talked,
what did you think we'd do?

881
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,079
I don't know. I...

882
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:13,472
I never really come
face to face with it, I guess.

883
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,079
Will. Do you love me?

884
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,993
What do I know about love?

885
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:28,632
Love? I guess you could call it that...
And more.

886
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,349
I never felt like this about nobody.

887
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:38,072
I want you, and the button,
for my own, but...

888
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,431
But?

889
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,276
It takes a heap of time, years,
to build up a spread.

890
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,079
I don't have them years no more.

891
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:55,030
Homestead! We'd just be startin' up
with a few measly cows.

892
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:59,637
Come January, I'd be trying to feed you,
the button, the cattle...

893
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:04,874
- We don't have to ranch! We can farm.
- I don't know nothin' about farmin'.

894
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,598
I do.

895
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:12,039
Cath, I'm a cow-hand.
Been a cow-hand all my life.

896
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,318
- Scared?
- Damn right. Bad scared.

897
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:22,828
I told you before,
I lived one way my whole life.

898
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,470
What would I do?

899
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:33,193
Try to feed you and the boy, on some
measly six-cow ranch? What would I do?

900
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,871
Love us?

901
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,356
Hell...

902
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,830
You don't know
how bad it can be, ranchin'.

903
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:51,631
Say I got a frostbit foot,
or broke my hand?

904
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,351
Then we're starvin'.
How's love gonna stand up to that?

905
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,276
It's supposed to, isn't it?

906
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,671
Yeah.

907
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,116
Come closer with you than I ever will,

908
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,238
with anybody.

909
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,234
I seen what it was meant to be like.

910
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:22,710
But...it's too late, Cath.

911
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,636
Too late for me.

912
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:35,352
I ain't a good gamble for you.

913
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:47,474
I wish luck to you, though.
I surely do that.

914
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,755
I love that boy.

915
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:02,313
Buena suerte.

916
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:22,552
- Pick us up them 50 dollars?
- You bet.

917
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,790
I'm quittin', Alex.

918
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,235
I couldn't work here no more.

919
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:33,919
Any money I got comin' for my time,
give it to Missus Allen and the boy.

920
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,793
Is he ever comin' back, Ma?

921
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,916
Is he?

922
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,672
Say goodbye, Horace.

923
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,676
Wave goodbye.

924
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,919
Bye, Will.

925
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,076
Bye, Will!

926
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:30,999
Bye.

927
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:43,759
# Don't know too much
But one thing I'm sure of

928
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:51,476
# A man ain't nothing
More than a man

929
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,635
# A lonely rider
Playing his time out

930
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:05,558
# The best he can
The best he can

931
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:12,990
# Too many joys
Too swiftly tasted

932
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:19,952
# Play the cards
As they fall

933
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:27,549
# Next thing you know
A man's purpose gets wasted

934
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:35,479
# As the wind blows
That's how the tree grows

935
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:41,438
# No matter where
He chooses to travel

936
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:49,034
# A lonely rider
Wakes every morn

937
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:55,354
# And knows that he must go
Where he's guided

938
01:44:55,520 --> 01:45:01,993
# His fate was decided
On the day he was born #
