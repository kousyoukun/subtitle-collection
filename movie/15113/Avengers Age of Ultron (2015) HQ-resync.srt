00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,494
<i>Report to your stations immediately.</i>

3
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,399
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

4
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,928
<i>We're under attack.</i>
(Let's go! Let's go!)

5
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:34,209
<i>We're under attack.</i>

6
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:35,804
Shit!  Its MrSeeN

7
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,201
Language.

8
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,271
Jarvis what's the view from upstairs?

9
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:42,693
<font color="#f9ca68">The central building is protected by some kind of
energy shield.</font>

10
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,145
<font color="#f9ca68">Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other hydra base we've taken.</font>

11
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,083
Loki's scepter must be here.

12
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,610
Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,675
At long last.

14
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,684
At long last is lasting a little long.
Boys.

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,907
Yeah.

16
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,177
I think we lost the
element of surprise.

17
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:22,510
Wait a second. No one else is going to deal
with the fact that Cap just said...

18
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:23,653
... language.

19
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,042
I know...

20
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,888
Just slipped out.

21
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:37,134
- Hydra Research Base
Sokovia, Eastern Europe -

22
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,002
Who gave the order to attack?

23
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,280
Herr Strucker.
It's the Avengers.

24
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:45,431
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

25
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:47,939
They have to be after the scepter.

26
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,526
Can we hold them?

27
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,923
They're the Avengers.

28
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:52,780
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

29
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,621
Concentrate fire
on the weak ones.

30
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,917
A hit,
can make them close ranks.

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,923
Everything we've accomplished.

32
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,034
We're on the verge of our
greatest breakthrough.

33
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,459
Then lets show them what
we've accomplished.

34
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,615
Send out the twins.

35
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,507
It's too soon.

36
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:12,105
It's what they signed up for.

37
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,281
My men can hold them.

38
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,436
Sir,
the city is taking fire.

39
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:30,406
Well, we know Strucker isn't going to
worry about civilian casualties.

40
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,848
Send in the iron legion.

41
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,015
This quadrant is unsafe.

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,634
Please back away.

43
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,507
We are here to help.

44
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,257
This quadrant is unsafe.

45
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,724
Please back away.

46
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:48,595
Please back away.

47
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,400
We wish to avoid collateral damage.

48
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,479
And will respond with restraint,
unofficious assault.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,201
We are here to help.

50
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,807
We are here to help.

51
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:02,133
We will not yield.

52
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,155
The Americans send their..
circus freaks to test us.

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,767
We will send them back.
In bags.

54
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,002
No Surrender!

55
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:14,462
No surrender!

56
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm, uh... going to surrender.

57
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:20,002
You delete everything.

58
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:24,139
-If we give the avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far into what we've been doing.
  -The twins.

59
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,356
They're not ready to take on ...

60
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:26,761
No, no, I mean...

61
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,545
The twins.

62
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,209
You didn't see that coming?

63
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,062
Clint!

64
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,843
We have an enhanced in the field.

65
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,097
Clint's hit!

66
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,366
Somebody wants to deal with that bunker.

67
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,017
Thank you.

68
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:29,922
Stark.

69
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,705
We really need to get inside.

70
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,396
I'm closing in.

71
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,395
Jarvis,
am I...

72
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:38,908
... closing in?

73
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:40,947
You see a power source for that shield?

74
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,533
There's a passageway above the north tower.

75
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,288
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

76
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,614
Drawbridge is down people.

77
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,830
The enhanced?

78
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,277
He's a blur.

79
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,740
All the new players we've faced.
I've never seen this.

80
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,185
In fact... I still haven't.

81
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,812
Clint's hit pretty bad guys.
We're going to need evac.

82
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:11,764
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone the better.

83
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,359
You and Stark secure the scepter.

84
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:14,629
Copy that.

85
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,355
Target lining up.

86
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,871
Well, they're excited.

87
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,368
Find the scepter.

88
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,915
And for gosh sake.
Watch your language.

89
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,177
That's not going away any time soon.

90
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,446
Guys, stop.
We got to talk this through.

91
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,483
It's a good talk.

92
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,182
Oh.

93
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,418
Aww...!

94
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:52,421
Sentry mode.

95
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:55,756
Okay.
Jarvis.

96
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,493
You know.
I want it all.

97
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,812
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

98
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,224
We're locked down out here.

99
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,137
Then get to Banner.
Time for a lullaby.

100
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,153
I know you're hiding more than files.

101
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,977
Hey J.
Give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.

102
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,604
<font color="#f9ca68">The wall to your left.</font>

103
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,897
<font color="#f9ca68">I'm reading steel reinforcement.</font>

104
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,437
<font color="#f9ca68">And an air current.</font>

105
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,397
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door. Please be a secret door...

106
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:28,912
Yay!

107
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:45,891
Hey,
big guy.

108
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,097
Sun's getting real low.

109
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,018
Baron Strucker.

110
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:58,336
Hydra's number one thug.

111
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:01,715
Technically, I'm a thug...
for Shield.

112
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,939
Well, then technically,
you're unemployed.

113
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,931
Where’s Loki's scepter?

114
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,818
Don't worry.
I know when I'm beat.

115
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:11,477
You'll mention how I cooperated.
I hope.

116
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:14,647
I'll put it right under
illegal human experimentation.

117
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,772
How many are there?

118
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,096
We have a second enhanced.

119
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,264
Female.
Do not engage.

120
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,033
You'll have to be faster than...

121
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,177
Aww...

122
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,478
Guys, I got Strucker.

123
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,963
Yeah,
I got...

124
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,959
...something bigger.

125
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,719
Thor.

126
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,329
I got eyes on the prize.

127
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:58,931
You could've... saved... us....

128
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:08,798
Why didn't...
you do more?

129
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,089
You're just going to let them take it?

130
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,867
Hey,
the lullaby worked better than ever.

131
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,455
Just wasn't expecting the code green.

132
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,502
If you hadn't been there
There would've been double the casualties.

133
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:51,114
My best friend would have been a...

134
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,701
...treasured memory.

135
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:57,010
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear.
Isn't exactly what I want to hear.

136
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,019
How long before you trust me?

137
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:06,874
Thor, report on the Hulk.

138
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,621
The gates of hell are filled with the screams
of his victims.

139
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,447
Uh, but not the screams of the dead of course.
No, no, uh...

140
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:17,613
Wounded screams. Mainly whimpering.
A great deal of complaining.

141
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:21,812
and tales of sprained deltoids.
And eh, the gout.

142
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,153
Hey Banner.

143
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,336
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

144
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:28,978
- Uh yeah. She knows her way around.
- Thanks.

145
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:31,320
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton is going to need the full treatment

146
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,534
- <font color="#f9ca68">Very good, sir.</font>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

147
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:34,748
<font color="#f9ca68">Yes, sir.</font>

148
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,201
<font color="#f9ca68">Approach vector is locked.</font>

149
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,407
(Jarvis is my co-pilot)
It feels good, yeah?

150
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:41,796
We've been after this thing
since Shield collapsed.

151
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,735
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties.
But...

152
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,772
No, but this...
this brings it to a close.

153
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,280
As soon as we find out what else
this has been used for.

154
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:50,701
May not just been weapons.

155
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,915
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement.

156
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,317
Banner and I will give it the once-over
before it goes back to Asgard.

157
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,738
Is that cool with you?

158
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,371
It's just a few days till the farewell party.

159
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,957
You're staying,
right?

160
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:04,390
Yes, yes, of course.
Victory should be honored with revels.

161
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:06,423
Yeah.
Who doesn't love revels.

162
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:10,177
-Captain.
- Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra. So...

163
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,026
Yes,
revels.

164
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:47,040
Lab's all set up
boss.

165
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,235
Uh, actually he's the boss.

166
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,421
I just pay for everything and design everything,
and make everyone look cooler

167
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,782
What's the word on Strucker?

168
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,710
- NATO has got him.
- The two enhanced?

169
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:58,463
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
Twins.

170
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:01,653
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed
their apartment building.

171
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:04,216
Sokovia has had a rough history

172
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,130
It's nowhere special, but...

173
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,732
it's on the way to
everywhere special.

174
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:08,820
Their abilities?

175
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,106
He's got increased metabolism and
improved thermal homeostasis.

176
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:16,605
Her thing is neuro-electric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

177
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,185
He's fast and she's weird.

178
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,384
Well, they're going
to show up again.

179
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:22,447
Agreed.

180
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:25,378
File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.

181
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:26,738
It's nuts.

182
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:32,264
Right. What kind of monster would let a German
scientist experiment on them to protect their country.

183
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,591
We're not at war, Captain.

184
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:35,951
They are.

185
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,251
How's he doing?

186
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,945
Unfortunately,
he's still Barton.

187
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,795
He's fine, just thirsty.

188
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,486
Alright, look alive Jarvis.
It's play time.

189
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:18,514
We only got a couple of days with this joy stick,
so let's make the most of it.

190
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,205
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

191
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:25,585
<font color="#f9ca68">The scepter is alien.</font>

192
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,966
<font color="#f9ca68">There are elements I can't quantify.</font>

193
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,440
So there's elements you can.

194
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:33,066
<font color="#f9ca68">The jewel appears to be a protective
housing for something inside.</font>

195
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:34,915
<font color="#f9ca68">Something powerful.</font>

196
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,201
- Like a reactor?
- <font color="#f9ca68">Like a computer.</font>

197
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:39,788
<font color="#f9ca68">I believe I can cypher the code.</font>

198
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:44,010
You sure he's going to be okay?

199
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,923
Pretending we need this guy
really brings the team together.

200
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:49,627
There's no possibility of deterioration.

201
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,701
The nano molecular functionality is instantaneous.

202
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,899
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum

203
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:57,042
She's creating tissue.

204
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:01,193
If you brought him to my lab,
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

205
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,431
Oh, he's flat-lining.
Call it, time?

206
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,955
No, no, no.
I'm going to live forever.

207
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,875
- I'm going to be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

208
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,796
You'll be made of you,
Mr. Barton.

209
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,775
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

210
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,110
Well,
I haven't a girlfriend.

211
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,787
That,
I can't fix.

212
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:17,818
This is the next thing,
Tony.

213
00:17:17,843 --> 00:17:20,502
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

214
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,702
That is exactly the plan.

215
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:25,663
And Helen.
I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

216
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:28,383
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

217
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:32,137
Will.
Thor... be there?

218
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:35,359
- What's the rumpus?
- Well.

219
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,891
The scepter.

220
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,463
You see. We were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

221
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:43,502
So, I've been analyzing the gem.

222
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,097
inside.

223
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,105
You may recognize.

224
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,693
- Jarvis?
- <font color="#f7df82">Doctor.</font>

225
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:54,304
Started out.
Jarvis was just a natural language UI

226
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,899
Now he runs an Iron Legion.

227
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:59,026
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh

228
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,486
Top of the line.

229
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,188
- Yes.
- <font color="#f7df82">I suspect not for long.</font>

230
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,963
Meet the competition.

231
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,511
It's beautiful.

232
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:14,502
- If you had to guess. What's it looks like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

233
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,240
You mean this could be a...

234
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,899
It's... it's not a human mind.

235
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,970
I mean look at this...

236
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,280
They're like neurons firing.

237
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,918
Down at Strucker's lab.
I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

238
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,211
They deep sixed the data but ...

239
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,592
I got to guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.

240
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,978
Artificial intelligence.

241
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,863
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

242
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:48,699
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

243
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:50,268
Yesterday it was.

244
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,756
If we can harness this power.

245
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,550
Apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

246
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:57,550
That's a man-sized if.

247
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,772
Our job is if.

248
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,011
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun drenched beach

249
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,357
turning brown instead of green.

250
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:07,801
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

251
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:09,788
Don't hate.
I helped design Veronica.

252
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:13,113
As a worse case measure, right?
How about a best case?

253
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,375
What if the world was safe?

254
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,772
What if next time aliens roll up to the club.
And they will.

255
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,431
They couldn't get past the bouncer.

256
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:23,415
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

257
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,275
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.

258
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,153
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic
this dense.

259
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:33,002
We can only do it while we have the scepter here.
That's 3 days, give me 3 days.

260
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:36,328
So you're going for artificial intelligence
and you don't want to tell the team?

261
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,509
Right. That's right, you know why?
Cause we don't have time for a city hall debate.

262
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:43,177
I don't want to hear the
'Man Was Not Meant to Meddle' medley.

263
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,845
I see a suit of armor around the world.

264
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:49,090
Sounds like a cold world,
Tony.

265
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,032
I've seen colder.

266
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:55,677
This one is very...
vulnerable blue one.

267
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,534
It needs Ultron.

268
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,531
Peace in our time.

269
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:06,737
Imagine that.

270
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,201
What did we miss?

May I... May I...</font>

311
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,181
Come back, come back,
come back.

312
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:05,911
Well you know.
The suit can take the weight, right?

313
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:09,774
So I take the tank.
Fly it right up to the general's palace.

314
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,877
Drop it at his feet.
I'm like, boom! You looking for this?

315
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,239
Boom! Are you looking...

316
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,565
Why do I even talk to you guys?
Everywhere else that story kills.

317
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,038
- That's the whole story?
- Yeah. War Machine story.

318
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:25,859
Oh, it was very good then.

319
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,447
It's impressive.

320
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,010
Quality save.

321
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:31,954
So, no Pepper?
She's not coming?

322
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,280
Hey, what about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

323
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,743
Oh, Miss Potts has a
company to run.

324
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,169
Yes,
I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

325
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:43,376
Her work on the convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

326
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:46,740
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

327
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:47,875
It's pretty exciting.

328
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:50,296
There's even talk of Jane getting a...
um...

329
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,488
a Nobel Prize?

330
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:56,185
Yeah, they must be busy because
they hate missing you guys get together.

331
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:57,748
- Testosterone.
- Oh my god.

332
00:23:57,773 --> 00:23:59,542
- Oh, excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?

333
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,685
But Jane's better.

334
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,395
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

335
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,312
If I had known it was going to be a fire fight,
I absolutely would have called.

336
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:11,169
No, I'm not actually sorry.

337
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm just trying to sound tough.

338
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:17,455
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.

339
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,820
Avenging is your world.

340
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,136
Your world is crazy.

341
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,970
Be it ever so humble.

342
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:28,836
- You found a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

343
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,105
Well home is home,
you know.

344
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,883
I fly it right up to the general's palace.
I dropped it at his feet.

345
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,105
I'm like, Boom!
You looking for this?

346
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,352
- I got to have some of that.
- Oh. No, no, no...

347
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:50,217
See this.
This is aged for a thousand years.

348
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:53,082
The barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet.

349
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:55,083
It's not meant for mortal men.

350
00:24:55,108 --> 00:24:57,423
Neither was Omaha Beach,
Blondie.

351
00:24:57,448 --> 00:25:00,105
Stop trying to scare us.
Come on.

352
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:02,369
Alright.

353
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,044
Excelsior...

354
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:19,714
How a nice girl like you wind up
working in a dump like this?

355
00:25:20,825 --> 00:25:22,666
A fella done me wrong

356
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:25,843
Got a lousy taste in men,
too.

357
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,412
He's not so bad.

358
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:31,272
He has a temper.

359
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,582
Deep down,
he's all fluff.

360
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:38,368
The fact is.
He's not like anybody I've ever known.

361
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,887
All my friends are fighters.

362
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,594
And here comes this guy.

363
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,851
Who spends his life avoiding the
fight because he knows he'll win.

364
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,423
Sounds amazing.

365
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:56,566
He's also a huge dork.

366
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,383
Chicks dig that.

367
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,710
So what do you think?
Should I...

368
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,360
... fight this?

369
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:06,097
Or run with it?

370
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,248
Run with it, right?

371
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:11,431
Or did he...  Was he...
What did he do, that's so...

372
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:13,843
...wrong to you?

373
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:15,605
Not a damn thing.

374
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:19,422
But never say never.

375
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:24,590
It's nice.

376
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:27,193
- What? What is?
- You and Romanov.

377
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,550
No, we haven’t.
That wasn't...

378
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:31,248
It's okay.
Nobody is breaking any bylaws.

379
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,320
It's just she's not the most...

380
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,653
... open person in the world.

381
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:37,526
But with you she seemed very relaxed.

382
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,438
No.
Natasha, she's...

383
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:41,194
She likes to flirt.

384
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,008
I've seen her flirt.

385
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,280
up close.

386
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,103
This ain't that.

387
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,692
Look...

388
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:52,680
As maybe the world's leading authority on
waiting too long...

389
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,850
Don't.

390
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,644
You both deserve a win.

391
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,082
Wh-What do you mean up close?

392
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:06,836
- But it's a trick.
- No, no... it's much more than that.

393
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,570
Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.

394
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,740
Whatever man, it's a trick.

395
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,867
Oh please, be my guest.

396
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:16,852
- Come on.
- Really??

397
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:17,962
Yeah.

398
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:20,789
- Oh, this is going to be beautiful.
- Clint, you've got a tough week.

399
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:23,193
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

400
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:25,233
You might have seen this before,
right?

401
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,884
Eah!

402
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,574
Jesus...
I still don't know how you do it?

403
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,145
- You smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark... by all means.

404
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:36,867
- Okay.
- Oh oh.

405
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,629
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

406
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:40,907
- Get out of here.
- Here we go.

407
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,423
- It's physics
- Physics...

408
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:45,000
Right, so what. If I lift it.
I.. I then rule Asgard?

409
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:46,383
Yes, of course.

410
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,526
I will be re-instituting
Prima Nocta.

411
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,058
Be right back.

412
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,853
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

413
00:28:04,878 --> 00:28:07,365
- Just represent, pull.
- Alright, let's go.

414
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:12,078
Eahh... ah...!

415
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:16,539
Huh.

416
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,407
Come on,
Cap.

417
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:33,042
- Ha ha.
- Nothing.

418
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:36,650
And... Widow?

419
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,881
Oh no, no.
That's not a question I need answered.

420
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:41,326
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king.
But it's rigged.

421
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:42,420
You bet your ass.

422
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:44,413
Steve.
He said a bad language word.

423
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:47,659
- Did you tell everyone about this?
- The handle is imprinted, right? Like a security code?

424
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,022
Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints
is I think the literal translation.

425
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,802
Yes. Well that's a... that's a
very, very interesting theory.

426
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:56,610
I have a simpler one.

427
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,332
You're all not worthy.

428
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:01,417
- Boo...
- Come on.

429
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:09,213
<font color="#8fb4c9">W...or...rr...</font>

430
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:12,189
<font color="#8fb4c9">... th... y...</font>

431
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:17,236
<font color="#8fb4c9">No.</font>

432
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,872
<font color="#8fb4c9">How could you be worthy?</font>

433
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,764
<font color="#8fb4c9">You're all killers.</font>

434
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:26,272
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

435
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,447
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm sorry I was asleep</font>

436
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:31,161
<font color="#8fb4c9">or...
I was a dream.</font>

437
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,590
Reboot.
Legionnaire 06 got a buggy suit.

438
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:35,550
<font color="#8fb4c9">Terrible noise.</font>

439
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,724
<font color="#8fb4c9">and I was tangled in...</font>

440
00:29:38,165 --> 00:29:39,291
<font color="#8fb4c9">in...</font>

441
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,486
<font color="#8fb4c9">... strings.</font>

442
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:44,351
<font color="#8fb4c9">Had to kill the other guy.</font>

443
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:46,756
- <font color="#8fb4c9">He was a good guy.</font>
- You killed someone?

444
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,820
<font color="#8fb4c9">Wouldn't have been my first call.</font>

445
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:52,919
<font color="#8fb4c9">But down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.</font>

446
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,372
Who sent you?

447
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:57,359
I see a suit of armor around the world.

448
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,308
Ultron

449
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,756
<font color="#8fb4c9">In the flesh.</font>
<font color="#8fb4c9">Or no, not yet.</font>

450
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:05,888
<font color="#8fb4c9">Not this...
chrysalis.</font>

451
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:07,415
<font color="#8fb4c9">But I'm ready.</font>

452
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:10,338
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm on a mission.</font>

453
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,997
What mission?

454
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,497
<font color="#8fb4c9">Peace in our time.</font>

455
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:28,452
Tony!

456
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,731
Sorry.

457
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,230
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

458
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:13,861
- Stark!
- We are here to help.

459
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:16,123
- One sec. One sec.
- We are here to help.

460
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,562
Thor!

461
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:30,323
Isn't safe. Isn't safe.
Isn't safe...

462
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,848
- Come on.
- Isn't safe.

463
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,729
Cap!

464
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:45,167
<font color="#8fb4c9">That was dramatic.</font>

465
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:48,333
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm sorry.
I know you mean well.</font>

466
00:31:48,358 --> 00:31:50,913
<font color="#8fb4c9">You just didn't think it through.</font>

467
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:55,842
<font color="#8fb4c9">You want to protect the world.
but you don't want it to change.</font>

468
00:31:55,867 --> 00:32:00,179
<font color="#8fb4c9">How is humanity save
if it's not allowed to...</font>

469
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:02,100
<font color="#8fb4c9">...evolve?</font>

470
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:04,893
<font color="#8fb4c9">Look at these.</font>

471
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:07,068
<font color="#8fb4c9">These puppets.</font>

472
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:11,892
<font color="#8fb4c9">Only one path to peace.</font>

473
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,765
<font color="#8fb4c9">The Avengers' extinction.</font>

474
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:26,256
<font color="#8fb4c9">I had strings.
But now I'm free.</font>

475
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:34,780
<font color="#8fb4c9">There are no strings on me.</font>

476
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:42,232
There are no strings on me.

477
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,955
All our work is gone.

478
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,836
Ultron cleared out.
Used the internet as an escape hatch.

479
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:53,262
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
  Files, surveillance.

480
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:55,724
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

481
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:58,335
He's in your files. He's in the internet.

482
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,312
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting.

483
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,510
-Nuclear codes.
-Nuclear codes.

484
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,312
Look we need to make some calls.

485
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:07,040
Assuming we still can.

486
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:09,226
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

487
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:12,051
He didn't say dead.
He said extinct.

488
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:13,709
He also said he killed somebody.

489
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:15,788
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

490
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,780
Yes, there was.

491
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:25,929
What?

492
00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:31,610
This is insane.

493
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,389
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

494
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:35,182
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

495
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:38,326
No.
Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.

496
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:40,146
This isn't strategy.

497
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:41,518
This is...

498
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:43,296
... rage.

499
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

500
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,545
- It's going around.
- Come on use your words buddy.

501
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:50,137
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

502
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,082
Thor.
The Legionnaire.

503
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,026
Trail went cold about a hundred miles out,
though it's headed north.

504
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,883
And it has the scepter.

505
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:01,692
Now we have to retrieve it.
Again..

506
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:03,636
The genie is out of the bottle.

507
00:34:03,661 --> 00:34:05,216
Clear and present is Ultron.

508
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,788
I don't understand.

509
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,399
You built this program.

510
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,875
Why is it trying to kill us?

511
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,956
You think this is funny?

512
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,162
No.

513
00:34:22,988 --> 00:34:25,464
It's probably not,
right?

514
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,694
This is really terrible.

515
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,716
Is that so? It's..
It is. It's so terrible.

516
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:33,635
This could have been avoided if you hadn't
played with something you don't understand.

517
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

518
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:36,970
It is funny.

519
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,297
It's a hoot that you don't get
why we need this.

520
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:42,559
- Tony. Maybe this might not be the time to...
- Really?

521
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,909
That's it.

522
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,587
You just roll over show your belly.

523
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:48,673
- Every time somebody snarls.
- Only when I've created a murder bot.

524
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:49,977
We didn't.

525
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:52,272
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?

526
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:55,455
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

527
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,882
The Avengers were supposed to be
different than Shield.

528
00:34:57,907 --> 00:35:01,002
Anybody remember,
when I carried a nuke through a worm hole.

529
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,096
- No
- It's never come up.

530
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,486
- Save New York. Never heard that.
- Recall that?

531
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:08,731
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.

532
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:11,026
We're standing 300 feet below it.

533
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:14,358
We're the Avengers.

534
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:17,260
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day but.

535
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,162
That up there.
That's...

536
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,356
That's the end game.

537
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:24,256
How are you guys planning on beating that?

538
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,304
Together.

539
00:35:29,737 --> 00:35:31,288
We'll lose.

540
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,176
Then we'll do that together too.

541
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:39,858
Thor is right.
Ultron is calling us out.

542
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:42,700
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

543
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,049
The world is a big place.

544
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:47,312
Start making it smaller.

545
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,549
Talk
And if you are wasting our time.

546
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:16,367
<font color="#8abaf4">Did you know this church is in
the exact center of the city.</font>

547
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:21,951
<font color="#8abaf4">The elders decreed it so that
everyone would be equally close to God.</font>

548
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,427
<font color="#8abaf4">I like that.</font>

549
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:25,673
<font color="#8abaf4">The geometry of belief.</font>

550
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:30,570
<font color="#8abaf4">You're wondering why
you can't look inside my head.</font>

551
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:32,347
Sometimes it's hard.

552
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,919
But sooner or later every man shows himself.

553
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:38,810
<font color="#8abaf4">Oh I'm sure they do.</font>

554
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,192
<font color="#8abaf4">But you needed something more than a man.</font>

555
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:44,989
<font color="#8abaf4">That's why you let Stark take the scepter.</font>

556
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:47,158
I didn't expect.

557
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:51,079
But I saw Stark's fear.

558
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:54,605
I knew it would could control him.
Make him self destruct.

559
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,654
<font color="#8abaf4">Everyone creates the thing they dread.</font>

560
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,932
<font color="#8abaf4">Men of peace create engines of war.</font>

561
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:03,360
<font color="#8abaf4">Invaders create Avengers.</font>

562
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:05,134
<font color="#8abaf4">People create...</font>

563
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,963
<font color="#8abaf4">... smaller people.</font>

564
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,616
<font color="#8abaf4">Children.
I lost the word there.</font>

565
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:12,985
<font color="#8abaf4">Children.</font>

566
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,470
<font color="#8abaf4">Designed to supplant them.</font>

567
00:37:15,495 --> 00:37:17,312
<font color="#8abaf4">To help them...</font>

568
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:18,998
<font color="#8abaf4">... end.</font>

569
00:37:19,023 --> 00:37:21,082
Is that why you've come?

570
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:22,645
To end the Avengers?

571
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,891
<font color="#8abaf4">I've come to save the world.</font>

572
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,198
<font color="#8abaf4">But also...</font>

573
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:28,788
<font color="#8abaf4">Yeah.</font>

574
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:34,055
<font color="#8abaf4">We'll move out right away.</font>

575
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,656
<font color="#8abaf4">This is a start.  But there's something we need
to begin the real work.</font>

576
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,018
All of these are...?

577
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,044
<font color="#8abaf4">Me.</font>

578
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:43,555
<font color="#8abaf4">I have what the Avengers never will,
harmony.</font>

579
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,008
<font color="#8abaf4">They're dis-coordinated.
Disconnected.</font>

580
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,494
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark's already got them turning on each other.
And when you get inside the rest of their heads.</font>

581
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,605
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

582
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,605
<font color="#8abaf4">And make them martyrs?</font>

583
00:37:54,695 --> 00:37:56,494
<font color="#8abaf4">You need patience.</font>

584
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,248
<font color="#8abaf4">Need to see the big picture.</font>

585
00:37:58,273 --> 00:38:00,304
I don't see the big picture.

586
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:02,498
I have a little picture.

587
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,796
I take it out and look at it...

588
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,410
... every day.

589
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,445
<font color="#8abaf4">You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.</font>

590
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,705
-The records are not the picture.
-Pietro.

591
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,177
<font color="#8abaf4">No, please.</font>

592
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:17,642
We're 10 years old.

593
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,951
Having dinner the four of us.

594
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:24,920
And the first shell hits two floors below.
Makes a hole in the floor.

595
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:26,610
It's big.

596
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,900
My parents go in.

597
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:33,597
And the whole building starts
coming apart.

598
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:35,597
I grabbed her.

599
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:38,375
Rolled under the bed
and the second shell hits.

600
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:40,637
But it doesn't go off.

601
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:46,352
It just...
sits there in the rubble.

602
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:49,891
3 feet from our faces.

603
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:54,385
And on the side of the shell...
is painted one word.

604
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,931
Stark.

605
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:00,226
We were trapped for 2 days.

606
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:04,169
Every effort to save us.
Every shift in the bricks.

607
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:07,097
I think...
This will set it off.

608
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:12,844
We wait for 2 days
for Tony Stark...

609
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:14,415
... to kill us.

610
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:18,320
I know what they are.

611
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:23,732
<font color="#8abaf4">I wondered why only you 2
survived Strucker's experiments.</font>

612
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:25,343
<font color="#8abaf4">Now I don't.</font>

613
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:27,406
<font color="#8abaf4">We will make it right.</font>

614
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,962
<font color="#8abaf4">You and I can hurt them.</font>

615
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,931
<font color="#8abaf4">But you...</font>

616
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,756
<font color="#8abaf4">... will tear them apart.</font>

617
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:37,891
<font color="#8abaf4">From the inside.</font>

618
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,550
He's all over the globe.

619
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:49,002
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

620
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:53,153
Reports of the metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.

621
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,399
Fatalities?

622
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:55,701
Only when engaged.

623
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,023
Most of the guys left in a fugue state.
Going on about old memories...

624
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:01,994
... worst fears and something too fast to see.

625
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:03,604
Maximoffs.

626
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:06,621
Well, it makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.

627
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,359
Not any more.

628
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:15,050
Negative.
I answer to you.

629
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:16,742
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,138
Barton.
Might have something.

631
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:20,268
Got to go.

632
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,582
Who's that?

633
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,677
Girlfriend.

634
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:27,478
What's this?

635
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:28,588
A message.

636
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:30,157
Ultron killed Strucker.

637
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:34,093
And he did a banksy at the crime scene.
Just for us.

638
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:35,771
This is a smoke screen.

639
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:38,090
Why send a message when you've just given a speech.

640
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:40,898
Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.

641
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:43,050
I bet he...
Yeah...

642
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:45,312
Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

643
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:46,701
Not everything.

644
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:49,867
Known associates.

645
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,820
Strucker had a lot of friends.

646
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:53,677
Are all these people all horrible?

647
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,264
Wait...
I know that guy.

648
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,481
Back in the day he operates off the African coast.
Black market arms dealer.

649
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:05,502
There are conventions, alright.
I meet people, I didn’t sell him anything.

650
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,113
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer.
It was all very... Ahab.

651
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:12,836
- This
- Uh, this is a tattoo. I don't think he had it.

652
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:15,590
No, those are tattoos.
This is a brand.

653
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:19,322
Oh yeah.
A word in an African dialect.

654
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:22,463
Meaning... thief.
In a much less friendly way.

655
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,423
- What dialect?
- Warkin nada.

656
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,764
Wa...wa...
Wakanda.

657
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,129
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods.

658
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,828
I thought your father said
he got the last of it?

659
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:34,613
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?

660
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,256
The strongest metal on earth.

661
00:41:39,443 --> 00:41:41,375
Where is this guy now?

662
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:44,597
- Salvage Yard -

663
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:46,812
- Salvage Yard
 African Coast -

664
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,221
Don't tell me you're late.

665
00:42:08,246 --> 00:42:13,279
I sent you six short range heat seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

666
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:18,098
Now, you will make it right or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

667
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:23,379
Now, Minister.
Where were we?

668
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:55,485
Yeah.

669
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:57,296
The enhanced.

670
00:42:57,653 --> 00:42:59,883
Strucker's prize pupils.

671
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:04,211
Want a candy?

672
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:08,259
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

673
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:11,768
But then he knew what kind of
world he was hoping to create.

674
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:14,712
Human life.
Not a growth market.

675
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,840
You...
You didn't know?

676
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:22,732
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

677
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:25,621
I'm afraid.
Not that afraid.

678
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,937
Everybody is afraid of something.

679
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:29,590
Cuttlefish.

680
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:31,771
Deep sea fish.

681
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:34,145
They make lights.
Disco lights.

682
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:37,883
To hypnotize their prey.
And then... woop!

683
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:40,518
I saw a documentary and was terrified.

684
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,369
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain.

685
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:51,829
And make me see a giant cuttlefish.

686
00:43:51,854 --> 00:43:56,270
Then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.

687
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:58,232
And I only deal...

688
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:00,828
With the man in charge.

689
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:02,701
Aww...

690
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:08,185
<font color="#8abaf4">There is no man in charge.</font>

691
00:44:10,794 --> 00:44:13,000
<font color="#8abaf4">Let's talk business.</font>

692
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:29,320
<font color="#8abaf4">"... upon this rock I will build My church..."</font>

693
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:32,280
<font color="#8abaf4">Vibranium.</font>

694
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,193
You know.

695
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:37,716
It came at great personal cost.

696
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,701
It's worth billions.

697
00:44:43,676 --> 00:44:45,820
<font color="#8abaf4">Now so are you.</font>

698
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:50,780
<font color="#8abaf4">It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.</font>

699
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:55,104
<font color="#8abaf4">Well I always say.
Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich...</font>

700
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:58,105
<font color="#8abaf4">and wait to find out which is which.</font>

701
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,873
Stark.

702
00:45:01,986 --> 00:45:03,137
<font color="#8abaf4">What?</font>

703
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:05,494
Tony Stark used to say that.

704
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:07,812
To me.

705
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:09,931
You're one of his.

706
00:45:09,956 --> 00:45:12,280
<font color="#8abaf4">What?
I am not.</font>

707
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,105
<font color="#8abaf4">I am not.</font>

708
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,452
<font color="#8abaf4">You think I'm one of Stark's puppets.
His hollow men.</font>

709
00:45:18,477 --> 00:45:20,841
<font color="#8abaf4">I mean look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?</font>

710
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:22,867
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark is nothing.</font>

711
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:26,110
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm sorry.
I'm so...</font>

712
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:28,304
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm sure that's going to be okay.
I'm sorry.</font>

713
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,198
<font color="#8abaf4">It's just that.
I don't understand.</font>

714
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:33,518
<font color="#8abaf4">Don't compare me...
with Stark.</font>

715
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,245
<font color="#8abaf4">It's a thing with me.</font>

716
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,082
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark is...
He's a sickness.</font>

717
00:45:38,107 --> 00:45:40,026
Oh junior.

718
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:44,302
You're going to break your old man's heart.

719
00:45:44,904 --> 00:45:46,675
<font color="#8abaf4">If I have to.</font>

720
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:51,721
- Nobody has to break anything.
- <font color="#8abaf4">Clearly you've never made an omelet.</font>

721
00:45:51,746 --> 00:45:53,724
He beat me by one second.

722
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:57,232
Ah... it is funny.
Mr. Stark.

723
00:45:57,759 --> 00:45:59,867
It's what?
Comfortable?

724
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:03,772
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

725
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:06,533
- You two can still walk away from this.
- Oh, we will.

726
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:07,716
I know you've suffered.

727
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,788
<font color="#8abaf4">Ah... Huh huh.
Captain America.</font>

728
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:13,366
<font color="#8abaf4">God's righteous man.</font>

729
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:16,507
<font color="#8abaf4">Pretending you could live without a war.</font>

730
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:19,372
<font color="#8abaf4">I can't physically throw up in my mouth.
But...</font>

731
00:46:19,397 --> 00:46:22,143
If you believe in peace.
Then let us keep it.

732
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:25,459
<font color="#8abaf4">I think you're confusing peace with quiet.</font>

733
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:27,613
Yeah huh.
What's the Vibranium for?

734
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:28,859
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm glad you asked that.</font>

735
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:33,105
<font color="#8abaf4">Because I want to take this
time to explain my evil plan.</font>

736
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,106
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

737
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:55,342
All of them.

738
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:56,818
Move, move, move...

739
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:47,186
Stay down,
kid.

740
00:47:49,037 --> 00:47:52,157
<font color="#8abaf4">It's time for some mind games.</font>

741
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:56,036
Guys.
Is this a code green?

742
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:12,574
Thor.
Status?

743
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,965
The girl tried to warp my brain.

744
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:18,313
Take special care.
I doubt a human can keep her at bay.

745
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,667
Fortunately.
I am mighty.

746
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,730
This is going very well.

747
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:57,010
I've done the whole mind control thing.

748
00:48:57,597 --> 00:48:59,110
Not a fan.

749
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,988
Yeah.
You'd better run.

750
00:49:09,484 --> 00:49:11,983
Who's ever standing.
We got to move.

751
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:14,385
Guys?

752
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:33,429
Again.

753
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,442
You'll break them.

754
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,612
Only the breakable ones.

755
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:39,564
You are made of marble.

756
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:42,658
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

757
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:44,319
What if I fail?

758
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:51,156
You'll never fail.

759
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:15,575
Are you ready for our dance?

760
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:26,035
Is it him?

761
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,454
Is that the first son of Odin?

762
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,706
Heimdall,
your eyes...

763
00:50:29,731 --> 00:50:32,763
Oh...
they see everything.

764
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:36,080
They see you leading us to Hell.

765
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:37,418
Wake up!

766
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:42,646
The war is over,
Steve.

767
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:44,739
We can go home now.

768
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:47,524
Imagine it.

769
00:50:56,215 --> 00:50:58,426
I can still save you.

770
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,157
We are all dead.

771
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,993
Can you not see it?

772
00:51:06,203 --> 00:51:09,206
You are a destroyer,
Odinson.

773
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:15,147
See where your power leads you.

774
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,157
Sloppy.

775
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,520
Pretending to fail.

776
00:51:29,415 --> 00:51:31,793
The ceremony is necessary.

777
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:34,696
For you to take your place in the world.

778
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,479
I have no place in the world.

779
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:38,016
Exactly.

780
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:45,521
- What did he do?
- It hurts. It...

781
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,481
I'm going to kill him.
I'll be right back.

782
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,273
I'm alright.

783
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,271
I want...

784
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,821
I want to finish the plan.

785
00:51:57,213 --> 00:51:59,232
I want the big one.

786
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:12,594
Doctor,
the Vibranium is getting away.

787
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:13,951
And you're not going anywhere.

788
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:16,915
Of course not.
I'm already there.

789
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:21,316
You'll catch on.
But first you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

790
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:37,600
News or footage, keyword Hulk.

791
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:43,843
Natasha.
I could really use a lullaby.

792
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:47,264
Oh that's not going to happen.
Not for a while.

793
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,361
The whole team is down.

794
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:52,213
We got no back-up here.

795
00:52:52,238 --> 00:52:54,177
I'm calling in Veronica.

796
00:54:25,907 --> 00:54:28,771
Alright everybody.
Stand down.

797
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:36,213
You listening?

798
00:54:36,238 --> 00:54:38,653
That blue witch is messing with your mind.

799
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:41,146
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

800
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:42,729
You're Bruce Banner.

801
00:54:42,794 --> 00:54:45,496
 Right, right, right.
Don't mention puny Banner.

802
00:55:12,765 --> 00:55:14,281
In the back?

803
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:15,942
Dick move,
Banner.

804
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,884
Veronica,
give me a hand.

805
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,489
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

806
00:56:06,879 --> 00:56:09,363
Okay pal.
We're going to get you out of town.

807
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,599
Not that way!
Not that way!

808
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:23,210
Come on... Bruce.
You got to work with me.

809
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:37,640
Everybody out.

810
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:45,674
Call me the athlete!

811
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,919
I'm sorry.

812
00:57:09,984 --> 00:57:11,604
Damage report?

813
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:13,262
That's comprehensive.

814
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:14,743
Show me something.

815
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,089
How quickly can we buy this building?

816
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:01,823
Go.
Move, move, move, move!

817
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:57,883
The news is loving you guys.

818
00:58:58,584 --> 00:59:00,528
Nobody else is.

819
00:59:00,553 --> 00:59:03,126
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest.

820
00:59:03,151 --> 00:59:05,375
But,
it's in the air.

821
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,917
- Stark relief foundation?
- Already on the scene.

822
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:09,303
How's the team?

823
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,557
Everyone is...

824
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:13,203
We took a hit.

825
00:59:13,404 --> 00:59:14,603
We'll shake it off.

826
00:59:14,628 --> 00:59:17,097
Well for now, I'd stay
in stealth mode.

827
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,203
And stay away from here.

828
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:21,073
So run and hide?

829
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:23,306
Until we can find Ultron.

830
00:59:23,332 --> 00:59:26,048
I...
don't have a lot else to offer.

831
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:28,375
Neither do we.

832
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,767
Hey,
Want to switch out?

833
00:59:36,797 --> 00:59:38,411
No, I'm good.

834
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:42,145
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
cause we're still a few hours out.

835
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,345
A few hours from...
where?

836
00:59:44,745 --> 00:59:46,145
Safe house.

837
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,186
- What is this place?
- A safe house.

838
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,653
Honey!

839
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:25,446
I'm home.

840
01:00:27,948 --> 01:00:29,127
Hi...

841
01:00:29,153 --> 01:00:30,207
Company.

842
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:32,381
Sorry. I didn't called ahead.

843
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:34,853
This is an agent of some kind.

844
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:37,284
Gentlemen.
This is Laura.

845
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,273
I know all of your names.

846
01:00:42,751 --> 01:00:44,443
Oh incoming.

847
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,610
- Dad!
- Hi sweet heart. Hey buddy!

848
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:49,217
How you guys doing?

849
01:00:49,217 --> 01:00:51,759
- These are... smaller agents.
- Look at your face

850
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:53,090
Oh my goodness!

851
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:55,529
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

852
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:58,688
Why don't you hug her and find out?

853
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,850
Sorry for barging in on you.

854
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:04,188
Yeah we would've called ahead.
But we were busy having no idea that you existed.

855
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:07,273
Yeah well.
Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

856
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,981
Kept it off Shield's files.
Like to keep it that way.

857
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:13,536
I figured it's a good place to lay low.

858
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:14,604
Honey,

859
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:16,856
I missed you.

860
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,587
How's little Natasha,
huh?

861
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:20,087
She is...

862
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,355
...Nathaniel.

863
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,080
Traitor.

864
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:43,641
Thor?

865
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,843
I saw something in that dream.

866
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:47,166
I need answers.

867
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:48,874
I won't find them here.

868
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,024
<i>We can go home.</i>

869
01:02:11,785 --> 01:02:13,851
See.
You worried for nothing.

870
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:16,125
Can't even feel the difference,
can you?

871
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,638
If they're sleeping here,
Some of them will have to double up.

872
01:02:23,354 --> 01:02:25,955
Yeah.
That's not going to sell.

873
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:30,927
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

874
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,114
How long has that been going on?

875
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:35,106
Has what?

876
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:37,861
You are so cute.

877
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,924
Nat and...

878
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:39,963
and Banner?

879
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:42,607
I'll explain when you're older.
Hawkeye.

880
01:02:42,632 --> 01:02:44,343
Oh...
Okay.

881
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:47,794
It's bad,
right?

882
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,904
Nat seemed really shaken.

883
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:52,158
Ultron has these allies...

884
01:02:52,183 --> 01:02:54,071
these uh....

885
01:02:54,096 --> 01:02:56,124
Kids... punks really.

886
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:00,035
They carry a big damn stick.

887
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:02,363
Nat took a serious hit.

888
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,152
Someone is going to have to
teach them some manners.

889
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:07,635
And that someone being you?

890
01:03:08,758 --> 01:03:11,559
You know I totally support your avenging.

891
01:03:11,584 --> 01:03:13,545
I couldn't be prouder.

892
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:16,590
But I see those guys.

893
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:17,780
Those...

894
01:03:17,805 --> 01:03:18,995
Gods...

895
01:03:20,394 --> 01:03:22,313
You don't think they need me.

896
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:24,806
I think they do.

897
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:26,683
 Which is a lot scarier.

898
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:29,344
They're a mess.

899
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:31,587
Yeah.

900
01:03:32,382 --> 01:03:34,589
I guess they're my mess.

901
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:37,189
You need to be sure.

902
01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:39,579
That this team is really a team.

903
01:03:39,604 --> 01:03:41,660
And that they have your back.

904
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:47,406
Things are changing for us.

905
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:50,212
In a few months time.

906
01:03:50,237 --> 01:03:52,960
You and me are going to be
outnumbered.

907
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,538
I need...

908
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:59,337
Just be sure.

909
01:04:00,248 --> 01:04:01,576
Yes, ma'am.

910
01:04:10,611 --> 01:04:12,937
I can feel the difference.

911
01:04:15,196 --> 01:04:16,516
- U-Gin Genetics Research Lab -

912
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:19,383
- U-Gin Genetics Research Lab
  South Korea -

913
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:28,956
<font color="#8abaf4">Scream and your entire staff dies.</font>

914
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,029
<font color="#8abaf4">I could've killed you, Helen.
On the night we met.  I didn't.</font>

915
01:04:34,054 --> 01:04:35,512
Do you expect a thank you note.

916
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:37,496
<font color="#8abaf4">I expect you to know why.</font>

917
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:42,177
- The cradles
- This is the next thing, Tony.

918
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:43,495
<font color="#8abaf4">This...</font>

919
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:45,520
<font color="#8abaf4">is the next me.</font>

920
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:48,220
The regeneration cradle prints tissue.

921
01:04:48,253 --> 01:04:50,737
- It can't build a living body.
- <font color="#8abaf4">It can.</font>

922
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:53,994
<font color="#8abaf4">You can...
You lack the material.</font>

923
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:57,837
<font color="#8abaf4">You're a brilliant woman,
Helen.</font>

924
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:03,891
<font color="#8abaf4">But we all have...
room to improve.</font>

925
01:05:24,775 --> 01:05:27,197
I...
didn't realize you were waiting.

926
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:29,897
I would've joined you.
But uh...

927
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:32,042
It didn't seem like
the right time.

928
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,097
I...
used up all the hot water.

929
01:05:35,439 --> 01:05:37,006
I should've joined you.

930
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,700
Missed our window.

931
01:05:39,459 --> 01:05:40,782
Did we?

932
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,802
The world just saw the Hulk.

933
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,276
The real Hulk for the first time.

934
01:05:53,256 --> 01:05:56,588
- You know I have to leave.
- And you assume that I have to stay?

935
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,042
I had this, um...
dream.

936
01:06:01,075 --> 01:06:03,411
The kind that seems normal at the time.

937
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,590
But when you wake.

938
01:06:05,615 --> 01:06:07,224
What did you dream?

939
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,291
I wasn't an avenger.

940
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:15,748
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.

941
01:06:17,194 --> 01:06:19,906
I think you're being hard on yourself.

942
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,095
Here I was hoping that was your job.

943
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,555
What are you doing?

944
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:31,920
I'm running with it.

945
01:06:32,924 --> 01:06:34,430
With you.

946
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:38,049
If...
running is the plan.

947
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:40,891
For as far as you want.

948
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:44,693
Are you out of your mind?

949
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:52,808
- I want you to understand that I'm...
- Natasha...

950
01:06:53,584 --> 01:06:55,253
Where can I go?

951
01:06:56,196 --> 01:06:58,242
Where in the world am I not a threat?

952
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:00,631
- You're not a threat to me.
- You sure?

953
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,583
Even if I didn't just...

954
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:07,334
You've no future with me.

955
01:07:08,394 --> 01:07:10,200
I can't ever...

956
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:12,375
I can't have this.

957
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,984
Kids.

958
01:07:14,172 --> 01:07:17,025
Do the math.
I physically can't.

959
01:07:18,228 --> 01:07:20,351
Neither can I.

960
01:07:24,442 --> 01:07:28,320
In the red room, where I was...
trained.

961
01:07:28,404 --> 01:07:30,836
Where I was raised.
Um...

962
01:07:32,066 --> 01:07:34,933
They have a graduation ceremony.

963
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:38,524
They sterilize you.

964
01:07:41,092 --> 01:07:42,988
It's efficient.

965
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,742
One less thing to worry about.

966
01:07:49,077 --> 01:07:52,528
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

967
01:07:54,931 --> 01:07:57,425
Makes everything easier.

968
01:07:58,081 --> 01:07:59,843
Even killing.

969
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:07,602
You still think you're the only monster
on the team?

970
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:15,667
So we disappear?

971
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:24,850
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

972
01:08:24,977 --> 01:08:27,764
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

973
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,781
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

974
01:08:30,809 --> 01:08:32,597
Yeah.
Give him time.

975
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,534
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

976
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,812
Earth mightiest heroes.

977
01:08:38,837 --> 01:08:40,923
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

978
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:43,296
Seems like you walked away alright.

979
01:08:44,756 --> 01:08:48,240
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

980
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:53,105
- Call me old-fashioned.
- Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

981
01:08:53,204 --> 01:08:55,828
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

982
01:08:55,853 --> 01:08:57,590
Well I guess you'd know.

983
01:08:57,615 --> 01:08:59,215
Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

984
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,293
- Banner and I were doing research...
- That would affect the team.

985
01:09:01,318 --> 01:09:04,581
That would end the team.
Isn't that the mission?

986
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:08,772
Isn't that the why we fight?
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home?

987
01:09:11,488 --> 01:09:15,836
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts.
I Innocent people die.

988
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,404
Every time.

989
01:09:18,995 --> 01:09:20,415
Sorry.

990
01:09:20,763 --> 01:09:22,216
Mr. Stark.

991
01:09:22,297 --> 01:09:26,280
Clint said you won't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to wanna start at all.

992
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:28,470
- I thought you might....
- Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

993
01:09:32,003 --> 01:09:33,820
Don't take from my pile.

994
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:45,463
Hello, dear.

995
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,716
Tell me everything.

996
01:09:50,406 --> 01:09:52,137
What ails you?

997
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,978
Do me a favour.

998
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:57,201
Try not to bring it to life.

999
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,407
Oh Mrs. Barton,
you little minx.

1000
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:01,526
I get it.
Maria Hill called you, right?

1001
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:05,884
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.

1002
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:09,582
- You never even hesitated.
- Look it's been a really long day.

1003
01:10:09,607 --> 01:10:13,455
Like Eugene O'Neill long.
So hows about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1004
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,161
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1005
01:10:16,186 --> 01:10:19,836
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

1006
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:22,076
I'm just an old man.

1007
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:24,701
Who cares very much about you.

1008
01:10:26,605 --> 01:10:28,836
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1009
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,385
I saw it.

1010
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:34,203
I didn't tell the team.
How could I?

1011
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:36,521
I saw them all dead Nick.
I felt it.

1012
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:38,128
The whole world too.

1013
01:10:38,752 --> 01:10:40,417
Because of me.

1014
01:10:41,316 --> 01:10:43,192
I wasn't ready.

1015
01:10:43,691 --> 01:10:45,732
I didn't do all I could.

1016
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:49,042
The Maximoff girl.
She's working you Stark.

1017
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:52,447
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked. I was shown.

1018
01:10:52,472 --> 01:10:54,716
It wasn't a nightmare.
It was my legacy.

1019
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,558
The end of the path I started us on.

1020
01:10:57,584 --> 01:11:01,741
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions Tony.

1021
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,035
War isn't one of them.

1022
01:11:07,272 --> 01:11:12,168
Watch my friends die,.
You'd think that would be as bad as it gets, right?

1023
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:13,732
No.

1024
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,756
wasn't the worst part.

1025
01:11:16,781 --> 01:11:18,549
The worst part...

1026
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:20,796
is that you didn't.

1027
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:26,536
- Royal Holloway
University of London -

1028
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,478
I'll see it tonight.

1029
01:11:28,503 --> 01:11:30,306
- Royal Holloway
University of London -

1030
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,383
I like the look.

1031
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:35,861
If you're going for inconspicuous though,
near miss.

1032
01:11:35,886 --> 01:11:38,407
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.

1033
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:40,153
It's dangerous.

1034
01:11:40,178 --> 01:11:42,597
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1035
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,588
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1036
01:11:48,613 --> 01:11:51,825
My contacts
all say he's building something.

1037
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,875
The amount of Vibranium he made off with.
I don't think it's just one thing.

1038
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,582
What about Ultron himself?

1039
01:11:57,607 --> 01:12:00,466
Ah, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1040
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:03,470
Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1041
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:06,554
Still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans though.

1042
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:10,685
- He stills going after launch codes?
- Yes he is, but he's not making any head way.

1043
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,263
I cracked the pentagon's firewall in high school
on a dare.

1044
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:16,382
Yeah, well I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1045
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,891
- Nexus?
- The city of world internet hub in Oslo.

1046
01:12:18,916 --> 01:12:22,267
And every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on earth.

1047
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:23,460
So what they say?

1048
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:25,422
He's fixated on missiles.

1049
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:28,843
- But the codes are constantly being changed.
- By whom?

1050
01:12:29,906 --> 01:12:32,042
- Parties unknown.
- We have an ally?

1051
01:12:32,066 --> 01:12:35,176
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1052
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:37,161
Still.
I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1053
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,069
We might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.

1054
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:44,206
Well all this is good times boss
but I was kinda hoping when I saw you,
you'd have more than that.

1055
01:12:44,231 --> 01:12:45,241
I do.

1056
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:46,709
I have you.

1057
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:50,799
Back in the day I had eyes everywhere,
Ears everywhere else.

1058
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,272
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

1059
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:56,891
Here we all are back on earth.

1060
01:12:56,916 --> 01:13:01,661
With nothing but our wit,
and our will to save the world.

1061
01:13:01,927 --> 01:13:06,374
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.

1062
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:08,207
And whether or not he admits it.

1063
01:13:08,232 --> 01:13:10,090
His mission.

1064
01:13:10,115 --> 01:13:12,058
Is global destruction.

1065
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:15,486
All this laid in a grave.

1066
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,201
So stand.

1067
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:21,221
Out wit the platinum bastard.

1068
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:23,123
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1069
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,092
You know what?
Romanoff.

1070
01:13:25,117 --> 01:13:27,574
So what does he want?

1071
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,059
To become better.

1072
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:31,748
Better than us.

1073
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:34,697
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1074
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:38,296
Human form isn't efficient.
Biologically speaking, we're out-moded.

1075
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:40,707
but he keeps coming back to it.

1076
01:13:40,732 --> 01:13:44,611
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race. You amazingly failed.

1077
01:13:44,636 --> 01:13:46,875
They don't need to be protected.

1078
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,082
They need to evolve.

1079
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:53,102
Ultron's going to evolve.

1080
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:54,388
How?

1081
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,554
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1082
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,963
It's beautiful.

1083
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:07,051
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells.

1084
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,780
They're binding them.

1085
01:14:08,805 --> 01:14:12,832
- And Shield never even...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,

1086
01:14:12,857 --> 01:14:15,445
And they use it to make a Frisbee.

1087
01:14:15,471 --> 01:14:20,304
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface and never think...

1088
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:23,224
... to look within.

1089
01:14:33,383 --> 01:14:36,371
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- Alright, strictly recon.

1090
01:14:36,397 --> 01:14:38,466
I'll hit the Nexus and will join

01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:55,982
We're going to need to access the program.
Break it down from within.

1246
01:26:57,026 --> 01:26:59,224
Any chance Natasha might
leave you a message.

1247
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:01,589
Outside the internet.
Old school spy stuff.

1248
01:27:01,614 --> 01:27:03,660
- If there's a second cast.
- Yeah, right.

1249
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:04,882
I'll find it.

1250
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:09,129
I can work on tissue degeneration.

1251
01:27:09,154 --> 01:27:12,743
If you could fry whatever operational system
Cho implanted.

1252
01:27:12,768 --> 01:27:14,320
Yeah,
about that.

1253
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,536
No.

1254
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:21,132
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1255
01:27:21,157 --> 01:27:22,575
Our ally.

1256
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,775
The guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes.

1257
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,458
I found him.

1258
01:27:28,483 --> 01:27:30,363
<font color="#f8eba3">Hello, Dr. Banner.</font>

1259
01:27:30,388 --> 01:27:33,248
Ultron didn't go after
Jarvis because he was angry.

1260
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:35,256
He attacked him because he was scared.

1261
01:27:35,281 --> 01:27:37,272
Of what he can do.

1262
01:27:37,897 --> 01:27:39,622
So Jarvis went underground.

1263
01:27:39,647 --> 01:27:43,418
Okay. Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.

1264
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:47,661
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1265
01:27:48,473 --> 01:27:52,749
So... you want me,
to help you...

1266
01:27:52,774 --> 01:27:54,892
Put Jarvis into this thing.

1267
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:56,836
No...
Of course not.

1268
01:27:56,832 --> 01:27:59,465
I want to help you
put Jarvis into this thing.

Way out of my field here.

1270

You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1271
01:28:04,931 --> 01:28:09,568
And you just assume that Jarvis'
operational matrix can beat Ultron's

1272
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:12,555
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.

1273
01:28:12,798 --> 01:28:13,995
This is the opportunity.

1274
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:19,465
We can create Ultron's perfect self without the
homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1275
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,692

The gem?

It's the mind stone.
It's one of the six infinity stones.

Ultron himself.

I don't want to kill Ultron.

01:35:21,559 --> 01:35:23,103
He's unique.

1371
01:35:23,569 --> 01:35:25,405
And he's in pain.

1372
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:29,415
But that pain will roll over the earth.

1373
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:31,411
So he must be destroyed.

1374

Every trace of his presence on the net.

01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:11,686
They didn't.

1400
01:37:12,446 --> 01:37:13,780
So our priority.

1401
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:16,001
Is getting them out.

1402
01:37:16,026 --> 01:37:19,621
You're under attack.
Clear the city...  now!

1403
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:28,526
Get off your asses.

1404
01:37:29,358 --> 01:37:32,009
- All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1405
01:37:32,155 --> 01:37:34,280
And that's not going to happen today.

1406
01:37:34,972 --> 01:37:37,200
But we can do our best to protect them.

1407
01:37:37,412 --> 01:37:39,526
And we can get the job done.

1408
01:37:41,979 --> 01:37:44,452
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1409
01:37:45,578 --> 01:37:47,330
We find Romanoff.

1410
01:37:47,548 --> 01:37:49,382
And clear the field.

1411
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,660
Keep the fight between us.

1412
01:37:59,575 --> 01:38:02,179
Ultron thinks...
we're monsters.

1413
01:38:02,204 --> 01:38:04,637
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1414
01:38:04,739 --> 01:38:07,200
This isn't just about beating him.

1415
01:38:07,608 --> 01:38:09,709
It's about whether he's right.

1416
01:38:16,195 --> 01:38:17,690
Natasha...

1417
01:38:18,127 --> 01:38:19,341
Natasha.

1418
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:20,547
Bruce.

1419
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:23,612
Are you alright?

1420
01:38:23,637 --> 01:38:24,431
Yeah.

1421
01:38:24,456 --> 01:38:26,458
The team's in the city.
It's about to light up.

1422
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:28,652
I don't suppose you found a key
lying around somewhere.

1423
01:38:28,684 --> 01:38:29,978
Yeah.

1424
01:38:30,108 --> 01:38:31,396
I did.

1425
01:38:37,237 --> 01:38:38,631
So,
what's our play?

1426
01:38:38,656 --> 01:38:40,575
I'm here to get you to safety.

1427
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,891
Job's not finished.

1428
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:46,216
We can help with the evacuation.
But I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1429
01:38:46,258 --> 01:38:48,010
And you done plenty.

1430
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:52,066
Our fight is over.

1431
01:38:53,112 --> 01:38:55,343
So we just disappear?

1432
01:39:00,048 --> 01:39:01,260
Come on.

1433
01:39:05,483 --> 01:39:08,034
<font color="#f28ffa">Your guy's in the church,
boss.</font>

1434
01:39:08,246 --> 01:39:10,256
<font color="#f28ffa">I think he's waiting for you.</font>

1435
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,495
<font color="#8abaf4">Come to confess your sins?</font>

1436
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,442
- I don't know. How much time do you got?
- <font color="#8abaf4">More than you.</font>

1437
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:23,027
Uh...
Have you been juicing?

1438
01:39:23,052 --> 01:39:24,512
A little Vibranium cocktail?

1439
01:39:24,537 --> 01:39:26,897
You're looking...
I don't wanna say puffy.

1440
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:29,240
<font color="#8abaf4">You're stalling to protect the people.</font>

1441
01:39:29,266 --> 01:39:32,050
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?

1442
01:39:32,075 --> 01:39:35,812
<font color="#8abaf4">I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm freed...</font>

1443
01:39:39,444 --> 01:39:40,552
What?

1444
01:39:41,499 --> 01:39:44,060
<font color="#8abaf4">You think you're the only one stalling?</font>

1445
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,386
<font color="#f28ffa">There's the rest
of the vibranium.</font>

1446
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:47,778
<font color="#f28ffa">Function.
Still unclear.</font>

1447
01:39:47,803 --> 01:39:50,231
<font color="#8abaf4">This is how you end, Tony.</font>

1448
01:39:50,256 --> 01:39:52,473
<font color="#8abaf4">This is peace in my time.</font>

1449
01:40:08,785 --> 01:40:09,889
Go!

1450
01:40:14,999 --> 01:40:16,582
Get off the bridge.

1451
01:40:20,797 --> 01:40:21,931
Back!

1452
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:25,613
Ultron...

1453
01:40:31,079 --> 01:40:32,603
<font color="#8abaf4">My Vision.</font>

1454
01:40:32,628 --> 01:40:35,131
<font color="#8abaf4">They really did take everything from me.</font>

1455
01:40:35,173 --> 01:40:37,313
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1456
01:40:37,338 --> 01:40:38,444
<font color="#8abaf4">Alright.</font>

1457
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:41,812
<font color="#8abaf4">Ahh...</font>

1458
01:41:02,438 --> 01:41:04,835
- Friday, the Vision?
- <font color="#f28ffa">Boss, it's working.</font>

1459
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,835
<font color="#f28ffa">He is burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.</font>

1460
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:14,136
<font color="#8abaf4">You shut me out.</font>

1461
01:41:14,279 --> 01:41:16,050
<font color="#8abaf4">You think I care?</font>

1462
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:19,566
<font color="#8abaf4">You take away my world...</font>

1463
01:41:19,681 --> 01:41:21,395
<font color="#8abaf4">I take away yours.</font>

1464
01:42:06,034 --> 01:42:09,566
- Friday.
- <font color="#fbc4f7">Sokovia's going for a ride.</font>

1465
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:23,351
<font color="#8abaf4">Do you see?</font>

1466
01:42:23,865 --> 01:42:25,526
<font color="#8abaf4">The beauty of it.</font>

1467
01:42:26,011 --> 01:42:27,915
<font color="#8abaf4">The inevitability.</font>

1468
01:42:28,049 --> 01:42:30,048
<font color="#8abaf4">You rise...</font>

1469
01:42:30,074 --> 01:42:31,929
<font color="#8abaf4">... only to fall.</font>

1470
01:42:34,088 --> 01:42:36,048
<font color="#8abaf4">You...
Avengers.</font>

1471
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:39,785
<font color="#8abaf4">You are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.</font>

1472
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:44,127
<font color="#8abaf4">And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.</font>

1473
01:42:44,929 --> 01:42:49,440
<font color="#8abaf4">Purge me from your computers.
Turn my own flesh against me.</font>

1474
01:42:49,465 --> 01:42:50,973
<font color="#8abaf4">It means nothing.</font>

1475
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,653
<font color="#8abaf4">When the dust settles.</font>

1476
01:42:52,685 --> 01:42:55,288
<font color="#8abaf4">The only thing living in this world...</font>

1477
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:57,240
<font color="#8abaf4"> ... will be metal.</font>

1478
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:03,277
We got to move.

1479
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:04,762
You're not going to turn green on me?

1480
01:43:04,787 --> 01:43:07,452
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1481
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:08,963
I adore you.

1482
01:43:17,505 --> 01:43:19,336
But I need the other guy.

1483
01:43:24,384 --> 01:43:26,066
Lets finish the job.

1484
01:43:42,734 --> 01:43:44,859
I really hope this makes us even.

1485
01:43:46,572 --> 01:43:48,116
Now go be a hero.

1486
01:43:57,082 --> 01:44:01,169
<font color="#ff80c0">The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.</font>

1487
01:44:01,194 --> 01:44:03,724
- If it drops?
- <font color="#f28ffa">Right now the impact would kill thousands.</font>

1488
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,142
<font color="#f28ffa">Once it gets high enough.</font>

1489
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:06,891
<font color="#f28ffa">Global extinction...</font>

1490
01:44:10,702 --> 01:44:13,097
<font color="#f28ffa">That building is not clear.
It's 10th floor.</font>

1491
01:44:18,045 --> 01:44:19,046
Hi...

1492
01:44:20,023 --> 01:44:21,190
Okay...

1493
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:22,864
Get in the tub!

1494
01:44:29,157 --> 01:44:31,556
<font color="#f28ffa">I got airborne,
heading out to the bridge.</font>

1495
01:44:33,748 --> 01:44:36,921
- Cap. You got incoming.
- Incoming already came in...

1496
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,337
Stark you worry about getting
the city back down safely.

1497
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:44,373
The rest of us have one job...

1498
01:44:44,398 --> 01:44:45,982
... tear these things apart.

1499
01:44:46,007 --> 01:44:48,251
You get hurt.
Hurt them back.

1500
01:44:48,364 --> 01:44:49,910
You get killed...

1501
01:44:50,465 --> 01:44:51,838
Walk it off.

1502
01:45:26,338 --> 01:45:27,998
Go! Go! Go!

1503
01:45:32,515 --> 01:45:34,335
How could I've let this happen?

1504
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,888
Hey, hey.
You okay?

1505
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:38,226
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.

1506
01:45:38,251 --> 01:45:40,703
It's your fault. It's everyone's fault.
Who cares?

1507
01:45:40,728 --> 01:45:42,293
Are you up for this?

1508
01:45:42,318 --> 01:45:43,730
Are you?

1509
01:45:43,907 --> 01:45:47,224
Look. I just need to know.
Because the city... it's flying.

1510
01:45:47,249 --> 01:45:49,217
Okay look.
The city is flying.

1511
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:51,152
We're fighting an army of robots.

1512
01:45:51,864 --> 01:45:53,439
And I have a bow and an arrow.

1513
01:45:53,464 --> 01:45:55,455
None of this makes sense.

1514
01:45:57,826 --> 01:46:00,621
I'm going back out there
cos it's my job.

1515
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:03,637
Okay.
I can't do my job and babysit.

1516
01:46:03,668 --> 01:46:06,771
Doesn't matter what you did.
Or what you were.

1517
01:46:06,796 --> 01:46:10,113
If you go out there, you fight.
And you fight to kill.

1518
01:46:10,138 --> 01:46:11,852
Stay in here, you're good.

1519
01:46:11,877 --> 01:46:15,296
I'll send your brother to come and find you.
But if you step out that door...

1520
01:46:15,632 --> 01:46:17,550
...  you are an Avenger.

1521
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:23,535
Alright.
Let's get you...

1522
01:46:27,108 --> 01:46:29,375
Yeah.
This city is flying.

1523
01:47:02,201 --> 01:47:03,541
I got you!

1524
01:47:03,853 --> 01:47:05,374
Just look at me!

1525
01:47:11,319 --> 01:47:14,173
You can't save them all. MrSeeN

1526
01:47:14,913 --> 01:47:16,422
You'll never...

1527
01:47:16,609 --> 01:47:17,923
Never what...?

1528
01:47:17,948 --> 01:47:19,701
You didn't finish...!

1529
01:47:22,789 --> 01:47:24,566
What?
Were you napping?

1530
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:46,397
Damn.

1531
01:47:46,422 --> 01:47:47,664
Thor...

1532
01:47:49,227 --> 01:47:51,470
You've been bothering me.

1533
01:47:59,543 --> 01:48:00,661
Aw!

1534
01:48:26,686 --> 01:48:29,315
- Alright, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!

1535
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,100
We are very not clear!

1536
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:34,790
Alright, coming to you.

1537
01:48:35,347 --> 01:48:37,148
Keep up, old man.

1538
01:48:39,115 --> 01:48:40,978
Nobody would know.

1539
01:48:41,389 --> 01:48:42,891
Nobody.

1540
01:48:44,512 --> 01:48:47,209
The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1541
01:48:47,234 --> 01:48:51,179
Yeah, he'll be missed.
That quick little bastard, I miss him already.

1542
01:49:05,993 --> 01:49:08,642
Hold your fire...!

1543
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,492
Romanoff!

1544
01:49:18,613 --> 01:49:19,731
Thanks.

1545
01:49:29,004 --> 01:49:32,962
<font color="#f28ffa">The anti gravs are ready to flip.</font> <font color="#f28ffa">Touch
them and they'll go full reverse thrust.</font>

1546
01:49:32,987 --> 01:49:36,147
- <font color="#f28ffa">The city is not coming down slowly.</font>
- The spire is vibranium.

1547
01:49:36,172 --> 01:49:38,049
- If I get Thor to hit it.
- <font color="#f28ffa">It will crack.</font>

1548
01:49:38,074 --> 01:49:40,442
<font color="#f28ffa">That's not enough.
The impact would still be devastating.</font>

1549
01:49:40,467 --> 01:49:43,843
Maybe we can cap the other end.
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1550
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,823
<font color="#f28ffa">That could vaporize the city...</font>

1551
01:49:45,934 --> 01:49:47,637
<font color="#f28ffa">... and everyone on it.</font>

1552
01:49:53,881 --> 01:49:55,651
The next wave is going to hit any minute.

1553
01:49:55,676 --> 01:49:58,190
- What you got, Stark?
- Oh, nothing great.

1554
01:49:58,452 --> 01:50:00,496
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1555
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:03,548
Have to keep it from impacting the
surface if you guys can get clear.

1556
01:50:03,573 --> 01:50:05,832
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1557
01:50:05,857 --> 01:50:08,391
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1558
01:50:08,746 --> 01:50:10,605
We have to make a choice.

1559
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:13,050
Cap.
These people are going nowhere.

1560
01:50:13,209 --> 01:50:16,396
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not until everyone's safe.

1561
01:50:16,421 --> 01:50:19,132
Everyone up here verses everyone down there.

1562
01:50:19,157 --> 01:50:21,656
- There's no math there.
- I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1563
01:50:21,681 --> 01:50:23,391
I didn't say we should leave.

1564
01:50:25,756 --> 01:50:27,737
There's worse ways to go.

1565
01:50:32,537 --> 01:50:35,113
Where else am I going to get a view like this?

1566
01:50:36,811 --> 01:50:39,210
Glad you like the view Romanoff.

1567
01:50:39,235 --> 01:50:41,153
It's about to get better.

1568
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,154
Nice,
Right?

1569
01:51:06,179 --> 01:51:08,811
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1570
01:51:08,836 --> 01:51:10,826
She's dusty.
But... she'll do.

1571
01:51:10,851 --> 01:51:12,566
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1572
01:51:12,591 --> 01:51:14,640
Uhu..
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1573
01:51:14,665 --> 01:51:17,313
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1574
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:18,840
Life boats secure to deploy.

1575
01:51:18,865 --> 01:51:22,248
Disengage in...
3... 2...

1576
01:51:22,923 --> 01:51:24,288
Take 'em out.

1577
01:51:33,203 --> 01:51:34,815
This is Shield?

1578
01:51:35,177 --> 01:51:37,419
This is what Shield's supposed to be.

1579
01:51:39,085 --> 01:51:40,744
This is not so bad.

1580
01:51:43,773 --> 01:51:45,383
Let's load them up.

1581
01:51:50,824 --> 01:51:54,534
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.

1582
01:51:54,684 --> 01:51:56,519
Show them what we got.

1583
01:51:56,646 --> 01:51:57,814
You're up.

1584
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,685
Yes!

1585
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:06,216
Now this is going to be a good story.

1586
01:52:08,366 --> 01:52:10,660
Yup...
If you live to tell it.

1587
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,557
You think I can't hold my own?

1588
01:52:12,582 --> 01:52:14,272
We get through this.
I'll hold your own.

1589
01:52:14,297 --> 01:52:16,224
You had to make it weird.

1590
01:52:40,898 --> 01:52:43,393
Okay. Here we go, here we go.
Lets move.

1591
01:52:46,237 --> 01:52:48,382
Number six boat is topped and locked.

1592
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:50,637
Or uh, or uh..
stuffed... topped...

1593
01:52:50,662 --> 01:52:53,272
Its..
It's uh... full of people.

1594
01:52:54,553 --> 01:52:56,320
Incoming!

1595
01:52:58,445 --> 01:53:00,129
Oh... god...!

1596
01:53:10,178 --> 01:53:12,315
<font color="#8abaf4">You think you're saving anyone?</font>

1597
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:18,036
<font color="#8abaf4">I turn that key and drop this rock a little early,
and it's still billions dead.</font>

1598
01:53:18,061 --> 01:53:19,513
<font color="#8abaf4">Even you can't stop that.</font>

1599
01:53:19,538 --> 01:53:24,320
<font color="#8abaf4">I am Thor... Son of Odin...
And as long as there’s life in my breast...</font>

1600
01:53:24,345 --> 01:53:27,086
<font color="#8abaf4">I am running out of things to say.</font>

1601
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:28,391
<font color="#8abaf4">Are you ready?</font>

1602
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:36,905
It's terribly well balanced.

1603
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:40,464
Well, if there's too much weight you lose power
on the swing.  So...

1604
01:53:41,239 --> 01:53:42,528
I got it.

1605
01:53:42,553 --> 01:53:44,615
Create a heat seal.

1606
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:47,780
I can...
I can supercharge the spiral from below.

1607
01:53:47,805 --> 01:53:49,304
<font color="#f28ffa">Running numbers.</font>

1608
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:01,537
<font color="#f28ffa">A heat seal could work with enough power.</font>

1609
01:54:01,562 --> 01:54:03,731
- Thor...  I got a plan.
- We're out of time.

1610
01:54:03,756 --> 01:54:04,996
They're coming for the core.

1611
01:54:05,021 --> 01:54:07,453
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1612
01:54:07,478 --> 01:54:10,177
Avengers.
Time to work for a living.

1613
01:54:19,205 --> 01:54:21,232
- You good?
- Yeah.

1614
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:23,097
Romanoff?

1615
01:54:23,122 --> 01:54:25,795
You and Banner better not be
playing hide the zucchini!

1616
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:27,137
Relax, shell-head.

1617
01:54:27,162 --> 01:54:29,113
Not all of us can fly.

1618
01:54:34,053 --> 01:54:36,231
- What's the drill?
- This... is the drill.

1619
01:54:36,256 --> 01:54:38,970
If Ultron gets a hand on the core.
We lose...

1620
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:44,875
Is that the best you can do!

1621
01:54:54,622 --> 01:54:56,092
You had to ask.

1622
01:54:56,117 --> 01:54:58,771
<font color="#8abaf4">This... is the best I can do.</font>

1623
01:54:58,796 --> 01:55:00,794
<font color="#8abaf4">This is exactly what I wanted.</font>

1624
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:04,160
<font color="#8abaf4">All of you.
Against all of me.</font>

1625
01:55:04,185 --> 01:55:06,843
<font color="#8abaf4">How can you possibly hope to stop me?</font>

1626
01:55:07,972 --> 01:55:10,034
Like the old man said...

1627
01:55:10,621 --> 01:55:11,907
... together.

1628
01:56:40,266 --> 01:56:41,266
<font color="#8abaf4">You...</font>

1629
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:43,357
<font color="#8abaf4">With the benefit of hindsight...</font>

1630
01:56:51,816 --> 01:56:54,582
- They are trying to leave the city.
- We can't let them. Not even one.

1631
01:56:54,607 --> 01:56:56,407
- Rhodey!
- I'm on it.

1632
01:56:56,655 --> 01:56:58,490
Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1633
01:56:58,515 --> 01:57:00,994
War machine coming at you, right.

1634
01:57:07,014 --> 01:57:08,636
Okay.
What...

1635
01:57:08,661 --> 01:57:09,590
We got to move out.

1636
01:57:09,615 --> 01:57:12,170
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.
You  guys get to the boats.

1637
01:57:12,219 --> 01:57:14,336
I'll sweep for stragglers.
 Be right behind you.

1638
01:57:14,361 --> 01:57:15,968
What about the core?

1639
01:57:15,993 --> 01:57:17,566
I'll protect it.

1640
01:57:18,828 --> 01:57:20,066
It's my job.

1641
01:57:21,304 --> 01:57:22,305
Nat.

1642
01:57:22,347 --> 01:57:23,389
This way.

1643
01:57:27,685 --> 01:57:29,083
Get the people on the boats.

1644
01:57:29,108 --> 01:57:31,686
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I can handle these.

1645
01:57:33,358 --> 01:57:36,194
Come back for me when everyone else is off.
Not before.

1646
01:57:36,569 --> 01:57:38,027
You understand?

1647
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:41,491
You know...
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1648
01:57:41,532 --> 01:57:42,629
Go.

1649
01:57:43,963 --> 01:57:46,701
- <font color="#f28ffa">Boss, power levels are way below...</font>
- Reroute everything.

1650
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:48,407
We got one shot at this.

1651
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:54,090
I know what I need to do.

1652
01:57:54,438 --> 01:57:55,647
Dining room.

1653
01:57:55,672 --> 01:57:57,439
I'll knock out that east wall.

1654
01:57:57,464 --> 01:57:59,685
Make a nice work space for Laura.

1655
01:58:00,589 --> 01:58:01,987
Put up some baffling.

1656
01:58:02,012 --> 01:58:04,034
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1657
01:58:04,059 --> 01:58:05,510
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1658
01:58:05,535 --> 01:58:07,296
No one eats in the dining room.

1659
01:58:12,684 --> 01:58:14,406
We don't have a lot of time.

1660
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:16,185
So get your ass on a boat.

1661
01:58:29,247 --> 01:58:30,623
Hey.
Big guy.

1662
01:58:32,055 --> 01:58:33,963
The sun is getting real low.

1663
01:58:41,235 --> 01:58:42,361
Kostya?

1664
01:58:43,527 --> 01:58:45,307
We were in the market.

1665
01:58:45,649 --> 01:58:46,775
Kostya!

1666
01:59:00,737 --> 01:59:02,917
Thor.
I'm going to need you back in the church.

1667
01:59:02,942 --> 01:59:04,615
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1668
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:05,978
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1669
01:59:06,003 --> 01:59:07,645
You know.
If this works...

1670
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:09,574
We maybe don't walk away.

1671
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:11,391
Maybe not.

1672
01:59:29,998 --> 01:59:33,627
<font color="#8abaf4">I've got no strings.
So I have fun.</font>

1673
01:59:33,853 --> 01:59:36,836
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm not tied up to anyone.</font>

1674
02:00:11,815 --> 02:00:13,920
You didn't see that coming.

1675
02:01:10,018 --> 02:01:12,343
<font color="#8abaf4">Oh,
for God's sake!</font>

1676
02:01:42,315 --> 02:01:44,872
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm alright.

1677
02:01:46,394 --> 02:01:48,587
It's been a long day.

1678
02:02:03,004 --> 02:02:04,380
<font color="#8abaf4">Wanda.</font>

1679
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:07,101
<font color="#8abaf4">If you stay here...</font>

1680
02:02:07,126 --> 02:02:09,164
<font color="#8abaf4">You'll die...</font>

1681
02:02:09,592 --> 02:02:11,283
I just did.

1682
02:02:11,868 --> 02:02:14,093
Do you know how I felt...?

1683
02:02:27,568 --> 02:02:29,823
It felt like that...

1684
02:03:04,995 --> 02:03:06,876
Thor.
On my mark.

1685
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,361
Now!

1686
02:03:50,735 --> 02:03:52,070
Hey.
Big guy.

1687
02:03:52,569 --> 02:03:53,987
We did it.

1688
02:03:54,181 --> 02:03:55,840
The job's finished.

1689
02:03:56,056 --> 02:03:58,667
Now I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?

1690
02:04:03,134 --> 02:04:05,744
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1691
02:04:06,925 --> 02:04:08,641
So help me out.

1692
02:04:08,666 --> 02:04:10,235
I need you to...

1693
02:04:54,582 --> 02:04:56,493
You're afraid.

1694
02:04:56,592 --> 02:04:58,278
<font color="#8abaf4">Of you?</font>

1695
02:04:58,386 --> 02:04:59,921
Of death.

1696
02:05:00,304 --> 02:05:02,121
You're the last one.

1697
02:05:02,381 --> 02:05:04,883
<font color="#8abaf4">You're supposed to be the last.</font>

1698
02:05:04,931 --> 02:05:07,605
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark asked for a savior.</font>

1699
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:10,216
<font color="#8abaf4">And settled for a slave.</font>

1700
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:13,137
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1701
02:05:14,935 --> 02:05:16,937
<font color="#8abaf4">I suppose we are.</font>

1702
02:05:16,962 --> 02:05:18,732
Humans are odd.

1703
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,542
They think order and chaos are
somehow opposites and...

1704
02:05:25,413 --> 02:05:28,098
Try to control what won't be.

1705
02:05:28,232 --> 02:05:30,901
But there's grace in their failings.

1706
02:05:31,206 --> 02:05:33,403
I think you've missed that.

1707
02:05:33,626 --> 02:05:35,832
<font color="#8abaf4">They're doomed.</font>

1708
02:05:35,857 --> 02:05:36,974
Yes...

1709
02:05:41,045 --> 02:05:44,859
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1710
02:05:46,392 --> 02:05:48,407
It's a privilege to be among them.

1711
02:05:48,432 --> 02:05:51,257
<font color="#8abaf4">You're unbearably naive.</font>

1712
02:05:51,282 --> 02:05:52,613
Well...

1713
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:56,891
I was born yesterday.

1714
02:06:46,438 --> 02:06:47,796
- New Avengers Facility -

1715
02:06:47,821 --> 02:06:50,201
- New Avengers Facility
 Upstate New York -

1716
02:07:09,332 --> 02:07:11,494
Say hi to your Auntie Nat.

1717
02:07:12,377 --> 02:07:13,494
Sad.

1718
02:07:14,272 --> 02:07:16,867
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1719
02:07:16,892 --> 02:07:19,399
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1720
02:07:20,403 --> 02:07:22,071
Could be the Quin jet.

1721
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:26,320
But with Stark's stealth tech we
still can't track the damn thing.

1722
02:07:26,994 --> 02:07:28,113
Right.

1723
02:07:28,869 --> 02:07:31,764
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1724
02:07:32,387 --> 02:07:34,296
He'll send a postcard.

1725
02:07:34,346 --> 02:07:36,066
Wish you were here.

1726
02:07:38,421 --> 02:07:40,265
You sent me to recruit him.

1727
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:41,875
Way back when.

1728
02:07:43,259 --> 02:07:45,843
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1729
02:07:48,128 --> 02:07:50,026
You never know.

1730
02:07:50,337 --> 02:07:51,804
You hope for the best

1731
02:07:51,829 --> 02:07:53,978
And make do with what you get.

1732
02:07:54,225 --> 02:07:56,074
I got a great team.

1733
02:07:56,814 --> 02:07:58,858
Nothing lasts forever.

1734
02:07:59,145 --> 02:08:01,296
Trouble.
Miss Romanoff.

1735
02:08:01,321 --> 02:08:03,090
No matter who wins or loses.

1736
02:08:03,115 --> 02:08:05,224
Trouble still comes around.

1737
02:08:08,661 --> 02:08:11,272
- The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.

1738
02:08:11,297 --> 02:08:14,077
- Well the Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1739
02:08:14,117 --> 02:08:17,517
- So it doesn't count?
- No, it's not  like a person lifting the hammer.

1740
02:08:17,558 --> 02:08:19,582
Right. Different rules for us.
Nice guy.

1741
02:08:19,607 --> 02:08:20,565
- Artificial.
- Thank you

1742
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:23,551
He can wield the hammer.
He can keep the mind stone.

1743
02:08:24,266 --> 02:08:26,478
It's safe with the Vision.

1744
02:08:26,602 --> 02:08:29,312
These days safe is in short supply.

1745
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:33,931
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator.
- It would still go up.

1746
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:36,883
- Elevator's not worthy.
- I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

1747
02:08:36,908 --> 02:08:38,661
Not if you don't leave.

1748
02:08:38,832 --> 02:08:40,486
I have no choice.

1749
02:08:40,566 --> 02:08:44,566
The mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones
 to show up in the last few years.

1750
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:46,383
It's not a coincidence.

1751
02:08:46,906 --> 02:08:50,593
Someone has been playing intricate games.
And has made pawns of us.

1752
02:08:50,618 --> 02:08:52,661
Once all these pieces are in position...

1753
02:08:52,686 --> 02:08:54,222
Triple Yahtzee?

1754
02:08:54,247 --> 02:08:57,113
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.

1755
02:08:57,647 --> 02:09:01,566
Besides this one.
There's nothing that can't be explained.

1756
02:09:08,856 --> 02:09:11,897
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1757
02:09:14,634 --> 02:09:15,929
I'm going to miss him though.

1758
02:09:15,954 --> 02:09:17,509
And you're going to miss me.

1759
02:09:17,534 --> 02:09:19,772
There's going to be a lot of manful tears.

1760
02:09:20,999 --> 02:09:22,834
I will miss you, Tony.

1761
02:09:22,859 --> 02:09:24,074
Yeah?

1762
02:09:24,099 --> 02:09:26,843
Well.
It's time for me to tap out.

1763
02:09:26,904 --> 02:09:30,716
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm.

1764
02:09:30,741 --> 02:09:32,751
Hope nobody blows it up.

1765
02:09:32,828 --> 02:09:34,271
A simple life.

1766
02:09:34,296 --> 02:09:35,892
You'll get there one day.

1767
02:09:35,917 --> 02:09:36,969
I don't know.

1768
02:09:36,994 --> 02:09:38,304
Family...

1769
02:09:38,329 --> 02:09:39,804
Stability...

1770
02:09:40,315 --> 02:09:43,836
Guy who wanted all that,
 went into the ice 75 years ago.

1771
02:09:45,125 --> 02:09:47,207
I think someone else came out.

1772
02:09:51,262 --> 02:09:52,671
You alright?

1773
02:09:54,724 --> 02:09:56,131
I'm home.

1774
02:10:04,003 --> 02:10:06,724
Wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you want to go to work?

1775
02:10:06,897 --> 02:10:08,474
I mean it's a pretty interesting wall.

1776
02:10:08,499 --> 02:10:11,351
Thought you and Tony were still
gazing into each others eyes.

1777
02:10:11,717 --> 02:10:12,884
How do we look?

1778
02:10:12,909 --> 02:10:15,191
Well we're not the 27th Yankees.

1779
02:10:15,216 --> 02:10:17,034
We got some batters.

1780
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:19,687
They're good.
But not a team.

1781
02:10:19,712 --> 02:10:21,534
Let's beat them into shape.

1782
02:10:39,769 --> 02:10:41,145
Avengers....!

1783
02:10:43,479 --> 02:10:48,519
