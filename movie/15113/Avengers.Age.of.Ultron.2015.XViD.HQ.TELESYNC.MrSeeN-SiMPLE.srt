2
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:36,394
<i>Report to your stations immediately.</i>

3
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,299
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

4
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,828
<i>We're under attack.</i>
(Let's go! Let's go!)

5
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:43,109
<i>We're under attack.</i>

6
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:44,704
Shit!  Its MrSeeN

7
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,101
Language.

8
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:48,171
Jarvis what's the view from upstairs?

9
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:51,593
<font color="#f9ca68">The central building is protected by some kind of
energy shield.</font>

10
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:56,045
<font color="#f9ca68">Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other hydra base we've taken.</font>

11
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,983
Loki's scepter must be here.

12
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,510
Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it.

13
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,575
At long last.

14
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,584
At long last is lasting a little long.
Boys.

15
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:24,807
Yeah.

16
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,077
I think we lost the
element of surprise.

17
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,410
Wait a second. No one else is going to deal
with the fact that Cap just said...

18
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,553
... language.

19
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,942
I know...

20
00:02:40,237 --> 00:02:41,788
Just slipped out.

21
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:46,034
- Hydra Research Base
Sokovia, Eastern Europe -

22
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,902
Who gave the order to attack?

23
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,180
Herr Strucker.
It's the Avengers.

24
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,331
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

25
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,839
They have to be after the scepter.

26
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,426
Can we hold them?

27
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:59,823
They're the Avengers.

28
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,680
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

29
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,521
Concentrate fire
on the weak ones.

30
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:06,817
A hit,
can make them close ranks.

31
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,823
Everything we've accomplished.

32
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,934
We're on the verge of our
greatest breakthrough.

33
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,359
Then lets show them what
we've accomplished.

34
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,515
Send out the twins.

35
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,407
It's too soon.

36
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:21,005
It's what they signed up for.

37
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,181
My men can hold them.

38
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:33,336
Sir,
the city is taking fire.

39
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,306
Well, we know Strucker isn't going to
worry about civilian casualties.

40
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,748
Send in the iron legion.

41
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,915
This quadrant is unsafe.

42
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,534
Please back away.

43
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,407
We are here to help.

44
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,157
This quadrant is unsafe.

45
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,624
Please back away.

46
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,495
Please back away.

47
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,300
We wish to avoid collateral damage.

48
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:02,379
And will respond with restraint,
unofficious assault.

49
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,101
We are here to help.

50
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,707
We are here to help.

51
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,033
We will not yield.

52
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:15,055
The Americans send their..
circus freaks to test us.

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,667
We will send them back.
In bags.

54
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,902
No Surrender!

55
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,362
No surrender!

56
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm, uh... going to surrender.

57
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,902
You delete everything.

58
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:33,039
-If we give the avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far into what we've been doing.
  -The twins.

59
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,256
They're not ready to take on ...

60
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,661
No, no, I mean...

61
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,445
The twins.

62
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,109
You didn't see that coming?

63
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:13,962
Clint!

64
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,743
We have an enhanced in the field.

65
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:19,997
Clint's hit!

66
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,266
Somebody wants to deal with that bunker.

67
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:30,917
Thank you.

68
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,822
Stark.

69
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,605
We really need to get inside.

70
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:42,296
I'm closing in.

71
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:46,295
Jarvis,
am I...

72
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,808
... closing in?

73
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,847
You see a power source for that shield?

74
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:52,433
There's a passageway above the north tower.

75
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,188
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

76
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,514
Drawbridge is down people.

77
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:09,730
The enhanced?

78
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:11,177
He's a blur.

79
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,640
All the new players we've faced.
I've never seen this.

80
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,085
In fact... I still haven't.

81
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,712
Clint's hit pretty bad guys.
We're going to need evac.

82
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,664
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone the better.

83
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,259
You and Stark secure the scepter.

84
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:23,529
Copy that.

85
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,255
Target lining up.

86
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,771
Well, they're excited.

87
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,268
Find the scepter.

88
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:36,815
And for gosh sake.
Watch your language.

89
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,077
That's not going away any time soon.

90
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,346
Guys, stop.
We got to talk this through.

91
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,383
It's a good talk.

92
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,082
Oh.

93
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:57,318
Aww...!

94
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,321
Sentry mode.

95
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:04,656
Okay.
Jarvis.

96
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,393
You know.
I want it all.

97
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,712
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,124
We're locked down out here.

99
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:17,037
Then get to Banner.
Time for a lullaby.

100
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:22,053
I know you're hiding more than files.

101
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,877
Hey J.
Give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.

102
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,504
<font color="#f9ca68">The wall to your left.</font>

103
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,797
<font color="#f9ca68">I'm reading steel reinforcement.</font>

104
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:32,337
<font color="#f9ca68">And an air current.</font>

105
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,297
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door. Please be a secret door...

106
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:37,812
Yay!

107
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:54,791
Hey,
big guy.

108
00:07:58,217 --> 00:07:59,997
Sun's getting real low.

109
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:04,918
Baron Strucker.

110
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:07,236
Hydra's number one thug.

111
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,615
Technically, I'm a thug...
for Shield.

112
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,839
Well, then technically,
you're unemployed.

113
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,831
Where’s Loki's scepter?

114
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,718
Don't worry.
I know when I'm beat.

115
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:20,377
You'll mention how I cooperated.
I hope.

116
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:23,547
I'll put it right under
illegal human experimentation.

117
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,672
How many are there?

118
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,996
We have a second enhanced.

119
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,164
Female.
Do not engage.

120
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,933
You'll have to be faster than...

121
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,077
Aww...

122
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,378
Guys, I got Strucker.

123
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:44,863
Yeah,
I got...

124
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,859
...something bigger.

125
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,619
Thor.

126
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,229
I got eyes on the prize.

127
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:07,831
You could've... saved... us....

128
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,698
Why didn't...
you do more?

129
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,989
You're just going to let them take it?

130
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,767
Hey,
the lullaby worked better than ever.

131
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,355
Just wasn't expecting the code green.

132
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,402
If you hadn't been there
There would've been double the casualties.

133
00:12:58,374 --> 00:13:00,014
My best friend would have been a...

134
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,601
...treasured memory.

135
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:05,910
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear.
Isn't exactly what I want to hear.

136
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,919
How long before you trust me?

137
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,774
Thor, report on the Hulk.

138
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,521
The gates of hell are filled with the screams
of his victims.

139
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:23,347
Uh, but not the screams of the dead of course.
No, no, uh...

140
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:26,513
Wounded screams. Mainly whimpering.
A great deal of complaining.

141
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:30,712
and tales of sprained deltoids.
And eh, the gout.

142
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,053
Hey Banner.

143
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,236
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

144
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,878
- Uh yeah. She knows her way around.
- Thanks.

145
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:40,220
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton is going to need the full treatment

146
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,434
- <font color="#f9ca68">Very good, sir.</font>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

147
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:43,648
<font color="#f9ca68">Yes, sir.</font>

148
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,101
<font color="#f9ca68">Approach vector is locked.</font>

149
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:48,307
(Jarvis is my co-pilot)
It feels good, yeah?

150
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,696
We've been after this thing
since Shield collapsed.

151
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,635
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties.
But...

152
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,672
No, but this...
this brings it to a close.

153
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,180
As soon as we find out what else
this has been used for.

154
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,601
May not just been weapons.

155
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,815
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement.

156
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,217
Banner and I will give it the once-over
before it goes back to Asgard.

157
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:05,638
Is that cool with you?

158
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:08,271
It's just a few days till the farewell party.

159
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,857
You're staying,
right?

160
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,290
Yes, yes, of course.
Victory should be honored with revels.

161
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,323
Yeah.
Who doesn't love revels.

162
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:19,077
-Captain.
- Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra. So...

163
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,926
Yes,
revels.

164
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:55,940
Lab's all set up
boss.

165
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:57,135
Uh, actually he's the boss.

166
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,321
I just pay for everything and design everything,
and make everyone look cooler

167
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:02,682
What's the word on Strucker?

168
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:04,610
- NATO has got him.
- The two enhanced?

169
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:07,363
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff.
Twins.

170
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:10,553
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed
their apartment building.

171
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,116
Sokovia has had a rough history

172
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:15,030
It's nowhere special, but...

173
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,632
it's on the way to
everywhere special.

174
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:17,720
Their abilities?

175
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:21,006
He's got increased metabolism and
improved thermal homeostasis.

176
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:25,505
Her thing is neuro-electric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

177
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,085
He's fast and she's weird.

178
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,284
Well, they're going
to show up again.

179
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,347
Agreed.

180
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,278
File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments.

181
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,638
It's nuts.

182
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:41,164
Right. What kind of monster would let a German
scientist experiment on them to protect their country.

183
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,491
We're not at war, Captain.

184
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:44,851
They are.

185
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,151
How's he doing?

186
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,845
Unfortunately,
he's still Barton.

187
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:20,695
He's fine, just thirsty.

188
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,386
Alright, look alive Jarvis.
It's play time.

189
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:27,414
We only got a couple of days with this joy stick,
so let's make the most of it.

190
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:31,105
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

191
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,485
<font color="#f9ca68">The scepter is alien.</font>

192
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,866
<font color="#f9ca68">There are elements I can't quantify.</font>

193
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,340
So there's elements you can.

194
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,966
<font color="#f9ca68">The jewel appears to be a protective
housing for something inside.</font>

195
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,815
<font color="#f9ca68">Something powerful.</font>

196
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,101
- Like a reactor?
- <font color="#f9ca68">Like a computer.</font>

197
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:48,688
<font color="#f9ca68">I believe I can cypher the code.</font>

198
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,910
You sure he's going to be okay?

199
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,823
Pretending we need this guy
really brings the team together.

200
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,527
There's no possibility of deterioration.

201
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,601
The nano molecular functionality is instantaneous.

202
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,799
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum

203
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,942
She's creating tissue.

204
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:10,093
If you brought him to my lab,
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

205
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:12,331
Oh, he's flat-lining.
Call it, time?

206
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,855
No, no, no.
I'm going to live forever.

207
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,775
- I'm going to be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.

208
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,696
You'll be made of you,
Mr. Barton.

209
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,675
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

210
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,010
Well,
I haven't a girlfriend.

211
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:24,687
That,
I can't fix.

212
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,718
This is the next thing,
Tony.

213
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:29,402
Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

214
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:31,602
That is exactly the plan.

215
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,563
And Helen.
I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

216
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,283
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

217
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,037
Will.
Thor... be there?

218
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,259
- What's the rumpus?
- Well.

219
00:17:44,404 --> 00:17:45,791
The scepter.

220
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,363
You see. We were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

221
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:52,402
So, I've been analyzing the gem.

222
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:53,997
inside.

223
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,005
You may recognize.

224
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,593
- Jarvis?
- <font color="#f7df82">Doctor.</font>

225
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,204
Started out.
Jarvis was just a natural language UI

226
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,799
Now he runs an Iron Legion.

227
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,926
He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh

228
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:09,386
Top of the line.

229
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:12,088
- Yes.
- <font color="#f7df82">I suspect not for long.</font>

230
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:13,863
Meet the competition.

231
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,411
It's beautiful.

232
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:23,402
- If you had to guess. What's it looks like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

233
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:26,140
You mean this could be a...

234
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,799
It's... it's not a human mind.

235
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,870
I mean look at this...

236
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,180
They're like neurons firing.

237
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:37,818
Down at Strucker's lab.
I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

238
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:40,111
They deep sixed the data but ...

239
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,492
I got to guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.

240
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,878
Artificial intelligence.

241
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,763
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

242
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,599
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

243
00:18:57,624 --> 00:18:59,168
Yesterday it was.

244
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,656
If we can harness this power.

245
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,450
Apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

246
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,450
That's a man-sized if.

247
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,672
Our job is if.

248
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:11,911
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun drenched beach

249
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,257
turning brown instead of green.

250
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:16,701
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

251
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,688
Don't hate.
I helped design Veronica.

252
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:22,013
As a worse case measure, right?
How about a best case?

253
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:24,275
What if the world was safe?

254
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,672
What if next time aliens roll up to the club.
And they will.

255
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,331
They couldn't get past the bouncer.

256
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:32,315
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

257
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,175
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.

258
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,053
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic
this dense.

259
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,902
We can only do it while we have the scepter here.
That's 3 days, give me 3 days.

260
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:45,228
So you're going for artificial intelligence
and you don't want to tell the team?

261
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:49,409
Right. That's right, you know why?
Cause we don't have time for a city hall debate.

262
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,077
I don't want to hear the
'Man Was Not Meant to Meddle' medley.

263
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,745
I see a suit of armor around the world.

264
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,990
Sounds like a cold world,
Tony.

265
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,932
I've seen colder.

266
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,577
This one is very...
vulnerable blue one.

267
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,434
It needs Ultron.

268
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,431
Peace in our time.

269
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,637
Imagine that.

270
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,101
What did we miss?

May I... May I...</font>

311
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,081
Come back, come back,
come back.

312
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,811
Well you know.
The suit can take the weight, right?

313
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:18,674
So I take the tank.
Fly it right up to the general's palace.

314
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:22,777
Drop it at his feet.
I'm like, boom! You looking for this?

315
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,139
Boom! Are you looking...

316
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,465
Why do I even talk to you guys?
Everywhere else that story kills.

317
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,938
- That's the whole story?
- Yeah. War Machine story.

318
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:34,759
Oh, it was very good then.

319
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:36,347
It's impressive.

320
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,910
Quality save.

321
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,854
So, no Pepper?
She's not coming?

322
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:44,180
Hey, what about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

323
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,643
Oh, Miss Potts has a
company to run.

324
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,069
Yes,
I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

325
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:52,276
Her work on the convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

326
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:55,640
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate on earth.

327
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:56,775
It's pretty exciting.

328
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:59,196
There's even talk of Jane getting a...
um...

329
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,388
a Nobel Prize?

330
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:05,085
Yeah, they must be busy because
they hate missing you guys get together.

331
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:06,648
- Testosterone.
- Oh my god.

332
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:08,442
- Oh, excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?

333
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,585
But Jane's better.

334
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,295
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

335
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,212
If I had known it was going to be a fire fight,
I absolutely would have called.

336
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,069
No, I'm not actually sorry.

337
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm just trying to sound tough.

338
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:26,355
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.

339
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,720
Avenging is your world.

340
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:32,036
Your world is crazy.

341
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:33,870
Be it ever so humble.

342
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:37,736
- You found a place in Brooklyn yet?
- I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

343
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:40,005
Well home is home,
you know.

344
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,783
I fly it right up to the general's palace.
I dropped it at his feet.

345
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:48,005
I'm like, Boom!
You looking for this?

346
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,252
- I got to have some of that.
- Oh. No, no, no...

347
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:59,117
See this.
This is aged for a thousand years.

348
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:01,982
The barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet.

349
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:03,983
It's not meant for mortal men.

350
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:06,323
Neither was Omaha Beach,
Blondie.

351
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:09,005
Stop trying to scare us.
Come on.

352
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,269
Alright.

353
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,944
Excelsior...

354
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:28,614
How a nice girl like you wind up
working in a dump like this?

355
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:31,566
A fella done me wrong

356
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,743
Got a lousy taste in men,
too.

357
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,312
He's not so bad.

358
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:40,172
He has a temper.

359
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,482
Deep down,
he's all fluff.

360
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:47,268
The fact is.
He's not like anybody I've ever known.

361
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:51,787
All my friends are fighters.

362
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,494
And here comes this guy.

363
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,751
Who spends his life avoiding the
fight because he knows he'll win.

364
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,323
Sounds amazing.

365
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,466
He's also a huge dork.

366
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,283
Chicks dig that.

367
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,610
So what do you think?
Should I...

368
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,260
... fight this?

369
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:14,997
Or run with it?

370
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,148
Run with it, right?

371
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:20,331
Or did he...  Was he...
What did he do, that's so...

372
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,743
...wrong to you?

373
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,505
Not a damn thing.

374
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:28,322
But never say never.

375
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:33,490
It's nice.

376
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,093
- What? What is?
- You and Romanov.

377
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:37,450
No, we haven’t.
That wasn't...

378
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:40,148
It's okay.
Nobody is breaking any bylaws.

379
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:42,220
It's just she's not the most...

380
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:44,553
... open person in the world.

381
00:26:44,578 --> 00:26:46,426
But with you she seemed very relaxed.

382
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,338
No.
Natasha, she's...

383
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,094
She likes to flirt.

384
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,908
I've seen her flirt.

385
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,180
up close.

386
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,003
This ain't that.

387
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,592
Look...

388
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:01,580
As maybe the world's leading authority on
waiting too long...

389
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,750
Don't.

390
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,544
You both deserve a win.

391
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,982
Wh-What do you mean up close?

392
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,736
- But it's a trick.
- No, no... it's much more than that.

393
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,470
Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.

394
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:21,640
Whatever man, it's a trick.

395
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,767
Oh please, be my guest.

396
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:25,752
- Come on.
- Really??

397
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,862
Yeah.

398
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,689
- Oh, this is going to be beautiful.
- Clint, you've got a tough week.

399
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,093
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

400
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,133
You might have seen this before,
right?

401
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:35,784
Eah!

402
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,474
Jesus...
I still don't know how you do it?

403
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:43,045
- You smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark... by all means.

404
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:45,767
- Okay.
- Oh oh.

405
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,529
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

406
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:49,807
- Get out of here.
- Here we go.

407
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,323
- It's physics
- Physics...

408
00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,900
Right, so what. If I lift it.
I.. I then rule Asgard?

409
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,283
Yes, of course.

410
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,426
I will be re-instituting
Prima Nocta.

411
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,958
Be right back.

412
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,753
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?

413
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:16,265
- Just represent, pull.
- Alright, let's go.

414
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,978
Eahh... ah...!

415
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:25,439
Huh.

416
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:32,307
Come on,
Cap.

417
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:41,942
- Ha ha.
- Nothing.

418
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:45,550
And... Widow?

419
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,781
Oh no, no.
That's not a question I need answered.

420
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,226
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king.
But it's rigged.

421
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,320
You bet your ass.

422
00:28:51,345 --> 00:28:53,313
Steve.
He said a bad language word.

423
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,559
- Did you tell everyone about this?
- The handle is imprinted, right? Like a security code?

424
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,922
Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints
is I think the literal translation.

425
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:03,702
Yes. Well that's a... that's a
very, very interesting theory.

426
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,510
I have a simpler one.

427
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,232
You're all not worthy.

428
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:10,317
- Boo...
- Come on.

429
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,113
<font color="#8fb4c9">W...or...rr...</font>

430
00:29:18,684 --> 00:29:21,089
<font color="#8fb4c9">... th... y...</font>

431
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:26,136
<font color="#8fb4c9">No.</font>

432
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:30,772
<font color="#8fb4c9">How could you be worthy?</font>

433
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,664
<font color="#8fb4c9">You're all killers.</font>

434
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,172
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

435
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:37,347
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm sorry I was asleep</font>

436
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:40,061
<font color="#8fb4c9">or...
I was a dream.</font>

437
00:29:40,086 --> 00:29:42,490
Reboot.
Legionnaire 06 got a buggy suit.

438
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:44,450
<font color="#8fb4c9">Terrible noise.</font>

439
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:46,624
<font color="#8fb4c9">and I was tangled in...</font>

440
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,191
<font color="#8fb4c9">in...</font>

441
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,386
<font color="#8fb4c9">... strings.</font>

442
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,251
<font color="#8fb4c9">Had to kill the other guy.</font>

443
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,656
- <font color="#8fb4c9">He was a good guy.</font>
- You killed someone?

444
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,720
<font color="#8fb4c9">Wouldn't have been my first call.</font>

445
00:29:57,816 --> 00:30:01,819
<font color="#8fb4c9">But down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.</font>

446
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,272
Who sent you?

447
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:06,259
I see a suit of armor around the world.

448
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,208
Ultron

449
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:11,656
<font color="#8fb4c9">In the flesh.</font>
<font color="#8fb4c9">Or no, not yet.</font>

450
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,788
<font color="#8fb4c9">Not this...
chrysalis.</font>

451
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,315
<font color="#8fb4c9">But I'm ready.</font>

452
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,238
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm on a mission.</font>

453
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,897
What mission?

454
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,397
<font color="#8fb4c9">Peace in our time.</font>

455
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:37,352
Tony!

456
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:47,631
Sorry.

457
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:49,130
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

458
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,761
- Stark!
- We are here to help.

459
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:25,023
- One sec. One sec.
- We are here to help.

460
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:35,462
Thor!

461
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:39,223
Isn't safe. Isn't safe.
Isn't safe...

462
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,748
- Come on.
- Isn't safe.

463
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:45,629
Cap!

464
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,067
<font color="#8fb4c9">That was dramatic.</font>

465
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:57,233
<font color="#8fb4c9">I'm sorry.
I know you mean well.</font>

466
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,813
<font color="#8fb4c9">You just didn't think it through.</font>

467
00:32:00,571 --> 00:32:04,742
<font color="#8fb4c9">You want to protect the world.
but you don't want it to change.</font>

468
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:09,079
<font color="#8fb4c9">How is humanity save
if it's not allowed to...</font>

469
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:11,000
<font color="#8fb4c9">...evolve?</font>

470
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,793
<font color="#8fb4c9">Look at these.</font>

471
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,968
<font color="#8fb4c9">These puppets.</font>

472
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:20,792
<font color="#8fb4c9">Only one path to peace.</font>

473
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,665
<font color="#8fb4c9">The Avengers' extinction.</font>

474
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:35,156
<font color="#8fb4c9">I had strings.
But now I'm free.</font>

475
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,680
<font color="#8fb4c9">There are no strings on me.</font>

476
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:51,132
There are no strings on me.

477
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,855
All our work is gone.

478
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,736
Ultron cleared out.
Used the internet as an escape hatch.

479
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:02,162
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
  Files, surveillance.

480
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:04,624
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

481
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,235
He's in your files. He's in the internet.

482
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,212
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting.

483
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,410
-Nuclear codes.
-Nuclear codes.

484
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:14,212
Look we need to make some calls.

485
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:15,940
Assuming we still can.

486
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:18,126
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

487
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:20,951
He didn't say dead.
He said extinct.

488
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,609
He also said he killed somebody.

489
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,688
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

490
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:26,680
Yes, there was.

491
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,829
What?

492
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,510
This is insane.

493
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:42,289
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

494
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:44,082
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

495
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:47,226
No.
Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.

496
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:49,046
This isn't strategy.

497
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,418
This is...

498
00:33:51,014 --> 00:33:52,196
... rage.

499
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:54,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

500
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:56,445
- It's going around.
- Come on use your words buddy.

501
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:59,037
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

502
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:00,982
Thor.
The Legionnaire.

503
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:06,926
Trail went cold about a hundred miles out,
though it's headed north.

504
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,783
And it has the scepter.

505
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:10,592
Now we have to retrieve it.
Again..

506
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,536
The genie is out of the bottle.

507
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:14,116
Clear and present is Ultron.

508
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:15,688
I don't understand.

509
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,299
You built this program.

510
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:21,775
Why is it trying to kill us?

511
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:29,856
You think this is funny?

512
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:31,062
No.

513
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:34,364
It's probably not,
right?

514
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,594
This is really terrible.

515
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,616
Is that so? It's..
It is. It's so terrible.

516
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:42,535
This could have been avoided if you hadn't
played with something you don't understand.

517
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,660
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

518
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:45,870
It is funny.

519
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:48,197
It's a hoot that you don't get
why we need this.

520
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:51,459
- Tony. Maybe this might not be the time to...
- Really?

521
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:52,809
That's it.

522
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,487
You just roll over show your belly.

523
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:57,573
- Every time somebody snarls.
- Only when I've created a murder bot.

524
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:58,877
We didn't.

525
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:01,172
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?

526
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:04,355
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

527
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,782
The Avengers were supposed to be
different than Shield.

528
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:09,902
Anybody remember,
when I carried a nuke through a worm hole.

529
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:10,996
- No
- It's never come up.

530
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,386
- Save New York. Never heard that.
- Recall that?

531
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:17,631
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.

532
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,926
We're standing 300 feet below it.

533
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,258
We're the Avengers.

534
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:26,160
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day but.

535
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:28,062
That up there.
That's...

536
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,256
That's the end game.

537
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,156
How are you guys planning on beating that?

538
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,204
Together.

539
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,188
We'll lose.

540
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:43,076
Then we'll do that together too.

541
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:48,758
Thor is right.
Ultron is calling us out.

542
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,600
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

543
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:53,949
The world is a big place.

544
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,212
Start making it smaller.

545
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:21,449
Talk
And if you are wasting our time.

546
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:25,267
<font color="#8abaf4">Did you know this church is in
the exact center of the city.</font>

547
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:30,851
<font color="#8abaf4">The elders decreed it so that
everyone would be equally close to God.</font>

548
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,327
<font color="#8abaf4">I like that.</font>

549
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,573
<font color="#8abaf4">The geometry of belief.</font>

550
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:39,470
<font color="#8abaf4">You're wondering why
you can't look inside my head.</font>

551
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:41,247
Sometimes it's hard.

552
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,819
But sooner or later every man shows himself.

553
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:47,710
<font color="#8abaf4">Oh I'm sure they do.</font>

554
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,092
<font color="#8abaf4">But you needed something more than a man.</font>

555
00:36:51,136 --> 00:36:53,889
<font color="#8abaf4">That's why you let Stark take the scepter.</font>

556
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:56,058
I didn't expect.

557
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,979
But I saw Stark's fear.

558
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:03,505
I knew it would could control him.
Make him self destruct.

559
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,554
<font color="#8abaf4">Everyone creates the thing they dread.</font>

560
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:09,832
<font color="#8abaf4">Men of peace create engines of war.</font>

561
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:12,260
<font color="#8abaf4">Invaders create Avengers.</font>

562
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:14,034
<font color="#8abaf4">People create...</font>

563
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:16,863
<font color="#8abaf4">... smaller people.</font>

564
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:20,516
<font color="#8abaf4">Children.
I lost the word there.</font>

565
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,885
<font color="#8abaf4">Children.</font>

566
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,370
<font color="#8abaf4">Designed to supplant them.</font>

567
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:26,212
<font color="#8abaf4">To help them...</font>

568
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:27,898
<font color="#8abaf4">... end.</font>

569
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:29,982
Is that why you've come?

570
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,545
To end the Avengers?

571
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,791
<font color="#8abaf4">I've come to save the world.</font>

572
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,098
<font color="#8abaf4">But also...</font>

573
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:37,688
<font color="#8abaf4">Yeah.</font>

574
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:42,955
<font color="#8abaf4">We'll move out right away.</font>

575
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,556
<font color="#8abaf4">This is a start.  But there's something we need
to begin the real work.</font>

576
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:47,918
All of these are...?

577
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:48,944
<font color="#8abaf4">Me.</font>

578
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,455
<font color="#8abaf4">I have what the Avengers never will,
harmony.</font>

579
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,908
<font color="#8abaf4">They're dis-coordinated.
Disconnected.</font>

580
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,394
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark's already got them turning on each other.
And when you get inside the rest of their heads.</font>

581
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,505
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

582
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,505
<font color="#8abaf4">And make them martyrs?</font>

583
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:05,394
<font color="#8abaf4">You need patience.</font>

584
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,148
<font color="#8abaf4">Need to see the big picture.</font>

585
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,204
I don't see the big picture.

586
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:11,398
I have a little picture.

587
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,696
I take it out and look at it...

588
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:15,310
... every day.

589
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,345
<font color="#8abaf4">You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.</font>

590
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,605
-The records are not the picture.
-Pietro.

591
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,077
<font color="#8abaf4">No, please.</font>

592
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:26,542
We're 10 years old.

593
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,851
Having dinner the four of us.

594
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:33,820
And the first shell hits two floors below.
Makes a hole in the floor.

595
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,510
It's big.

596
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,800
My parents go in.

597
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:42,497
And the whole building starts
coming apart.

598
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,497
I grabbed her.

599
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:47,275
Rolled under the bed
and the second shell hits.

600
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,537
But it doesn't go off.

601
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,252
It just...
sits there in the rubble.

602
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:58,791
3 feet from our faces.

603
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:03,285
And on the side of the shell...
is painted one word.

604
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,831
Stark.

605
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,126
We were trapped for 2 days.

606
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:13,069
Every effort to save us.
Every shift in the bricks.

607
00:39:13,094 --> 00:39:15,997
I think...
This will set it off.

608
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:21,744
We wait for 2 days
for Tony Stark...

609
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,315
... to kill us.

610
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:27,220
I know what they are.

611
00:39:28,043 --> 00:39:32,632
<font color="#8abaf4">I wondered why only you 2
survived Strucker's experiments.</font>

612
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,243
<font color="#8abaf4">Now I don't.</font>

613
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:36,306
<font color="#8abaf4">We will make it right.</font>

614
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:38,862
<font color="#8abaf4">You and I can hurt them.</font>

615
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,831
<font color="#8abaf4">But you...</font>

616
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:43,656
<font color="#8abaf4">... will tear them apart.</font>

617
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,791
<font color="#8abaf4">From the inside.</font>

618
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:54,450
He's all over the globe.

619
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,902
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

620
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:02,053
Reports of the metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.

621
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,299
Fatalities?

622
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:04,601
Only when engaged.

623
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:07,923
Most of the guys left in a fugue state.
Going on about old memories...

624
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,894
... worst fears and something too fast to see.

625
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,504
Maximoffs.

626
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:15,521
Well, it makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.

627
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,259
Not any more.

628
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:23,950
Negative.
I answer to you.

629
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:25,642
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:28,038
Barton.
Might have something.

631
00:40:28,063 --> 00:40:29,168
Got to go.

632
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,482
Who's that?

633
00:40:31,106 --> 00:40:32,577
Girlfriend.

634
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:36,378
What's this?

635
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,488
A message.

636
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,057
Ultron killed Strucker.

637
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,993
And he did a banksy at the crime scene.
Just for us.

638
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:44,671
This is a smoke screen.

639
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:46,990
Why send a message when you've just given a speech.

640
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:49,798
Strucker knew something that
Ultron wanted us to miss.

641
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,950
I bet he...
Yeah...

642
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:54,212
Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

643
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:55,601
Not everything.

644
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,767
Known associates.

645
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,720
Strucker had a lot of friends.

646
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,577
Are all these people all horrible?

647
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:05,164
Wait...
I know that guy.

648
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,381
Back in the day he operates off the African coast.
Black market arms dealer.

649
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:14,402
There are conventions, alright.
I meet people, I didn’t sell him anything.

650
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,013
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer.
It was all very... Ahab.

651
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:21,736
- This
- Uh, this is a tattoo. I don't think he had it.

652
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,490
No, those are tattoos.
This is a brand.

653
00:41:25,563 --> 00:41:28,222
Oh yeah.
A word in an African dialect.

654
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:31,363
Meaning... thief.
In a much less friendly way.

655
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,323
- What dialect?
- Warkin nada.

656
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:35,664
Wa...wa...
Wakanda.

657
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,029
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods.

658
00:41:39,054 --> 00:41:40,728
I thought your father said
he got the last of it?

659
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:43,513
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?

660
00:41:45,055 --> 00:41:47,156
The strongest metal on earth.

661
00:41:48,343 --> 00:41:50,275
Where is this guy now?

662
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:53,497
- Salvage Yard -

663
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:55,712
- Salvage Yard
 African Coast -

664
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,121
Don't tell me you're late.

665
00:42:17,146 --> 00:42:22,179
I sent you six short range heat seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

666
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:26,998
Now, you will make it right or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

667
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:32,279
Now, Minister.
Where were we?

668
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,385
Yeah.

669
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:06,196
The enhanced.

670
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:08,783
Strucker's prize pupils.

671
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:13,111
Want a candy?

672
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,159
Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker.

673
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,668
But then he knew what kind of
world he was hoping to create.

674
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:23,612
Human life.
Not a growth market.

675
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,740
You...
You didn't know?

676
00:43:27,764 --> 00:43:31,632
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

677
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:34,521
I'm afraid.
Not that afraid.

678
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:36,837
Everybody is afraid of something.

679
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:38,490
Cuttlefish.

680
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,671
Deep sea fish.

681
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,045
They make lights.
Disco lights.

682
00:43:43,796 --> 00:43:46,783
To hypnotize their prey.
And then... woop!

683
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:49,418
I saw a documentary and was terrified.

684
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,269
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain.

685
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:00,729
And make me see a giant cuttlefish.

686
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:05,170
Then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.

687
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:07,132
And I only deal...

688
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:09,728
With the man in charge.

689
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:11,601
Aww...

690
00:44:14,232 --> 00:44:17,085
<font color="#8abaf4">There is no man in charge.</font>

691
00:44:19,694 --> 00:44:21,900
<font color="#8abaf4">Let's talk business.</font>

692
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:38,220
<font color="#8abaf4">"... upon this rock I will build My church..."</font>

693
00:44:39,493 --> 00:44:41,180
<font color="#8abaf4">Vibranium.</font>

694
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:43,093
You know.

695
00:44:43,118 --> 00:44:46,616
It came at great personal cost.

696
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:48,601
It's worth billions.

697
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:54,720
<font color="#8abaf4">Now so are you.</font>

698
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:59,680
<font color="#8abaf4">It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.</font>

699
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:04,004
<font color="#8abaf4">Well I always say.
Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich...</font>

700
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:07,005
<font color="#8abaf4">and wait to find out which is which.</font>

701
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,773
Stark.

702
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:12,037
<font color="#8abaf4">What?</font>

703
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:14,394
Tony Stark used to say that.

704
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:16,712
To me.

705
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:18,831
You're one of his.

706
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:21,180
<font color="#8abaf4">What?
I am not.</font>

707
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:24,005
<font color="#8abaf4">I am not.</font>

708
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,352
<font color="#8abaf4">You think I'm one of Stark's puppets.
His hollow men.</font>

709
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:29,741
<font color="#8abaf4">I mean look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?</font>

710
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:31,767
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark is nothing.</font>

711
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,010
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm sorry.
I'm so...</font>

712
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:37,204
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm sure that's going to be okay.
I'm sorry.</font>

713
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:39,098
<font color="#8abaf4">It's just that.
I don't understand.</font>

714
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:42,418
<font color="#8abaf4">Don't compare me...
with Stark.</font>

715
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:45,145
<font color="#8abaf4">It's a thing with me.</font>

716
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,982
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark is...
He's a sickness.</font>

717
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:48,926
Oh junior.

718
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:53,202
You're going to break your old man's heart.

719
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:55,575
<font color="#8abaf4">If I have to.</font>

720
00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:00,621
- Nobody has to break anything.
- <font color="#8abaf4">Clearly you've never made an omelet.</font>

721
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:02,624
He beat me by one second.

722
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:06,132
Ah... it is funny.
Mr. Stark.

723
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,767
It's what?
Comfortable?

724
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:12,672
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.

725
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:15,433
- You two can still walk away from this.
- Oh, we will.

726
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:16,616
I know you've suffered.

727
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,688
<font color="#8abaf4">Ah... Huh huh.
Captain America.</font>

728
00:46:19,788 --> 00:46:22,266
<font color="#8abaf4">God's righteous man.</font>

729
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,407
<font color="#8abaf4">Pretending you could live without a war.</font>

730
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:28,272
<font color="#8abaf4">I can't physically throw up in my mouth.
But...</font>

731
00:46:28,297 --> 00:46:31,043
If you believe in peace.
Then let us keep it.

732
00:46:31,068 --> 00:46:34,359
<font color="#8abaf4">I think you're confusing peace with quiet.</font>

733
00:46:34,384 --> 00:46:36,513
Yeah huh.
What's the Vibranium for?

734
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:37,759
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm glad you asked that.</font>

735
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:42,005
<font color="#8abaf4">Because I want to take this
time to explain my evil plan.</font>

736
00:47:01,254 --> 00:47:03,006
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

737
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,242
All of them.

738
00:47:04,267 --> 00:47:05,718
Move, move, move...

739
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,086
Stay down,
kid.

740
00:47:57,937 --> 00:48:01,057
<font color="#8abaf4">It's time for some mind games.</font>

741
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:04,936
Guys.
Is this a code green?

742
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:21,474
Thor.
Status?

743
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,865
The girl tried to warp my brain.

744
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,213
Take special care.
I doubt a human can keep her at bay.

745
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,567
Fortunately.
I am mighty.

746
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:52,630
This is going very well.

747
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:05,910
I've done the whole mind control thing.

748
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:08,010
Not a fan.

749
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:16,888
Yeah.
You'd better run.

750
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:20,883
Who's ever standing.
We got to move.

751
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:23,285
Guys?

752
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,329
Again.

753
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:44,342
You'll break them.

754
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,512
Only the breakable ones.

755
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:48,464
You are made of marble.

756
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:51,558
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

757
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,219
What if I fail?

758
00:49:58,263 --> 00:50:00,056
You'll never fail.

759
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:24,475
Are you ready for our dance?

760
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:34,935
Is it him?

761
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,354
Is that the first son of Odin?

762
00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:38,606
Heimdall,
your eyes...

763
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,663
Oh...
they see everything.

764
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:44,980
They see you leading us to Hell.

765
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:46,318
Wake up!

766
00:50:49,205 --> 00:50:51,546
The war is over,
Steve.

767
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,639
We can go home now.

768
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,424
Imagine it.

769
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:07,326
I can still save you.

770
00:51:07,351 --> 00:51:09,057
We are all dead.

771
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:10,893
Can you not see it?

772
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:18,106
You are a destroyer,
Odinson.

773
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:24,047
See where your power leads you.

774
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,057
Sloppy.

775
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,420
Pretending to fail.

776
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:40,693
The ceremony is necessary.

777
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:43,596
For you to take your place in the world.

778
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,379
I have no place in the world.

779
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:46,916
Exactly.

780
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:54,421
- What did he do?
- It hurts. It...

781
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:57,381
I'm going to kill him.
I'll be right back.

782
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,173
I'm alright.

783
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:01,171
I want...

784
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,721
I want to finish the plan.

785
00:52:06,113 --> 00:52:08,132
I want the big one.

786
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,494
Doctor,
the Vibranium is getting away.

787
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:22,851
And you're not going anywhere.

788
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,815
Of course not.
I'm already there.

789
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:30,216
You'll catch on.
But first you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

790
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:46,500
News or footage, keyword Hulk.

791
00:52:50,148 --> 00:52:52,743
Natasha.
I could really use a lullaby.

792
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:56,164
Oh that's not going to happen.
Not for a while.

793
00:52:56,192 --> 00:52:58,261
The whole team is down.

794
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:01,113
We got no back-up here.

795
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:03,077
I'm calling in Veronica.

796
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:37,671
Alright everybody.
Stand down.

797
00:54:43,387 --> 00:54:45,113
You listening?

798
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:47,553
That blue witch is messing with your mind.

799
00:54:47,578 --> 00:54:50,046
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

800
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:51,629
You're Bruce Banner.

801
00:54:51,694 --> 00:54:54,396
 Right, right, right.
Don't mention puny Banner.

802
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:23,181
In the back?

803
00:55:23,206 --> 00:55:24,842
Dick move,
Banner.

804
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:37,784
Veronica,
give me a hand.

805
00:56:04,585 --> 00:56:06,389
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

806
00:56:15,779 --> 00:56:18,263
Okay pal.
We're going to get you out of town.

807
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:21,499
Not that way!
Not that way!

808
00:56:29,197 --> 00:56:32,110
Come on... Bruce.
You got to work with me.

809
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:46,540
Everybody out.

810
00:56:52,605 --> 00:56:54,574
Call me the athlete!

811
00:57:03,483 --> 00:57:04,819
I'm sorry.

812
00:57:18,884 --> 00:57:20,504
Damage report?

813
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:22,162
That's comprehensive.

814
00:57:22,187 --> 00:57:23,643
Show me something.

815
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,989
How quickly can we buy this building?

816
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:10,723
Go.
Move, move, move, move!

817
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:06,783
The news is loving you guys.

818
00:59:07,484 --> 00:59:09,428
Nobody else is.

819
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:12,026
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest.

820
00:59:12,051 --> 00:59:14,275
But,
it's in the air.

821
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:16,817
- Stark relief foundation?
- Already on the scene.

822
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:18,203
How's the team?

823
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:19,457
Everyone is...

824
00:59:20,384 --> 00:59:22,103
We took a hit.

825
00:59:22,304 --> 00:59:23,503
We'll shake it off.

826
00:59:23,528 --> 00:59:25,997
Well for now, I'd stay
in stealth mode.

827
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,103
And stay away from here.

828
00:59:28,305 --> 00:59:29,973
So run and hide?

829
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:32,206
Until we can find Ultron.

830
00:59:32,232 --> 00:59:34,948
I...
don't have a lot else to offer.

831
00:59:35,715 --> 00:59:37,275
Neither do we.

832
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:45,667
Hey,
Want to switch out?

833
00:59:45,697 --> 00:59:47,311
No, I'm good.

834
00:59:47,344 --> 00:59:51,045
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
cause we're still a few hours out.

835
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,245
A few hours from...
where?

836
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:55,045
Safe house.

837
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:24,086
- What is this place?
- A safe house.

838
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:32,553
Honey!

839
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:34,346
I'm home.

840
01:00:36,848 --> 01:00:38,027
Hi...

841
01:00:38,053 --> 01:00:39,107
Company.

842
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:41,281
Sorry. I didn't called ahead.

843
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:43,753
This is an agent of some kind.

844
01:00:43,778 --> 01:00:46,184
Gentlemen.
This is Laura.

845
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:49,173
I know all of your names.

846
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:53,343
Oh incoming.

847
01:00:53,641 --> 01:00:56,510
- Dad!
- Hi sweet heart. Hey buddy!

848
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:58,117
How you guys doing?

849
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,659
- These are... smaller agents.
- Look at your face

850
01:01:00,684 --> 01:01:01,990
Oh my goodness!

851
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:04,429
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

852
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,588
Why don't you hug her and find out?

853
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,750
Sorry for barging in on you.

854
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:13,088
Yeah we would've called ahead.
But we were busy having no idea that you existed.

855
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:16,173
Yeah well.
Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

856
01:01:16,997 --> 01:01:19,881
Kept it off Shield's files.
Like to keep it that way.

857
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:22,436
I figured it's a good place to lay low.

858
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:23,504
Honey,

859
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:25,756
I missed you.

860
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,487
How's little Natasha,
huh?

861
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:28,987
She is...

862
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,255
...Nathaniel.

863
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:35,980
Traitor.

864
01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:52,541
Thor?

865
01:01:52,566 --> 01:01:54,743
I saw something in that dream.

866
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:56,066
I need answers.

867
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,774
I won't find them here.

868
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:09,924
<i>We can go home.</i>

869
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:22,751
See.
You worried for nothing.

870
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:25,025
Can't even feel the difference,
can you?

871
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:30,538
If they're sleeping here,
Some of them will have to double up.

872
01:02:32,254 --> 01:02:34,855
Yeah.
That's not going to sell.

873
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:39,827
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

874
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:42,014
How long has that been going on?

875
01:02:42,615 --> 01:02:44,006
Has what?

876
01:02:44,664 --> 01:02:46,761
You are so cute.

877
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,824
Nat and...

878
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:48,863
and Banner?

879
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,507
I'll explain when you're older.
Hawkeye.

880
01:02:51,532 --> 01:02:53,243
Oh...
Okay.

881
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,694
It's bad,
right?

882
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:58,804
Nat seemed really shaken.

883
01:02:59,505 --> 01:03:01,058
Ultron has these allies...

884
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,971
these uh....

885
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:05,024
Kids... punks really.

886
01:03:06,831 --> 01:03:08,935
They carry a big damn stick.

887
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,263
Nat took a serious hit.

888
01:03:11,812 --> 01:03:14,052
Someone is going to have to
teach them some manners.

889
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:16,535
And that someone being you?

890
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:20,459
You know I totally support your avenging.

891
01:03:20,484 --> 01:03:22,445
I couldn't be prouder.

892
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:25,490
But I see those guys.

893
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:26,680
Those...

894
01:03:26,705 --> 01:03:27,895
Gods...

895
01:03:29,294 --> 01:03:31,213
You don't think they need me.

896
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:33,706
I think they do.

897
01:03:33,731 --> 01:03:35,583
 Which is a lot scarier.

898
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:38,244
They're a mess.

899
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:40,487
Yeah.

900
01:03:41,282 --> 01:03:43,489
I guess they're my mess.

901
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:46,089
You need to be sure.

902
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:48,479
That this team is really a team.

903
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:50,560
And that they have your back.

904
01:03:53,899 --> 01:03:56,306
Things are changing for us.

905
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,112
In a few months time.

906
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:01,860
You and me are going to be
outnumbered.

907
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:03,438
I need...

908
01:04:06,386 --> 01:04:08,237
Just be sure.

909
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:10,476
Yes, ma'am.

910
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:21,837
I can feel the difference.

911
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:25,416
- U-Gin Genetics Research Lab -

912
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:28,283
- U-Gin Genetics Research Lab
  South Korea -

913
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:37,856
<font color="#8abaf4">Scream and your entire staff dies.</font>

914
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,929
<font color="#8abaf4">I could've killed you, Helen.
On the night we met.  I didn't.</font>

915
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:44,412
Do you expect a thank you note.

916
01:04:44,437 --> 01:04:46,396
<font color="#8abaf4">I expect you to know why.</font>

917
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:51,077
- The cradles
- This is the next thing, Tony.

918
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,395
<font color="#8abaf4">This...</font>

919
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:54,420
<font color="#8abaf4">is the next me.</font>

920
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:57,120
The regeneration cradle prints tissue.

921
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:59,637
- It can't build a living body.
- <font color="#8abaf4">It can.</font>

922
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,894
<font color="#8abaf4">You can...
You lack the material.</font>

923
01:05:04,089 --> 01:05:06,737
<font color="#8abaf4">You're a brilliant woman,
Helen.</font>

924
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,791
<font color="#8abaf4">But we all have...
room to improve.</font>

925
01:05:33,675 --> 01:05:36,097
I...
didn't realize you were waiting.

926
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:38,797
I would've joined you.
But uh...

927
01:05:38,822 --> 01:05:40,942
It didn't seem like
the right time.

928
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:43,997
I...
used up all the hot water.

929
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:45,906
I should've joined you.

930
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,600
Missed our window.

931
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:49,682
Did we?

932
01:05:53,344 --> 01:05:55,702
The world just saw the Hulk.

933
01:05:56,609 --> 01:05:59,176
The real Hulk for the first time.

934
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:05,488
- You know I have to leave.
- And you assume that I have to stay?

935
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:09,942
I had this, um...
dream.

936
01:06:09,975 --> 01:06:12,311
The kind that seems normal at the time.

937
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,490
But when you wake.

938
01:06:14,515 --> 01:06:16,124
What did you dream?

939
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,191
I wasn't an avenger.

940
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:24,648
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.

941
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:28,806
I think you're being hard on yourself.

942
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,995
Here I was hoping that was your job.

943
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,455
What are you doing?

944
01:06:38,788 --> 01:06:40,820
I'm running with it.

945
01:06:41,824 --> 01:06:43,330
With you.

946
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,949
If...
running is the plan.

947
01:06:47,606 --> 01:06:49,791
For as far as you want.

948
01:06:51,502 --> 01:06:53,593
Are you out of your mind?

949
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:01,708
- I want you to understand that I'm...
- Natasha...

950
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:04,153
Where can I go?

951
01:07:05,096 --> 01:07:07,142
Where in the world am I not a threat?

952
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,531
- You're not a threat to me.
- You sure?

953
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:12,483
Even if I didn't just...

954
01:07:14,148 --> 01:07:16,234
You've no future with me.

955
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:19,100
I can't ever...

956
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,275
I can't have this.

957
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,884
Kids.

958
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,925
Do the math.
I physically can't.

959
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:29,251
Neither can I.

960
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:37,220
In the red room, where I was...
trained.

961
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:39,736
Where I was raised.
Um...

962
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:43,833
They have a graduation ceremony.

963
01:07:45,214 --> 01:07:47,424
They sterilize you.

964
01:07:49,992 --> 01:07:51,888
It's efficient.

965
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,642
One less thing to worry about.

966
01:07:57,977 --> 01:08:01,428
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

967
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:06,325
Makes everything easier.

968
01:08:06,981 --> 01:08:08,743
Even killing.

969
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:16,502
You still think you're the only monster
on the team?

970
01:08:22,534 --> 01:08:24,567
So we disappear?

971
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:33,750
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

972
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:36,664
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

973
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,681
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

974
01:08:39,709 --> 01:08:41,497
Yeah.
Give him time.

975
01:08:41,808 --> 01:08:44,434
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

976
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,712
Earth mightiest heroes.

977
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:49,823
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

978
01:08:49,848 --> 01:08:52,196
Seems like you walked away alright.

979
01:08:53,656 --> 01:08:57,140
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

980
01:08:58,172 --> 01:09:02,005
- Call me old-fashioned.
- Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

981
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:04,728
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

982
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:06,490
Well I guess you'd know.

983
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:08,115
Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

984
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,193
- Banner and I were doing research...
- That would affect the team.

985
01:09:10,218 --> 01:09:13,481
That would end the team.
Isn't that the mission?

986
01:09:13,505 --> 01:09:17,672
Isn't that the why we fight?
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home?

987
01:09:20,388 --> 01:09:24,736
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts.
I Innocent people die.

988
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:26,304
Every time.

989
01:09:27,895 --> 01:09:29,315
Sorry.

990
01:09:29,663 --> 01:09:31,116
Mr. Stark.

991
01:09:31,197 --> 01:09:35,180
Clint said you won't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to wanna start at all.

992
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,370
- I thought you might....
- Yeah, I'll give it a kick.

993
01:09:40,903 --> 01:09:42,720
Don't take from my pile.

994
01:09:52,926 --> 01:09:54,363
Hello, dear.

995
01:09:56,713 --> 01:09:58,616
Tell me everything.

996
01:09:59,306 --> 01:10:01,037
What ails you?

997
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,878
Do me a favour.

998
01:10:04,057 --> 01:10:06,101
Try not to bring it to life.

999
01:10:06,126 --> 01:10:08,307
Oh Mrs. Barton,
you little minx.

1000
01:10:08,332 --> 01:10:10,426
I get it.
Maria Hill called you, right?

1001
01:10:10,928 --> 01:10:14,784
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.

1002
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:18,482
- You never even hesitated.
- Look it's been a really long day.

1003
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:22,355
Like Eugene O'Neill long.
So hows about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1004
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,061
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

1005
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:28,736
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.

1006
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:30,976
I'm just an old man.

1007
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:33,601
Who cares very much about you.

1008
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,736
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1009
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:40,285
I saw it.

1010
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:43,103
I didn't tell the team.
How could I?

1011
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,421
I saw them all dead Nick.
I felt it.

1012
01:10:45,446 --> 01:10:47,028
The whole world too.

1013
01:10:47,652 --> 01:10:49,317
Because of me.

1014
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:52,092
I wasn't ready.

1015
01:10:52,591 --> 01:10:54,632
I didn't do all I could.

1016
01:10:55,046 --> 01:10:57,942
The Maximoff girl.
She's working you Stark.

1017
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:01,347
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked. I was shown.

1018
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:03,616
It wasn't a nightmare.
It was my legacy.

1019
01:11:03,641 --> 01:11:06,458
The end of the path I started us on.

1020
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:10,641
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions Tony.

1021
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:13,935
War isn't one of them.

1022
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:21,068
Watch my friends die,.
You'd think that would be as bad as it gets, right?

1023
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,632
No.

1024
01:11:23,838 --> 01:11:25,656
wasn't the worst part.

1025
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,449
The worst part...

1026
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:29,696
is that you didn't.

1027
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,436
- Royal Holloway
University of London -

1028
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,378
I'll see it tonight.

1029
01:11:37,403 --> 01:11:39,206
- Royal Holloway
University of London -

1030
01:11:39,231 --> 01:11:41,283
I like the look.

1031
01:11:41,595 --> 01:11:44,761
If you're going for inconspicuous though,
near miss.

1032
01:11:44,786 --> 01:11:47,307
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.

1033
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:49,053
It's dangerous.

1034
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:51,497
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1035
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:57,488
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1036
01:11:57,513 --> 01:12:00,725
My contacts
all say he's building something.

1037
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:04,775
The amount of Vibranium he made off with.
I don't think it's just one thing.

1038
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,482
What about Ultron himself?

1039
01:12:06,507 --> 01:12:09,366
Ah, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1040
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,370
Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1041
01:12:12,395 --> 01:12:15,454
Still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans though.

1042
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,585
- He stills going after launch codes?
- Yes he is, but he's not making any head way.

1043
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,163
I cracked the pentagon's firewall in high school
on a dare.

1044
01:12:22,188 --> 01:12:25,282
Yeah, well I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1045
01:12:25,298 --> 01:12:27,791
- Nexus?
- The city of world internet hub in Oslo.

1046
01:12:27,816 --> 01:12:31,167
And every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on earth.

1047
01:12:31,192 --> 01:12:32,360
So what they say?

1048
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:34,322
He's fixated on missiles.

1049
01:12:34,347 --> 01:12:37,743
- But the codes are constantly being changed.
- By whom?

1050
01:12:38,806 --> 01:12:40,942
- Parties unknown.
- We have an ally?

1051
01:12:40,966 --> 01:12:44,076
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1052
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:46,061
Still.
I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1053
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:48,969
We might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.

1054
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:53,106
Well all this is good times boss
but I was kinda hoping when I saw you,
you'd have more than that.

1055
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,141
I do.

1056
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,609
I have you.

1057
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:59,699
Back in the day I had eyes everywhere,
Ears everywhere else.

1058
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:03,172
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

1059
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:05,791
Here we all are back on earth.

1060
01:13:05,816 --> 01:13:10,561
With nothing but our wit,
and our will to save the world.

1061
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:15,274
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.

1062
01:13:15,299 --> 01:13:17,107
And whether or not he admits it.

1063
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:18,990
His mission.

1064
01:13:19,015 --> 01:13:20,958
Is global destruction.

1065
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:24,386
All this laid in a grave.

1066
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:27,101
So stand.

1067
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:30,121
Out wit the platinum bastard.

1068
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:32,023
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1069
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:33,992
You know what?
Romanoff.

1070
01:13:34,017 --> 01:13:36,474
So what does he want?

1071
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:38,959
To become better.

1072
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:40,648
Better than us.

1073
01:13:40,673 --> 01:13:43,597
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1074
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:47,196
Human form isn't efficient.
Biologically speaking, we're out-moded.

1075
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:49,607
but he keeps coming back to it.

1076
01:13:49,632 --> 01:13:53,511
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race. You amazingly failed.

1077
01:13:53,536 --> 01:13:55,775
They don't need to be protected.

1078
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,982
They need to evolve.

1079
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:02,002
Ultron's going to evolve.

1080
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:03,288
How?

1081
01:14:04,355 --> 01:14:07,454
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1082
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,863
It's beautiful.

1083
01:14:12,888 --> 01:14:15,951
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells.

1084
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:17,680
They're binding them.

1085
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:21,732
- And Shield never even...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,

1086
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,345
And they use it to make a Frisbee.

1087
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:29,204
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface and never think...

1088
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,124
... to look within.

1089
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:45,271
- I'll take Natasha and Clint.
- Alright, strictly recon.

1090
01:14:45,297 --> 01:14:47,366
I'll hit the Nexus and will join

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,882
We're going to need to access the program.
Break it down from within.

1246
01:27:05,926 --> 01:27:08,124
Any chance Natasha might
leave you a message.

1247
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:10,489
Outside the internet.
Old school spy stuff.

1248
01:27:10,514 --> 01:27:12,560
- If there's a second cast.
- Yeah, right.

1249
01:27:12,585 --> 01:27:13,782
I'll find it.

1250
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:18,029
I can work on tissue degeneration.

1251
01:27:18,054 --> 01:27:21,643
If you could fry whatever operational system
Cho implanted.

1252
01:27:21,668 --> 01:27:23,220
Yeah,
about that.

1253
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,436
No.

1254
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,032
- You have to trust me.
- Kinda don't.

1255
01:27:30,057 --> 01:27:31,475
Our ally.

1256
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,675
The guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes.

1257
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:37,358
I found him.

1258
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:39,263
<font color="#f8eba3">Hello, Dr. Banner.</font>

1259
01:27:39,288 --> 01:27:42,148
Ultron didn't go after
Jarvis because he was angry.

1260
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:44,156
He attacked him because he was scared.

1261
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:46,172
Of what he can do.

1262
01:27:46,797 --> 01:27:48,522
So Jarvis went underground.

1263
01:27:48,547 --> 01:27:52,318
Okay. Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.

1264
01:27:52,506 --> 01:27:56,561
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1265
01:27:57,373 --> 01:28:01,649
So... you want me,
to help you...

1266
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:03,792
Put Jarvis into this thing.

1267
01:28:03,817 --> 01:28:05,736
No...
Of course not.

1268
01:28:05,732 --> 01:28:08,365
I want to help you
put Jarvis into this thing.

Way out of my field here.

1270

You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1271
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:18,468
And you just assume that Jarvis'
operational matrix can beat Ultron's

1272
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:21,455
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.

1273
01:28:21,698 --> 01:28:22,895
This is the opportunity.

1274
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:28,365
We can create Ultron's perfect self without the
homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1275
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:29,592

The gem?

It's one of the six infinity stones.

I don't want to kill Ultron.

01:35:30,459 --> 01:35:32,003
He's unique.

1371
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:34,305
And he's in pain.

1372
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:38,315
But that pain will roll over the earth.

1373
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:40,311
So he must be destroyed.

Every trace of his presence on the net.

01:37:19,238 --> 01:37:20,586
They didn't.

1400
01:37:21,346 --> 01:37:22,680
So our priority.

1401
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:24,901
Is getting them out.

1402
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:28,521
You're under attack.
Clear the city...  now!

1403
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:37,426
Get off your asses.

1404
01:37:38,258 --> 01:37:40,909
- All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1405
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:43,180
And that's not going to happen today.

1406
01:37:43,872 --> 01:37:46,100
But we can do our best to protect them.

1407
01:37:46,312 --> 01:37:48,426
And we can get the job done.

1408
01:37:50,879 --> 01:37:53,352
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1409
01:37:54,478 --> 01:37:56,230
We find Romanoff.

1410
01:37:56,448 --> 01:37:58,282
And clear the field.

1411
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,560
Keep the fight between us.

1412
01:38:08,475 --> 01:38:11,079
Ultron thinks...
we're monsters.

1413
01:38:11,104 --> 01:38:13,537
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1414
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:16,100
This isn't just about beating him.

1415
01:38:16,508 --> 01:38:18,609
It's about whether he's right.

1416
01:38:25,095 --> 01:38:26,590
Natasha...

1417
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:28,241
Natasha.

1418
01:38:28,266 --> 01:38:29,447
Bruce.

1419
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:32,512
Are you alright?

1420
01:38:32,537 --> 01:38:33,331
Yeah.

1421
01:38:33,356 --> 01:38:35,358
The team's in the city.
It's about to light up.

1422
01:38:35,383 --> 01:38:37,552
I don't suppose you found a key
lying around somewhere.

1423
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,878
Yeah.

1424
01:38:39,008 --> 01:38:40,296
I did.

1425
01:38:46,137 --> 01:38:47,531
So,
what's our play?

1426
01:38:47,556 --> 01:38:49,475
I'm here to get you to safety.

1427
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,791
Job's not finished.

1428
01:38:50,816 --> 01:38:55,116
We can help with the evacuation.
But I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1429
01:38:55,158 --> 01:38:56,910
And you done plenty.

1430
01:38:58,957 --> 01:39:00,966
Our fight is over.

1431
01:39:02,012 --> 01:39:04,243
So we just disappear?

1432
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:10,160
Come on.

1433
01:39:14,383 --> 01:39:16,934
<font color="#f28ffa">Your guy's in the church,
boss.</font>

1434
01:39:17,146 --> 01:39:19,156
<font color="#f28ffa">I think he's waiting for you.</font>

1435
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:25,395
<font color="#8abaf4">Come to confess your sins?</font>

1436
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:28,342
- I don't know. How much time do you got?
- <font color="#8abaf4">More than you.</font>

1437
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:31,927
Uh...
Have you been juicing?

1438
01:39:31,952 --> 01:39:33,412
A little Vibranium cocktail?

1439
01:39:33,437 --> 01:39:35,797
You're looking...
I don't wanna say puffy.

1440
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:38,140
<font color="#8abaf4">You're stalling to protect the people.</font>

1441
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:40,950
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?

1442
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:44,712
<font color="#8abaf4">I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm freed...</font>

1443
01:39:48,344 --> 01:39:49,452
What?

1444
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:52,960
<font color="#8abaf4">You think you're the only one stalling?</font>

1445
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:55,286
<font color="#f28ffa">There's the rest
of the vibranium.</font>

1446
01:39:55,311 --> 01:39:56,678
<font color="#f28ffa">Function.
Still unclear.</font>

1447
01:39:56,703 --> 01:39:59,131
<font color="#8abaf4">This is how you end, Tony.</font>

1448
01:39:59,156 --> 01:40:01,373
<font color="#8abaf4">This is peace in my time.</font>

1449
01:40:17,685 --> 01:40:18,789
Go!

1450
01:40:23,899 --> 01:40:25,482
Get off the bridge.

1451
01:40:29,697 --> 01:40:30,831
Back!

1452
01:40:32,895 --> 01:40:34,513
Ultron...

1453
01:40:39,979 --> 01:40:41,503
<font color="#8abaf4">My Vision.</font>

1454
01:40:41,528 --> 01:40:44,031
<font color="#8abaf4">They really did take everything from me.</font>

1455
01:40:44,073 --> 01:40:46,213
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1456
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:47,344
<font color="#8abaf4">Alright.</font>

1457
01:40:49,379 --> 01:40:50,712
<font color="#8abaf4">Ahh...</font>

1458
01:41:11,338 --> 01:41:13,735
- Friday, the Vision?
- <font color="#f28ffa">Boss, it's working.</font>

1459
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,735
<font color="#f28ffa">He is burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.</font>

1460
01:41:21,219 --> 01:41:23,036
<font color="#8abaf4">You shut me out.</font>

1461
01:41:23,179 --> 01:41:24,950
<font color="#8abaf4">You think I care?</font>

1462
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:28,466
<font color="#8abaf4">You take away my world...</font>

1463
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:30,295
<font color="#8abaf4">I take away yours.</font>

1464
01:42:14,934 --> 01:42:18,466
- Friday.
- <font color="#fbc4f7">Sokovia's going for a ride.</font>

1465
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:32,251
<font color="#8abaf4">Do you see?</font>

1466
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:34,426
<font color="#8abaf4">The beauty of it.</font>

1467
01:42:34,911 --> 01:42:36,815
<font color="#8abaf4">The inevitability.</font>

1468
01:42:36,949 --> 01:42:38,948
<font color="#8abaf4">You rise...</font>

1469
01:42:38,974 --> 01:42:40,829
<font color="#8abaf4">... only to fall.</font>

1470
01:42:42,988 --> 01:42:44,948
<font color="#8abaf4">You...
Avengers.</font>

1471
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:48,685
<font color="#8abaf4">You are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.</font>

1472
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:53,027
<font color="#8abaf4">And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.</font>

1473
01:42:53,829 --> 01:42:58,340
<font color="#8abaf4">Purge me from your computers.
Turn my own flesh against me.</font>

1474
01:42:58,365 --> 01:42:59,873
<font color="#8abaf4">It means nothing.</font>

1475
01:42:59,898 --> 01:43:01,553
<font color="#8abaf4">When the dust settles.</font>

1476
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:04,188
<font color="#8abaf4">The only thing living in this world...</font>

1477
01:43:04,446 --> 01:43:06,140
<font color="#8abaf4"> ... will be metal.</font>

1478
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,177
We got to move.

1479
01:43:12,202 --> 01:43:13,662
You're not going to turn green on me?

1480
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:16,352
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1481
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:17,863
I adore you.

1482
01:43:26,405 --> 01:43:28,236
But I need the other guy.

1483
01:43:33,284 --> 01:43:34,966
Lets finish the job.

1484
01:43:51,634 --> 01:43:53,759
I really hope this makes us even.

1485
01:43:55,472 --> 01:43:57,016
Now go be a hero.

1486
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:10,069
<font color="#ff80c0">The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.</font>

1487
01:44:10,094 --> 01:44:12,624
- If it drops?
- <font color="#f28ffa">Right now the impact would kill thousands.</font>

1488
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:14,042
<font color="#f28ffa">Once it gets high enough.</font>

1489
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:15,791
<font color="#f28ffa">Global extinction...</font>

1490
01:44:19,602 --> 01:44:21,997
<font color="#f28ffa">That building is not clear.
It's 10th floor.</font>

1491
01:44:26,945 --> 01:44:27,946
Hi...

1492
01:44:28,923 --> 01:44:30,090
Okay...

1493
01:44:30,221 --> 01:44:31,764
Get in the tub!

1494
01:44:38,057 --> 01:44:40,456
<font color="#f28ffa">I got airborne,
heading out to the bridge.</font>

1495
01:44:42,648 --> 01:44:45,821
- Cap. You got incoming.
- Incoming already came in...

1496
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:51,237
Stark you worry about getting
the city back down safely.

1497
01:44:51,427 --> 01:44:53,273
The rest of us have one job...

1498
01:44:53,298 --> 01:44:54,882
... tear these things apart.

1499
01:44:54,907 --> 01:44:57,151
You get hurt.
Hurt them back.

1500
01:44:57,264 --> 01:44:58,810
You get killed...

1501
01:44:59,365 --> 01:45:00,738
Walk it off.

1502
01:45:35,238 --> 01:45:36,898
Go! Go! Go!

1503
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:43,235
How could I've let this happen?

1504
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:44,788
Hey, hey.
You okay?

1505
01:45:44,813 --> 01:45:47,126
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.

1506
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:49,603
It's your fault. It's everyone's fault.
Who cares?

1507
01:45:49,628 --> 01:45:51,193
Are you up for this?

1508
01:45:51,218 --> 01:45:52,630
Are you?

1509
01:45:52,807 --> 01:45:56,124
Look. I just need to know.
Because the city... it's flying.

1510
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:58,117
Okay look.
The city is flying.

1511
01:45:58,142 --> 01:46:00,052
We're fighting an army of robots.

1512
01:46:00,764 --> 01:46:02,339
And I have a bow and an arrow.

1513
01:46:02,364 --> 01:46:04,355
None of this makes sense.

1514
01:46:06,726 --> 01:46:09,521
I'm going back out there
cos it's my job.

1515
01:46:09,546 --> 01:46:12,537
Okay.
I can't do my job and babysit.

1516
01:46:12,568 --> 01:46:15,671
Doesn't matter what you did.
Or what you were.

1517
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:19,013
If you go out there, you fight.
And you fight to kill.

1518
01:46:19,038 --> 01:46:20,752
Stay in here, you're good.

1519
01:46:20,777 --> 01:46:24,196
I'll send your brother to come and find you.
But if you step out that door...

1520
01:46:24,532 --> 01:46:26,450
...  you are an Avenger.

1521
01:46:30,642 --> 01:46:32,435
Alright.
Let's get you...

1522
01:46:36,008 --> 01:46:38,275
Yeah.
This city is flying.

1523
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:12,441
I got you!

1524
01:47:12,753 --> 01:47:14,274
Just look at me!

1525
01:47:20,219 --> 01:47:23,073
You can't save them all. MrSeeN

1526
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:25,322
You'll never...

1527
01:47:25,509 --> 01:47:26,823
Never what...?

1528
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,601
You didn't finish...!

1529
01:47:31,689 --> 01:47:33,466
What?
Were you napping?

1530
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,297
Damn.

1531
01:47:55,322 --> 01:47:56,564
Thor...

1532
01:47:58,127 --> 01:48:00,370
You've been bothering me.

1533
01:48:08,443 --> 01:48:09,561
Aw!

1534
01:48:35,586 --> 01:48:38,215
- Alright, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear!

1535
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,000
We are very not clear!

1536
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,690
Alright, coming to you.

1537
01:48:44,247 --> 01:48:46,048
Keep up, old man.

1538
01:48:48,015 --> 01:48:49,878
Nobody would know.

1539
01:48:50,289 --> 01:48:51,791
Nobody.

1540
01:48:53,412 --> 01:48:56,109
The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1541
01:48:56,134 --> 01:49:00,079
Yeah, he'll be missed.
That quick little bastard, I miss him already.

1542
01:49:14,893 --> 01:49:17,542
Hold your fire...!

1543
01:49:25,983 --> 01:49:27,392
Romanoff!

1544
01:49:27,513 --> 01:49:28,631
Thanks.

1545
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:41,862
<font color="#f28ffa">The anti gravs are ready to flip.</font> <font color="#f28ffa">Touch
them and they'll go full reverse thrust.</font>

1546
01:49:41,887 --> 01:49:45,047
- <font color="#f28ffa">The city is not coming down slowly.</font>
- The spire is vibranium.

1547
01:49:45,072 --> 01:49:46,949
- If I get Thor to hit it.
- <font color="#f28ffa">It will crack.</font>

1548
01:49:46,974 --> 01:49:49,342
<font color="#f28ffa">That's not enough.
The impact would still be devastating.</font>

1549
01:49:49,367 --> 01:49:52,743
Maybe we can cap the other end.
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1550
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,723
<font color="#f28ffa">That could vaporize the city...</font>

1551
01:49:54,834 --> 01:49:56,537
<font color="#f28ffa">... and everyone on it.</font>

1552
01:50:02,781 --> 01:50:04,551
The next wave is going to hit any minute.

1553
01:50:04,576 --> 01:50:07,090
- What you got, Stark?
- Oh, nothing great.

1554
01:50:07,352 --> 01:50:09,396
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1555
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,448
Have to keep it from impacting the
surface if you guys can get clear.

1556
01:50:12,473 --> 01:50:14,732
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1557
01:50:14,757 --> 01:50:17,291
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1558
01:50:17,646 --> 01:50:19,505
We have to make a choice.

1559
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,950
Cap.
These people are going nowhere.

1560
01:50:22,109 --> 01:50:25,296
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not until everyone's safe.

1561
01:50:25,321 --> 01:50:28,032
Everyone up here verses everyone down there.

1562
01:50:28,057 --> 01:50:30,556
- There's no math there.
- I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1563
01:50:30,581 --> 01:50:32,291
I didn't say we should leave.

1564
01:50:34,656 --> 01:50:36,637
There's worse ways to go.

1565
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:44,013
Where else am I going to get a view like this?

1566
01:50:45,711 --> 01:50:48,110
Glad you like the view Romanoff.

1567
01:50:48,135 --> 01:50:50,053
It's about to get better.

1568
01:51:13,775 --> 01:51:15,054
Nice,
Right?

1569
01:51:15,079 --> 01:51:17,711
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1570
01:51:17,736 --> 01:51:19,726
She's dusty.
But... she'll do.

1571
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:21,466
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1572
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:23,540
Uhu..
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1573
01:51:23,565 --> 01:51:26,213
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1574
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:27,740
Life boats secure to deploy.

1575
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:31,148
Disengage in...
3... 2...

1576
01:51:31,823 --> 01:51:33,188
Take 'em out.

1577
01:51:42,103 --> 01:51:43,715
This is Shield?

1578
01:51:44,077 --> 01:51:46,319
This is what Shield's supposed to be.

1579
01:51:47,985 --> 01:51:49,644
This is not so bad.

1580
01:51:52,673 --> 01:51:54,283
Let's load them up.

1581
01:51:59,724 --> 01:52:03,434
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.

1582
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,419
Show them what we got.

1583
01:52:05,546 --> 01:52:06,714
You're up.

1584
01:52:11,483 --> 01:52:12,585
Yes!

1585
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:15,116
Now this is going to be a good story.

1586
01:52:17,266 --> 01:52:19,560
Yup...
If you live to tell it.

1587
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,457
You think I can't hold my own?

1588
01:52:21,482 --> 01:52:23,172
We get through this.
I'll hold your own.

1589
01:52:23,197 --> 01:52:25,124
You had to make it weird.

1590
01:52:49,798 --> 01:52:52,293
Okay. Here we go, here we go.
Lets move.

1591
01:52:55,137 --> 01:52:57,282
Number six boat is topped and locked.

1592
01:52:57,323 --> 01:52:59,537
Or uh, or uh..
stuffed... topped...

1593
01:52:59,562 --> 01:53:02,172
Its..
It's uh... full of people.

1594
01:53:03,453 --> 01:53:05,220
Incoming!

1595
01:53:07,345 --> 01:53:09,029
Oh... god...!

1596
01:53:19,078 --> 01:53:21,215
<font color="#8abaf4">You think you're saving anyone?</font>

1597
01:53:22,098 --> 01:53:26,936
<font color="#8abaf4">I turn that key and drop this rock a little early,
and it's still billions dead.</font>

1598
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:28,413
<font color="#8abaf4">Even you can't stop that.</font>

1599
01:53:28,438 --> 01:53:33,220
<font color="#8abaf4">I am Thor... Son of Odin...
And as long as there’s life in my breast...</font>

1600
01:53:33,245 --> 01:53:35,986
<font color="#8abaf4">I am running out of things to say.</font>

1601
01:53:36,011 --> 01:53:37,291
<font color="#8abaf4">Are you ready?</font>

1602
01:53:44,209 --> 01:53:45,805
It's terribly well balanced.

1603
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:49,364
Well, if there's too much weight you lose power
on the swing.  So...

1604
01:53:50,139 --> 01:53:51,428
I got it.

1605
01:53:51,453 --> 01:53:53,515
Create a heat seal.

1606
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:56,680
I can...
I can supercharge the spiral from below.

1607
01:53:56,705 --> 01:53:58,204
<font color="#f28ffa">Running numbers.</font>

1608
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:10,437
<font color="#f28ffa">A heat seal could work with enough power.</font>

1609
01:54:10,462 --> 01:54:12,631
- Thor...  I got a plan.
- We're out of time.

1610
01:54:12,656 --> 01:54:13,896
They're coming for the core.

1611
01:54:13,921 --> 01:54:16,353
- Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it.

1612
01:54:16,378 --> 01:54:19,077
Avengers.
Time to work for a living.

1613
01:54:28,105 --> 01:54:30,132
- You good?
- Yeah.

1614
01:54:30,688 --> 01:54:31,997
Romanoff?

1615
01:54:32,022 --> 01:54:34,695
You and Banner better not be
playing hide the zucchini!

1616
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,037
Relax, shell-head.

1617
01:54:36,062 --> 01:54:38,013
Not all of us can fly.

1618
01:54:42,953 --> 01:54:45,131
- What's the drill?
- This... is the drill.

1619
01:54:45,156 --> 01:54:47,870
If Ultron gets a hand on the core.
We lose...

1620
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:53,775
Is that the best you can do!

1621
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:04,992
You had to ask.

1622
01:55:05,017 --> 01:55:07,671
<font color="#8abaf4">This... is the best I can do.</font>

1623
01:55:07,696 --> 01:55:09,694
<font color="#8abaf4">This is exactly what I wanted.</font>

1624
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,060
<font color="#8abaf4">All of you.
Against all of me.</font>

1625
01:55:13,085 --> 01:55:15,743
<font color="#8abaf4">How can you possibly hope to stop me?</font>

1626
01:55:16,872 --> 01:55:18,934
Like the old man said...

1627
01:55:19,521 --> 01:55:20,807
... together.

1628
01:56:49,166 --> 01:56:50,166
<font color="#8abaf4">You...</font>

1629
01:56:50,191 --> 01:56:52,257
<font color="#8abaf4">With the benefit of hindsight...</font>

1630
01:57:00,716 --> 01:57:03,482
- They are trying to leave the city.
- We can't let them. Not even one.

1631
01:57:03,507 --> 01:57:05,307
- Rhodey!
- I'm on it.

1632
01:57:05,555 --> 01:57:07,390
Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1633
01:57:07,415 --> 01:57:09,894
War machine coming at you, right.

1634
01:57:15,914 --> 01:57:17,536
Okay.
What...

1635
01:57:17,561 --> 01:57:18,490
We got to move out.

1636
01:57:18,515 --> 01:57:21,070
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.
You  guys get to the boats.

1637
01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:23,236
I'll sweep for stragglers.
 Be right behind you.

1638
01:57:23,261 --> 01:57:24,868
What about the core?

1639
01:57:24,893 --> 01:57:26,466
I'll protect it.

1640
01:57:27,728 --> 01:57:28,966
It's my job.

1641
01:57:30,204 --> 01:57:31,205
Nat.

1642
01:57:31,247 --> 01:57:32,289
This way.

1643
01:57:36,585 --> 01:57:37,983
Get the people on the boats.

1644
01:57:38,008 --> 01:57:40,586
- I'm not going to leave you.
- I can handle these.

1645
01:57:42,258 --> 01:57:45,094
Come back for me when everyone else is off.
Not before.

1646
01:57:45,469 --> 01:57:46,927
You understand?

1647
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:50,391
You know...
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1648
01:57:50,432 --> 01:57:51,529
Go.

1649
01:57:52,863 --> 01:57:55,601
- <font color="#f28ffa">Boss, power levels are way below...</font>
- Reroute everything.

1650
01:57:55,626 --> 01:57:57,307
We got one shot at this.

1651
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:02,990
I know what I need to do.

1652
01:58:03,338 --> 01:58:04,547
Dining room.

1653
01:58:04,572 --> 01:58:06,339
I'll knock out that east wall.

1654
01:58:06,364 --> 01:58:08,585
Make a nice work space for Laura.

1655
01:58:09,489 --> 01:58:10,887
Put up some baffling.

1656
01:58:10,912 --> 01:58:12,934
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1657
01:58:12,959 --> 01:58:14,410
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1658
01:58:14,435 --> 01:58:16,196
No one eats in the dining room.

1659
01:58:21,584 --> 01:58:23,306
We don't have a lot of time.

1660
01:58:23,331 --> 01:58:25,085
So get your ass on a boat.

1661
01:58:38,147 --> 01:58:39,523
Hey.
Big guy.

1662
01:58:40,955 --> 01:58:42,863
The sun is getting real low.

1663
01:58:50,135 --> 01:58:51,261
Kostya?

1664
01:58:52,427 --> 01:58:54,207
We were in the market.

1665
01:58:54,549 --> 01:58:55,675
Kostya!

1666
01:59:09,637 --> 01:59:11,817
Thor.
I'm going to need you back in the church.

1667
01:59:11,842 --> 01:59:13,515
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1668
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,878
Everyone else is on the carrier.

1669
01:59:14,903 --> 01:59:16,545
You know.
If this works...

1670
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,474
We maybe don't walk away.

1671
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:20,291
Maybe not.

1672
01:59:38,898 --> 01:59:42,527
<font color="#8abaf4">I've got no strings.
So I have fun.</font>

1673
01:59:42,753 --> 01:59:45,736
<font color="#8abaf4">I'm not tied up to anyone.</font>

1674
02:00:20,715 --> 02:00:22,820
You didn't see that coming.

1675
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:21,243
<font color="#8abaf4">Oh,
for God's sake!</font>

1676
02:01:51,215 --> 02:01:53,772
No, no. I'm fine.
I'm alright.

1677
02:01:55,294 --> 02:01:57,487
It's been a long day.

1678
02:02:11,904 --> 02:02:13,280
<font color="#8abaf4">Wanda.</font>

1679
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:16,001
<font color="#8abaf4">If you stay here...</font>

1680
02:02:16,026 --> 02:02:18,064
<font color="#8abaf4">You'll die...</font>

1681
02:02:18,492 --> 02:02:20,183
I just did.

1682
02:02:20,768 --> 02:02:22,993
Do you know how I felt...?

1683
02:02:36,468 --> 02:02:38,723
It felt like that...

1684
02:03:13,895 --> 02:03:15,776
Thor.
On my mark.

1685
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:32,261
Now!

1686
02:03:59,635 --> 02:04:00,970
Hey.
Big guy.

1687
02:04:01,469 --> 02:04:02,887
We did it.

1688
02:04:03,081 --> 02:04:04,740
The job's finished.

1689
02:04:04,956 --> 02:04:07,567
Now I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?

1690
02:04:12,034 --> 02:04:14,644
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1691
02:04:15,825 --> 02:04:17,541
So help me out.

1692
02:04:17,566 --> 02:04:19,135
I need you to...

1693
02:05:03,482 --> 02:05:05,393
You're afraid.

1694
02:05:05,492 --> 02:05:07,178
<font color="#8abaf4">Of you?</font>

1695
02:05:07,286 --> 02:05:08,821
Of death.

1696
02:05:09,204 --> 02:05:11,021
You're the last one.

1697
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:13,783
<font color="#8abaf4">You're supposed to be the last.</font>

1698
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:16,505
<font color="#8abaf4">Stark asked for a savior.</font>

1699
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:19,116
<font color="#8abaf4">And settled for a slave.</font>

1700
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:22,037
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1701
02:05:23,835 --> 02:05:25,837
<font color="#8abaf4">I suppose we are.</font>

1702
02:05:25,862 --> 02:05:27,632
Humans are odd.

1703
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:33,442
They think order and chaos are
somehow opposites and...

1704
02:05:34,313 --> 02:05:36,998
Try to control what won't be.

1705
02:05:37,132 --> 02:05:39,801
But there's grace in their failings.

1706
02:05:40,106 --> 02:05:42,303
I think you've missed that.

1707
02:05:42,526 --> 02:05:44,732
<font color="#8abaf4">They're doomed.</font>

1708
02:05:44,757 --> 02:05:45,874
Yes...

1709
02:05:49,945 --> 02:05:53,759
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1710
02:05:55,292 --> 02:05:57,307
It's a privilege to be among them.

1711
02:05:57,332 --> 02:06:00,157
<font color="#8abaf4">You're unbearably naive.</font>

1712
02:06:00,182 --> 02:06:01,513
Well...

1713
02:06:03,171 --> 02:06:05,791
I was born yesterday.

1714
02:06:55,338 --> 02:06:56,696
- New Avengers Facility -

1715
02:06:56,721 --> 02:06:59,101
- New Avengers Facility
 Upstate New York -

1716
02:07:18,232 --> 02:07:20,394
Say hi to your Auntie Nat.

1717
02:07:21,277 --> 02:07:22,394
Sad.

1718
02:07:23,172 --> 02:07:25,767
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1719
02:07:25,792 --> 02:07:28,299
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1720
02:07:29,303 --> 02:07:30,971
Could be the Quin jet.

1721
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,220
But with Stark's stealth tech we
still can't track the damn thing.

1722
02:07:35,894 --> 02:07:37,013
Right.

1723
02:07:37,769 --> 02:07:40,664
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1724
02:07:41,287 --> 02:07:43,196
He'll send a postcard.

1725
02:07:43,246 --> 02:07:44,966
Wish you were here.

1726
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:49,165
You sent me to recruit him.

1727
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:50,775
Way back when.

1728
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:54,743
Did you know then what was going to happen?

1729
02:07:57,028 --> 02:07:58,926
You never know.

1730
02:07:59,237 --> 02:08:00,704
You hope for the best

1731
02:08:00,729 --> 02:08:02,878
And make do with what you get.

1732
02:08:03,125 --> 02:08:04,974
I got a great team.

1733
02:08:05,714 --> 02:08:07,758
Nothing lasts forever.

1734
02:08:08,045 --> 02:08:10,196
Trouble.
Miss Romanoff.

1735
02:08:10,221 --> 02:08:11,990
No matter who wins or loses.

1736
02:08:12,015 --> 02:08:14,124
Trouble still comes around.

1737
02:08:17,561 --> 02:08:20,172
- The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.

1738
02:08:20,197 --> 02:08:22,977
- Well the Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.

1739
02:08:23,017 --> 02:08:26,417
- So it doesn't count?
- No, it's not  like a person lifting the hammer.

1740
02:08:26,458 --> 02:08:28,482
Right. Different rules for us.
Nice guy.

1741
02:08:28,507 --> 02:08:29,465
- Artificial.
- Thank you

1742
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:32,451
He can wield the hammer.
He can keep the mind stone.

1743
02:08:33,166 --> 02:08:35,378
It's safe with the Vision.

1744
02:08:35,502 --> 02:08:38,212
These days safe is in short supply.

1745
02:08:40,028 --> 02:08:42,831
- But if you put the hammer in an elevator.
- It would still go up.

1746
02:08:42,856 --> 02:08:45,783
- Elevator's not worthy.
- I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

1747
02:08:45,808 --> 02:08:47,561
Not if you don't leave.

1748
02:08:47,732 --> 02:08:49,386
I have no choice.

1749
02:08:49,466 --> 02:08:53,466
The mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones
 to show up in the last few years.

1750
02:08:53,491 --> 02:08:55,283
It's not a coincidence.

1751
02:08:55,806 --> 02:08:59,493
Someone has been playing intricate games.
And has made pawns of us.

1752
02:08:59,518 --> 02:09:01,561
Once all these pieces are in position...

1753
02:09:01,586 --> 02:09:03,122
Triple Yahtzee?

1754
02:09:03,147 --> 02:09:06,013
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.

1755
02:09:06,547 --> 02:09:10,466
Besides this one.
There's nothing that can't be explained.

1756
02:09:17,756 --> 02:09:20,797
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1757
02:09:23,534 --> 02:09:24,829
I'm going to miss him though.

1758
02:09:24,854 --> 02:09:26,409
And you're going to miss me.

1759
02:09:26,434 --> 02:09:28,672
There's going to be a lot of manful tears.

1760
02:09:29,899 --> 02:09:31,734
I will miss you, Tony.

1761
02:09:31,759 --> 02:09:32,974
Yeah?

1762
02:09:32,999 --> 02:09:35,743
Well.
It's time for me to tap out.

1763
02:09:35,804 --> 02:09:39,616
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm.

1764
02:09:39,641 --> 02:09:41,651
Hope nobody blows it up.

1765
02:09:41,728 --> 02:09:43,171
A simple life.

1766
02:09:43,196 --> 02:09:44,792
You'll get there one day.

1767
02:09:44,817 --> 02:09:45,869
I don't know.

1768
02:09:45,894 --> 02:09:47,204
Family...

1769
02:09:47,229 --> 02:09:48,704
Stability...

1770
02:09:49,215 --> 02:09:52,736
Guy who wanted all that,
 went into the ice 75 years ago.

1771
02:09:54,025 --> 02:09:56,107
I think someone else came out.

1772
02:10:00,162 --> 02:10:01,571
You alright?

1773
02:10:03,624 --> 02:10:05,031
I'm home.

1774
02:10:12,903 --> 02:10:15,624
Wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you want to go to work?

1775
02:10:15,797 --> 02:10:17,374
I mean it's a pretty interesting wall.

1776
02:10:17,399 --> 02:10:20,251
Thought you and Tony were still
gazing into each others eyes.

1777
02:10:20,617 --> 02:10:21,784
How do we look?

1778
02:10:21,809 --> 02:10:24,091
Well we're not the 27th Yankees.

1779
02:10:24,116 --> 02:10:25,934
We got some batters.

1780
02:10:25,959 --> 02:10:28,587
They're good.
But not a team.

1781
02:10:28,612 --> 02:10:30,434
Let's beat them into shape.

1782
02:10:48,669 --> 02:10:50,045
Avengers....!

1783
02:10:52,379 --> 02:10:57,419
