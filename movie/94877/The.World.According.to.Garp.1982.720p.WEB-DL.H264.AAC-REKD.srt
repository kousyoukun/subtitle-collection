1
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,320
加普？
Garp?

2
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
加普。
Garp.

3
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
加普。
Garp.

4
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,800
加普？
Garp?

5
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,400
是的，加普。
Yes, Garp.

6
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,440
听起来像是一条鱼：“我女儿被一个Garp搞大了肚子！”
Sounds like a fish: "My daughter got knocked up by a Garp! "

7
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,480
找出那狗娘养的是姓还是名。
Find out if that's the son of a bitch's first or last name.

8
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,600
-那是他的名还是姓？-是加普.
- Was that his first name or last name? - It was Garp.

9
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
只有加普。这就是事情的全部。
Just Garp. That's the whole thing.

10
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,720
我想那是他的姓。
I think it was his last name.

11
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,120
-他的名字是什么？-我一直不知道.
- What was his first name? - I never found out.

12
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
她没查到他的名字吗？
She never found out his first name?

13
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,360
-珍妮，你一定知道他的名字。-加普技术中士。
- Jenny, you must know his first name. - Technical Sergeant Garp.

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,080
我就知道！一个该死的士兵。
I knew it! A goddamn soldier.

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
技术中士？
Technical Sergeant?

16
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,560
T.S.是的。T.S.加普。
T.S. Yes. T.S. Garp.

17
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,440
那是我孩子的名字。
That's my baby's name.

18
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,040
如果我遇到那个狗娘养的，我会杀了他。
If I ever meet the son of a bitch, I'll kill him.

19
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
他已经死了。
He's dead already.

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
我想你不会费心结婚的。
I don't suppose you bothered to get married.

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,560
结婚了吗？她甚至都没见过那个狗娘养的。
Married? She never even met the son of a bitch.

22
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,600
我不想结婚。我想要个孩子。
I didn't want to marry. I wanted a baby.

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,200
但是一枚结婚戒指，亲爱的..。
But a wedding ring, dear...

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,640
我不需要他的戒指，妈妈。我需要他的精子。
I didn't need his ring, Mother. I needed his sperm.

25
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,280
你敢在这房子里说“精子”。
Don't you dare say "sperm" in this house.

26
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,600
-你要去哪里？-去找工作.
- Where are you going? - To get a job.

27
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,800
我是一名训练有素的护士，我计划继续我的工作。
I'm a trained nurse and I plan to continue my work.

28
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,720
詹妮!
Jenny!

29
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,880
在战争中..。
In the war...

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,200
.他站在哪一边？
...which side was he on?

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
他至少是站在我们这边的吗？
Was he on our side at least?

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,720
他没有站在任何一方。他在医院里仰卧着。
He wasn't on any side. He was flat on his back in a hospital.

33
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
一天晚上，当他像往常一样勃起的时候.
One night, when he had one of his usual erections...

34
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,840
.我爬到他身上，他把它喷到我身上.
...I got on top of him and he squirted it in me.

35
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,440
他射精了，结果，我生了一个很棒的孩子。
He ejaculated, and as a result, I've got a wonderful baby.

36
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,640
我他妈的什么都听不见。
I can't hear a damn thing.

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,840
她去哪里了？威妮弗莱德..。
Where'd she go? Winifred...

38
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,840
天哪。
Oh, my God.

39
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,120
真是个大胖子！
What a bod!

40
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,160
真是个大胖子。先生们，这是一只BOD。
What a bod. This, gentlemen, is a bod.

41
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,320
我希望我是个女孩。如果我是个女孩，我会脱掉我的衣服。
I wish I was a girl. If I was a girl, I'd take off my clothes...

42
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,480
.然后站在镜子前看着自己几个小时
...and stand in front of a mirror and look at myself for hours.

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
全美BOD。
The all-American bod.

44
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
为什么篮球运动员不能做孩子的父亲呢？
Why can't a basketball player father a child?

45
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,560
每个人都知道这句话。
Everybody knows that one.

46
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,320
抓住他，博斯沃思！
Get him, Bosworth!

47
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,320
把那个给我！
Give me that!

48
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
-它在哪儿？-我没拿到.
- Where is it? - I haven't got it.

49
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,680
你把它放哪儿了？
Where did you put it?

50
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
你当然可以告诉我发生了什么。快进来吧。
Of course you can tell me what happened. Come on in here.

51
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,480
我拉链拉得太快了，结果被卡住了。
I zipped it up too fast and it got caught.

52
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,160
我看得出来。我们只能给你拉开拉链了。
I can see that. We'll just have to unzip you.

53
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,360
我已经试过了，但是很疼。
I tried that already, but it hurts.

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,080
不是那样，就是截肢。
It's either that, or amputate.

55
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,360
我们不能让你像个从婆罗洲来的野人一样到处游荡。
We can't have you parading around like a savage from Borneo.

56
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,240
没事的。等一等。我要在上面涂点东西。
It's all right. Hold on. I'm going to put something on it.

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,120
我会让你为此付出代价的！
I'll get you for this!

58
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,440
杰弗里。
Jeffrey.

59
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,320
暂时别管它。
Leave it alone for a while.

60
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,440
是的，菲尔兹小姐。
Yes, Miss Fields.

61
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
你醒着干什么？
What are you doing awake?

62
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,600
-爸爸.-不，不是爸爸.
- Dada. - No, not Dada.

63
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,760
妈妈。
Mama.

64
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
说“妈妈”
Say "Mama."

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,560
妈-妈。
Ma-ma.

66
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,160
爸爸死了。他被杀了。
Dada's dead. He got killed.

67
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,040
不，放手吧。
No, let go.

68
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,960
把这个给我。
Give this to me.

69
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,840
放手。
Let go.

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
你从哪里弄到这个的？
Where did you get this?

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,720
生病。
Sick.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
即使他们很健康，他们也会因欲望而生病。
Even when they're healthy they're sick with lust.

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
博斯沃思。
Bosworth.

74
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
博斯沃思！
Bosworth!

75
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
警告一句，你这个肮脏的贩子！
A word of warning, you filth monger!

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,880
如果你再把我的孩子暴露在这样廉价的镜头下.
If you expose my baby one more time to cheap shots like this...

77
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,640
.我要给你的运动背带接种腺鼠疫疫苗.
...l'll inoculate your jock strap with bubonic plague.

78
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,360
它会把你弄得精疲力竭的，你在那下面就没什么可抓的了。
It'll do such a job on you, you'll have nothing left to scratch down there.

79
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,080
-明白吗？-是的，菲尔兹小姐
- Understand? - Yes, Miss Fields.

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,120
很好。
Fine.

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,480
那么晚安，博斯沃思。睡好。
Well, good night then, Bosworth. Sleep well.

82
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,880
-我父亲是一名飞行员。-我告诉过你他是飞机上的机尾枪手
- My father was a flier. - I told you he was a tail gunner in a plane.

83
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,040
如果他在飞机上，他就是一名飞行员。
If he was in a plane, he was a flier.

84
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,320
-他真的很高大吗？-我不知道，我从没见过他站起来.
- Was he real big? - I don't know, I never saw him standing up.

85
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,680
为什么不行？
Why not?

86
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,560
有一天我会告诉你这件事的。这是一门你不会选的课程。
I'll tell you about it some day. This is one course you won't be taking.

87
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
文字枯燥乏味，斯图尔特·珀西更是枯燥乏味。
The text is dull, and Stewart Percy is even duller.

88
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,600
今天我在他的课上差点睡着。
I nearly fell asleep in his class today.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,520
也许他没有死。
Maybe he didn't die.

90
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
谁-我父亲
- Who? - My father.

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,800
他当然是这么做的。已经死了，已经走了。
He sure did. Dead and gone.

92
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
“神话”
"Mythology."

93
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,600
下个星期我会为你检查一下这门课。
I'll check out this class for you next week.

94
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
长骑兵死了。
Long Ranger died.

95
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,080
是“独行侠”不是“龙”-他死了
- It's "Lone Ranger," not "Long." - He died.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
-很抱歉听到这个消息.-但他真的没有
- Sorry to hear that. - But he really didn't.

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,560
每个人都以为他死了，但他没有死。
Everybody thought he died, but he didn't die.

98
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,800
也许我父亲也没有真的去世。
Maybe my father didn't really die either.

99
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
不怎么有意思。
Not really.

100
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,240
我是一名护士。我知道呀。他死了。
I'm a nurse. I know. He died.

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
-我会像爸爸一样吃飞翔吗？-我不知道
- Will I ever fly like Daddy? - I don't know.

102
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,360
我记得我坐过飞机。
I remember flying.

103
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,280
当你出生的时候，我太高兴了，我把你摔得上上下下，上上下下。
When you were born, I was so happy I threw you up and down, up and down.

104
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,400
-我记得.-你太小了，记不起来了。
- I remember. - You were too young to remember.

105
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,880
我记得我坐过飞机。上周我和爸爸一起坐飞机去了。
I remember flying. I went flying with Daddy last week.

106
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,240
你是要睡觉，还是要熬夜思考你的怪念头？
Will you sleep or will you stay up and think your weird thoughts?

107
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,480
我会熬夜想一会儿奇怪的想法。
I'll stay up and think weird thoughts for a while.

108
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
好吧。好吧。
All right. Fine.

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
晚安。
Good night.

110
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,800
-明早见。-如果我还在这里的话
- I'll see you in the morning. - Lf I'm still here.

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
你并不真的需要一个父亲。
You don't really need a father.

112
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
其他孩子都有一个。
All the other kids have one.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,920
如果他们都有战壕嘴，你也想要吗？
If they all had trench mouth, would you want that, too?

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
我厌倦了这个答案。
I'm tired of that answer.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,960
我厌倦了你的问题。
I'm tired of your questions.

116
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,160
晚安。
Good night.

117
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
嘿，这里，斯图伊！
Hey, over here, Stuey!

118
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,560
我知道怎么生孩子。
I know how to make babies.

119
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,840
我也知道。
I know, too.

120
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,400
你怎么能这样呢？你没有父亲。
How could you? You don't have a father.

121
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,840
你是个混蛋。
You're a bastard.

122
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
但我会教你的。
But I'll teach you.

123
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
猴子在中间！
Monkey in the middle!

124
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,080
好的，第一件事是：
All right, first thing is:

125
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
我头疼。
I have a headache.

126
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,120
哦，我的头。我头疼。今晚不行。
Oh, my head. I have a headache. Not tonight.

127
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,720
现在，你应该攻击我，脱下我的衣服。
Now, you're supposed to attack me and pull my clothes off.

128
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
你确定吗？
You sure?

129
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
是的。你应该说：
Yes. And you're supposed to say:

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
“每天晚上你都会头疼。”
"Every night you have a headache."

131
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,120
-好吗-好的
- Okay? - Okay.

132
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,600
今晚不行！我头疼！
Not tonight! I have a headache!

133
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,320
每天晚上你都头疼！
Every night you have a headache!

134
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,320
不，不要那样做。好痒！
No, don't do that. It tickles!

邦基！你还好吗，大男孩？

邦基咬了加普一口。

146
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,400
至少这条狗品味不错。

- Garp, what happened? - Bonkers bit me!

159

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,800
他咬掉了你的耳垂！

珀西先生说我味道很好！
Mr. Percy said that I tasted good!

162
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
他是这么做的，是吗？
He did, did he?

163
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,760
呆着，邦基，呆着。那是条好狗。
Stay, Bonkie, stay. That's a good dog.

164
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
笑一笑，库西。没错。

165

168
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,800
维尼，你能笑一笑吗，该死的？
Pooh, would you smile, damn it?

169
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,080
如果你不笑，你永远找不到丈夫。
If you don't smile, you'll never get a husband.

170
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
该死的。

171
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,280
-我儿子不是狗粮，该死的！-冷静点，珍妮.
- My son is not dog food, goddamn it! - Calm down, Jenny.

- Bonkers just got a little excited. - Fine. I'm a little excited, too!

173
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
疯子在哪里？

174
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,080
-为什么？-我要带他去给他打一针
- What for? - I'll want to take him and give him a shot.

175
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,200
-为什么？-这样他就不会再咬人了
- What for? - So he won't bite people anymore.

176
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,640
-来一杯就可以了吗？-当然可以.他会死的。
- A shot'll do that? - Sure it will. He'll be dead.

177
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,600
-你不会是认真的吧！-你敢打赌我是认真的！
- You can't be serious! - You bet your fat ass I am!

178
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,240
我警告你：要么把他绑起来，让他守规矩.
I'm warning you: either tie him up, make him behave...

179
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,360
.否则我会让他死得像个门钉
...or I'll make him dead as a doornail.

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
来吧，加普。

非常感谢。

189
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,680
-为什么我不能决定参加什么运动？-因为你太年轻了。
- Why can't I decide what sport to take? - Because you're too young.

190
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,200
我都查过了。篮球是最好的。
I've looked into them all. Basketball is the best.

191
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,480
我太矮了，打不了篮球。
I'm too short for basketball.

192
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,120
加普，你想玩吗？

193
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,160
-是的，我知道.-不，你没有.
- Yes, I do. - No, you don't.

194
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,360
库西自己也可以进行一项很好的运动。
That Cushie could use a good sport herself.

195
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,200
-在这里，我们走！-抢篮板球！
- Over here, let's go! - Hit the rebound!

196
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,040

197
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,240
我们走吧，克里斯。站在底线上。
Let's go, Chris. Set up on the base line.

198

快点，丹尼，我们抓到他们了。
Come on, Danny, we got them.

200
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
-看着他！-开枪！
- Watch him! - Take the shot!

201
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,680
砰的一声！打得好！
Swish! Nice shot!

202
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,120

203
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,880

Okay, gentlemen, that's it. Hit the showers.

209
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,840
嘿，加普，你好吗？
Hey, Garp, how are you doing?

210
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
为什么篮球运动员不能做孩子的父亲呢？
Why can't basketball players father a child?

211
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
因为他们很丑。
Because they're ugly.

212
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,000
不，因为他们在投篮前会运球。
No, because they dribble before they shoot.

213
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,240
-胸罩的定义是什么？-我不知道，什么？
- What's the definition of a brassiere? - I don't know, what?

214
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
这是一个过肩的巨石支架。

215
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,520

- And what's the definition of a girdle? - I don't know.

我父亲戴着头盔。他是个飞行员。
My father wore a helmet. He was a flyer.

218
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,080
你会飞翔吗-不会
- Can you fly? - No.

219
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
加普？
Garp?

220
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,960
-上帝啊！-她在这里做什么？
- Jesus Christ! - What's she doing here?

221
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,400
-恕我直言.-为什么圣诞老人不能做孩子的父亲？
- Spare me your modesty. - Why can't Santa Claus father a child?

222
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,560
因为他从烟囱里下来。
Because he comes down a chimney.

223
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,280
加普，你在这里做什么？
Garp, what are you doing in here?

224
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,560
我们明天有个重要的会议，所以今晚不能暴饮暴食！
We've got a big meeting tomorrow, so no beating the meat tonight!

225
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,040
-我想做他们做的事-动物！
- I want to do what they do. - Animals!

226
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,760
加普？
Garp?

227
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,600
妈妈!
Mom!

228
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,440
加普？
Garp?

229
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,680
妈妈，帮帮我！
Mom, help me!

230

帮助!妈妈，救命啊！

231
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,600
-布洛杰院长！-谁在屋顶？
- Dean Blodger! - Who's on the roof?

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
我恐怕……!
I'm afraid!

233
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,400
加普，我来了。
Garp, I'm here.

234
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
我这就上来接你。呆着别动。
I'm going to come up and get you. Stay very still.

235
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
抓紧了。没事的。
Hold tight. It's all right.

236

一些可以缓冲跌倒的东西！

239
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,640
我明白。没事的。

现在小心点，把你的脚给我。

把床垫放在一起。

242
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,360
.就在大楼旁边，这样他就可以摔倒在他们身上.快点，孩子们！
...right next to the building so he can fall on them. Hurry, boys!

243
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,600
把你的自由脚给我。再多一点。我们到了！
Give me your free foot. A little bit more over. There we are!

244
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,680
我抓住你了！我不会放手的！好的?我不会放过你的。
I've got you! I'm not going to let go! All right? I'm not going to let go of you.

245
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,000
你会没事的。
You'll be all right.

246
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,360
快点。

249
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,600

I've got you, son, I've got you!

250
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,280
菲尔兹小姐。
Miss Fields.

251
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
-什么事？-那Dean Blodger呢？

252

把他带到医务室来。

253

我们走吧，伙计们。所有人都回屋里去。
Let's go, boys. Everybody back inside.

254

嘿，大家都进去吧。把床垫拿来。
Hey, everybody inside. Get the mattresses.

255
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,120
你肯定喜欢麻烦，不是吗？
You sure like trouble, don't you?

256
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,200
谢天谢地我抓到他了。
Thank God I caught him.

257
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,800
是的，来得正是时候。
Yes, just in time.

258
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,560
他在上面做什么？
What was he doing up there?

259
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,920
假装成他死去的父亲。
Pretending to be his dead father.

260
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,400
我自己也想当父亲。但我从未结婚。
I wanted to be a father myself. But I never got married.

261
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,000
我也不知道。
Neither did I.

262
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
我一直想要个孩子。
I always wanted a child.

263
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,560
如果我能自己吃一杯，我会的。
If I could've had one by myself, I would have.

264
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,440
但是上帝，或者自然，或者别的什么..。嗯，你知道，你需要一个男人。
But God, or nature, or whatever... Well, you know, you need a man.

265
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,560
你知道男人是什么样的。充满了欲望。我能跟你说是因为你已经忘了这一切了。
You know what men are like. Full of lust. I can talk to you 'cause you're past all that.

266
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,120
-什么？-你身体不太好，不能走路.
- What? - You're not well enough to walk.

267
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120
这是一个非常严重的肿块。
It's a very nasty bump.

268
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,400
不管怎么说，战争已经开始了。
Anyway, the war was on.

269
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,560
我是一名护士。有一天，他们带来了一个尾炮手..。
I was a nurse. One day, they brought in a tail gunner...

270
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,880
.他在德国上空的一次突袭中被防空打伤。
...who'd been wounded by antiaircraft in a raid over Germany.

271
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,960
一块钢铁碎片扎进了他的脑海，他所能说的只有他的名字：加普。
A splinter of steel had lodged in his brain and all he could say was his name: Garp.

272
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
由于我无法理解的医学原因，他也经常勃起。
For medical reasons I couldn't understand, he also had a constant erection.

273
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,640
他每况愈下。
He deteriorated steadily.

274
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,240
直到有一天，他所能说的都是他名字的一部分：ARP。
Until one day, all he could say was part of his name: Arp.

275
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
就在那时，我知道他活不了多久了。
It was then that I knew that he wouldn't last much longer.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,760
然而，他的勃起依然有增无减。
His erections continued, however, quite unabated.

277
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
我明白了。
I see.

278
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,320
-我正要走了.-还没有.
- I'll just be going. - Not yet.

279
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,040
你最好是睡觉的。
You'd better rest.

280
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
不管怎么说。
Anyway.

281
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
我刚才说到哪里？
Where was I?

282
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,920
他一直在勃起。
He kept having erections.

283
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,880
谢谢。
Thank you.

284
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,920
他快要死了。我想要个孩子。
He was dying. I wanted a child.

285
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,880
这是一个很好的方式，没有丈夫在身边的麻烦。
It was a good way to have one without the bother of a husband around...

286
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,000
.对我的身体有合法权利的人所以，有一天晚上上班的时候.
...who had legal rights to my body. So, one night at work...

287
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
.当伤员和残废都睡着了，我就去找他.
...when the wounded and maimed were all asleep, I went to him.

288
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,920
他睡着了。
He was asleep.

289
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,360
但他的勃起就在那里，一如既往。
But his erection was there, as always.

290
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,760
我脱下内衣，爬到他身上。
I removed my undergarments and climbed on top of him.

291
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
然后他就醒了。
He woke up then.

292
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,800
除了他的名字，他说了我听过的唯一一个词。
He said the only word other than his name that I ever heard him utter.

293
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,840
他说，“很好。”这并没有花很长时间，这一次就是所需的全部。
He said, "good." It didn't take very long, and that once was all that was needed.

294
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,480
你强奸了他！你强奸了一个垂死的人！
You raped him! You raped a dying man!

295
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,040
-你还好吗？-不好！
- Are you all right? - No!

296
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,280
是!
Yes!

297
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,120
我现在得回家了。你真是太好了。
I have to get home now. You've been very kind.

298
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,160
我从来没听说过什么..。
I've never heard anything...

299
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,120
晚安。
Good night.

300
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,440
然后他就死了。
And then he died.

301
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,320
他确实死了。
He did die.

302
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,840
真的？
Really?

303
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
真的。
Really.

304
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,320
你会像以前一样把我扔到空中吗？
Will you throw me in the air like you used to?

305
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,680
你现在太大了，不能这么做。
You're too big for that now.

306
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,680
现在你也没有父亲了。
Now you don't have a father, either.

307
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,040
你知道，每个人都会死。
You know, everybody dies.

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,720
我父母去世了。你父亲去世了。每个人都会死。
My parents died. Your father died. Everybody dies.

309
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
我也要死了。你也会的。
I'm going to die, too. So will you.

310
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,680
问题是，在我们死之前要有自己的生活。
The thing is, to have a life before we die.

311
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,160
这可能是一次真正的冒险。
It can be a real adventure...

312
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,520
.有自己的生活
...having a life.

313
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,080
加普！当心暗流！
Garp! Careful of the undertow!

314
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,280
回流！
The undertow!

315
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,960
当心暗流！
Be careful of the undertow!

316
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,120
-你好？-嗨.
- How do you do? - Hi.

317
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
你好，又见面了。

318
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
希望我没有打扰你，在这里跑来跑去。
Hope I'm not disturbing you, running up and down here.

319
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,800
不是的。
Nope.

320
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,040
很让人分心，不是吗？
It's distracting, isn't it?

321
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,080
对我来说不是，不是。
Not to me, it's not.

322
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,560
你的体重是多少，大约112磅？
What do you weigh, about 112 or so?

323
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,600

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,520
我叫T.S.加普。
My name is T.S. Garp.

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
-T.S.代表什么？-非常性感
- What's T.S. stand for? - Terribly Sexy.

329

- I'm Helen Holm. - Holm sweet Holm.

331
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,120
我们这里的新摔跤教练叫霍姆。真是个顽固的家伙！
Our new wrestling coach here is named Holm. What a hard-ass!

332
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,840
我们叫他“霍姆汗霍姆”-他是我父亲我是他的女儿。
- We call him "Holm sweat Holm." - He's my father. I'm his daughter.

333
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,840
我们是霍姆队。
We're the Holm team.

334
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
保重。
Take care.

335
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,480
混蛋。
Asshole.

336
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,080
我们去抓他们吧，加普。
Let's get them, Garp.

337
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,920
下一个！

动手吧！
Do it!

339

-你越界了。--聚精会神。
- You're out of bounds. - Concentration.

340
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,280
你直接走进了那个消防员的房间，加普。赶快!
You walked right into that fireman's, Garp. Come on!

341
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,520

他打了你的脚。他得到了所有的打击。
He beat you on your feet. He got all the takedowns.

350
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,320
还有大部分的瀑布。
And most of the falls.

351
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,120
霍姆先生？
Mr. Holm?

352
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,520
嗨，珍妮。
Hi, Jenny.

353
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,240
霍姆先生，你知道外面发生了什么吗？
Mr. Holm, were you aware of what was going on out here?

354
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,920
加普在第一节课上并没有真正集中精力。
Garp wasn't really concentrating in the first period.

355
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,400
-但那是双臂的.-那是欲望.
- But it was that double-armed... - It was lust.

356
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,280
请再说一遍？
Beg your pardon?

357
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,520
性欲。
Lust.

358
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,440
霍姆先生，你有个女儿。我有一个儿子。
Mr. Holm, you have a daughter. I have a son.

359
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,360
-他是个好孩子。摔跤好手。-他也充满了欲望
- He's a fine boy. Good wrestler. - He's also full of lust.

360
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,760
我在一英里外就能认出它。他在追求你的女儿。
I can spot it a mile away. He's lusting after your daughter.

361
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,720
我不会担心这个的。海伦能照顾好自己。
I wouldn't worry about that. Helen can take care of herself.

362
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,880
-毕竟，这是很自然的。-疾病也是自然的。
- After all, it's only natural. - Diseases are natural, too.

363
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,480
这并不意味着我们必须向他们让步。
It doesn't mean we have to give in to them.

364
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,080
看好你的女儿，教练。
Keep an eye on your daughter, coach.

365
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,640
喂，加普吗？
Hello, Garp?

366
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,920
卡西？
Cushie?

367
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,400
什么风把你吹回来了？
So, what brings you home?

368
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
我是来拜访的。我被困在这所女子学校。
I'm visiting. I'm stuck at this all girls' school.

369
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,920
所以，我想我应该来看看孩子们怎么样了。
So, I thought I'd visit here, see how the boys are doing.

370
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,080
那么，你好吗？
So, how are you?

371
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,920
我头疼得厉害。
I have this terrible headache.

372
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,520
-回头见.-保重。

373
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,320
-嗨.-嗨.
- Hi. - Hi.

374
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,640
-我打扰到你了吗？-我想你喜欢打扰我
- Am I disturbing you? - I think you like to disturb me.

375
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,800
你的确读了很多书。
You sure read a lot.

376
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,240
-我总是读很多书。-我也是。不过，这会毁了你的眼睛的。
- I've always read a lot. - Me, too. It'll ruin your eyes, though.

377
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
他们已经被毁了。
They're already ruined.

378
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
“尤利西斯”
Ulysses<

379
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,640
-你要当作家吗？-不可能我要成为一名读者。
- You going to be a writer? - No chance. I'm going to be a reader.

380
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,000
也许你会嫁给一个作家。
Maybe you'll marry a writer.

381
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,840
如果我嫁给任何人，那一定是个作家。
If I marry anybody, it'll be a writer.

382
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,560
但我怀疑我会嫁给任何人。
But I doubt I'll marry anybody.

383
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,120
-你当然不会嫁给摔跤运动员。-这一点你可以非常肯定。
- You certainly won't marry a wrestler. - You can be very sure of that.

384
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,160
除非是一个摔跤运动员同时也是个作家。
Unless it's a wrestler who's also a writer.

385
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,320
-但是首先是一个作家吗？-是的，一个真正的作家.
- But a writer first and foremost? - Yeah, a real writer.

386
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
就像乔伊斯那样吗-也许吧
- Like Joyce? - Maybe.

他从来没有赚过钱。他当过办事员以养家糊口。
He never made any money. He worked as a clerk to support his family.

388
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,280
你读过他的书吗？
You've read him?

389
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,040
你知道他有一副动听的男高音吗？
Did you know he had a beautiful tenor voice?

390
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,560
不，我没有。
No, I didn't.

391
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,120
当他进入都柏林的费斯·塞奥尔时，他21岁。
He was 21 when he entered the Feis Ceoil in Dublin.

392
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,920
-什么？-费斯·塞奥尔
- The what? - The Feis Ceoil.

It's a Gaelic musical competition. He was runner-up in the tenor category.

394
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,440
你知道谁赢了吗-不知道
- Do you know who the winner was? - No.

395
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,840
-约翰·麦科马克(John McCormack)-真的吗？
- John McCormack. - Really?

396
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,440
-你总是穿运动服吗？-你不喜欢吗？
- Do you always wear a sweat suit? - Don't you like it?

397
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,880
是的，我只是想知道没有它你会是什么样子。我是说，穿着裙子。
Yes, I just wonder what you'd be like without it. I mean, in a dress.

398
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,120
我花了很多时间想象事情。这是我作为作家训练的一部分。
I spend a lot of time imagining things. Part of my training as a writer.

399
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,440
所有真正的作家都会想象。
All real writers imagine.

400
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
晚安，加普！
Good night, Garp!

401
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,640
天哪。
Oh, my God.

402
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,360
加普！你没有权利写这个！
Garp! You've no right to write this!

403
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,320
如果你要写我和我的私生活，等我死了再说。
If you're going to write about me and my personal life, wait till I'm dead.

404
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,720
在我活着的时候，这个主题属于我。
While I'm alive, the subject belongs to me.

405
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,080
我可能想写一下我自己。
I might want to write about myself.

406
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,680
-我还没发生什么事，妈妈.-嗯，太糟糕了.
- Nothing's happened to me yet, Mom. - Well, too bad.

407
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,480
那就编点什么吧。晚安，儿子。
Make up something then. Good night, son.

408
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,680
晚安，妈妈。
Good night, Mom.

409
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,680
-睡个好觉。-你也是.
- Sleep well. - You too.

410
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,280
那么，你怎么知道你会成为一名作家呢？
So, how do you know you're going to be a writer?

411
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,240
这只是你知道的一些事。
It's just something you know.

412
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,640
你打算写些什么呢？
What are you going to write about?

413
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,200
我的生活，一旦我经历够了。
My life, once I've experienced enough.

414
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,880
你要写信，你要嫁给海伦，她要读书。
You'll write, and you'll marry Helen, and she'll read.

415
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,200
-这就是你想要的吗-也许吧
- Is that what you want? - Maybe.

416
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,320
我想我最好给你写点东西。
I guess I'd better give you something to write about.

417
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,680
它卡住了。
It's stuck.

418
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,320
-这是你第一次吗-不是
- Is this your first time? - No.

419
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,320
我也这么想。
I thought so.

420
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,480
-你的东西呢？-什么在哪里？
- Where's your thing? - Where's what?

421
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,680
-你的事.-我的事？你没有拿着它吗？
- Your thing. - My thing? Don't you have a hold of it?

422
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,440
-不，是你的手套.-我的手套？
- No, your glove. - My glove?

423
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,960
听着，我不想要孩子。
Look, I don't want babies.

424
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,920
没有手套，就没有爱。
No glove, no love.

425
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,960
你是说橡胶。
You mean rubbers.

426
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,560
维尼？
Pooh?

427
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,280
可怜的加普，你快要爆了。
Poor Garp, you're about to burst.

428
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
海伦！
Helen!

429
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
我快追上你了，海伦。
I'm gaining on you, Helen.

430
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,960
你怎么了？
What's the matter?

431
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,200
-注意你在跑的地方。-对不起.
- Watch where you're running. - Sorry.

432
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,760
我的短篇小说！
My short story!

433
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
这是我的第一个短篇小说。
It's my first short story.

434
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,760
我为你写的。
I wrote it for you.

435
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,640
-你为我写的.-是的。
- You wrote it for me. - Yeah.

436
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,960
库西怎么看？
What'd Cushie think of it?

437
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,400
卡西？
Cushie?

438
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,440
库西。
Cushie.

439
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,680
她不是那种欣赏严肃文学的人。
She's not the type to appreciate serious literature.

440
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,080
我不知道。
I don't know.

441
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,000
在我看来，她似乎很有头脑。
From what I saw of her, she seemed to have a pretty good head on her shoulders.

442
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,280
哦!这下糟了!
Oh, boy!

443
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,760
我们的时间不多了。
We haven't got much time.

444
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,360
我家里的男人死得很早！
Men die young in my family!

445
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,720
我要走了！我要去纽约成为一名真正的作家！
I'm leaving! I'm going to New York to become a real writer!

446
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

447
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,600
精神错乱。
Bonkers.

448
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,040
邦基，快点。
Bonkie, come on now.

449
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,760
把报纸给我。
Give me the paper.

450
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,600
疯子，把纸给我，你这个毛茸茸的狗娘养的！
Bonkers, give me that paper, you hairy son of a bitch!

451
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
神经病，你这个鸡屎！
Bonkers, you chicken shit!

452
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,920
如果我是一条狗，你早就死了！
If I were a dog, you'd be dead!

453
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
发生了什么？
What happened?

454
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,480
我和海伦吵了一架。
I had a fight with Helen.

455
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,720
和海伦在一起吗？
With Helen?

456
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,400
还有精神错乱。
And Bonkers, too.

457
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,120
我想离开这里。
I want to get out of here.

458
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,320
我想去纽约，成为一名真正的作家。
I want to go to New York, become a real writer.

459
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,440
好的。
All right.

460
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,040
我一直在想我们应该离开，我自己。
I've been thinking we ought to leave, myself.

461
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,880
我们在这里待得够久了。
We've been here long enough.

462
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,680
你要来吗？
Are you going to come?

463
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,120
我认为这是个好主意。也许我也可以在那里写作。
I think it's a good idea. Maybe I could write there, too.

464
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,320
-这是什么？-疯子的耳朵.
- What's this? - Bonkers' ear.

465
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,560
-他的耳朵？-一部分.
- His ear? - Part of it.

466
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,120
加普，你在上面吗？
Garp, are you up there?

467
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,800
珍妮·菲尔兹，你在上面吗？
Jenny Fields, are you up there?

468
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
是的，您想要什么？
Yes, what is it you want?

469
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,200
你那该死的混蛋儿子对我的狗做了什么？
What the hell did that bastard son of yours do to my dog?

470
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,720
门廊上有血！到处都是血！
There's blood on the porch! There's blood everywhere!

471
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,640
他在房子下面，他不肯出来！
He's under the house, and he won't come out!

472
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,800
他做了什么？
What did he do?

473
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,360
加普咬了邦基。
Garp bit Bonkie.

474
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,440
我们有橙子、水果和蔬菜。
We've got oranges, fruits and vegetables.

475
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,440
现在我们只需要一些黄油，一些牛奶，还有.
Now all we need is some butter, some milk, and...

476
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,480
.一些咖啡.
...some coffee.

477
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
而且我们的糖浆也用完了。
And we're also out of syrup.

478
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,080
那是最新的款式吗？
Is that the latest fashion?

479
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,840
不，妈妈，那是最古老的职业。
No, Mom, that's the oldest profession.

480
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,960
-妓女？-哦，是的。
- Whores? - Oh, yes.

481
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,200
怎么又知道了？
How do you know?

482
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
这只是一个作家的本能。
Just a writer's instinct.

483
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,760
-我想和他们中的一个谈谈-来吧.
- I want to talk with one of them. - Come on.

484
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,760
不，我想问她一些事情。
No, I want to ask her about something.

485
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,920
-关于什么？-我想问她关于欲望的事！
- About what? - I want to ask her about lust!

486
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,160
妈妈!
Mom!

487
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,240
哦!这下糟了。
Oh, boy.

488
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,880
请原谅我。我叫珍妮·菲尔兹。你是妓女吗？
Pardon me. My name is Jenny Fields. Are you a prostitute?

489
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,360
这事与你有何关系？
What's it to you?

490
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,400
我叫加普。我妈妈和我只是..。
My name's Garp. My mother and I were just...

491
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,200
-你母亲？-我很乐意付钱给你.
- Your mother? - I'll be glad to pay you.

492
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,880
-是的，你看，我母亲.-没有.
- Yes, you see, my mother... - No.

493
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,360
我不喜欢古怪的东西。你想要这些，去第八大道吧。
I don't go for no kinky stuff. You want any of that, go to 8th Avenue.

494
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,280
-她只是想和你谈谈.-你们的常规费用是多少？
- She just wants to talk to you. - What's your regular charge?

495
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,320
-问几个问题。-10美元够吗？
- Ask a few questions. - Would $10 be enough?

496
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,120
10美元？
$10?

497
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,440
-通常是什么？-我不知道.那得看情况。
- What's the usual? - I don't know. It depends.

498
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
我给你20美元。
I'll give you $20.

499
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,640
我们去个地方喝杯咖啡，暖暖身子聊聊天。
We'll go someplace where we can get a cup of coffee, get warm and talk.

500
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,680
你付咖啡钱了吗？
You pay for the coffee?

501
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,160
当然了。
Of course.

502
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,400
搞什么鬼。去。
What the hell. Go.

503
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,080
妈妈，我们现在可以走了吗？
Mom, can we go now?

504
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
你感觉到什么了吗？
Do you feel anything?

505
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,440
你从中得到了什么身体上的享受吗？
Do you get any physical enjoyment from it?

506
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,480
我工作的时候不会。哦，有时候。
Not when I'm working. Oh, sometimes.

507
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
你觉得男人为什么喜欢你？
Why do you think men like you?

508
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,880
-我们真的得走了.-你喜欢她吗？
- We've really got to go. - Do you like her?

509
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,680
-她人很好，妈妈，但是.-你到底想要她什么？
- She's nice, Mom, but... - What is it about her that you want?

510
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,600
我指的不只是她的性爱部分。
I don't mean just her sex parts.

511
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,600
我是说，还有什么让人满意的吗？
I mean, is there something else that's satisfying?

512
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,280
这是一种组合。
It's a combination.

513
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,440
你觉得这样被需要是什么感觉？
How do you feel to be wanted in that way?

514
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,240
让我儿子那样想要你是不是有损你的身份？
Does it degrade you to have my son want you in that way?

515
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,920
或者你认为这只会贬低他？
Or do you think it only degrades him?

516
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,960
我不知道。
I don't know.

517
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,560
你想要她吗？你想要她就像你想要海伦一样吗？
Do you want her? Do you want her like you want Helen?

518
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,480
是同样的欲望吗？
Is it the same kind of want?

519
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,720
你真的很想和她做爱。
You really want to have sex with her.

520
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,440
嗯，你有吗？
Well, do you?

521
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,440
是。
Yes.

522
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,960
我当然认为了。
Of course I do.

523
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,360
好的。
All right.

524
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,280
听着，如果你妈妈想买我给你，我没问题。
Look, it's all right with me if your mother wants to buy me for you.

525
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,880
但是她不能和我们一起去。
But she can't come along with us.

526
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,320
-没有.-绝对不行.
- No. - Absolutely not.

527
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,040
我不会让她监视我们的。信不信由你，我还是天主教徒。
I will not have her watching us. I am still a Catholic, believe it or not.

528
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,720
-你想要什么好玩的.-我不打算看.
- You want anything funny... - I don't intend to watch.

529
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,800
我已经听够了。非常感谢您抽出时间来。
I've heard quite enough. Thank you so much for your time.

530
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,040
我想，你可以做你想做的事，或者你必须做的事。
You do what you want to do, or what you have to do, I guess.

531
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,320
-给你.-别在这里给我钱！
- Here. - Don't give me money here!

532
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
为什么不行？
Why not?

533
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,920
因为这是违法的，妈妈。
Because it's illegal, Mom.

534
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,120
-为什么？-因为就是这样，这就是原因
- Why? - Because it is, that's why.

535
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,560
那太傻了。
That's silly.

536
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,520
这是她的身体。她为什么不能按她想要的方式使用呢？
It's her body. Why shouldn't she use it the way she wants to?

537
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,520
这里。
Here.

538
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,600
待会儿见。
I'll see you later.

539
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,640
晚安。
Good night.

540
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
非常感谢。
Thank you so much.

541
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,720
你妈妈是个怪人。
Your mother's weird.

542
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
可以这么说。
You could say that.

543
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,760
妈妈?
Mom?

544
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,560
你干吗呢？
What are you doing?

545
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,920
写作。
Writing.

546
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,520
关于什么？
About what?

547
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,640
与你无关。
None of your business.

548
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,060
别再烦我了。
Just lay off me.

549
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,860
自从我们上了飞机，你就一直在骂我！
You've been hammering at me ever since we got on the plane!

550
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,900
-我告诉过你我们应该留在芝加哥！-来吧，瑞秋！
- I told you we should've stayed in Chicago! - Come on, Rachel!

551
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,220
别“瑞秋”我，斯蒂芬！只要别“瑞秋”我就行了！
Don't "Rachel" me, Stephen! Just don't "Rachel" me!

552
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,420
拿上你们的床垫！把你们的床垫放在下面！
Get your mattresses! Put your mattresses under!

553
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,260
缓冲他的跌落！
Cushion his fall!

554
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,460
跳!跳!
Jump! Jump!

555
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,460
往前跳吧！
Go ahead and jump!

556
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,020
天哪!斯蒂芬!
Oh, my God! Stephen!

557
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,940
瑞秋?
Rachel?

558
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,300
还记得芝加哥吗？
Remember Chicago?

559
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,900
你是?
Do you?

560
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,700
还记得这些吗，瑞秋？你是?
Remember these, Rachel? Do you?

561
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,060
我再也不想要它们了！
I don't want them anymore!

562
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,700
“唱歌上还会有其他歌曲。
"There will be other songs to sing

563
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,420
-“又一个秋天，又一个春天”-下来吧，斯蒂芬！
- "Another fall, another spring" - Come down, Stephen!

564
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,700
“但是会有的……”
"But there will..."

565
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,420
小心!
Watch out!

566
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,180
井?
Well?

567
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,820
这是..。
It's...

568
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,500
.有点单薄。
...a bit thin.

569
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,780
重要的不是数量。
It's not quantity that counts.

570
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,900
谢天谢地！这对我来说已经足够了。
Thank God for that! This is good enough for me.

571
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,460
这不是很有艺术性。
That's not very artistic.

572
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,740
我不是艺术家。
I'm not an artist.

573
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,660
我是一名护士。我差不多是时候回去做这件事了。
I'm a nurse. It's about time I got back to it.

574
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,060
我想成为一名艺术家，我想知道你是怎么想的。
I want to be an artist, and I want to know what you thought of it.

575
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,380
我不太清楚我是不是听懂了。
I'm not sure I understand it.

576
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,100
妈妈，这很简单。
Mom, it's very simple.

577
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,220
当他戴上他的魔术手套时，他可以创造奇迹。
He can do wonders when he's wearing his magic gloves.

578
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,260
如果他的妻子伤心，他只会用手套抚摸她，她就会很开心。
If his wife is sad, he just touches her with his gloves, and she's happy.

579
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,860
如果他的孩子在哭，他只需抚摸他们，他们就会微笑。
If his children are crying, he just touches them, and they smile.

580
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,820
但是他感觉不到他们！
But he can't feel them!

581
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,660
他渴望感受。
He yearns to feel.

582
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,700
他甚至可以用他的魔法手套阻止死亡，但他感觉不到生命。
He can even hold off death with his magic gloves, but he can't feel life.

583
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,340
所以他脱下手套，然后就死了。
So he takes off the gloves, and he dies.

584
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,980
但是，当他飞向死亡的怀抱时，他终于感受到了生命。
But, he finally feels life as he's flying into the arms of death.

585
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,500
我喜欢这样。
I like that.

586
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,420
如果是这个意思，我喜欢。
If that's what it means, I like it.

587
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,420
让我看看你的。
Let me see yours.

588
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,740
不，我得走了。
No, I've got to go.

589
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,860
那是不公平的。我给你看了我的。你应该给我看看你的。
That's not fair. I showed you mine. You should show me yours.

590
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,700
你觉得这是什么？和Cushie一起的“医生办公室”？
What do you think this is? "Doctor's Office" with Cushie?

591
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,100
-我有个约会。-和谁？
- I have an appointment. - With who?

592
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,260
是谁。
Whom.

593
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,420
妈妈，您约的是谁？
With whom is your appointment, Mother?

594
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,300
和他在一起。他是个出版商。他看起来是个好人。
With him. He's a publisher. He looks like a nice man.

595
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,060
我会让他出版我的书。
I'll let him publish my book.

596
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,100
-让他去？-有何不可？
- Let him? - Why not?

597
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:22,140
把那个拿来，好吗？我们可以退货。
Bring that along, will you? We can return it.

598
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,420
-来吧！-好的，妈妈。
- Come along! - Yes, Mother.

599
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,140
“在这个肮脏的世界里，你要么是某人的妻子.
"In this dirty minded world you are either somebody's wife...

600
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,620
“.或者某人的妓女.
"...or somebody's whore...

601
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,380
“……或者在你成为其中之一的道路上快马加鞭。”
"...or fast on your way to becoming one or the other."

602
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,860
我也这么想。你不觉得吗？
I think so. Don't you?

603
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,140
说实话，我从来没有想过这件事，但是……
To tell you the truth, I've never given the matter much thought but...

604
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,620
加普！是那么回事吗？加普？
Garp! Is that right? Garp?

605
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,780
没错。加普。
That's right. Garp.

606
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,220
你没有写我吧，是吗？
You didn't write about me, did you?

607
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,140
我写了我的生活。你是其中的一部分。
I wrote about my life. You're a part of it.

608
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,940
-但是当我想写你的.-我儿子也是一名作家。
- But when I wanted to write about your... - My son is also a writer.

609
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,860
短篇小说。
Short stories.

610
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,340
>性犯罪嫌疑人</
>Sexual Suspect</

611
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,380
我想要一份工作，我想一个人住。
I wanted a job, and I wanted to live alone.

612
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,980
所以我成了性嫌疑犯。
That made me a sexual suspect.

613
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,220
我想要一个孩子，但我不想为了要一个孩子而分享我的生活。
I wanted a baby, but I didn't want to share my life in order to have one.

614
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,860
这也让我成了性嫌疑犯。
That also made me a sexual suspect.

615
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,740
噢。
Oh.

616
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,340
-我想表达内心的渴望.-好的，我会打电话给你的.
- I wanted to express an inner longing... - Well, I'll call you.

617
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,500
这不公平。你说我不能写关于你的事。
That wasn't fair. You said I couldn't write about you.

618
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,340
天哪。
Oh, my God.

619
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,380
走开!
Go away!

620
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,580
井?
Well?

621
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,220
这是..。
It's...

622
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,260
.太悲哀了.
...so sad.

623
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,420
真的？
Really?

624
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,380
太悲哀了！
So sad!

625
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,620
太好了。我是说，谢谢你。
That's great. I mean, thank you.

626
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,740
这是我读过的最悲伤的故事！
It's the saddest story I have ever read!

627
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,980
太棒了！我高兴极了。
That's wonderful! I'm so happy.

628
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,980
我很伤心!
I'm so sad!

629
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,540
海伦，你知道这篇文章要发表在“评论”上吗<
Helen, do you know that this is going be published in The Review<

630
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,580
妈妈的出版商说他也会出版我的第一本小说。
Mom's publisher said that he'll publish my first novel, too.

631
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,940
你认为我会成为一个真正的作家吗？
Do you think I'll be a real writer?

632
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,780
我知道。哦，我知道！
I do. Oh, I do!

633
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,100
你说过你只会嫁给真正的作家。
You said you'd only marry a real writer.

634
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,780
我做到了。
I did.

635
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,300
我确实是这么想的。
And I do.

636
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,460
我也是。
I do, too.

637
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,740
太恶心了。
It's sickening.

638
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,780
纽约的每家书店都是这样的。
Every bookstore in New York looks like this.

639
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,420
美国每一家书店。
Every bookstore in the U.S.

640
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,980
她该死的知道什么是性欲？她从来没有感觉到。一次也没有。
What the hell does she know about lust? She never felt it. Not even once.

641
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,020
她是某种权威。
Some authority she is.

642
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,180
这就像听一种植物描述哺乳动物的动机。
It's like listening to a plant describe the motives of a mammal.

643
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,380
这是时机的问题。
It's the timing.

644
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,420
时机到了。我以为写作应该是写作。
Timing. I thought writing is supposed to be the writing.

645
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,180
在写作上，它就是写作。在出版业，关键在于时机。
In writing, it is writing. In publishing, it's timing.

646
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,460
我自己都惊呆了。这让人心烦意乱！
I'm stunned, myself. It upsets people!

647
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,420
我不知道珍妮怎么样，但我因为发表它而收到敌意邮件。
I don't know about Jenny, but I'm getting hate mail for publishing it.

648
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,100
这是危险的东西，而且危险的东西卖得很好。
It's dangerous stuff, and dangerous stuff sells.

649
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,860
以这样或那样的方式..。
In one way or another...

650
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,060
..。我们都被怀疑过..。
... we have all been suspect...

651
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,380
..。我们所有的生命。
... all of our lives.

652
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,980
我们一直被怀疑是较弱的性别。
We have been suspect as the weaker sex.

653
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,300
当我们表现出实力时，人们怀疑我们不够软弱。
When we showed strength, we were suspect as not being weak enough.

654
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,820
当我们展示情报时，我们被怀疑掩盖.
When we showed intelligence, we were suspect of covering up...

655
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,300
..。我们大脑中女性气质的一些缺陷。
... some defect in our femininity with our brains.

656
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,940
知道什么最让我恼火吗？
Know what really gets my goat?

657
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,820
她写的关于我的故事。
That she wrote about me.

658
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,980
我被认为是珍妮·菲尔兹的私生子。
I am known as the bastard son of Jenny Fields.

659
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,980
你好，很高兴再次见到你。
Hello, how nice to see you again.

660
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,660
你好吗？
How are you doing?

661
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,860
-很好，谢谢你.-是吗？
- Very well, thank you. - Yeah?

662
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,020
非常感谢你所做的一切。
Thank you so much for everything.

663
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,820
搞什么鬼。我在里面吗？
What the hell. Am I in it?

664
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,740
-在某种程度上。-是吗？
- In a way. - Yeah?

665
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,380
我会读的。
I'll read it.

666
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,980
她会变得非常非常富有。
She is going to be very, very rich.

667
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,060
而且非常非常有名。
And very, very famous.

668
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,140
-我明白了.-我不认为你有.
- I get the picture. - I don't think you do.

669
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,580
你是个很棒的作家。
You're a wonderful writer.

670
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,100
你的小说是我读过的第一部小说中最好的。
Your novel is as good a first novel as I've read.

671
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,700
我很自豪能出版它。
I'm proud to publish it.

672
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,740
但你母亲写了一份政治宣言。
But your mother has written a political manifesto.

673
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,980
她是邪教，不是作家。
She's a cult, not a writer.

674
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,100
嗨。
Hi.

675
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,580
-你能在里面写点什么吗？-好的
- Could you write something in there? - Yes.

676
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,140
这是给我丈夫弗兰克的。
It's for Frank, my husband.

677
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,900
“亲爱的弗兰克，孩子们在学校，狗在院子里……
"Dear Frank, the kids are in the school, the dog is in the yard...

678
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,260
“……我走了，走了，走了。爱你的，露丝。”
"...and I am gone, gone, gone. Love, Ruth."

679
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,740
-我想你最好把它写下来。-谢谢你.这就做。
- I think you'd better write that. - Thank you. I will.

680
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,500
我们不是弱小，而是一股需要对付的力量！
We're neither little nor weak, but a force to be dealt with!

681
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,140
美国的女人们渴望一位女英雄。
The women of America, hungry for a heroine...

682
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,780
..。终于在珍妮·菲尔兹身上找到了一个！
... have at last found one in Jenny Fields!

683
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,340
美国人很快就会知道那是什么意思。
The men of America will soon find out what that means.

684
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,580
妈妈!
Mom!

685
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,260
我很好，亲爱的！
I'm all right, darling!

686
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,980
在这个安静的地方，你通常找不到这么漂亮的房子。
You don't usually find homes this lovely in this quiet a location.

687
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,820
这不是很好吗？这条街不是很漂亮吗？
Isn't this nice? Isn't this a beautiful street?

688
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,860
还有景观美化。他们用草坪做了一些可爱的事情。
And the landscaping. They've done lovely things with the lawn.

689
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,060
这是个不错的地方。
It's a lovely place.

690
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,460
可爱的。
Lovely.

691
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,220
正好是年轻婚姻的入场券。
Just the ticket for young marrieds.

692
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,500
我的公司甚至会为抵押贷款提供资金。
And my firm will even finance the mortgage.

693
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,220
我妈妈会付钱的。这些天她已经成为一家公司了。
My mother's paying for it. She's become a firm these days.

694
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,860
你觉得呢，海伦？
What do you think, Helen?

695
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,020
这是个家吗？
Is it a home?

696
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,540
它离我将要教书的那所学院很近。
It's close to the college where I'll be teaching.

697
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,260
而且离我要去购物的超市很近。
And close to the supermarket where I'll be shopping.

698
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,100
就像我们的房子一样。
Just like our house.

699
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,220
我工作，我丈夫在家里闲逛。
I work, and my husband putters around the house.

700
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,460
我丈夫不会推杆。他是个作家。
My husband doesn't putter. He's a writer.

701
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,500
他的小说刚刚出版：T.S.G.的“拖延症”
His novel was just published: Procrastination by T.S. G

702
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:54,580
T.S.加普？不是珍妮·菲尔兹的私生子？
T.S. Garp? Not the bastard son of Jenny Fields?

703
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,540
我喜欢你妈妈的书！
I loved your mother's book!

704
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,940
我很喜欢。
Loved it.

705
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,820
我一直在买，而我丈夫一直在烧掉它们！
I keep buying them, and my husband keeps burning them!

706
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,420
你也要写作。
And you write, too.

707
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,820
这不是很好吗？
Isn't that nice?

708
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,540
你一定为你母亲感到骄傲。
You must be so proud of your mother.

709
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,860
我为妈妈感到非常非常自豪。
I'm very, very proud of Mom.

710
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,260
你们在下面还好吗？
You folks all right down there?

711
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,220
是的，我很好。我们都很好。但是你还好吗？
Yeah, I'm okay. We're all right. But are you all right?

712
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,660
我很好。
I'm fine.

713
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,260
介意我用一下你的电话吗？
You mind if I use your phone?

714
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,740
当然可以，如果你能找到的话。
Sure, if you can find it.

715
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,820
非常感谢。
Thanks a lot.

716
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,260
我们要买下这房子。
We'll take the house.

717
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,460
另一架飞机撞上这座房子的可能性是天文数字。
The chances of another plane hitting this house are astronomical.

718
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,060
它已经预先灾难过了。我们在这里会很安全的。
It's been pre-disastered. We're going to be safe here.

719
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,100
-怎么了？-没什么.
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

720
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,420
是的，有。
Yes, there is.

721
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,940
没人买我的小说。
Nobody is buying my novel.

722
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,380
我开始了我的第二次，同样是无名小卒.
I'm starting my second and the same nobodies...

723
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,460
.也要排队不买那个了。
...are going to line up not to buy that one, too.

724
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,220
我刚在“时代”杂志上读到一篇文章。
ave just read in Time magazin

725
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,820
.我母亲的书已经被翻译成阿帕契语了
...that my mother's book has been translated into Apache.

726
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,940
阿帕奇，海伦！
Apache, Helen!

727
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,020
甚至连莎士比亚或狄更斯都没有被翻译成阿帕契语！
Not even Shakespeare or Dickens has been translated into Apache!

728
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,580
她来得很及时。
She's timely.

729
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,540
她引起了女人们想要听到的共鸣。评论家们把她打得体无完肤。
She struck a chord women wanted to hear. Reviewers took her to pieces.

730
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,780
他们对你的书赞不绝口。
They said wonderful things about your book.

731
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,860
是啊，但我不想要评论。我想要一个观众。一大群观众。
Yeah, but I don't want reviews. I want an audience. A big audience.

732
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,060
我的一个学生今天在课堂上提到了你。
One of my students brought you up in class today.

733
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,340
他甚至不知道我们结婚了。
He didn't even know we were married.

734
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,580
Y开始谈论魔法手套<
y started talking about Magic Gloves<

735
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,380
判决结果如何？
What was the verdict?

736
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,940
他们很喜欢。
They loved it.

737
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,420
其中一人甚至称它为中篇小说，而不是短篇小说。
One of them even called it a novella instead of a short story.

738
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,140
我喜欢那孩子。
I like that kid.

739
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,780
我相信还有一个孩子你也会喜欢的。
There's another kid I'm sure you're going to like, too.

740
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,460
真的？他长得怎样？
Really? What's he like?

741
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,940
还不能说。
Can't tell yet.

742
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,980
安静的类型？
Quiet type?

743
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,340
是啊，是真的。他很年轻。
Yeah, real. He's very young.

744
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,900
一个真正的孩子。
A real baby.

745
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,980
我邀请他过来见你。
I invited him over to meet you.

746
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,380
什么时候?
When?

747
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,340
大概七个半月后就会到了。
Should be here in about seven and a half months.

748
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,460
别哭了。
Don't cry.

749
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,180
我才是那个应该哭的人。
I'm the one who's supposed to be crying.

750
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,540
这里的一切都得我来做。
I've got to do everything around here.

751
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,980
我得做饭了。我得打扫一下。我要哭了。
I've got to cook. I've got to clean. I've got to cry.

752
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,740
他在里面吗-是的
- He's in there? - Yeah.

753
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,020
里面很不错。我知道呀。
It's nice in there. I know.

754
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,620
可爱的小家伙，不是吗？
Cute little bugger, isn't he?

755
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,460
这是我们的孩子。
It's our baby.

756
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,700
我要亲吻我们的孩子。
I've got to kiss our baby.

757
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,540
来吧，邓肯。说“爸爸”
Come on, Duncan. Say "Dada."

758
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,220
这很简单。哒。
It's easy. Da-da.

759
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,460
任何人都会说“妈妈”邓肯。拜托，别再折磨我了。
Anybody can say "Mama," Duncan. Come on, quit torturing me.

760
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,380
说“爸爸”说出来！
Say "Dada." Say it!

761
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,780
好了，邓肯！我是加普中士。
All right, Duncan! This is Technical Sergeant Garp.

762
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,180
让你自己轻松点。别像个孩子一样。
Make it easy on yourself. Don't be a baby.

763
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,620
说“爸爸”
Say "Dada."

764
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,660
嘿，你！等一下！
Hey, you! Wait!

765
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,980
听着，这是个住宅区。
Look, this is a residential neighborhood.

766
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,140
居民大多是不能照顾自己的孩子。
The residents are mostly kids who can't look out for themselves.

767
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,980
所以，我们有责任照顾他们。
So, it's up to us to look out for them.

768
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,860
这意味着我们必须遵守限速。
This means that we have to follow the speed limit.

769
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,300
是啊，是啊。
Yeah, yeah.

770
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,340
站住，你这个狗娘养的！
Stop, you son of a bitch!

771
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,980
每次我们来这里，都会有更多的人。
Every time we come here, there are more people.

772
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,300
天哪，他们在利用她。
Boy, they take advantage of her.

773
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,780
我想知道他们都是谁。
I wonder who they all are.

774
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,420
游手好闲的人，靠山吃山的人。
Moochers, hangers-on.

775
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,940
这就是当你变得富有和出名时会发生的事情。这就是我避开它的原因。
This is what happens when you become rich and famous. That's why I avoided it.

776
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,740
加普？
Garp?

777
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,540
见到你真是太好了！
How lovely to see you!

778
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,660
你看起来棒极了。
You look wonderful.

779
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,540
海伦。你好，亲爱的。
Helen. Hello, dear.

780
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,140
你好，邓肯。
Hello, Duncan.

781
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,220
给奶奶一个拥抱怎么样？
How about a hug for Grandma?

782
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,180
说“奶奶”
Say "Grandma."

783
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,500
不是的。
No.

784
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,340
好吧，进来吧。我带你上楼。
Well, come on inside. I'll take you upstairs.

785
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,140
嗨，你好。
Hi.

786
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,540
嗨。
Hi.

787
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:43,660
-那是谁？-是妈妈介绍我认识的人
- Who's that? - Somebody Mother introduced me to.

788
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,060
回到你的基层医院，怀特？
Back to your basic hospital white?

789
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,220
是。
Yes.

790
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,500
上楼来吧。我带您去看看您的房间。
Come on upstairs. I'll show you your rooms.

791
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,740
嗨，我叫T.S.加普。
Hi, my name's T.S. Garp.

792
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,260
别碰我!别碰我!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

793
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,940
-爱丽丝亲爱的，没事的，亲爱的-他碰了我！
- Alice dear, it's all right, darling. - He touched me!

794
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,980
-我很抱歉.我所做的就是摸了她一下。-没事的.
- I'm sorry. All I did was touch her. - It's all right.

795

It's going to be hard to avoid being touched, isn't it?

Garp just frightened Alice for a bit, but she's fine.

806
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,860

I'm sorry. All I did was just touch her.

807
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,740
没事的，亲爱的。大家都没事了！
It's all right, darling. It's all right, everyone!

808

回到你之前做的事情就行了。

她怎么了？

01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,140
-她是Ellen Jamesian家的人-那是什么意思？

你不知道Ellen Jamesian是什么吗？
You don't know what an Ellen Jamesian is?

821
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,700
它是被故意切断的。

...who they were or what they looked like.

这些妇女中的一些人以她的名义成立了一个协会。
Some of these women formed a society in her honor.

827
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,460
你的意思是，这个艾伦·詹姆斯协会不会说话，就好像他们没有舌头一样？
You mean, this Ellen James Society doesn't speak, as if they had no tongues?

828
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,420
不，我是说他们没有舌头。

-是的。这个社会..。-妈妈，我不想听这些狗屎！
- Yes. The society... - Mom, I don't want to hear about this shit!

833
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,900
你有点缺乏同情心。

我很同情一个被强奸的女孩。
I've got a lot of sympathy for a girl who gets raped.

835
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,780
但是上帝，这是自残！
But God, this is self-mutilation!

836
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,060
假设下一次发生强奸案，我会割下我的刺头，然后把它戴在脖子上。
Suppose the next time there's a rape, I cut off my prick and wear it around my neck.

837
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,900
我也有个好主意。为什么不剪掉你的乳房呢？
I got a good idea, too. Why not cut off your tits?

838
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,020
这样你的盔甲就合身了！
That way your armor will fit!

839
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,820
-没事的.-上帝啊！
- It's all right. - Jesus Christ!

840
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,340
把事情弄得比现在更糟是没有意义的。
No sense making things any worse than they are.

841

-整座房子都是.-我知道.

她是个很棒的人。

你似乎是这个地方唯一的正常人。
You just seem like the only normal person around the place.

847
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,180
哦，我不知道。

请原谅我。

Of course I can't. And they won't let me adopt.

直到我成为一个女人，我才知道我是如此地爱他们。
I didn't know I loved them so much until I became a woman.

903
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,420
如果我知道，我还是个男人的时候就会喝了。

这只是一次激烈的荷尔蒙攻击。

Right?

915
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,660
我们是文明人，文明人遵守规则！
We are civilized people, and civilized people obey the rules!

916
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,420
你这个新石器时代的笨蛋！
You Neolithic dipshit!

917
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,460
放开我！你干吗呢？
Get off me! What are you doing?

918
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,860
那是怎么回事？
What was that all about?

919
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:31,700
-他多年来一直在这个地区制造恐怖.-你不认为那是反应过度吗？
- He's been terrorizing the area for years. - You don't think that was overreacting?

操!
Fuck!

921
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:11,140
那个狗娘养的闯了同样的停车标志。
That son of a bitch ran that same stop sign.

922
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,300
你有一种让人皈依文明的地狱般的方式。
You have one hell of a way of making converts to civilization.

923
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,740
你从你母亲那里继承的唯一一样东西。

924
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,220
.就是你天生的惹恼别人的能力

只是我的一个循序渐进的学生。

-我不这么认为.-真的吗？
- I don't think so. - Really?

948

That way, I could see you flat-chested and watch you as your breasts grew.

962
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,900
你会看到我的乳房下垂，我的牙齿脱落.
You'll get to see my breasts sag, my teeth fall out...

...and my hair turn gray. It's not as exciting but...

964

我们的青春一去不复返了，不是吗？
Our youth is gone, isn't it?

965
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,780

-也许我们该搬家了.-为什么？

我是说，附近有核电站。

我们没有任何陌生人，但我是说.
We haven't had any strangers, but I mean...

976
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,900
陌生人可能会介入我们之间
...strangers can come between us.

977
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,740
你勾引那个保姆了吗？
Did you seduce that babysitter?

978
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:30,980
哦，看在上帝的份上！这真让我着迷！

我想读完这个故事。
I want to finish reading this story.

984
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,580
你在我床上看另一位作家。那是通奸！
You're reading another writer in my bed. That's adultery!

985
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:15,780
你看，一个陌生人挡住了我们的去路。
You see, a stranger has come between us.

986
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,180
迈克·斯诺。那很朗朗上口。
Mike Snow. That's catchy.

- Michael Milton. Is that his name? - Yes.

988
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,660

It sounds like a flavor in a gay ice cream parlor.

989

- Does he write sad stuff, too? - Hardly.

993

他是我的一个循序渐进的学生。

他足够聪明，他只是.

年轻，也许吧。

998
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,540
他只是很年轻。
He's just young.

999
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,340
很聪明，但很年轻。
Very bright, but young.

1000
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,660
多小？17岁？

他是青少年吗-我不知道

我们去看看孩子们吧。
Let's go look at the kids.

1005

我们昨晚看了他们。

杀了他们。杀了他们。

It's time to die, Sir Scum. I'm going to revenge my uncle's death.

-我也想死。-好的.
- I want to die, too. - All right.

1037

在他最后一口气的时候，人渣爵士设法爬了出来。
With his last dying breath, Sir Scum manages to crawl forth...

1038
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,460
.然后抛出他卑鄙的刀刃

1039

真对不起。
Sorry about that.

We have to end the war because of a pot roast. Isn't that a pity?

1041
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,340

I've got to go. It's late. Goodbye, darlings.

1044

你确定不能留下来吗？
Sure you can't stay?

1045

不，我得去曼哈顿痛痛欲绝。
No, I have to go and have a heartbreak in Manhattan.

1046

他很年轻，很英俊.我能做什么?
He's young, he's handsome... What can I do?

1047
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,140
也许这一次会有结果的。
Maybe this time it'll work out.

1048
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:33,380
也许是这样吧。在这个大男子主义的世界里，我是一个无可救药的浪漫主义者。
Maybe so. I'm a hopeless romantic in a male chauvinist world.

1049
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,420
再见，亲爱的！

If anyone finds out about this, it's over. Do you understand?

1056
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:24,340
-这是个小镇。-它不是那么小的一个小镇。
- It's a small town. - It's not that small a town.

1057

你一直在和玛吉·塔尔沃斯上床。
You've been sleeping with Marge Tallworth.

她出演了迪克森的话剧“穿越时代”。
She's in Dirckson's Drama through the Ages.

1059

这就是这个小镇有多小。
That's how small this town is.

1060
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,940
老师，你一直在做作业。
You've been doing your homework, teacher.

1061
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,140
我喜欢你叫我“老师”
I like you calling me "teacher."

1062
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:40,220
它突显了我们时代的不同。

1063
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:43,580
.并提醒我为什么要这么做所以，你可以坚持下去。
...and reminds me why I'm doing this. So, you can keep it up.

1064
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,900
这里不行。
Not here.

1065
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,060
只在你的公寓里。

1066
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:52,300
而且只有在它是干净的情况下。

1067
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,980
这只是那些日子中的一天，海伦。
It was just one of those days, Helen.

我看到你去上班了。

孩子们和我和罗伯塔玩了一场精彩的比赛。
The kids and I played a great game with Roberta.

1071

-我们打败了他，妈妈.-我们做到了我们杀了他！
- We beat him, Mom. - We did. We killed him!

1073
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,500
哦，天哪，是吗？
Oh, boy, did they?

1074
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:38,420
然后我们谈到了我从未写过圣诞故事的事实。
Then we talked about the fact that I have never written a Christmas story.

1075
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,580
-这是我的主意.-是的。故事功劳归功于邓肯。
- It was my idea. - It was. Story credit goes to Duncan.

1076
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,900
它将被命名为：儿童与鲸鱼的圣诞节<
It's going to be called: A Child's Christmas with a Whale<

1077
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,500
是关于这个跛脚的小女孩..。
It's about this little lame girl...

1078
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:51,020
.她遇到了一头搁浅的蓝鲸，还活着，她帮助了他.
...who runs across a beached blue whale, still alive, and she helps him.

1079
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,020
我来画画。
And I get to do the drawings.

1080
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,180
沃尔特可以做插图。
Walt gets to do the illustrations.

1081
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,340
你知道他有多棒吗？
Do you realize how good he is?

1082
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,500
这将是一个真正的家庭项目。
This is going to be a real family project.

1083
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,220
有时候你可以在一天内拥有一生……
Sometimes you can have a whole lifetime in a day...

1084
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,420
.甚至没有注意到这是生活中最美好的
...and never even notice that this is as beautiful as life gets.

1085
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,900
我只是很高兴我注意到了。
I just feel happy that I noticed.

1086
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,700
我今天过得很美好。我甚至死了，活着告诉了我这件事。
I had a beautiful life today. I even died and lived to tell about it.

1087
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,580

Oh, Walt, isn't this lovely? Look at him.

1093
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:48,820
他在说什么？
What's he saying?

1094
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,180
嘘-呼。
Boo-hoo.

1095

-真的是你自己做的吗-是的
- Did you really do them yourself? - Yes.

邓肯画的是鲸鱼的眉毛，但我画的是睡觉。
Duncan did the eyebrows on the whale, but I did the rest.

你爸爸以前画过画。
Your daddy used to draw.

1098
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,460
比不上你。
Not as well as you.

真的？
Really?

1108
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:40,460
没错。
That's right.

1109
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,620
总有一天，你也会变老的。“沃尔特老头”
You'll be old, too, someday. "Old Man Walt."

1110
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:49,340
年纪大了，还不错。实际上，这是一种不错的感觉。
It's not bad, being old. It's kind of nice, actually.

1116
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:15,420
我可以去游泳吗？
Can I go swimming?

1117
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,860
你当然可以，亲爱的。只是别跪着进去就行了。
Of course you can, darling. Just don't go in over your knees.

1118
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,900
好的，邓肯。赶快。赶快。

暂停。暂停。只有五个。

1120
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,740
那是怎么回事？一部新宪法？
What was that all about? A new constitution?

1121
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,620
他们遇到了危机。

1123

别再让其他女人伤害自己了。
And stop getting other women to hurt themselves.

1124
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,260
对她来说太好了！
Good for her!

1125
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:14,220
他们进行了投票，并决定继续进行。
They took a vote and decided to continue.

1126

他们会有一个艾伦·詹姆斯协会，艾伦·詹姆斯反对吗？
They'll have an Ellen James Society, and Ellen James is against it?

1127

做他们想做的事是他们的权利。
It's their right to do what they want.

她寄给我一张她自己的照片。

1129
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,540
-这就是那个小女孩-她不再小了.
- So this is the little girl. - She's not little anymore.

1130
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:32,100
她不想让任何人知道她现在的样子，或者她在哪里。
She doesn't want anyone to know what she looks like now, or where she is.

1131
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,540
仍然有男人会伤害她。
There still are men who would hurt her.

1132
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,380
可怜的孩子。她不仅要躲起来，而且要感到有责任感.
Poor kid. She not only has to hide, but she's got to feel responsible...

1133
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:41,980
.为了那些以她的名义把舌头打掉的女人
...for women whacking their tongues off in her name.

1134
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:46,260
如果我知道她在哪我会帮她的，但我找不到。
I'd help her if I knew how or even where she is, but I can't find out.

1135
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,220
-能给我吗？-什么？

我也不知道。
Don't know.

1138
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,260
沃尔特！

当心暗流！
Be careful of the undertow!

1141
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:40,420
你在纽约的伙伴工作得怎么样？
How's your fellow in New York working out?

1142
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,900
不是的，他说我让他觉得性暧昧。
It isn't. He says I make him feel sexually ambiguous.

1143
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,860
你能想象吗？
Can you imagine?

1144
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,460
对不起。
I'm sorry.

我下周五要去游轮旅行，住两个星期。地中海俱乐部。
I'm going on a cruise next Friday, for two weeks. The Club Med.

1146
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,460
也许情况会有所改变。
Maybe things will change.

1147
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:01,820
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,660
一些我的仇恨邮件。
Some of my hate mail.

1149
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:09,140
这个人希望我能被奥克兰突袭队轮奸。
This one hopes that I'll get gang banged by the Oakland Raiders.

1150
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,020
外面有很多病人。你妈妈会比这更糟的。
There are a lot of sick people out there. Your mother gets even worse than these.

1151
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,700
你在写什么吗？
You writing anything?

1152
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:18,980
不是的。
No.

1153
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,380
如果我能写作，我会感觉好些。也许吧。
If I could write, I'd feel better. Maybe.

1154
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,540
怎么了，罗伯塔？
What's the matter, Roberta?

1155
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,580
我不知道。
I don't know.

1156
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:36,420
我想我正在发展女性的直觉。
I think I'm developing female intuition.

1157
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:41,700
我不知道。可能没什么。
I don't know. It's probably nothing.

1158
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,420
-你来吗？-马上就来.
- You coming? - In a minute.

1159
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,460
蟾蜍？什么蟾蜍？
Toad? What toad?

1160
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,540
-我几乎很抱歉我们要回去了-家就是家。
- I'm almost sorry we're going back. - Home is home.

- Undertoad. - There's no toad under the water.

1162

孩子，你真了不起，沃尔特。

1163
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:20,900
-你听到了吗，爸爸？-那是什么？
- Did you hear that, Dad? - What's that?

You know, undertoad.

1166
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:33,540
先是循序渐进的学生，现在是低级学生。
First there was the gradual student, and now the undertoad.

-别这样，沃尔特是个好孩子-我知道.他就是不能说话。
- Come on, Walt's a fine kid. - I know. He just can't talk.

1168

我能为您做点什么？
Can I help you?

1169
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,020
那是什么？
What is it?

你找错房子了，找错人了。我叫加普。
You've got the wrong house, and the wrong guy. My name is Garp.

1172
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,980
你想要的是我妈妈。
It's my mother you want.

1173
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:19,540
我知道有关它的一切。我认为你做的事很可怕。
I know all about it. I think it's a hideous thing that you've done.

1174
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,900
我不知道你知道。
I didn't know you knew.

1175
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,380
你可以说话。
You can talk.

1176
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,580
为什么篮球运动员不能有孩子呢？
Why can't basketball players have kids?

1177
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,460
-因为他们是男的.-爸爸是个男的.
- Because they're guys. - Daddy's a guy.

1178
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,220
但是爸爸有妈妈。
But Daddy has Mommy.

1179
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:42,060
如果爸爸有妈妈，但他是个篮球运动员..。
If Daddy had Mommy, but he was a basketball player...

1180
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,780
.他为什么不能生孩子？
...why couldn't he have kids?

1181
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:48,700
但他是爸爸，她是妈妈。那就是说他们是有孩子的，对吧？
But he's a Daddy, and she's a Mommy. That means they do have kids, right?

1182
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:51,260
你真是太笨了。这只是个玩笑。
You're so dumb. It's a joke.

1183
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:54,340
你没说这是个玩笑。
You didn't say it was a joke.

1184
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,860
-你的手帕呢？-我没有。
- Where's your handkerchief? - I don't have one.

1185
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:08,980
这里。拿我的吧。
Here. Take mine.

1186
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:11,620
-我们为什么要在外面吃饭？-因为很好玩！
- How come we're eating out? - Because it's fun!

1187
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,740
听到了吗，沃尔特？我们玩得很开心。
Hear that, Walt? We're having fun.

1188
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:16,620
妈妈回家后打算吃什么？
What's Mom going to eat when she comes home?

1189
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,900
闭嘴，吃吧！
Shut up and eat!

1190
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,540
这真的很有趣，爸爸！
This sure is fun, Dad!

1191
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:27,220
加普？
Garp?

1192
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,060
邓肯！
Duncan!

1193
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,900
沃尔特！
Walt!

1194
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:17,580
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

1195
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:26,460
你好?
Hello?

1196
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:27,740
你好，海伦。
Hello, Helen.

1197
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:30,820
I>你在哪儿？-见鬼，你管我们在哪儿干嘛？
i>Where are you? - What the hell do you care where we are?

1198
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,580
你打电话给他，海伦。
You call him, Helen.

1199
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,220
你告诉那个懦夫..。
And you tell that wimp...

1200
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,940
我>..。都已经过去了。-我当然会的.
i>... it's all over. - Of course I will.

1201
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,540
你打电话给他，说：“再见。”在电话里。
You call him, and you say: "Good-bye." On the phone.

1202
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,740
路上没有最后一次操了。在电话里！
No last fucks for the road. On the phone!

1203
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:49,540
回家吧。没有你们所有人在这里我感觉糟透了。
Come home. I feel horrible without all of you here.

1204
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,900
沃尔特今天早上感冒了。他应该在家的。
Walt had a cold this morning. He should be home.

1205
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,460
回家！什么家？我们要去看电影。
Home! What home? We're going to go to a movie.

1206
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,580
我只是现在不能见你。
I just can't see you right now.

1207
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,100
你能不能把那狗屎给我剪了？
Will you cut that shit out?

1208
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,580
如果我们回家的话，我们会晚一点回家。
We'll be home later, if we come home at all.

1209
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:14,940
“家”这个词不断出现，但它听起来不再一样了。
The word '"home'"keeps coming up, but it doesn't sound the same anymore.

1210
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:25,020
快他妈的到后面去。快进去！
Get in the goddamn back. Get in there!

1211
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:33,740
-哦，迈克尔，该死的，你能听我说吗？我>你不能，海伦。你就是做不到。
- Oh, Michael, damn it, will you listen? i>You can't, Helen. You just can't.

1212
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:35,700
我>不是这样的。-我说了，结束了.
i>Not like this. - I said, it's over.

1213
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:39,300
我还得再见你一次。我这就过来。我马上就到。
I've got to see you one more time. I'm coming over. I'll be right there.

1214
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:40,860
你不能这么做！迈克尔!
You can't! Michael!

1215
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,740
-我不想看电影.-我也是.
- I don't feel like a movie. - Me neither.

1216
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,460
太糟糕了，我们走吧。
Too bad, let's go.

1217
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,220
-你猜怎么着？-什么？
- Guess what? - What?

1218
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:11,700
我想我们还是玩得很开心。
I think we're still having fun.

1219
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,180
-我一定要见你，海伦！-你必须走了.你不能进来。
- I've got to see you, Helen! - You must go. You can't come in.

1220
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:47,820
那就和我一起上车吧。
Then get in the car with me.

1221
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,500
-不，迈克尔，拜托！-我带了些香槟来。
- No, Michael, please! - I brought some champagne.

1222
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,860
-就一会儿.-我们哪儿也不去！
- Just for a minute. - We're not going anywhere!

1223
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:55,740
我知道呀。我只想坐下来和你谈谈。
I know. I just want to sit and talk with you.

1224
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:57,780
把钥匙给我。
Give me the keys.

1225
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:02,740
把你的车钥匙给我，我上车一会儿，然后你必须走了。
Give me your car keys and I'll get in the car for a minute, but then you must go.

1226
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:18,540
我马上回来。
I'll be right back.

1227
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:57,620
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1228
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,140
-电影还没拍完。-当我说结束的时候，它就结束了。
- The movie's not finished yet. - It's finished when I say it's finished.

1229
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:02,740
这才是真正的男子汉时代！
It's real macho time!

1230
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:05,020
-别再引用罗伯塔的话了。-我在引用奶奶的话.
- Stop quoting Roberta. - I'm quoting Granny.

1231
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,700
-他是，他在引用奶奶的话.-我不在乎.赶快。
- He is, he's quoting Granny. - I don't care. Come on.

1232
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:09,420
去你妈的吧！
Go fuck yourself!

1233
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:21,660
那里。我已经喝了两杯香槟了。你现在就得离开！
There. I've had two glasses of champagne. You have to leave now!

1234
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,980
我做不到，我就是做不到。
I can't. I just can't.

1235
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:27,860
我告诉过你，一旦有人发现这件事，一切就结束了。
I told you, the minute anyone found out about this, it was over.

1236
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:32,020
但你是我唯一的亲人。我和玛吉分手了。
But you're all I've got. I broke up with Marge.

1237
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:34,540
你和玛吉分手太晚了。
You broke up with Marge too late.

1238
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:37,380
做个男子汉，迈克尔。
Be a man, Michael.

1239
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:40,180
是你挑起的。现在像个男子汉一样离开吧！
You started it. Now be a man and leave!

1240
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:49,660
就像在水下一样。
It's like being underwater.

1241
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:52,700
是啊，你也知道谁住在水下。
Yeah, and you know who lives underwater.

1242
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:57,140
可怕的、丑陋的、低级的蟾蜍！
The terrible, the ugly, undertoad!

1243
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:01,900
如果我们能再来一次的话.
If we could have just one more time...

1244
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:05,020
-迈克尔！-我们就不用离开车了
- Michael! - We wouldn't have to leave the car.

1245
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:11,140
天哪。这就是你想要的吗？
Oh, my God. Is that what you want?

1246
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:14,020
我一直希望你这么做。
I always wanted you to.

1247
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,980
哦，上帝!
Oh, God!

1248
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:18,020
请?
Please?

1249
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,940
如果我做了，你会离开吗？
If I do it, will you leave then?

1250
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,460
-你保证吗？-是的。
- Do you promise? - Yes.

1251
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,900
-保证？-我保证
- Promise? - I promise.

1252
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:45,940
那就来飞翔吧，爸爸。我们想去飞翔。
Make it fly, Dad. We want to fly.

1253
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,180
就像做梦一样。
It's like a dream.

1254
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,260
你晒得很黑。
You got a nice tan.

1255
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:47,940
我就知道这么多。
That's all I got.

1256
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,460
收到你的信后，我尽快赶来。
I came as soon as I could after your letter.

1257
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,980
不管怎么说，这次游轮是一场灾难。
The cruise was a disaster, anyway.

1258
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,740
我很高兴你来了。
I'm glad you're here.

1259
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,460
他们怎么样？
How are they?

1260
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:00,500
我们这里需要你。还有很多治疗工作要做。
We need you here. There's a lot of healing yet to be done.

1261
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:25,140
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

1262
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,860
一切都很好。
It was fine.

1263
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,060
不，不是。很无聊。
No, it wasn't. It was a bore.

1264
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:10,580
我很想你们，我等不及要回去了。
I missed you all, and I couldn't wait to get back.

1265
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:24,220
进来吧。我带您上楼去您的房间。
Come on in. I'll take you up to your room.

1266
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,780
医生说他会没事的。
The doctor says he'll be fine...

1267
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:35,060
.一旦他们把他舌头上的缝线拆开，把他的下巴拆开。
...once they take the stitches out of his tongue and unwire his jaw.

1268
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:37,220
至少他过得比..。
At least he's better off than...

1269
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:40,060
他叫什么名字-迈克尔·米尔顿
- What was his name? - Michael Milton.

1270
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,060
是的，米尔顿。
Yes, Milton.

1271
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:47,540
我是说，我在全身麻醉下做了手术切除我的。
I mean, I had mine removed surgically under general anesthesia.

1272
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,580
但是要把它咬下来..。
But to have it bitten off...

1273
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,300
这是一场噩梦。
It's a nightmare.

1274
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,020
这是欲望。
It's lust.

1275
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,780
见鬼，你到底是怎么回事？
What the hell's the matter with you?

1276
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,980
你以为你是这里唯一心碎的人吗？
You think you're the only one around here with a broken heart?

1277
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,980
你是这么想的吗？
Is that what you think?

1278
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,860
嗯，你不是。
Well, you're not.

1279
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:47,860
看看你周围！
Look around you!

1280
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:51,540
这屋子里全是他们！而我的就是一个！
This house is full of them! And mine is one!

1281
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:17,540
劳蕾尔！
Laurel!

1282
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:25,340
现在，抓紧它。
Now, hold on to it.

1283
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:30,820
-明白了吗？-是的，我明白了.你现在可以放手了。
- Got it? - Yeah, I got it. You can let go now.

1284
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,860
风吹得越多，你就能放得越多。
The more the wind blows, the more you can let out.

1285
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,780
嘿，你呀!假阴茎！
Hey, you! Dildo!

1286
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:40,220
这是你们收容我的桂冠的精神病院吗？
Is this the nuthouse where you're keeping my Laurel?

1287
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,180
-呆在这儿别动.-好的.
- Stay right here. - Okay.

1288
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:43,180
劳蕾尔来了..。
Laurel is here...

1289
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:45,340
.但我们并不是真的要“留住她”
...but we're not exactly "keeping her."

1290
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:49,620
-胡说，你这个大同性恋！-我不是同性恋.劳蕾尔在等你吗？
- Bullshit, you big dyke! - I am not a dyke. Is Laurel expecting you?

1291
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:53,140
去你妈的，你这个混蛋-这就是你们男人所理解的，就是暴力.
- Fuck you, you douche bag. - That's all you men understand, is violence.

1292
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,140
我知道这里出没的是什么样的人。
I know what sort of creeps hang around here.

1293
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:57,220
这是一个很大的女同性恋场景！
It's a big lesbian scene!

1294
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,420
你是干什么的？
What are you?

1295
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,620
房子的主人，还是宫廷的太监？
The man of the house, or the court eunuch?

1296
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,060
劳蕾尔！你在里面吗，婊子？
Laurel! You in there, you bitch?

1297
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,260
你好。
Hello.

1298
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:07,860
我知道你是谁。
I know who you are.

1299
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,580
-我的Laurel不是你喜欢的类型，亲爱的-也许她也不是你喜欢的类型。
- My Laurel's not your type, sweetie. - Perhaps she's not your type, either.

1300
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:15,340
听着，该死的！如果你不把劳蕾尔的屁股弄出来，我就.
Listen, goddamn it! If you don't get Laurel's ass out here, I'm going to...

1301
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,580
兰迪！
Randy!

1302
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,860
你还好吗-宝贝你找到我了
- Are you all right? - Baby, you found me.

1303
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:27,180
我想我开不了这该死的车。
I don't think I can drive the fucking car.

1304
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,820
没关系，我会开车。你就是从来不让我这么做。
That's all right, I can drive. You just never let me.

1305
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:31,740
我想兰迪需要我。
I guess Randy needs me.

1306
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,740
-冷静点！-对不起，宝贝。
- Easy! - Sorry, baby.

1307
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:37,660
疯狂的女同性恋让我措手不及。
Crazy dyke blindsided me.

1308
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:53,420
我老实告诉你，孩子。
I'll tell you honestly, son.

1309
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:56,780
我认为你的行为非常恶劣。
I think you've been behaving very badly.

1310
01:51:56,940 --> 01:52:00,500
我一直在看着你，我和海伦谈过了。
I've been watching you, and I've been talking to Helen.

1311
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:02,900
发生了什么事。
What happened happened.

1312
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:05,380
你责怪她不会改变这一点。
Your blaming her isn't going to change that.

1313
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:07,660
她受伤了，你也受伤了。
She's hurt, and you're hurt.

1314
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:10,740
你就一直往伤口上撒盐。
And you just keep pouring salt on the wounds.

1315
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:13,860
护士的儿子可不能这么做。
That's no way for the son of a nurse to behave.

1316
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:16,300
治好你自己，该死的！
Heal yourself, damn it!

1317
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:20,660
在你们两个还来得及的时候，帮她疗伤。

进来。
Come in.

1319
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,380
你看医生了吗？
Did you see the doctor?

1320
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:53,740
他拆线了吗？
Did he take out the stitches?

1321
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,420
你能说话吗？
Can you speak?

1322
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,740
我想念你。
I miss you.

1323
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,020
我也很想你。
I miss you, too.

1324
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:12,380
我真的很想你。
I really miss you.

1325
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,300
我也是。

1326
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:23,020
我想念沃尔特！

01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:33,460
我想再要一个孩子，加普。
I want another child, Garp.

1329
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:36,380
-真的吗-是的你不觉得吗？
- You do? - Yes. Don't you?

1330
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,340
当然了!
Of course!

1331
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:42,100
越快越好！
As soon as possible!

1332
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:50,260
我真的，真的很抱歉！
I'm so, so sorry!

1333
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:53,740
不，我很抱歉。
No, I'm sorry.

1334
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:58,860
-不，我太.-哦，不.对不起。
- No, I'm so... - Oh, no. I'm sorry.

1335
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:10,020
你可以在任何场合订购一只漂亮的玻璃眼。
You can order a nice glass eye for any occasion.

1336
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:12,300
这是真的吗？
Is that really true?

1337
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:16,380
是。情人节，你可以买一个有心的。
Yes. For Valentine's Day, you can have one with a heart.

1338
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,420
七月四日的旗帜。
A flag for the Fourth of July.

1339
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,900
-感恩节吃火鸡？-如果你坚持的话
- A turkey for Thanksgiving? - Lf you insist.

1340
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,540
我知道我想要什么。
I know what I want.

1341
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:28,500
圣诞节，我想要一只玻璃眼，就像他们的水晶球一样……
For Christmas, I want a glass eye like one of those crystal balls they have...

1342
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:30,300
.里面有雪。
...with snow inside of them.

1343
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:32,980
我像这样向后仰着头，然后像这样.
I tip my head back like this, and then like this...

1344
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,540
.然后有雪落在我的眼睛里
...and then there's snow falling in my eye.

1345
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:36,940
听起来很棒。
That sounds wonderful.

1346
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:41,180
听。
Listen.

1347
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,420
爸爸又在写信了吗？
Is Daddy writing again?

1348
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:47,460
噢，邓肯！
Oh, Duncan!

1349
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,780
我看到一个只有一条腿的人。
I see a man with one leg.

1350

我希望你能重新考虑一下。
I wish you'd reconsider.

1351
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:01,780
我要把它出版。人们利用她。他们夺走了她的生命。
I want it published. People used her. They took her life away.

1352
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,780
-你也在利用她-我只是在帮她陈述她的情况
- You're using her, too. - I'm just helping her state her case.

1353
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,420
也许吧，但你也想找到艾伦·詹姆森一家。
Maybe, but you also want to get at the Ellen Jamesians.

1354
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,740
你想伤害他们。
You want to hurt them.

1355
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:12,740
不，我没有。我只是想让他们停止他们正在做的事情。艾伦也希望如此。
No, I don't. I just want them to stop what they're doing. Ellen wants that, too.

1356
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:15,780
-你和她谈过了吗？-没有，我找不到她
- Have you talked with her about it? - No, I couldn't find her.

1357
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,420
我不知道她在哪里。
I don't know where she is.

1358
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:22,460
作为一名严肃小说家，你享有很高的声誉。这是很严肃的事情。
You have a fine reputation as a writer of serious fiction. This is serious stuff.

1359
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:26,620
但这不是虚构的。这是一次漫长而无情的攻击。
But it is not fiction. It's a long, merciless attack.

1360
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:29,820
约翰，你是出版商，不是评论家。你只要把它出版就行了。
You're a publisher, John, not a critic. You just publish it.

1361
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,980
我看到一个只有一只胳膊的人！
I see a man with one arm!

作为朋友，我警告你：你会后悔写下这封信的。
As a friend, I'm warning you: you'll be sorry you ever wrote this.

1363
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,540
我愿意冒这个险。只要出版就行了！
I'll take that chance. Just publish it!

1364

他带着一条狗。

至少换个标题吧。
At least change the title.

1366
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:45,300
我想要它，艾伦。T·艾伦，那就是
I want it Ellen. t Ellen, and that's

1367
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,820
再见，约翰叔叔。
'Bye, Uncle John.

1368
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:49,780
再见，邓肯。
Goodbye, Duncan.

1369
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:54,540
加普？加普！
Garp? Garp!

1370
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:07,940
一切都结束了吗？
Is it all over?

1371
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:09,460
是。
Yes.

1372
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:11,900
可以吗？
Is it all right?

1373
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:14,700
这不是“它”是个“她”
It's not an "it." It's a "she."

1374
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,660
她很好。
And she's all right.

1375
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,780
她只是个安静的小女孩。
She's just a quiet little girl.

1376
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:24,460
她打嗝了。
She's got the hiccups.

1377
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,460
-海伦怎么样？-她很好.
- How's Helen? - She's fine.

1378
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:38,780
她想给她取名为珍妮。
She wants to name her Jenny.

1379
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,060
真是个好听的名字。
That's a beautiful name.

1380
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:44,980
是的，差不多到了我们再吃一杯的时候了。
Yes, it's about time we had another one.

1381
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:46,900
我做珍妮的时间够长了。
I've been Jenny long enough.

1382
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,540
到这儿来。
Come here.

1383
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:51,300
向你的小妹妹问好。

Hello.

1385
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:03,380
说“邓肯”
Say "Duncan."

1386
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,300
我能进去吗？
Can I go in?

1387
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,900
你不能多呆几天吗？
Can't you stay a couple more days?

1388
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,820
不，我得走了。我已经把竞选拖得够久了。
No, I've got to go. I've delayed the campaign long enough.

1389
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,100
我想在这里接生。现在，一切都结束了。
I wanted to be here to deliver the baby. Now, it's done.

1390
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:40,060
我们家里需要一位奶奶。
We need a granny around the house.

1391
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:42,940
嗯，我不想当家里的老奶奶。
Well, I don't want to be the granny around the house.

1392

-我看不到你在政治上看到的东西。-一团糟，就是这样.我不喜欢这样。
- I don't see what you see in politics. - A mess, that's what. And I don't like it.

1393
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,660
所以我正试着把它清理干净一点。
So I'm trying to clean it up a bit.

1394
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,580
我支持的女人会成为一个非常好的总统。
The woman I'm supporting would make a damn fine president...

1395
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:00,940
.而且她只是在竞选州长.再见，亲爱的。
...and she's only running for governor. Goodbye, darling.

1396
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,580
我做了件好事，儿子，有了你。
I did a fine thing, son, having you.

1397
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,140
我也很高兴你这么做了，妈妈。
I'm kind of glad you did too, Mom.

1398
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,980
我从来不需要父亲！
I never needed a father!

1399
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:30,540
自从我开始竞选新罕布夏州州长以来。

1402
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:44,580
..。我想扭转这一局面，这样无论输赢.
... I want to reverse that, so that win or lose...

1403
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:47,740
..。我稍后可以说：
... l'll be able to say later on:

1404
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:51,900
“”那一年我介绍了……
'"That was the year I got to introduce...

1405

“……珍妮·菲尔兹！”

1406
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:31,780
我是珍妮·菲尔兹。

似乎你们大多数人都知道我是谁

1408
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:50,100
我只希望..。
I only wish that...

1409
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:03,940
帮我把她抬上车！
Help me get her into the car!

1410
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:23,140

1416
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:54,260
哦，加普。
Oh, Garp.

1417
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:05,420
我试着照顾她。我做到了。

1418
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:09,300
我一直警告她要远离人群。
I kept warning her to stay away from crowds.

1419
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:12,820
在人群中很难保护她。
It's hard to protect her in a crowd.

1420
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:15,460
我讨厌人群。

1421
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:18,260
我一直在警告她。我做到了。
I kept warning her. I did.

1422
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:22,380
如果我看到那个持枪的人..。
If I'd seen the man with the gun...

1423
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:26,940
如果我能再见他一眼，再早一秒.
If I'd only seen him a second, just a split second sooner...

1424
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,700
.我本可以挡住射门的我会这么做的。
...I could have blocked the shot. I would have done it.

-我知道.-我是如此的爱她.
- I know. - I loved her so.

她曾经把我吓得要死，但我认为她是个好女人。
She scared the hell out of me once, but I thought she was a fine woman.

我救了她儿子的命。
I saved her boy's life.

1428
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,780
真的吗-是的

1429
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:46,660
在他从屋顶上摔下来的时候抓住了他。

1430
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:49,980
直接抓住了他。

1431
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:54,140
死亡就是这样。
Death's like that.

1432
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:58,140
它只是简单地抓住了你。
It just plain catches you.

1433
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,420
教练，篮球队怎么样？
How's the basketball team, coach?

1434
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:06,660
-我是摔跤教练。-换了工作，嗯？

1435
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:09,340
不，我要退休了。
No, I'm retiring.

1436
02:03:09,580 --> 02:03:11,300
你别那么说呀。

1437

你还有很长的路要走。

1442
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:24,460
当教练。
Coaching.

1443
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:26,580
你是做什么教练的？
What do you coach?

1444
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,780
会议将于明天下午5点在纽约举行。
It's going to be held at 5:00 tomorrow in New York.

1445
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:34,260
但是恐怕你不能去。
But I'm afraid you can't go.

1446
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:37,860
你说我不能去是什么意思？我是她的儿子。
What do you mean, I can't go? I'm her son.

1447
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:39,260
这只是为女性准备的。
It's just for women.

1448
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:42,420
你看，这将是第一场女权主义追悼会。
You see, it's going to be the first feminist memorial funeral.

1449
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:45,220
他们不会允许任何男人。
And they aren't going to allow any men.

1450
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:48,780
一个男人杀了她。他们很不高兴。
A man killed her. They're very upset.

1451
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:50,660
气疯了我了!她是我妈妈。
I'm upset! She's my mother.

1452
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:52,580
我警告过你要小心你的书，加普。
I warned you about your book, Garp.

1453
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:55,500
艾伦·詹姆森一家在给我发恐吓信。
The Ellen Jamesians are sending threatening letters to me.

1454
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,780
我也是。那又怎么样？
Me, too. So what?

1455
02:03:56,940 --> 02:04:00,300
-暴力已经够多了-他们对你大发雷霆.
- There's been enough violence. - They're furious at you.

1456
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:02,420
我认识这些女人。如果一个男人出现了..。
I know these women. If a man shows up...

1457
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:05,340
-有个男人出现了。-你只是想找麻烦。
- A man is showing up. - You just want to make trouble.

1458
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:06,820
不，我没有。
No, I don't.

1459
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:11,340
我告诉你我想要什么。我想让我母亲复活。
I'll tell you what I want. I want my mother alive again.

1460
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:15,500
但既然我不能那样做，又因为我非常想念她.
But since I can't have that, and since I miss her terribly...

1461
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:19,700
.我想和尽可能多的和我有同感的人在一起。
...I want to be around as many people as possible who feel the same way as I do.

1462
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:23,220
我要为我生命中的睡觉独自哀悼她的逝世。
I'm going to mourn her death alone for the rest of my life.

1463
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:27,260
但现在，我想和尽可能多的人分享。
But right now, I want to share it with as many people as I can.

1464
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,660
这片土地上有一个声音。
There was a voice in the land.

1465
02:04:55,820 --> 02:04:59,540
但是现在这个声音已经被压制了..。
But now that voice has been silenced...

1466
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:02,060
.被一颗疯子的子弹打死了
...by a madman's bullet.

1467
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:05,300
珍妮的声音已经沉默了。
Jenny's voice has been silenced.

1468
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,540
但是她的话已经传给了我们每个人。
But her words have been passed on to each one of us.

1469
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,740
现在我们可以为自己说话了。
And we now can speak for ourselves.

1470
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:16,060
因为她教会了我们怎么做。
Because she taught us how.

1471
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:21,740
我感到悲痛，不是因为我害怕我们无法继续下去。
I grieve, not because I'm afraid that we won't be able to continue.

1472
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:25,020
我们会继续。
We will continue.

1473
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,580
我伤心是因为我爱她。
I grieve because I loved her.

1474
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,220
因为我们都爱她。
Because we all loved her.

1475
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:32,700
她是我们的母亲。
She was our mother.

1476
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:37,620
因此，我们现在是孤儿。
And therefore, we are now orphans.

1477
02:05:39,580 --> 02:05:44,020
她是我们的家，现在我们无家可归了。
She was our home, and now we are homeless.

1478
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:46,020
ARP！
Arp!

1479
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,380
-我有更多的话要说，但是l.-阿普！
- I had more to say, but l... - Arp!

1480
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:49,740
噗！
Pooh!

1481
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:11,140
各位，请坐下。
Everyone, please sit down.

1482
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:15,020
请安静！
Silence, please!

1483
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:20,580
屋子里安静！
Silence in the house!

1484
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:33,140
我知道，那是我的书。我真的不知道。
I know, that's my book. I really don't...

1485
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:37,860
你是Ellen Jamesian家的人。谢谢..。
You're an Ellen Jamesian. Thank...

1486
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:46,060
你是艾伦·詹姆斯？
You're Ellen James?

1487
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:11,780
我只想和你谈谈。等等..。
I just want to talk to you. Wait...

1488
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:32,260
你不能上唐纳森的课。那真是令人厌烦。
You're not taking Donaldson's class. That's a real bore.

1489
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,020
我该带些什么呢？
What shall I take?

1490
02:07:34,660 --> 02:07:36,140
我没有把握。
I'm not sure.

1491
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:39,500
见鬼的“全球发展研究”是什么？
What the hell is "Global Development Studies"?

1492
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:43,020
我得旁听那件事，然后告诉你。
I'll have to sit in on that one and let you know.

1493
02:07:44,260 --> 02:07:47,260
那一定是保姆。我去拿。
That must be the babysitter. I'll get it.

1494
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:50,740
-嗨，加普太太.-嗨，吉米.进来吧。
- Hi, Mrs. Garp. - Hi, Jimmy. Come on in.

1495
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:52,700
嗨，珍妮。
Hi, Jenny.

1496
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:54,660
你叫什么名字-吉姆
- What's your name? - Jim.

1497
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:58,980
电影应该在10点半结束，所以我们11点就到家了。
The movie should be over by 10:30, so we'll be home by 11:00.

1498
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:02,900
我把剧院的电话号码留在电话旁边了，以防你有麻烦。
I left the number of the theater by the phone in case you have any trouble.

1499
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:04,940
-再见.-‘再见。
- Bye-bye. - 'Bye.

1500
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:06,780
再见，妈妈。再见，爸爸。
'Bye, Mom. 'Bye, Dad.

1501
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,140
那是个保姆吗？
That's a babysitter?

1502
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:37,940
我以为我们要去看电影。
I thought we were going to the movies.

1503
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,900
我们去什么地方？
Where are we going?

1504
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:54,820
我明白了。
I see.

1505
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:58,500
我们要留在这里看孩子们。
We're going to stay here and look at the kids.

1506
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:01,100
这真是个不错的约会。
This is some date.

1507
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:08,540
你怀念写作吗？
Do you miss writing?

1508
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:11,580
不用谢。如果我这么做了，我会重新开始的。
Not at all. If I do, I'll start again.

1509
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:16,340
不过你知道我真正喜欢的是什么吗？想着所有的事情。
You know what I really love, though? Thinking about everything.

1510
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,140
我们是怎么认识的。
How we met.

1511
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:20,140
所有这些。
All that.

1512
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:23,180
-你不能活在过去。-我没有
- You can't live in the past. - I'm not.

1513
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:26,300
但我可以活在现在，回想过去。
But I can live in the present, and think about the past.

1514
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:28,900
你应该在年纪大、头发花白的时候才这么做。
You're supposed to do that when you're old and gray.

1515
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:30,340
让它见鬼去吧。
To hell with that.

1516
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:33,580
当我又老又白的时候，我可能不会记得我的过去了。
When I'm old and gray, I probably won't remember my past.

1517
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:35,500
你做这件事的时候一定要年轻。
You've got to be young when you do it.

1518
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:40,780
真的很不错，你知道吗？回首往事，看到你生命的弧线。
It's really nice, you know? To look back and see the arc of your life.

1519
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:42,580
这一切都是有联系的。
It's all connected.

1520
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:45,020
你是怎么从那里到这里的..。
How you got from there to here...

1521
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:47,900
去看看队伍，你知道吗？
To see the line, you know?

1522
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:52,100
这真的是一次冒险。
It really has been an adventure.

1523
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:54,740
我又要开始教书了。
I'm going to start teaching again.

1524
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:57,020
我要开始玩悬挂式滑翔了。
I'm going to take up hang-gliding.

1525
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:09,940
这就是你一直想要的。
This is what you had in mind all along.

1526
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:16,380
我打赌我知道我们以后能做什么。
And I bet I know what we can do later on.

1527
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:20,900
孩子们睡着了，我们去看看。
We'll go look at the kids when they're asleep.

1528
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:24,620
海伦·霍姆。
Helen Holm.

1529
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:37,500
去!
Go!

1530
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:42,740
去吧，马丁。赶快!
Go, Martin. Come on!

1531
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:44,780
把他拿下！
Take him down!

1532
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:48,540
就这样。走得好！
That's it. Good move!

1533
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,740
十秒！
Ten seconds!

1534
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:52,580
来吧，马丁。骑他！
Come on, Martin. Ride him!

1535
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:56,780
来吧，埃尔默。
Come on, Elmer.

1536
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:59,860
同一个人，最底层。
Same man, the bottom.

1537
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:05,820
别再唠叨了，维吉尔。
Get off your back, Virgil.

1538
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:08,500
把他绑在下面。就这样。
Tie him up underneath. That's it.

1539
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,220
十秒！
Ten seconds!

1540
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:13,740
在他后面，马库斯！
Behind him, Marcus!

1541
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:15,300
五秒钟！
Five seconds!

1542
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:17,500
在他身后。把他放下来！
Behind him. Bring him down!

1543
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,740
噗！
Pooh!

1544
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:39,300
快找人来！快点！快叫医生来！
Get someone! Quickly! Get a doctor!

1545
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:40,980
快叫救护车！
Get an ambulance!

1546
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:44,100
哦，天哪，拜托！
Oh, God, please!

1547
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:31,020
我们要带你去波士顿的一家医院。
We're taking you to a hospital in Boston.

1548
02:12:31,420 --> 02:12:33,420
一切都会顺利的。
Everything will be fine.

1549
02:12:34,980 --> 02:12:36,140
海伦？
Helen?

1550
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:43,660
记住。
Remember.

1551
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:45,860
什么，亲爱的？
What, my love?

1552
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:48,900
一切，海伦。
Everything, Helen.

1553
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:52,100
是的，亲爱的。
Yes, my love.

1554
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:59,740
我在飞，海伦。
I'm flying, Helen.

1555
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,900
是的，亲爱的。
Yes, my love.

1556
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:10,460
我在飞。
I'm flying.

1557
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:13,420
塔-兰塔-兰塔-拉。
Ta-ranta-ranta-ra.
