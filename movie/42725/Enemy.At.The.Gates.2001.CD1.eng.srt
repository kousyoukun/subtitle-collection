1
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:38,273
I am a stone.

2
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,320
I do not move.

3
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:51,995
Very slowly,
I put snow in my mouth,

4
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,123
then he won't
see my breath.

5
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:08,136
I take my time.
I let him come closer.

6
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:11,974
I have only one bullet.
I aim at his eye.

7
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:17,437
Very gently, my finger
presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:25,404
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:29,908
I have no fear.
I'm a big boy now.

10
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:38,000
Ready, Vassili?

11
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,877
Now, Vassili.
Fire!

12
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,089
Fire, Vassili!
Fire!

13
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,109
- Come on, pick your feet up.

14
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,571
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.

15
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:01,083
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

16
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,754
All civilians, get out!

17
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,298
Make way, let the civilians off.

18
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,717
This is a military convoy.

19
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:16,431
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

20
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:20,102
This is a convoy
to Stalingrad...

21
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,689
only for the soldiers
of the Red Army.

22
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,295
All aboard!

23
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,489
Autumn, 1942.

24
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:18,035
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

25
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,750
The German Third Reich
I sat the height of its power.

26
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:28,170
Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union...

27
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,756
towards the oilfields
of Asia.

28
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,384
One last obstacle remains.
A city on the Volga...

29
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:38,597
where the fate of the world
is being decided. Stalingrad.

30
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,649
Glorious comrade Stalin...

31
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:34,570
has ordered not another
step backwards.

32
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,824
The people of the Soviet Union
shall be free.

33
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:57,259
Go forward, comrades.
Not a step backwards!

34
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,280
Listen to these letters
sent by Russian mothers...

35
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:21,450
to their sons on the front.

36
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:26,705
"Volodya, my child,
I know that it's for our motherland-

37
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:35,756
"I know that it's for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

38
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:55,567
"Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

39
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,654
"Everyone here
is proud of you.

40
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:04,409
"Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

41
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,995
Avenge us
on the hordes of fascists. "

42
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,244
Nobody move!
Stay on the boat!

43
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:50,455
-Get back or I'll shoot!

44
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,917
Back from the rails, or we shoot.
Shoot the traitors!

45
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:32,122
Come on, come on!
Move!

46
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:38,503
Come on, comrades,
come on!

47
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,505
Move, or you'll be shot!

48
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,025
Over here, stretcher!

49
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:07,449
The one with
the rifle shoots!

50
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:10,160
One out of two
gets a rifle.

51
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:13,580
The one without
follows him!

52
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:17,292
When the one
with the rifle gets killed,

53
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:22,130
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots!

54
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:27,427
The one with
the rifle shoots!

55
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:30,889
The one without follows him!

56
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,684
When the one with
the rifle gets killed,

57
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,228
the one who is following...

58
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:40,315
picks up the rifle and shoots!

59
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,401
The one with
the rifle shoots!

60
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:47,489
- This way, now.
-The one without follows him!

61
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,683
Soldiers of the glorious
Red Army, from now on...

62
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:19,146
it is either victory
or death!

63
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:23,275
-Those who retreat will be shot.
-I need a rifle.

64
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:26,945
There will be no mercy
For cowards and traitors!

65
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,115
Achtung!

66
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,361
Aah!

67
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,100
It's hopeless, comrades.
Get back!

68
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,811
Pullback!

69
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,689
Pullback!

70
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:28,609
Get back! Get back!

71
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:32,696
In the name
of the Soviet Union,

72
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,574
not a step backwards,
or we shoot.

73
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,911
No retreat!
Not a step back!

74
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,997
-No mercy!
-Deserters will be shot.

75
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,709
-Fire!
-Shoot the traitors!

76
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,420
Cowards will be shot!

77
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:52,841
No mercy for cowards!

78
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:33,715
Russians, surrender.
You will see your home again.

79
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,468
This is not your war.

80
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:40,973
Join your German comrades,
They understand your suffering...

81
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:44,935
and will care more for you
than your own officers,

82
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,313
who are only sending you
to your death.

83
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:51,858
The Third Reich
Is not your enemy.

84
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,529
The enemy is blood thirsty Stalin
And his Bolshevik camp,

85
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:59,283
who have stolen your land, who have
deported your father-

86
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,849
Fire!

87
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:26,138
You'll get us caught,
comrade Commissar.

88
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,370
With your permission,
comrade Commissar.

89
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:26,490
-Which one should I aim at first?
-You should wait...

90
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:28,533
till there's an explosion.

91
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:45,050
-Do you know how to shoot?
-A little.

92
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,021
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

93
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,047
Thank you,
comrade Commissar.

94
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,642
Danilov, political officer,
second class.

95
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:02,646
Twenty-first infantry.

96
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:24,376
"Vassili Zaitsev."

97
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,753
"On this day,
September the 20th, 1942,

98
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:30,549
-"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

99
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,389
"arrived in the city of Stalingrad,
on the banks of the Volga.

100
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:40,309
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

101
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:46,148
"Like thousands before him, he came
to answer comrade Stalin's call.

102
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,737
"Armed with a rifle, he quickly made
the fascist invader realize that...

103
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,950
"from now on he would be punished for
every step he took in the motherland;

104
00:21:57,034 --> 00:22:00,329
that from here on,
the only way was back."

105
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,334
What do you think?

106
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:10,172
I think comrade Commissar's
been overgenerous.

107
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:31,360
Let me go!
Let me go!

108
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,910
By order of comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

109
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:45,874
-Get back!

110
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,377
Stand away,
or we will open fire.

111
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:01,515
-Stand away!

112
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,559
Get back!

113
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,520
Get back or we shoot!

114
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:08,230
Back!
Keep back!

115
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:12,734
Make way for
comrade Stalin 's envoy!

116
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:19,616
I carried out my orders.

117
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,995
I sent in
all of my boys.

118
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:26,623
But the Germans
engulfed us.

119
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:30,877
They have artillery,
aircraft, tanks.

120
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,090
-And me, what did I have?
-The sacred duty to resist!

121
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,634
I have to
report to the boss.

122
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,890
Perhaps you'd prefer
to avoid the red tape.

123
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,498
My name is...

124
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,211
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

125
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,341
I've come to take things
in hand here.

126
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:21,386
This city is not Kursk...

127
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,307
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

128
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,936
This city is Stalingrad.

129
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,731
Stalingrad!

130
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:35,984
This city bears the name
of the boss.

131
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,654
It's more than a city,
it's a symbol.

132
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:43,951
If the Germans
capture this city,

133
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:48,497
the entire country
will collapse.

134
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,751
Now, I want our boys...

135
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,420
to raise their heads.

136
00:24:55,504 --> 00:24:59,174
I want them to act like
they have balls!

137
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:03,428
I want them to stop shitting
their pants!

138
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:10,352
That's your job.

139
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:15,732
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

140
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:22,322
You,
what's your suggestion?

141
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:24,825
Shoot all the other generals
who have retreated...

142
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:28,078
and their
chiefs of staff too.

143
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,998
M-Make some examples.

144
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:35,294
-D-D-Deport families of the deserters-
-Yeah, that's all been done.

145
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:37,754
Give them hope!

146
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,729
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

147
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,857
But there's another way.
The way of courage.

148
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,401
The way of love
of the motherland.

149
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,403
We must publish
the army newspaper again.

150
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:03,530
We must tell magnificent stories.
Stories that extol...

151
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:05,574
sacrifice, bravery.

152
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:07,951
We must make them believe
in the victory.

153
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:12,039
We must give them hope,
pride, a desire to fight.

154
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:16,209
Yes, we need to
make examples.

155
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:19,421
But examples to follow.

156
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:23,342
What we need...
are heroes.

157
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,765
Do you know any heroes
around here?

158
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:35,312
Yes, comrade,
I know one.

159
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:42,236
That’s me!

160
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,281
"Vassili Zaitsev."
That's me!

161
00:26:46,323 --> 00:26:49,409
No, you're not dreaming.
It's your name.

162
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:52,246
We made the front page.

163
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,540
They haven't changed a word.

164
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,044
Do you have any idea
what this means?

165
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,672
It's not the back page,
it's not the second page,

166
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,007
-it's the front page.
- The front page!

167
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,468
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere.

168
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:10,556
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

169
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:13,976
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

170
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:17,771
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

171
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:20,566
We're famous, Vassili.
Kruschev loved the article.

172
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:22,651
He's promoted me
to the general staff.

173
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:26,280
And you
to sniper division.

174
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,409
-Well, that's good.
-It's very good.

175
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,620
-It's very good. It's great.
-It's very great!

176
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:35,956
-It's great!
-For us because we did it together.

177
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,499
-Together!

178
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,626
-Although I did all the hard work.
-Oh, yeah?

179
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,045
-You're very lucky I can't fight back.
-Why's that?

180
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:44,464
Because Kruschev told me to make sure
nothing happens to you.

181
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,508
-You're too important.
-I'm too valuable.

182
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:49,094
Yes, careful of my- careful
of my glasses, please. They're new.

183
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:51,179
Sorry, sir.

184
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:55,809
-I'm famous! We're famous!
-I'm famous! I'm famous!

185
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:58,437
Vassili,
the young shepherd from the Urals,

186
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,439
killed his 12th
German officer today.

187
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,524
He used to hunt wolves,
Now he shoots fascists.

188
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:05,694
Today, Vassili Zaitsev
shot his 23rd German officer.

189
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,738
He is an example to us all.

190
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:10,407
Vassili shot
his 32ndGerman officer.

191
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:17,122
Count only the Germans
you have killed.

192
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:19,207
-Today, Vassili Zaitsev-
-Here is the evidence-

193
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,919
11 dog tags retrieved
by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.

194
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:30,719
More and more men and women, fighters
from all branches of our armed forces,

195
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:35,224
join the sniper division and learn
the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

196
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,355
I am a stone.

197
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:47,486
I am a stone.

198
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,572
I breathe slowly.

199
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:01,458
I aim at the eye.

200
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,823
So it is you,

201
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:36,535
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

202
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:40,122
-My mother makes potatoes with bacon.
-Sounds good.

203
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:42,708
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

204
00:29:44,626 --> 00:29:49,047
-How many today?
-Only two.

205
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,925
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

206
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:56,680
He was only a foot soldier.
Wasn't worth giving away my position.

207
00:29:56,763 --> 00:30:00,976
-Bless you.

208
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:02,936
We know how much
we owe you.

209
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,565
We pray for you every day.

210
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:11,445
Every evening, we listen to them talk
about you on Radio Moscow.

211
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:15,198
Thanks. You've certainly
managed well down here.

212
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:19,870
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

213
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:22,623
Sacha, drop that right now.

214
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,667
It's loaded.

215
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,053
This way, comrade Commissar.

216
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,138
Thank you, comrade.

217
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:42,267
Good evening.

218
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,231
Comrade Zaitsev?

219
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:55,447
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

220
00:30:55,489 --> 00:31:00,535
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

221
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:02,704
This one's from the workers
of the Kouzbass.

222
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:05,749
They want to name
their mine after Vassili.

223
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,834
Right, let's start
with the miners.

224
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:11,838
Come on,
let's get to work.

225
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:18,804
Dear comrades
from the Kouzbass,

226
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:22,849
-Kouzbass.
-I thank you for your letter of praise.

227
00:31:22,891 --> 00:31:25,769
-Praise?
-R-A-I-S-E.

228
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:33,610
And... I hope that
I can live up...

229
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:38,615
to your expectations-
A-T-I-O-N-S.

230
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:42,411
Expectations.

231
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:45,289
You're interested
in German literature, Mrs. Filipov?

232
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:51,420
It's all right,
it's our neighbor.

233
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:54,047
-Right, where were we?
-Tania, we have guests.

234
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:56,967
Your offer to name-

235
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:06,977
I-

236
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,979
I-I recognize you.

237
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:13,734
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

238
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:19,781
I saw your picture
in the paper.

239
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:22,910
Thank you
For everything you're doing.

240
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:26,663
-And this is his friend, Commissar...
-Danilov.

241
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:28,874
Danilov.

242
00:32:28,957 --> 00:32:31,043
Tania is like
a daughter to me.

243
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:34,463
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

244
00:32:34,504 --> 00:32:36,673
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

245
00:32:36,757 --> 00:32:40,385
-Oh, they're yours?
-She studied German at the university.

246
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,763
-Which university?
-Moscow.

247
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:51,355
Moscow. Moscow.

248
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,609
Shouldn't we, uh-

249
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:58,946
Yes, let's continue.

250
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:03,450
Your offer to name
Your mine after me...

251
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:07,204
is... a great honor.

252
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:12,918
H-O-N.

253
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:15,003
Yes, I know.
Honor.

254
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,756
Very good.

255
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:23,262
Shouldn't we make the point that
I'm not the only one fighting?

256
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:27,349
That- That's excellent-
excellent idea, Vassili.

257
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:29,476
-We can take it even further though.
-Oh.

258
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,478
We can take it further.

259
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:35,649
Your battle for
The production of coal...

260
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:39,278
is as worthy as mine.

261
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:44,199
There's no "K" in coal.

262
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,285
Just-just one "L. "

263
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:51,707
Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.

264
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,543
-No, you're not going too fast.
-You sure?

265
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:56,712
I just thought is there
Any other improvements?

266
00:33:56,795 --> 00:34:01,258
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

267
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,802
We should carry on.
We're not tired.

268
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:07,014
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.
These people...

269
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:09,933
took the trouble
to write to us.

270
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:13,353
Tomorrow, we may not
be around to write back.

271
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:26,843
Major Konig,
Herr General.

272
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,993
I was expecting
someone...

273
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:52,995
else.

274
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,956
Certainly not someone
so prestigious.

275
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:58,000
I imagine you have
your reasons...

276
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,920
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

277
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:08,969
My army is not designed
For this kind of fighting.

278
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:11,221
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote...

279
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:15,809
25 sergeants to replace the officers
shot down by their sharpshooters.

280
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:21,481
Those snipers are
demoralizing my people.

281
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:25,861
This city is no more than...

282
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:27,946
a heap of ruins.

283
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,201
But the fuehrer's persisting.

284
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:36,455
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

285
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:46,298
We should trust
the fuehrer's instinct.

286
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:50,010
He always managed to
lead us to victory.

287
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:55,724
We shall be back home
For Christmas.

288
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:02,397
How are you going to go about finding
this young Russian?

289
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:08,403
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

290
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:12,449
Vassili.
Vassili.

291
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:15,619
-Come on, time to get up.
-What?

292
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:19,498
They have a problem in the department
store sector. They need us. Come on.

293
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:32,803
Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store. Over there.

294
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,768
So far this morning,

295
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,147
he's knocked off five officers,
plus two machine gunners.

296
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:51,238
Look, third floor,
fourth window from the left.

297
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,033
Fourth window from the left.

298
00:37:57,786 --> 00:37:59,705
See him?

299
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:02,457
Yeah, I see him.

300
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:16,889
There, you got him!

301
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,850
Great shot.

302
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:25,105
Let's go get
his dog tag.

303
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:31,153
Good-bye, comrade Commissar.

304
00:38:31,236 --> 00:38:33,864
Thank you for your
hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.

305
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:45,167
You can borrow
whatever you like.

306
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,961
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters...

307
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:50,964
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

308
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:53,050
-There's some Marx too.

309
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,845
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

310
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:59,139
No, I volunteered.

311
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:02,476
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

312
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:04,519
Comrade Kruschev was
telling me just yesterday...

313
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,980
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

314
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:10,859
I can't. Our militia's responsible
for all the people in this neighbourhood.

315
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:12,903
We're already
desperately short of men.

316
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:15,989
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

317
00:39:16,073 --> 00:39:17,991
I'd rather stay and fight.

318
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:21,203
Serving at headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

319
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,749
You stay here.
You cover us.

320
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:28,001
- All right.
-We go.

321
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,673
Take care.

322
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,220
Ludmilla, come on.

323
00:40:30,272 --> 00:40:32,274
Check the stairway.

324
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:23,051
It's a trap.

325
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:25,470
I know.

326
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,788
Move back.

327
00:43:40,128 --> 00:43:42,089
He's still here.

328
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:09,449
-They're coming straight for us!
-Ludmilla,

329
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:13,287
stay where you are,
he's over there somewhere.

330
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:26,592
We have to
get out of here!

331
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,015
-We have to get out of here!
-Just stay where you are!

332
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:38,645
What are we gonna do?

333
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:41,106
Ludmilla, stay where you are!

334
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:54,745
Fuck this, I'm going.

335
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:59,750
Ludmilla, no!

336
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:52,886
What does this mean?

337
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:58,392
"The little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle,

338
00:45:58,475 --> 00:46:04,231
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-power P.U. telescope.

339
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:06,316
Pride of precision
Of Soviet production."

340
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,736
-I've seen that rifle close up.
-Have you?

341
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:14,533
I've even touched it.
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

342
00:47:03,957 --> 00:47:08,629
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today,
and it was my fault.

343
00:47:08,712 --> 00:47:11,131
No, I'm sure
that's not true.

344
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:16,595
There was a German sniper.
I walked them right into his trap.

345
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:20,015
- What else can you tell me?
-He didn't relocate.

346
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:24,937
A sniper who doesn't
relocate isn't normal.

347
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:32,527
He was very good. It wasn't just
his shooting, it was his instinct.

348
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:35,239
He was a step ahead
of me all the time.

349
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:39,409
That's because he knows
everything about you.

350
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:42,371
His name is Konig,
Major Konig.

351
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:47,167
They've sent him here
to ki-

352
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:50,337
to find you.

353
00:47:56,718 --> 00:47:59,471
At first we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

354
00:47:59,555 --> 00:48:02,599
It seems he's come
all the way from Berlin to stop you.

355
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:06,103
You've caused them so many sleepless
nights, they sent their top marksman.

356
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:10,190
-What do we know about him?
-He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

357
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:14,278
He's director of their
sniper school in Zossen.

358
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:17,823
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

359
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:22,286
He knows all his tricks. From now on,
he'll go with you everywhere.

360
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,789
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer...

361
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:29,042
against a shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

362
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:32,087
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

363
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:38,677
It's the essence
Of class struggle.

364
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,430
I'm glad
you're so happy.

365
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:46,685
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

366
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:49,479
No one shoots
like you, Vassili.

367
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,408
She's been transferred.

368
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,953
I'll see if they're ready
for you next door.

369
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:13,003
-Hello.
-You look smart in your new uniform.

370
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:17,466
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

371
00:49:17,549 --> 00:49:19,885
Yeah, they probably will.

372
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:28,018
I've heard the rumor about the German,
and I wanted to wish you luck.

373
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:30,687
Thank you.
I'll need it.

374
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:35,400
From what comrade Danilov
tells me, you're going to win.

375
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:40,239
Hmm.

376
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,449
It's time.

377
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:48,080
- Vassili! Vassili!
-Come to my arms.

378
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:53,335
-Look in my direction.

379
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:55,712
Put your cap back on,
you look more heroic.

380
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:58,590
-This way, comrade Zaitsev.
-I love this little fellow.

381
00:49:58,674 --> 00:50:02,177
Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?

382
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:03,220
How old are you, Vassili?

383
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:05,264
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

384
00:50:05,347 --> 00:50:09,268
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

385
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:12,020
Are you proud to be challenged
By the best sharpshooter in Germany?

386
00:50:12,104 --> 00:50:14,106
The Germans are starting
to shit their pants.

387
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:17,401
Go on, my boy, tell us how
you're going to deal with him.

388
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:20,904
-Or rather, no. Tell it to the boss.
-One more question, please.

389
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:24,157
He likes
good hunting stories.

390
00:50:29,705 --> 00:50:32,874
Look at him with pride,

391
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,711
because he's looking at you.

392
00:50:35,752 --> 00:50:39,548
The whole country
is looking at you.

393
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:05,449
Forgive me, forgive me,
Grandfather.

394
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:40,484
So, it's not the wolf that
chooses the hunting ground...

395
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,861
but the hunter.

396
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:49,534
But I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

397
00:51:53,664 --> 00:51:55,999
Except in this case,

398
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,001
I'm the game.

399
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:05,217
However,
today what we're going to do...

400
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:07,678
is lure the wolf
out of his lair...

401
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,889
to where we want him to be.

402
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:53,098
You're the one whose life is valuable.
You go first.

403
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:57,853
No, no. We take it in turns.
Next time is your turn to go first,

404
00:52:57,936 --> 00:52:59,897
and then it's you, Volodya.

405
00:53:14,953 --> 00:53:19,249
Son of a bitch!

406
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:26,757
These are new pants. I just took them
Off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

407
00:53:30,636 --> 00:53:35,140
Sixteen months I spent
in Germany at the school in Zossen.

408
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:39,102
Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts,:

409
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:42,648
when our Joseph
and their Adolph...

410
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:45,734
were walking hand in hand.

411
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:50,447
From here to the wire,
160meters, right?

412
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:58,205
One hundred and fifty-five.

413
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:03,001
Whatever. That'll make 'em
Send out a repair guy.

414
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:06,338
Let's relocate.

415
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,805
Aah!

416
00:54:25,983 --> 00:54:28,151
Hey, Volodya!

417
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:40,664
After the Germans
invaded us,

418
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:44,793
it wasn't the same
atmosphere anymore.

419
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:47,421
Threw my ass
in prison.

420
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:50,257
What were you doing
in Germany, huh?

421
00:54:50,299 --> 00:54:54,970
Excuse me, says I, but it was
comrade Stalin who sent me there.

422
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:59,766
Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

423
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:03,270
Confess, spy bastard!
Confess.

424
00:55:03,353 --> 00:55:07,357
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

425
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:13,405
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

426
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:17,993
And bang.
Knocked out all my teeth.

427
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:24,499
That's right, boy.
Have no illusions.

428
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:27,920
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

429
00:55:31,256 --> 00:55:35,969
Hey! It's your repair guy.

430
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,513
I got him.

431
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,279
It's about soup time,
isn't it?

432
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:57,157
I'm going.

433
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:00,077
Well, get a move on, Volodya,

434
00:56:00,118 --> 00:56:05,749
and try not to spill it all
on your way back, you Marxist bastard.

435
00:56:17,928 --> 00:56:21,682
The enemy sniper activity reported
during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.

436
00:56:24,184 --> 00:56:27,896
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector.

437
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:30,899
One artillery observer
in the Northern sector.

438
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:34,361
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer
division in the factory sector.

439
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:37,948
Three telephone repairmen
in the workers' housing sector.

440
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:42,327
They also tell me we have just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

441
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,329
I hope he's still
able to speak.

442
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:47,040
Excuse me, sir?

443
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:49,585
Nothing.
Thank you.

444
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:54,799
So, tell us, Volodya,

445
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:57,009
which building is he in?

446
00:56:59,804 --> 00:57:01,722
There is no way
I know that.

447
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:06,185
He moves around
all the time.

448
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:09,146
He jumps from one
to the next.

449
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,148
On which floor?

450
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:13,150
I don't know.

451
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:16,362
We'll see about that.

452
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:18,906
Undress him.

453
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:21,450
Put him in
one of our uniforms.

454
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:53,337
You see, they are stubborn.

455
00:57:53,379 --> 00:57:55,589
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

456
00:57:55,673 --> 00:58:00,052
Man, you got to admit
when they get an idea in their heads-

457
00:58:15,943 --> 00:58:18,070
Right.

458
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:20,572
Let's see if our customer
has arrived.

459
00:58:20,614 --> 00:58:23,158
Are you ready?

460
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:25,202
Uh-huh.

461
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:29,456
And now our famous shepherd
from the Urals,

462
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,834
who Major Konig
thinks is an idiot,

463
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:34,878
gets up to make sure
he has hit his target.

464
00:58:34,962 --> 00:58:37,756
Major Konig sees him.

465
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,054
Aims for his helmet.

466
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:46,682
Fires.

467
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:50,060
Reveals his position
And is shot in turn.

468
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:05,242
Except...
Major Konig doesn't fire...

469
00:59:08,787 --> 00:59:11,623
because Major Konig
isn't there.

470
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,504
Koulikov!

471
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:26,889
Don't you think that was strange,
that last one?

472
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:30,059
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

473
00:59:30,142 --> 00:59:32,061
It's not natural.

474
00:59:32,144 --> 00:59:35,606
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

475
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:40,861
Oh, no, I'm the one
who was stupid.

476
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,197
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

477
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,199
I mean, it's like us
with the Ukrainians.

478
00:59:45,282 --> 00:59:48,744
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

479
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:54,625
Tomorrow, we'll kill us
some generals.

480
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:05,844
Whose turn is it?

481
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:08,764
Mine, I think.

482
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:11,058
Oh, you're such a cheater!

483
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,603
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

484
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:18,524
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
it's my turn to go first.

485
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:23,737
And it's your turn to get a hole
in your britches.

486
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,857
To victory.

487
01:01:49,323 --> 01:01:53,994
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

488
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,372
What's that little fellow
of yours up to?

489
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,669
He's probing,
comrade Kruschev.

490
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:04,254
He's testing the Germans
for weaknesses.

491
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,215
He's meticulous
in his preparation.

492
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:13,555
Vodka...
is a luxury we have.

493
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:17,017
Caviar is
a luxury we have.

494
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:19,937
Time is not.

495
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,981
He's aware of that
comrade Kruschev. We both are.

496
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,528
I assure you
he will succeed.

497
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,655
Good.

498
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:33,951
It seems your destinies
are entwined.
