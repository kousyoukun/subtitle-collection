1
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:40,251
I am a stone.

2
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,181
I do not move.

3
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,851
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth,

4
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,981
then he won't see my breath.

5
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:08,991
I take my time. I let him come closer.

6
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,831
I have only one bullet. I aim at his eye.

7
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:18,291
Very gently,my finger presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:26,261
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:30,761
I have no fear. I'm a big boy now.

10
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,861
Ready,Vassili?

11
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,731
Now,Vassili. Fire!

12
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:44,951
Fire,Vassili! Fire!

13
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,971
- Come on,pick your feet up.

14
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,431
Get on your feet. Prepare to board the train.

15
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,941
You there,come along with me now. This way,pal.

16
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:06,611
All civilians,get out!

17
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:09,151
Make way,let the civilians off.

18
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:11,571
This is a military convoy.

19
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:17,291
No one stays on board but our valiant soldiers.

20
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:20,961
This is a convoy to Stalingrad...

21
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,551
only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

22
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:47,151
All aboard!

23
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:15,351
Autumn,1942.

24
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,891
Europe lies crushed beneath the Nazi jackboot.

25
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,611
The German Third Reich I sat the height of its power.

26
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:29,031
Hitler's armies are charging through the heart of the Soviet Union...

27
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,611
towards the oilfields of Asia.

28
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:35,241
One last obstacle remains. A city on the Volga...

29
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:39,451
where the fate of the world is being decided. Stalingrad.

30
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,511
Glorious comrade Stalin...

31
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,431
has ordered not another step backwards.

32
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:39,681
The people of the Soviet Union shall be free.

33
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:58,121
Go forward,comrades. Not a step backwards!

34
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:19,141
Listen to these letters sent by Russian mothers...

35
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,311
to their sons on the front.

36
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:27,561
"Volodya,my child, I know that it's for our motherland-

37
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:36,611
"I know that it's for our motherland that you are giving your life.

38
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:56,421
"Everyone here knows that you will not fall back.

39
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:59,511
"Everyone here is proud of you.

40
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:05,271
"Your father is dead. Your brothers are dead.

41
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,851
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists. "

42
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,101
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

43
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,311
-Get back or I'll shoot!

44
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,771
Back from the rails,or we shoot. Shoot the traitors!

45
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:32,981
Come on,come on! Move!

46
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,361
Come on,comrades, come on!

47
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,361
Move,or you'll be shot!

48
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,881
Over here,stretcher!

49
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,311
The one with the rifle shoots!

50
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,021
One out of two gets a rifle.

51
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,441
The one without follows him!

52
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,151
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

53
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:22,991
the one who is following picks up the rifle and shoots!

54
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:28,281
The one with the rifle shoots!

55
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:31,751
The one without follows him!

56
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,541
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

57
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:37,081
the one who is following...

58
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:41,171
picks up the rifle and shoots!

59
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:43,261
The one with the rifle shoots!

60
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:48,351
- This way,now. -The one without follows him!

61
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:15,541
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,from now on...

62
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:20,001
it is either victory or death!

63
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:24,131
-Those who retreat will be shot. -I need a rifle.

64
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:27,801
There will be no mercy For cowards and traitors!

65
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,971
Achtung!

66
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,221
Aah!

67
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,961
It's hopeless,comrades. Get back!

68
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,671
Pullback!

69
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:26,551
Pullback!

70
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:29,471
Get back! Get back!

71
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:33,551
In the name of the Soviet Union,

72
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,431
not a step backwards, or we shoot.

73
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:39,771
No retreat! Not a step back!

74
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,851
-No mercy! -Deserters will be shot.

75
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:46,571
-Fire! -Shoot the traitors!

76
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,281
Cowards will be shot!

77
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:53,701
No mercy for cowards!

78
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:34,571
Russians,surrender. You will see your home again.

79
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:37,321
This is not your war.

80
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:41,831
Join your German comrades, They understand your suffering...

81
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:45,791
and will care more for you than your own officers,

82
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:49,171
who are only sending you to your death.

83
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:52,711
The Third Reich Is not your enemy.

84
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:56,391
The enemy is blood thirsty Stalin And his Bolshevik camp,

85
00:14:56,471 --> 00:15:00,141
who have stolen your land,who have deported your father-

86
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:24,711
Fire!

87
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:26,991
You'll get us caught, comrade Commissar.

88
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,231
With your permission, comrade Commissar.

89
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,351
-Which one should I aim at first? -You should wait...

90
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,391
till there's an explosion.

91
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:45,911
-Do you know how to shoot? -A little.

92
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:39,881
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He's looking at us.

93
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:47,901
Thank you, comrade Commissar.

94
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:59,501
Danilov,political officer, second class.

95
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:03,501
Twenty-first infantry.

96
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:25,231
"Vassili Zaitsev."

97
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:27,611
"On this day, September the 20th,1942,

98
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:31,411
-"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

99
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:38,251
"arrived in the city of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga.

100
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,171
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

101
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:47,001
"Like thousands before him,he came to answer comrade Stalin's call.

102
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:52,591
"Armed with a rifle,he quickly made the fascist invader realize that...

103
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:57,811
"from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland;

104
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:01,191
that from here on, the only way was back."

105
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,191
What do you think?

106
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,031
I think comrade Commissar's been overgenerous.

107
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:32,221
Let me go! Let me go!

108
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:40,771
By order of comrade Stalin, no civilian can leave the city.

109
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:46,731
-Get back!

110
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,231
Stand away, or we will open fire.

111
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:02,371
-Stand away!

112
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,421
Get back!

113
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,381
Get back or we shoot!

114
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:09,091
Back! Keep back!

115
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:13,591
Make way for comrade Stalin 's envoy!

116
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:20,471
I carried out my orders.

117
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,851
I sent in all of my boys.

118
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:27,481
But the Germans engulfed us.

119
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:31,731
They have artillery, aircraft,tanks.

120
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:35,951
-And me,what did I have? -The sacred duty to resist!

121
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:38,491
I have to report to the boss.

122
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:43,751
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape.

123
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,351
My name is...

124
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:14,071
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

125
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:18,201
I've come to take things in hand here.

126
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:22,241
This city is not Kursk...

127
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:26,161
nor is it Kiev,nor Minsk.

128
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,791
This city is Stalingrad.

129
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:33,591
Stalingrad!

130
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:36,841
This city bears the name of the boss.

131
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,511
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

132
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,811
If the Germans capture this city,

133
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:49,351
the entire country will collapse.

134
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:53,611
Now,I want our boys...

135
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:56,281
to raise their heads.

136
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:00,031
I want them to act like they have balls!

137
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:04,281
I want them to stop shitting their pants!

138
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:11,211
That's your job.

139
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:16,591
As political officers, I'm counting on you.

140
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:23,181
You, what's your suggestion?

141
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,681
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated...

142
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:28,931
and their chiefs of staff too.

143
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:31,851
M-Make some examples.

144
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:36,151
-D-D-Deport families of the deserters- -Yeah,that's all been done.

145
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,611
Give them hope!

146
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:54,591
Here,the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours.

147
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:57,711
But there's another way. The way of courage.

148
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,261
The way of love of the motherland.

149
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:02,261
We must publish the army newspaper again.

150
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:04,391
We must tell magnificent stories. Stories that extol...

151
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,431
sacrifice,bravery.

152
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,811
We must make them believe in the victory.

153
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:12,901
We must give them hope, pride,a desire to fight.

154
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:17,071
Yes,we need to make examples.

155
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:20,281
But examples to follow.

156
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:24,201
What we need... are heroes.

157
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,621
Do you know any heroes around here?

158
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:36,171
Yes,comrade, I know one.

159
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:43,091
That’s me!

160
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:47,141
"Vassili Zaitsev." That's me!

161
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:50,271
No,you're not dreaming. It's your name.

162
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,101
We made the front page.

163
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:56,401
They haven't changed a word.

164
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,901
Do you have any idea what this means?

165
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:02,531
It's not the back page, it's not the second page,

166
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,861
-it's the front page. - The front page!

167
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:07,321
They're going to reprint our article everywhere.

168
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:11,411
In the Caucasus,in the Crimea, even in the Urals.

169
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:14,831
Tomorrow morning,Stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast,

170
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:18,631
reading my words, memorizing your name.

171
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,421
We're famous,Vassili. Kruschev loved the article.

172
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,511
He's promoted me to the general staff.

173
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:27,141
And you to sniper division.

174
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,271
-Well,that's good. -It's very good.

175
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,481
-It's very good. It's great. -It's very great!

176
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:36,811
-It's great! -For us because we did it together.

177
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,361
-Together!

178
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,481
-Although I did all the hard work. -Oh,yeah?

179
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,901
-You're very lucky I can't fight back. -Why's that?

180
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:45,321
Because Kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you.

181
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,361
-You're too important. -I'm too valuable.

182
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,951
Yes,careful of my- careful of my glasses,please. They're new.

183
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:52,041
Sorry,sir.

184
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:56,671
-I'm famous! We're famous! -I'm famous! I'm famous!

185
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,291
Vassili, the young shepherd from the Urals,

186
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:01,301
killed his 12th German officer today.

187
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,381
He used to hunt wolves, Now he shoots fascists.

188
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:06,551
Today,Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd German officer.

189
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,591
He is an example to us all.

190
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:11,261
Vassili shot his 32ndGerman officer.

191
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,981
Count only the Germans you have killed.

192
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,061
-Today,Vassili Zaitsev- -Here is the evidence-

193
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:22,781
11 dog tags retrieved by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.

194
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,581
More and more men and women,fighters from all branches of our armed forces,

195
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:36,081
join the sniper division and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

196
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:42,211
I am a stone.

197
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:48,341
I am a stone.

198
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:51,431
I breathe slowly.

199
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:02,311
I aim at the eye.

200
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:33,681
So it is you,

201
00:29:33,761 --> 00:29:37,391
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

202
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,981
-My mother makes potatoes with bacon. -Sounds good.

203
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:43,561
When she sees you, she won't believe her eyes.

204
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:49,901
-How many today? -Only two.

205
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:52,781
And the last one, why didn't you shoot him?

206
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:57,541
He was only a foot soldier. Wasn't worth giving away my position.

207
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,731
-Bless you.

208
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:02,991
We know how much we owe you.

209
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:07,941
We pray for you every day.

210
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:12,821
Every evening,we listen to them talk about you on Radio Moscow.

211
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:16,571
Thanks. You've certainly managed well down here.

212
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:21,251
My parents used to store furniture down here before the war.

213
00:30:21,331 --> 00:30:24,001
Sacha,drop that right now.

214
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:27,041
It's loaded.

215
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:37,431
This way,comrade Commissar.

216
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,511
Thank you,comrade.

217
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,641
Good evening.

218
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,611
Comrade Zaitsev?

219
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:56,821
My God,where does all this mail come from?

220
00:30:56,871 --> 00:31:01,911
From all over the country, Mrs. Filipov,from all over.

221
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,081
This one's from the workers of the Kouzbass.

222
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:07,131
They want to name their mine after Vassili.

223
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,211
Right,let's start with the miners.

224
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:13,211
Come on, let's get to work.

225
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:20,181
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass,

226
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:24,231
-Kouzbass. -I thank you for your letter of praise.

227
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:27,151
-Praise? -R-A-I-S-E.

228
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:34,991
And... I hope that I can live up...

229
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:39,991
to your expectations- A-T-I-O-N-S.

230
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:43,791
Expectations.

231
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:46,671
You're interested in German literature,Mrs. Filipov?

232
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,801
It's all right, it's our neighbor.

233
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,421
-Right,where were we? -Tania,we have guests.

234
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:58,341
Your offer to name-

235
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:08,351
I-

236
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:10,361
I-I recognize you.

237
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,111
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

238
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,161
I saw your picture in the paper.

239
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:24,291
Thank you For everything you're doing.

240
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:28,041
-And this is his friend,Commissar... -Danilov.

241
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,251
Danilov.

242
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,421
Tania is like a daughter to me.

243
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,841
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory.

244
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,051
She even taught him German. All these books are hers.

245
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:41,761
-Oh,they're yours? -She studied German at the university.

246
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:44,141
-Which university? -Moscow.

247
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:52,731
Moscow. Moscow.

248
00:32:54,821 --> 00:32:56,991
Shouldn't we,uh-

249
00:32:57,031 --> 00:33:00,321
Yes,let's continue.

250
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,831
Your offer to name Your mine after me...

251
00:33:04,871 --> 00:33:08,581
is... a great honor.

252
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:14,291
H-O-N.

253
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:16,381
Yes,I know. Honor.

254
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,131
Very good.

255
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:24,641
Shouldn't we make the point that I'm not the only one fighting?

256
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:28,731
That- That's excellent- excellent idea,Vassili.

257
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:30,851
-We can take it even further though. -Oh.

258
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,851
We can take it further.

259
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:37,031
Your battle for The production of coal...

260
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:40,651
is as worthy as mine.

261
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:45,581
There's no "K" in coal.

262
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,661
Just-just one "L. "

263
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:53,081
Oh,tell me if I'm going too fast.

264
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:55,921
-No,you're not going too fast. -You sure?

265
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:58,091
I just thought is there Any other improvements?

266
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:02,631
Why don't you get some rest? These letters can wait until tomorrow.

267
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,181
We should carry on. We're not tired.

268
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:08,391
Thank you,Mrs. Filipov. These people...

269
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:11,311
took the trouble to write to us.

270
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,731
Tomorrow,we may not be around to write back.

271
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:28,221
Major Konig, Herr General.

272
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:52,371
I was expecting someone...

273
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,371
else.

274
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,331
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

275
00:35:57,371 --> 00:35:59,381
I imagine you have your reasons...

276
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:03,301
for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation.

277
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:10,351
My army is not designed For this kind of fighting.

278
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:12,601
Yesterday,yet again, I had to promote...

279
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:17,191
25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters.

280
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,861
Those snipers are demoralizing my people.

281
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:27,241
This city is no more than...

282
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,321
a heap of ruins.

283
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,581
But the fuehrer's persisting.

284
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:37,831
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself.

285
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,671
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct.

286
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:51,391
He always managed to lead us to victory.

287
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:57,101
We shall be back home For Christmas.

288
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:03,771
How are you going to go about finding this young Russian?

289
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:09,781
I'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me.

290
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:13,831
Vassili. Vassili.

291
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:17,001
-Come on,time to get up. -What?

292
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,871
They have a problem in the department store sector. They need us. Come on.

293
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:34,181
Look,Vassili,he's hiding in the department store. Over there.

294
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:41,141
So far this morning,

295
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:45,521
he's knocked off five officers, plus two machine gunners.

296
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:52,611
Look,third floor, fourth window from the left.

297
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:56,411
Fourth window from the left.

298
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,081
See him?

299
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:03,831
Yeah,I see him.

300
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:18,271
There,you got him!

301
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:21,231
Great shot.

302
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,481
Let's go get his dog tag.

303
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:32,531
Good-bye,comrade Commissar.

304
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,241
Thank you for your hospitality,Mrs. Filipov.

305
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,541
You can borrow whatever you like.

306
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:49,341
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters...

307
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:52,341
if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller.

308
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,431
-There's some Marx too.

309
00:38:56,011 --> 00:38:58,221
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district?

310
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,521
No,I volunteered.

311
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:03,851
It's such a coincidence meeting you like this.

312
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,901
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday...

313
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,361
how desperately we're in need of operators who speak German.

314
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:12,241
I can't. Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighbourhood.

315
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:14,281
We're already desperately short of men.

316
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:17,371
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German.

317
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:19,371
I'd rather stay and fight.

318
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:22,581
Serving at headquarters is fighting. You'd be far more useful there.

319
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,131
You stay here. You cover us.

320
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,381
- All right. -We go.

321
00:39:31,671 --> 00:39:34,051
Take care.

322
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,601
Ludmilla,come on.

323
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:33,651
Check the stairway.

324
00:42:22,511 --> 00:42:24,431
It's a trap.

325
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,851
I know.

326
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:53,161
Move back.

327
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:43,471
He's still here.

328
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:10,831
-They're coming straight for us! -Ludmilla,

329
00:44:10,871 --> 00:44:14,661
stay where you are, he's over there somewhere.

330
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,971
We have to get out of here!

331
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:34,391
-We have to get out of here! -Just stay where you are!

332
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:40,021
What are we gonna do?

333
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,481
Ludmilla,stay where you are!

334
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:56,121
Fuck this,I'm going.

335
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:01,131
Ludmilla,no!

336
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:54,261
What does this mean?

337
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,771
"The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,

338
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:05,611
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62, with its 3.5-power P.U. telescope.

339
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,691
Pride of precision Of Soviet production."

340
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:11,111
-I've seen that rifle close up. -Have you?

341
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:15,911
I've even touched it. I know him well,Vassili Zaitsev.

342
00:47:05,331 --> 00:47:10,011
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today, and it was my fault.

343
00:47:10,091 --> 00:47:12,511
No,I'm sure that's not true.

344
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:17,971
There was a German sniper. I walked them right into his trap.

345
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:21,291
- What else can you tell me? -He didn't relocate.

346
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:26,211
A sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal.

347
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:33,801
He was very good. It wasn't just his shooting,it was his instinct.

348
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,521
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

349
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:40,691
That's because he knows everything about you.

350
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:43,651
His name is Konig, Major Konig.

351
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:48,441
They've sent him here to ki-

352
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,611
to find you.

353
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:00,531
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.

354
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,661
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.

355
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:07,161
You've caused them so many sleepless nights,they sent their top marksman.

356
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,251
-What do we know about him? -He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

357
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:15,331
He's director of their sniper school in Zossen.

358
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:18,881
Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.

359
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:23,341
He knows all his tricks. From now on, he'll go with you everywhere.

360
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:26,851
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer...

361
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:30,101
against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves.

362
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:33,141
It's more than a confrontation between two nations.

363
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:39,731
It's the essence Of class struggle.

364
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:42,491
I'm glad you're so happy.

365
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:47,741
He had all the advantages. Next time you'll be even.

366
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:50,541
No one shoots like you,Vassili.

367
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:02,461
She's been transferred.

368
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:06,011
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

369
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:14,061
-Hello. -You look smart in your new uniform.

370
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:18,521
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished.

371
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,941
Yeah,they probably will.

372
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:29,071
I've heard the rumor about the German, and I wanted to wish you luck.

373
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:31,741
Thank you. I'll need it.

374
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:36,461
From what comrade Danilov tells me,you're going to win.

375
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:41,301
Hmm.

376
00:49:41,341 --> 00:49:43,511
It's time.

377
00:49:46,171 --> 00:49:49,141
- Vassili! Vassili! -Come to my arms.

378
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:54,391
-Look in my direction.

379
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:56,771
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic.

380
00:49:56,851 --> 00:49:59,651
-This way,comrade Zaitsev. -I love this little fellow.

381
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:03,231
Vassili,is it true that you volunteered for the front?

382
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,281
How old are you,Vassili?

383
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:06,321
Do you know what this duel means for our country?

384
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:10,321
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?

385
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:13,081
Are you proud to be challenged By the best sharpshooter in Germany?

386
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,161
The Germans are starting to shit their pants.

387
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:18,461
Go on,my boy,tell us how you're going to deal with him.

388
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:21,961
-Or rather,no. Tell it to the boss. -One more question,please.

389
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:25,211
He likes good hunting stories.

390
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,931
Look at him with pride,

391
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:36,771
because he's looking at you.

392
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:40,601
The whole country is looking at you.

393
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:06,511
Forgive me,forgive me, Grandfather.

394
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:41,541
So,it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground...

395
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:43,921
but the hunter.

396
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:50,591
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that.

397
00:51:54,721 --> 00:51:57,061
Except in this case,

398
00:51:57,101 --> 00:51:59,061
I'm the game.

399
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:05,971
However, today what we're going to do...

400
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:08,431
is lure the wolf out of his lair...

401
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:11,651
to where we want him to be.

402
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:53,851
You're the one whose life is valuable. You go first.

403
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:58,611
No,no. We take it in turns. Next time is your turn to go first,

404
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:00,651
and then it's you,Volodya.

405
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:20,011
Son of a bitch!

406
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:27,511
These are new pants. I just took them Off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

407
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:35,901
Sixteen months I spent in Germany at the school in Zossen.

408
00:53:35,981 --> 00:53:39,861
Of course,those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts,:

409
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:43,401
when our Joseph and their Adolph...

410
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:46,491
were walking hand in hand.

411
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:51,201
From here to the wire, 160meters,right?

412
00:53:56,961 --> 00:53:58,961
One hundred and fifty-five.

413
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:03,761
Whatever. That'll make 'em Send out a repair guy.

414
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:07,091
Let's relocate.

415
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:15,561
Aah!

416
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,911
Hey,Volodya!

417
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:41,421
After the Germans invaded us,

418
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:45,551
it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.

419
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,181
Threw my ass in prison.

420
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:51,011
What were you doing in Germany,huh?

421
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:55,731
Excuse me,says I,but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there.

422
00:54:55,811 --> 00:55:00,521
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery.

423
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:04,031
Confess,spy bastard! Confess.

424
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:08,111
And bang! Bang,bang,bang!

425
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:14,161
Well,there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer.

426
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:18,751
And bang. Knocked out all my teeth.

427
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:25,261
That's right,boy. Have no illusions.

428
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:28,681
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you.

429
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:36,731
Hey! It's your repair guy.

430
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,271
I got him.

431
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,041
It's about soup time, isn't it?

432
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,911
I'm going.

433
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:00,831
Well,get a move on,Volodya,

434
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:06,511
and try not to spill it all on your way back,you Marxist bastard.

435
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:22,441
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours,Herr Major.

436
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:28,651
Two sentries shot in the train station sector.

437
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:31,661
One artillery observer in the Northern sector.

438
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:35,121
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector.

439
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:38,701
Three telephone repairmen in the workers' housing sector.

440
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:43,081
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you.

441
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:45,091
I hope he's still able to speak.

442
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:47,801
Excuse me,sir?

443
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:50,341
Nothing. Thank you.

444
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:55,561
So,tell us,Volodya,

445
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:57,771
which building is he in?

446
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:02,481
There is no way I know that.

447
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,941
He moves around all the time.

448
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:09,901
He jumps from one to the next.

449
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:11,901
On which floor?

450
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:13,911
I don't know.

451
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:17,121
We'll see about that.

452
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,661
Undress him.

453
00:57:19,701 --> 00:57:22,211
Put him in one of our uniforms.

454
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:54,091
You see,they are stubborn.

455
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,351
That's the good thing about the Germans.

456
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,811
Man,you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads-

457
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,831
Right.

458
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:21,331
Let's see if our customer has arrived.

459
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:23,911
Are you ready?

460
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,961
Uh-huh.

461
00:58:26,001 --> 00:58:30,211
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals,

462
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,591
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,

463
00:58:32,671 --> 00:58:35,631
gets up to make sure he has hit his target.

464
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,511
Major Konig sees him.

465
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:44,811
Aims for his helmet.

466
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:47,441
Fires.

467
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:50,821
Reveals his position And is shot in turn.

468
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:06,001
Except... Major Konig doesn't fire...

469
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:12,381
because Major Konig isn't there.

470
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:18,261
Koulikov!

471
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:27,651
Don't you think that was strange, that last one?

472
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,821
They sent him out to get shot like the others.

473
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,821
It's not natural.

474
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:36,361
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him.

475
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,621
Oh,no,I'm the one who was stupid.

476
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:43,951
They don't give a shit about telephone guys.

477
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,961
I mean,it's like us with the Ukrainians.

478
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,501
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts.

479
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:55,381
Tomorrow,we'll kill us some generals.

480
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,601
Whose turn is it?

481
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:09,521
Mine,I think.

482
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:11,811
Oh,you're such a cheater!

483
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,361
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

484
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,281
No,no,no,no,no,no,no, it's my turn to go first.

485
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:24,491
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches.

486
01:01:40,451 --> 01:01:42,411
To victory.

487
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:54,551
This sniper business has been dragging on too long.

488
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,931
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

489
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,231
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

490
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:04,811
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.

491
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:06,771
He's meticulous in his preparation.

492
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:14,111
Vodka... is a luxury we have.

493
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:17,571
Caviar is a luxury we have.

494
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:20,491
Time is not.

495
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:23,541
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. We both are.

496
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:28,081
I assure you he will succeed.

497
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:30,211
Good.

498
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:34,511
It seems your destinies are entwined.

499
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:58,491
They're keeping you busy.

500
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:05,411
I picked this up in the kitchen.

501
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:09,251
It's from the reception the other day. I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

502
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:13,251
Um,she will be thrilled. That's very sweet of you.

503
01:03:14,381 --> 01:03:16,591
There's plenty more If you're hungry.

504
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:20,471
You're Jewish, aren't you?

505
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:24,891
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon.

506
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:29,481
My father had a premonition all this would happen.

507
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:31,691
You mean the war?

508
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:35,771
He understood that the hatred of the jews ran deep.

509
01:03:35,861 --> 01:03:40,071
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine.

510
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:44,371
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in;

511
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:47,281
the only land we had a duty to defend.

512
01:03:47,471 --> 01:03:51,601
He insisted learn to use a rifle.

513
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:53,931
I learned to shoot.

514
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:03,551
I know that in times of war,personal feelings should be put aside,but...

515
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,681
I have a favor to ask you.

516
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:08,011
Of course. Anything you want.

517
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:11,231
I want to be reassigned.

518
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:15,981
What's happened,Tania?

519
01:04:40,671 --> 01:04:42,591
He shot him.

520
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:48,891
He shot him even though he jumped first.

521
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,811
Shot him on the run.

522
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:55,141
It was an impossible shot.

523
01:04:55,231 --> 01:04:57,561
I've never seen anything like it.

524
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:01,031
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver.

525
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:05,861
I don't stand a chance against this man.

526
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:08,031
You mustn't talk like that,Vassili.

527
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:13,331
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements?

528
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:15,541
We've got someone,Vassili.

529
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:18,881
Someone close to him passing us information.

530
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:21,961
Next time you will be one step ahead of him.

531
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,631
I promise.

532
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:38,691
Now I have a favor to ask.

533
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:40,691
From me?

534
01:05:43,611 --> 01:05:45,531
It's about Tania.

535
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,951
Come in.

536
01:05:57,961 --> 01:06:00,041
He doesn't even know you exist.

537
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,881
But at that moment,you are closer to him than anyone else on earth.

538
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:07,091
You see his face through the sight.

539
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,551
You see whether he shaved that morning or not.

540
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,391
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on.

541
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,021
It's not like...

542
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:21,311
just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform.

543
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:24,481
It's a man's face.

544
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:28,281
Those faces don't go away.

545
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:33,491
They come back and they just- they get replaced by more faces.

546
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,751
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

547
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:40,581
He likes you very much. I think he'd try anything to change your mind.

548
01:06:40,671 --> 01:06:43,421
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer?

549
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:45,421
No.

550
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,421
This morning,a list arrived at headquarters.

551
01:06:48,511 --> 01:06:51,141
It was a list of civilians who'd been...

552
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:53,681
rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy...

553
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:56,311
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

554
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,311
My parents were amongst them.

555
01:07:02,611 --> 01:07:06,731
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers...

556
01:07:06,821 --> 01:07:10,951
stopped the train and forced everyone out.

557
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:17,241
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together,

558
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:20,211
two by two.

559
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,961
Mothers with daughters.

560
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:24,961
Husbands and wives.

561
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:31,051
They... lined them up against the railing,

562
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:34,511
and then they fired a single shot at each pair...

563
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,511
to save bullets.

564
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:40,351
It worked.

565
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:44,981
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water.

566
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:50,531
I know they died together.

567
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,701
They never would have let themselves be separated.

568
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:13,761
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good... rifle.

569
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,901
Thank you.

570
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:56,971
I know how he leaves the shelter.

571
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,971
He goes through the tractor factory.

572
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:02,271
The tractor factory is big.

573
01:09:04,981 --> 01:09:07,651
I know exactly where. He crawls through a gutter,

574
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:10,651
under a grate where the vats are,

575
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,741
then he goes out from the workshop.

576
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:16,071
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open.

577
01:09:16,161 --> 01:09:18,991
It's under a long,iron foot walk.

578
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:54,991
Good luck,comrade.

579
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:42,801
I know exactly where he's waiting for me.

580
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,771
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.

581
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:51,351
We'll take him out from behind.

582
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:16,541
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes.

583
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:18,551
Follow me.

584
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:07,241
You go that way. I'll go around this way.

585
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:10,121
Okay?

586
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,001
Shit!

587
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:38,801
Sergei, you should go back.

588
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:42,061
-No,I'll be all right. -Go back.

589
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:44,521
No,you go!

590
01:14:49,101 --> 01:14:51,021
Keep your legs in.

591
01:15:33,901 --> 01:15:38,741
Come on. Come on. Come on.

592
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:40,801
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort!

593
01:16:40,881 --> 01:16:42,891
The fate of the motherland is at risk!

594
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:45,601
The fate of all those you love and cherish!

595
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,061
It's for them that we fight today.

596
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:53,851
Listen to me,Tania. The Germans are throwing everything at us.

597
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:56,901
If they're lucky,one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive.

598
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:59,941
You're highly educated. You know languages.

599
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,411
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives.

600
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:07,331
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs.

601
01:17:07,411 --> 01:17:09,501
You have a duty to survive.

602
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:12,121
Vassili was born to fire a gun. It's what he knows.

603
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,921
You and I were born for a different purpose.

604
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:18,841
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing.

605
01:17:22,091 --> 01:17:26,601
Where is he? Where is Vassili?

606
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:34,501
Keep your head down.

607
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:37,211
-Tell me where he is. -Stay into that pipe,Tania.

608
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:39,291
Stay in. Stay in! Get your head in!

609
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,351
Slow down.

610
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:51,351
Don't shoot.

611
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:58,101
He's over there.

612
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:14,581
Do you see the pillar in front of you?

613
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:18,961
I need you to move round behind it.

614
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:30,761
Go.

615
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:37,811
Tania,I need you to find a large piece of glass.

616
01:19:37,891 --> 01:19:41,111
Piece of glass.

617
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,571
Do you see the kiln...

618
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:50,361
behind me to the left of the factory?

619
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,621
Yes? I can't hear you.

620
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,831
-Yes. -Yes.

621
01:19:57,871 --> 01:20:00,121
Do you see...

622
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:03,251
the two louvers?

623
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:07,421
-Yes. -Do you see the one...

624
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,261
with a broken slat?

625
01:20:10,341 --> 01:20:12,181
Yes.

626
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:14,391
This is what I want you to do.

627
01:20:21,351 --> 01:20:24,571
-Are you ready? -Yes.

628
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:28,901
Three... two... one...

629
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:49,431
Hello,Sacha.

630
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,651
He was right where you said he'd be.

631
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:01,151
Nearly there.

632
01:21:04,161 --> 01:21:06,121
He's very clever.

633
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:13,381
Tell me about him.

634
01:21:20,351 --> 01:21:24,231
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?

635
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:28,061
His father's dead. His mother too.

636
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:33,071
Does he talk about his father?

637
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:35,531
No. He didn't know him.

638
01:21:37,531 --> 01:21:39,821
Did he go to school?

639
01:21:39,911 --> 01:21:43,491
He knows how to write. He answers lots of letters.

640
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:46,621
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?

641
01:21:46,711 --> 01:21:49,501
Everyone writes to him.

642
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:51,631
Is there a girl he loves in his village?

643
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:55,591
-Not in his village,here. -Does she love him?

644
01:21:55,671 --> 01:21:58,591
Yes,because he's handsome.

645
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:01,621
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful.

646
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:04,101
I know her well. She's from my neighbour hood.

647
01:22:04,181 --> 01:22:07,191
She went to the university. They're handsome together.

648
01:22:07,271 --> 01:22:09,311
Later,the two of them will get married.

649
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,361
At least,I think so.

650
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:22,491
And you,Sacha,

651
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:24,501
why are you helping the Germans?

652
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,961
Because they're stronger. Because they're going to win the war.

653
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,261
And because you like chocolate,huh?

654
01:22:51,901 --> 01:22:54,861
All these people here know they're gonna die.

655
01:22:54,941 --> 01:22:58,281
So each night when they make it back,

656
01:22:58,361 --> 01:23:01,031
-it's a bonus.

657
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:03,701
-Excuse me.

658
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:06,201
So,every cup of tea,

659
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:08,501
every cigarette...

660
01:23:08,581 --> 01:23:12,081
becomes a little celebration.

661
01:23:12,171 --> 01:23:14,671
Because for a lot of us, it maybe our last night.

662
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:20,011
It's just something you have to accept here.

663
01:23:20,091 --> 01:23:22,011
Everyone has their time.

664
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:31,061
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years,

665
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:33,061
the donkey for nine.

666
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:39,821
So,that's-that's got to be a proverb from the Urals.

667
01:23:39,901 --> 01:23:41,861
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

668
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:45,831
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful.

669
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:47,831
Makes absolute sense.

670
01:23:47,911 --> 01:23:50,001
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.

671
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:53,001
You made it up.

672
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:56,961
So... I'm a donkey?

673
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:03,891
People like you and Danilov...

674
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:05,891
have to survive this.

675
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:09,351
People who have read books, had an education.

676
01:24:10,891 --> 01:24:13,351
We'll need you when the war is over.

677
01:24:13,441 --> 01:24:16,111
And if you survive?

678
01:24:16,191 --> 01:24:19,901
What will the useless Vassili Zaitsev do then?

679
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:23,241
I wanna work in a factory.

680
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:27,871
My granddad took me to a factory once.

681
01:24:27,951 --> 01:24:32,921
There was this man there, high up on a-

682
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:35,381
on a foot walk.

683
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:38,631
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

684
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:42,881
The people he was supervising didn't understand what they were doing.

685
01:24:42,971 --> 01:24:45,261
But for him, for him up there,

686
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:47,971
it was simple; it was clear.

687
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:53,271
And I thought,"One day, I could be that man."

688
01:24:58,901 --> 01:25:02,651
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen.

689
01:25:04,411 --> 01:25:06,321
Why shouldn't it?

690
01:25:08,661 --> 01:25:10,581
You'll outlive us all.

691
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:12,711
Hmm.

692
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:15,751
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

693
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:35,601
"150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga.

694
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:38,021
"Today the whole world is watching these 150meters.

695
01:25:38,111 --> 01:25:41,191
They are what makes Stalingrad..."

696
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,191
the capitol...

697
01:25:43,281 --> 01:25:45,451
of the war.

698
01:25:50,121 --> 01:25:52,081
Your friend,Tania...

699
01:25:53,451 --> 01:25:55,371
have you see her?

700
01:25:55,461 --> 01:25:58,211
She stays over there now, with the snipers.

701
01:26:00,631 --> 01:26:03,381
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters...

702
01:26:03,461 --> 01:26:06,131
to support the attack on the factory.

703
01:26:07,431 --> 01:26:09,851
Tell him Vassili will be there.

704
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:02,661
-I need to talk to you. -Sure.

705
01:30:02,661 --> 01:30:03,581
-I need to talk to you. -Sure.

706
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:10,131
-Danilov. -Hmm?

707
01:30:22,811 --> 01:30:25,391
You have to stop writing about me.

708
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:31,401
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough.

709
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:35,361
Sooner or later,he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me.

710
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:37,701
I've warned you before not to talk like this.

711
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:43,121
This time it's different.

712
01:30:44,751 --> 01:30:47,041
You've built me up...

713
01:30:47,121 --> 01:30:50,591
and up into someone I'm not.

714
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:55,211
I can't carry that weight anymore. I wanna fight.

715
01:30:56,421 --> 01:31:00,181
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

716
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:03,261
I understand.

717
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:07,021
The thing is,you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary.

718
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:10,691
No,I'm what you've made me.

719
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:13,321
Nothing more.

720
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:20,281
Why are you telling me this now?

721
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:22,661
Hmm? What's happened?

722
01:31:26,201 --> 01:31:28,161
What's changed?

723
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:35,171
Did you speak to Tania for me?

724
01:31:37,591 --> 01:31:39,511
-Yes. -Well...

725
01:31:39,591 --> 01:31:41,971
will she reconsider?

726
01:31:45,681 --> 01:31:47,851
I don't know.

727
01:31:50,391 --> 01:31:54,231
She should. She'll be much safer. She should,you know that.

728
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:57,901
-Yeah. -It'll be easier to get her reassigned.

729
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:01,201
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center.

730
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:04,491
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. We need you more than ever.

731
01:32:04,581 --> 01:32:06,581
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

732
01:32:11,211 --> 01:32:14,131
-Tell him what you know,Sacha. -Hello,Sacha.

733
01:32:14,211 --> 01:32:16,341
There was dust on the major's boots.

734
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:20,881
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side.

735
01:32:20,931 --> 01:32:23,891
I don't need to tell you the risk she's taking.

736
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:27,391
The dust was yellow. There's only one place where there's dust like that-

737
01:32:27,431 --> 01:32:30,691
in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks.

738
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:34,611
Well done.

739
01:32:34,651 --> 01:32:37,481
Sacha...

740
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:40,031
wait for me outside then.

741
01:32:46,951 --> 01:32:48,621
-Danilov, -Hmm?

742
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:52,581
you had no right to use him.

743
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:55,841
No,no,I didn't use him, Vassili.

744
01:32:55,921 --> 01:32:58,961
He did it of his own accord.

745
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:01,551
You know why?

746
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:03,761
Because he believes in you!

747
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:14,521
Tomorrow morning,we're going to take back the chemical factory.

748
01:33:14,601 --> 01:33:17,821
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there,

749
01:33:17,901 --> 01:33:20,571
so now you know where you have to wait for him.

750
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:23,861
-In the middle of an assault. -I'm following orders.

751
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:26,121
I suggest you do the same.

752
01:33:27,831 --> 01:33:30,911
Now,I'm aware of the risks.

753
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:32,911
You'll be fine.

754
01:33:37,461 --> 01:33:39,421
Comrade.

755
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:07,821
That's the Germans up there.

756
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:09,831
And yesterday was the Russians.

757
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:11,991
We're not very far now.

758
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,791
Sacha...

759
01:34:16,871 --> 01:34:19,131
you're playing a very dangerous game.

760
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:22,841
I want you to win.

761
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:27,221
See there? Keep going along the river.

762
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:29,891
It's safe... for a while.

763
01:38:45,021 --> 01:38:47,941
Aah!

764
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:12,801
He's dead. We found this on his corpse.

765
01:39:15,591 --> 01:39:19,301
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist.

766
01:39:19,391 --> 01:39:21,511
Pardon me,Herr General,

767
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:24,431
but I do not believe-

768
01:39:24,521 --> 01:39:26,771
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening.

769
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:29,191
You will be on it.

770
01:39:32,111 --> 01:39:35,481
Until then,I must ask you for your dog tags.

771
01:39:37,581 --> 01:39:40,671
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death.

772
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:43,331
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

773
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:45,791
You've already had a near miss.

774
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:57,921
Also please take this War Merit Cross.

775
01:39:57,971 --> 01:39:59,511
It was awarded posthumously...

776
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:01,891
to a lieutenant of the 116th Infantry Division...

777
01:40:01,971 --> 01:40:04,061
who fell here during the first days of the battle.

778
01:40:04,061 --> 01:40:05,471
who fell here during the first days of the battle.

779
01:40:06,681 --> 01:40:08,641
He was my son.

780
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:14,191
If the landing is captured, everything's lost!

781
01:40:16,691 --> 01:40:18,611
Come here.

782
01:40:21,911 --> 01:40:23,821
What did I tell you?

783
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:26,541
You've been playing your fiddle too much!

784
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:29,371
If it's confirmed that he's dead,we're sunk!

785
01:40:29,411 --> 01:40:33,171
-Well,you're sunk. -It isn't true.

786
01:40:33,251 --> 01:40:36,051
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters.

787
01:40:36,131 --> 01:40:39,011
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front of our men?

788
01:40:39,051 --> 01:40:42,051
They're lying.

789
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:46,311
That's good. Very good.

790
01:40:46,351 --> 01:40:50,141
Write it,then. "Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

791
01:40:50,231 --> 01:40:52,651
"This is what he had for breakfast this morning.

792
01:40:52,731 --> 01:40:57,191
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper." You're the poet".

793
01:40:57,231 --> 01:40:59,191
-What?

794
01:40:59,241 --> 01:41:01,781
You won't give up the riverbank!

795
01:41:01,861 --> 01:41:04,871
I don’t care if you’ve lost half your men!

796
01:41:04,951 --> 01:41:08,041
Lose the other half, or lose yourself!

797
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,381
Is he back?

798
01:41:18,551 --> 01:41:20,461
He should be back soon.

799
01:41:22,801 --> 01:41:25,181
The German attack cut the lines. That's why he's late.

800
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:29,771
Can we go outside?

801
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:38,691
I wrote to my mother about you.

802
01:41:38,771 --> 01:41:41,241
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over,

803
01:41:41,281 --> 01:41:43,651
if there's anything you needed- anything at all-

804
01:41:43,701 --> 01:41:46,031
our family will be there for you.

805
01:41:48,451 --> 01:41:50,541
You know I'm here for you.

806
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:57,751
They're saying Vassili is dead.

807
01:41:57,841 --> 01:42:02,171
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again.

808
01:42:02,221 --> 01:42:05,841
Surrender! This is your only hope.

809
01:42:09,681 --> 01:42:12,271
You're upset.

810
01:42:12,351 --> 01:42:14,641
Because Zaitsev is dead?

811
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:20,361
You don't have to hide it. There's no shame in it.

812
01:42:21,441 --> 01:42:23,781
You're a Russian like he is.

813
01:42:26,611 --> 01:42:28,781
Don't listen to them.

814
01:42:28,871 --> 01:42:32,161
It's just propaganda.

815
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:34,251
He isn't dead.

816
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:37,331
And do you know why?

817
01:42:38,581 --> 01:42:40,801
Because I haven't killed him yet.

818
01:42:47,801 --> 01:42:49,721
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

819
01:42:51,601 --> 01:42:54,681
Only you,because I know I can trust you.

820
01:42:54,731 --> 01:42:57,901
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul.

821
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:03,401
You swear?

822
01:43:03,441 --> 01:43:06,491
I found a terrific spot.

823
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:09,321
It's by the exit from the train station.

824
01:43:09,411 --> 01:43:12,241
I'll hide in the water tower.

825
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:15,291
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there.

826
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:19,421
You'll see. He'll be there.

827
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:24,671
He always is.

828
01:43:31,801 --> 01:43:35,681
I also want you to swear that from now on,you'll stay home where you belong.

829
01:43:37,981 --> 01:43:41,651
Do you swear? Yes?

830
01:43:44,731 --> 01:43:47,651
Good.

831
01:43:47,741 --> 01:43:49,741
"We know he's alive. We know he won't fail us.

832
01:43:49,821 --> 01:43:53,121
We know because he is a part of us now. Vassili is eternal."

833
01:43:56,201 --> 01:43:59,621
Where have you been? We've looked everywhere for you.

834
01:43:59,711 --> 01:44:03,341
Oh,didn't you hear? I was dead.

835
01:44:03,421 --> 01:44:07,421
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev...

836
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:12,391
Vassili was dead.

837
01:44:12,431 --> 01:44:14,391
The real one.

838
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:19,601
Me...

839
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:21,601
I was asleep,

840
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:23,561
and I missed my chance.

841
01:44:23,651 --> 01:44:28,991
Then,I was curled up in a corner,hiding...

842
01:44:29,071 --> 01:44:31,531
from a man who wants to kill me.

843
01:44:31,611 --> 01:44:34,411
I'll talk to Kruschev.

844
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:37,541
He'll send you back to your old division.

845
01:44:37,621 --> 01:44:40,961
-Where's Tania? -She's at the shelter.

846
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:43,291
I've been to the shelter.

847
01:44:43,381 --> 01:44:45,501
I told her you weren't dead.

848
01:44:47,261 --> 01:44:50,801
The major said so. He said the other Germans were lying.

849
01:44:50,881 --> 01:44:53,971
He told me you were waiting for him at the station.

850
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:59,811
Vassili.

851
01:45:20,251 --> 01:45:22,211
Vassili.

852
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,671
Vassili.

853
01:45:32,471 --> 01:45:34,801
My little Sacha.

854
01:45:34,841 --> 01:45:36,761
I knew it.

855
01:45:54,821 --> 01:45:57,491
-Vassili. -Tania.

856
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,581
I knew you weren't dead.

857
01:46:06,671 --> 01:46:09,091
How?

858
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:11,921
Because we only just met.

859
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:20,851
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl.

860
01:46:20,931 --> 01:46:24,231
When I opened my eyes, Sacha was standing there...

861
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:26,521
waiting to give me the good news.

862
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:32,441
I think he loves you even more than I do.

863
01:46:56,841 --> 01:46:59,551
To the proper military authority,

864
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:02,181
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed...

865
01:47:02,271 --> 01:47:06,311
in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

866
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:10,481
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties,

867
01:47:10,521 --> 01:47:12,941
voiced doubts on the chances of our victory...

868
01:47:13,031 --> 01:47:14,941
and made defeatist comments in public.

869
01:47:16,531 --> 01:47:19,161
The inexplicable duration of his duel...

870
01:47:19,241 --> 01:47:24,161
with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by...

871
01:47:24,201 --> 01:47:27,001
his lack of belief in the communist ideal.

872
01:47:34,961 --> 01:47:36,881
Good morning,Sacha.

873
01:47:38,841 --> 01:47:42,761
Once again,he knew exactly where to find me.

874
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:46,271
Don't you think that's strange?

875
01:47:46,351 --> 01:47:50,151
-Apart from me,only you knew.

876
01:47:50,231 --> 01:47:52,981
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.

877
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:56,441
You've done a very brave thing.

878
01:47:56,491 --> 01:47:59,451
You've chosen your camp. I respect that.

879
01:47:59,531 --> 01:48:01,451
But it isn't my camp.

880
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:04,411
We're both soldiers,

881
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:09,251
and we're both enemies, so I know you understand.

882
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:14,921
I'm annoyed with you,little Sacha,for not staying home as I made you swear to.

883
01:48:15,001 --> 01:48:18,341
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do.

884
01:48:23,891 --> 01:48:27,811
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep.

885
01:48:30,901 --> 01:48:33,401
How long have you been watching me?

886
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,861
All night.

887
01:48:35,941 --> 01:48:38,901
You've been snoring away happily for hours.

888
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:41,911
I don't snore. Do I?

889
01:48:41,991 --> 01:48:43,911
Like a pig.

890
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:46,491
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.

891
01:48:46,581 --> 01:48:48,501
Yes.

892
01:48:50,751 --> 01:48:52,791
There's something I should tell you.

893
01:49:00,381 --> 01:49:03,181
On the train...

894
01:49:03,261 --> 01:49:05,221
coming here...

895
01:49:07,061 --> 01:49:09,181
we were in the same car.

896
01:49:09,271 --> 01:49:11,191
No.

897
01:49:11,271 --> 01:49:13,441
I saw you.

898
01:49:13,521 --> 01:49:16,981
You were reading, and you fell asleep.

899
01:49:19,441 --> 01:49:23,031
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful.

900
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:26,701
It was scary.

901
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:33,621
Afterwards,I couldn't stop thinking about you.

902
01:49:33,711 --> 01:49:35,631
It made me smile.

903
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:41,551
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you...

904
01:49:43,841 --> 01:49:45,891
who'd make you laugh...

905
01:49:48,471 --> 01:49:50,391
how lucky they were.

906
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:55,151
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

907
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:56,941
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

908
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:02,491
-Was I snoring? -Like a pig.

909
01:50:33,891 --> 01:50:36,601
-What?

910
01:50:40,321 --> 01:50:43,491
-Oh,my God! -Oh,no.

911
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:45,491
-Oh,my God! -Tania,no.

912
01:50:45,571 --> 01:50:47,531
-Tania,no! -No,get off me!

913
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:50,281
-Get off me! Get off me! -It's what he wants!

914
01:50:50,371 --> 01:50:52,291
-This is what he wants! -Get off me!

915
01:50:52,371 --> 01:50:55,711
-No,he'll kill you. He'll kill you! -Let me go!

916
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:58,921
-I'll run after you,and he'll kill me. -Let me go!

917
01:50:59,041 --> 01:51:01,801
-Let me go! -This is what he wants! I'll get him.

918
01:51:01,881 --> 01:51:04,721
-I promise I'll get him.

919
01:51:04,801 --> 01:51:07,841
I'll get his rifle for you. I promise,Tania.

920
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:30,371
I need you.

921
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:36,661
You have to leave now,Mrs. Filipov. Stalingrad may fall.

922
01:51:36,711 --> 01:51:39,461
The last of the boats are leaving. The Germans will be here any moment.

923
01:51:39,501 --> 01:51:42,921
He's brought you a pass. You'll be safe on the other side.

924
01:51:42,961 --> 01:51:45,761
Gather your things,and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage.

925
01:51:45,801 --> 01:51:49,391
I'm not leaving. This is my home.

926
01:51:49,471 --> 01:51:52,471
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

927
01:51:52,561 --> 01:51:54,851
I have to tell you something, Mrs. Filipov.

928
01:51:57,441 --> 01:52:00,441
Something very difficult to understand.

929
01:52:00,521 --> 01:52:02,481
It's about Sacha.

930
01:52:16,911 --> 01:52:19,621
He's gone over to the Germans. He's betrayed his country.

931
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:22,081
He's with the enemy now. He won't be coming back.

932
01:52:25,001 --> 01:52:26,921
Oh,my God.

933
01:52:29,881 --> 01:52:31,801
Oh,my God.

934
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:37,931
He's become a traitor.

935
01:52:38,021 --> 01:52:40,901
The poor little thing.

936
01:52:40,941 --> 01:52:43,811
What has he done?

937
01:52:46,531 --> 01:52:48,571
So,he's going to stay over there?

938
01:52:54,161 --> 01:52:59,001
Yes... he's going to stay over there.

939
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:02,751
I shouldn't be saying this,comrade Commissar,

940
01:53:02,831 --> 01:53:05,671
but maybe it's for the best.

941
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:08,091
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

942
01:53:08,171 --> 01:53:12,091
I know it's wrong,but perhaps he has made the right choice.

943
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:34,241
- Oh! Oh,Tania! - Tania?

944
01:53:35,411 --> 01:53:38,201
-Oh,Tania! -Tania!

945
01:53:39,251 --> 01:53:42,211
Oh,my God! Oh!

946
01:53:58,471 --> 01:54:03,191
I need a doctor! A doctor!

947
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:09,731
I have a pass. I have a pass!

948
01:54:09,821 --> 01:54:11,741
You must let her cross.

949
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:16,371
Please!

950
01:54:16,451 --> 01:54:20,491
-It's useless. She'll never make it. -No! No,she will!

951
01:54:20,581 --> 01:54:23,711
She's my daughter! She's my daughter!

952
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:26,171
-I beg of you! -All right.

953
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:29,091
-Oh,thank you! -Put this one on the boat.

954
01:55:15,931 --> 01:55:18,641
Where is he?

955
01:55:18,721 --> 01:55:21,221
Where's the major?

956
01:55:21,311 --> 01:55:23,471
A few inches from your face.

957
01:55:23,811 --> 01:55:26,811
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

958
01:55:29,661 --> 01:55:33,871
Man will always be man.

959
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:36,041
There is no new man.

960
01:55:37,381 --> 01:55:40,711
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal,

961
01:55:40,801 --> 01:55:43,551
where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor.

962
01:55:43,631 --> 01:55:47,011
But there's always something to envy.

963
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:50,721
A smile...

964
01:55:50,811 --> 01:55:52,771
a friendship.

965
01:55:54,271 --> 01:55:58,271
Something you don't have and want to appropriate.

966
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:01,981
In this world- even a Soviet one-

967
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:05,201
there will always be rich and poor.

968
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:09,031
Rich in gifts...

969
01:56:10,531 --> 01:56:12,491
poor in gifts.

970
01:56:13,541 --> 01:56:15,501
Rich in love...

971
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:18,631
poor in love.

972
01:56:24,921 --> 01:56:27,971
Tania isn't coming back.

973
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:31,051
She's dead,Vassili.

974
01:56:39,691 --> 01:56:43,981
She was cut down by shrapnel. It was quick.

975
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:46,031
I don't think she even saw it coming.

976
01:56:47,821 --> 01:56:49,861
She was on her way back to you.

977
01:56:49,951 --> 01:56:54,991
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to the boats,she was coming back for you.

978
01:56:55,081 --> 01:56:59,921
She was right. You're a good man,Vassili.

979
01:57:04,051 --> 01:57:06,591
I want to help you, Vassili.

980
01:57:06,671 --> 01:57:09,381
Let me do one last thing.

981
01:57:09,471 --> 01:57:11,931
Something useful for a change.

982
01:57:17,521 --> 01:57:19,481
Let me show you where the major is.

983
01:57:19,521 --> 01:57:22,021
Don't do that. Don't do that!

984
02:01:36,691 --> 02:01:41,911
Today,February3,1943, is an ominous day for Hitler...

985
02:01:41,951 --> 02:01:46,331
and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners.

986
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:50,331
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland.

987
02:02:03,221 --> 02:02:07,221
After 180 days of heroic combat...

988
02:02:07,311 --> 02:02:09,351
in the market city of Stalingrad,

989
02:02:09,431 --> 02:02:14,691
and as a result of the valor and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

990
02:02:14,731 --> 02:02:17,901
the commander of our glorious Red Army...

991
02:02:17,941 --> 02:02:21,071
received the unconditional surrender...

992
02:02:21,151 --> 02:02:24,911
of the German fascist invaders.

993
02:02:37,051 --> 02:02:41,301
Sorry. No,young man, I cannot find...

994
02:02:41,381 --> 02:02:43,301
-a matching name in the book. -Could you check again?

995
02:02:43,381 --> 02:02:46,221
-This is the address and her name. -She is not here.

996
02:02:46,301 --> 02:02:50,891
Yes,this is our address, but we don't have her anymore.

997
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:53,731
-This is the address. She's been here. -I'm so sorry.

998
02:02:53,771 --> 02:02:56,521
-She wrote to me. -I looked three times. She's not here.

999
02:02:56,561 --> 02:03:02,031
Believe me,there is no Tania Chernova. I can't help you.

1000
02:03:02,111 --> 02:03:04,031
I'm so sorry.
