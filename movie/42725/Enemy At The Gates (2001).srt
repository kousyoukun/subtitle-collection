<i>Very slowly,</i>
<i>I put snow in my mouth,</i>

5
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:08,170
<i>I take my time.</i>
<i>I let him come closer.</i>

6
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,049
<i>I have only one bullet.</i>
<i>I aim at his eye.</i>

7
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>Very gently, my finger</i>

8
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,562
<i>I do not tremble.</i>

9
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:30,234
<i>I have no fear.</i>
<i>I'm a big boy now.</i>

10
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,033
<i>Ready, Vassili?</i>

11
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,911
Now, Vassili.
Fire!

12
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>Fire, Vassili!</i>
<i>Fire!</i>

13

You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

16
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,787
<i>All civilians, get out!</i>

17
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>Make way, let the civilians off.</i>

18
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,709
<i>This is a military convoy.</i>

<i>No one stays on board</i>

<i>The German Third Reich</i>

<i>where the fate of the world</i>

30

<i>Go forward, comrades.</i>
<i>Not a step backwards!</i>

90
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:45,083
-Do you know how to shoot?
-A little.

91
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,096
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

92
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,122
Thank you,
comrade Commissar.

93
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:58,717
Danilov, political officer,
second class.

94
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,721
Twenty-first infantry.

<i>Make way for</i>

I carried out my orders.

116
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:23,070
I sent in
all of my boys.

117
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,698
But the Germans
engulfed us.

118
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:30,953
They have artillery,
aircraft, tanks.

119
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:35,165
-And me, what did I have?
-The sacred duty to resist!

120
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,709
I have to
report to the boss.

121
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:43,006
Perhaps you'd prefer
to avoid the red tape.

122
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,574
My name is...

123
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:13,328
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

124
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,416
I've come to take things
in hand here.

125
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,503
This city is not Kursk...

126
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:25,424
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

127
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,052
This city is Stalingrad.

128
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,848
Stalingrad!

129
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,101
This city bears the name
of the boss.

130
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,729
It's more than a city,
it's a symbol.

131
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:44,067
If the Germans
capture this city,

132
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:48,572
the entire country
will collapse.

133
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,826
Now, I want our boys...

134
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,537
to raise their heads.

135
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:59,249
I want them to act like
they have balls!

136
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:03,504
I want them to stop shitting
their pants!

137
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:10,469
That's your job.

138
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:15,849
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

139
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,397
You,
what's your suggestion?

140
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,900
Shoot all the other generals
who have retreated...

141
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,153
<i>and their</i>
<i>chiefs of staff too.</i>

142
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:31,073
M-Make some examples.

143
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:35,410
<i>-D-D-Deport families of the deserters...</i>
-Yeah, that's all been done.

144
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,829
<i>Give them hope!</i>

145
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:53,804
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

146
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,974
But there's another way.
The way of courage.

147
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,476
The way of love
of the motherland.

148
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,478
We must publish
the army newspaper again.

149
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,647
We must tell magnificent stories.
Stories that extol...

150
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,691
<i>sacrifice, bravery.</i>

151
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,026
<i>We must make them believe</i>
<i>in the victory.</i>

152
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,155
We must give them hope,
pride, a desire to fight.

153
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:16,326
Yes, we need to
make examples.

154
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:19,496
But examples to follow.

155
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,458
What we need...
are heroes.

156
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,840
Do you know any heroes
around here?

157
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:35,387
Yes, comrade,
I know one.

158
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,311
<i>That's me!</i>

159
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:46,356
"Vassili Zaitsev."
That's me!

160
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,484
No, you're not dreaming.
It's your name.

161
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,321
We made the front page.

162
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,657
They haven't changed a word.

163
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,119
Do you have any idea
what this means?

164
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:01,747
It's not the back page,
it's not the second page,

165
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,082
-it's the front page.
-The front page!

166
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,585
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere.

167
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:10,631
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

168
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:14,092
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

169
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,888
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

170
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,641
<i>We're famous, Vassili.</i>
<i>Kruschev loved the article.</i>

171
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,768
He's promoted me
to the general staff.

172
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,355
And you
to sniper division.

173
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,442
-Well, that's good.
-It's very good.

174
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,737
-It's very good. It's great.
-It's very great!

175
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,031
-It's great!
-For us because we did it together.

176
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,574
Together!

177
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,743
-Although I did all the hard work.
-Oh, yeah?

178
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,120
-You're very lucky I can't fight back.
-Why's that?

179
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,540
Because Kruschev told me to make sure
nothing happens to you.

180
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,583
-You're too important.
-I'm too valuable.

181
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,211
Yes, careful of my... careful
of my glasses, please. They're new.

182
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,255
Sorry, sir.

183
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,884
-I'm famous! We're famous!
-I'm famous! I'm famous!

184
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,512
<i>Vassili,</i>
<i>the young shepherd from the Urals,</i>

185
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,514
<i>killed his 12th</i>
<i>German officer today.</i>

186
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,599
<i>He used to hunt wolves,</i>
<i>now he shoots fascists.</i>

187
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,769
Today, Vassili Zaitsev
shot his 23rd German officer.

188
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,855
<i>He is an example to us all.</i>

189
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,482
<i>Vassili shot</i>
<i>his 32nd German officer.</i>

190
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:17,197
<i>Count only the Germans</i>
<i>you have killed.</i>

191
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,283
<i>-Today, Vassili Zaitsev...</i>
<i>-Here is the evidence...</i>

192
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,994
<i>11 dog tags retrieved</i>
<i>by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.</i>

193
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,836
<i>More and more men and women, fighters</i>
<i>from all branches of our armed forces,</i>

194
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:35,340
<i>join the sniper division and learn</i>
<i>the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.</i>

195
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,430
<i>I am a stone.</i>

196
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,561
<i>I am a stone.</i>

197
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,647
<i>I breathe slowly.</i>

198
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,533
<i>I aim at the eye.</i>

199
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,898
<i>So it is you,</i>

200
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,652
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

201
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,197
-My mother makes potatoes with bacon.
-Sounds good.

202
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,783
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

203
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:49,081
-How many today?
-Only two.

204
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,000
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

205
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:56,755
He was only a foot soldier.
Wasn't worth giving away my position.

206
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,134
Bless you.

207
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,095
We know how much
we owe you.

208
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,682
We pray for you every day.

209
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:11,562
Every evening, we listen to them talk
about you on Radio Moscow.

210
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:15,315
Thanks. You've certainly
managed well down here.

211
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,028
<i>My parents used to store furniture</i>
<i>down here before the war.</i>

212
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,739
Sacha, drop that right now.

213
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,826
It's loaded.

214
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,211
This way, comrade Commissar.

215
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,255
Thank you, comrade.

216
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,426
Good evening.

217
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,389
Comrade Zaitsev?

218
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,564
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

219
00:30:55,647 --> 00:31:00,694
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

220
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,821
This one's from the workers
of the Kouzbass.

221
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,908
<i>They want to name</i>
<i>their mine after Vassili.</i>

222
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,951
Right, let's start
with the miners.

223
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:11,955
Come on,
let's get to work.

224
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:18,921
<i>Dear comrades</i>
<i>from the Kouzbass,</i>

225
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,966
-Kouzbass.
-I thank you for your letter of praise.

226
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,886
-Praise?
-R-A-l-S-E.

227
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:33,769
And... I hope that
I can live up...

228
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:38,774
to your expectations...
A-T-I-O-N-S.

229
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:42,569
<i>Expectations.</i>

230
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,447
You're interested
in German literature, Mrs. Filipov?

231
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,537
<i>It's all right,</i>
<i>it's our neighbor.</i>

232
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,164
<i>-Right, where were we?</i>
-Tania, we have guests.

233
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:57,084
<i>Your offer to name...</i>

234
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,135
<i>l...</i>

235
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,137
l-I recognize you.

236
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,892
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

237
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,940
I saw your picture
in the paper.

238
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,026
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for everything you're doing.</i>

239
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,822
-And this is his friend, Commissar...
-Danilov.

240
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:29,032
Danilov.

241
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,201
Tania is like
a daughter to me.

242
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,580
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

243
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,832
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

244
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:40,544
-Oh, they're yours?
-She studied German at the university.

245
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,921
-Which university?
-Moscow.

246
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,471
Moscow. Moscow.

247
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:55,726
Shouldn't we, uh...

248
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:59,104
Yes, let's continue.

249
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:03,609
<i>Your offer to name</i>
<i>your mine after me...</i>

250
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,321
is... a great honor.

251
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:13,076
H-O-N.

252
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,120
Yes, I know.
Honor.

253
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:17,915
Very good.

254
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:23,420
Shouldn't we make the point that
I'm not the only one fighting?

255
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:27,466
<i>That... That's excellent...</i>
<i>excellent idea, Vassili.</i>

256
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,593
-We can take it even further though.
-Oh.

257
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,637
We can take it further.

258
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,766
<i>Your battle for</i>
<i>the production of coal...</i>

259
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:39,436
is as worthy as mine.

260
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:44,316
There's no "K" in coal.

261
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,401
<i>Just-Just one "L."</i>

262
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,823
<i>Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.</i>

263
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:54,660
-No, you're not going too fast.
-You sure?

264
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,828
<i>I just thought is there</i>
<i>any other improvements?</i>

265
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:01,416
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

266
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,919
<i>We should carry on.</i>
<i>We're not tired.</i>

267
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,130
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.
These people...

268
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:10,092
took the trouble
to write to us.

269
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,512
Tomorrow, we may not
be around to write back.

270
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,960
Major Konig,
Herr General.

271
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:51,109
I was expecting
someone...

272
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:53,111
else.

273
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:56,073
Certainly not someone
so prestigious.

274
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,116
I imagine you have
your reasons...

275
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,037
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

276
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:09,086
<i>My army is not designed</i>
<i>for this kind of fighting.</i>

277
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,380
<i>Yesterday, yet again,</i>
<i>I had to promote...</i>

278
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:15,926
25 sergeants to replace the officers
shot down by their sharpshooters.

279
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,598
<i>Those snipers are</i>
<i>demoralizing my people.</i>

280
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,978
This city is no more than...

281
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:28,105
a heap of ruins.

282
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,318
But the fuehrer's persisting.

283
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:36,613
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

284
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:46,456
We should trust
the fuehrer's instinct.

285
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,127
He always managed to
lead us to victory.

286
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,841
<i>We shall be back home</i>
<i>for Christmas.</i>

287
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:02,514
How are you going to go about finding
this young Russian?

288
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:08,520
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

289
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,608
Vassili.
Vassili.

290
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:15,777
-Come on, time to get up.
-What?

291
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:19,656
They have a problem in the department
store sector. They need us. Come on.

292
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:32,920
<i>Look, Vassili, he's hiding</i>
<i>in the department store. Over there.</i>

293
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,885
<i>So far this morning,</i>

294
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:44,264
he's knocked off five officers,
plus two machine gunners.

295
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:51,355
<i>Look, third floor,</i>
<i>fourth window from the left.</i>

296
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:55,150
Fourth window from the left.

297
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,863
<i>See him?</i>

298
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:02,574
Yeah, I see him.

299
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,047
<i>There, you got him!</i>

300
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,925
<i>Great shot.</i>

301
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,264
Let's go get
his dog tag.

302
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:31,270
<i>Good-bye, comrade Commissar.</i>

303
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,022
Thank you for your
hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.

304
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,284
You can borrow
whatever you like.

305
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,078
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters...

306
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,081
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

307
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,208
There's some Marx too.

308
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,962
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

309
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,298
No, I volunteered.

310
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,593
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

311
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,636
Comrade Kruschev was
telling me just yesterday...

312
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,139
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

313
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:10,976
I can't. Our militia's responsible
for all the people in this neighborhood.

314
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,061
We're already
desperately short of men.

315
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:16,106
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

316
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,150
I'd rather stay and fight.

317
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,320
Serving at headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

318
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,866
<i>You stay here.</i>
<i>You cover us.</i>

319
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,118
<i>-All right.</i>
-We go.

320
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,831
Take care.

321
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,337
Ludmilla, come on.

322
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,432
Check the stairway.

323
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,252
It's a trap.

324
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,629
I know.

325
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:51,989
Move back.

326
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,247
He's still here.

327
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,608
-They're coming straight for us!
<i>-Ludmilla,</i>

328
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:13,445
stay where you are,
he's over there somewhere.

329
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,750
We have to
get out of here!

330
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:33,215
-We have to get out of here!
-Just stay where you are!

331
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,804
What are we gonna do?

332
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,306
Ludmilla, stay where you are!

333
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,945
Fuck this, I'm going.

334
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,950
Ludmilla, no!

335
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,045
What does this mean?

336
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:58,550
"The little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle,

337
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:04,389
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-Power P.U. Telescope.

338
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,475
Pride of precision
of Soviet production."

339
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:09,895
-I've seen that rifle close up.
-Have you?

340
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:14,691
I've even touched it.
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

341
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:08,787
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today,
and it was my fault.

342
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,290
No, I'm sure
that's not true.

343
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:16,753
There was a German sniper.
I walked them right into his trap.

344
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:20,215
<i>-What else can you tell me?</i>
<i>-He didn't relocate.</i>

345
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:25,137
A sniper who doesn't
relocate isn't normal.

346
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:32,644
<i>He was very good. It wasn't just</i>
<i>his shooting, it was his instinct.</i>

347
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,397
He was a step ahead
of me all the time.

348
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,610
That's because he knows
everything about you.

349
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,571
His name is Konig,
Major Konig.

350
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:47,284
They've sent him here
to ki...

351
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:50,495
to find you.

352
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:59,630
At first we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

353
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,758
It seems he's come
all the way from Berlin to stop you.

354
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:06,261
You've caused them so many sleepless
nights, they sent their top marksman.

355
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:10,349
-What do we know about him?
-He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

356
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:14,436
He's director of their
sniper school in Zossen.

357
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,981
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

358
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:22,444
<i>He knows all his tricks. From now on,</i>
<i>he'll go with you everywhere.</i>

359
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:25,948
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer...

360
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:29,201
against a shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

361
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:32,204
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

362
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:38,836
It's the essence
of class struggle.

363
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,588
I'm glad
you're so happy.

364
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:46,844
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

365
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,638
No one shoots
like you, Vassili.

366
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:01,525
She's been transferred.

367
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:05,112
I'll see if they're ready
for you next door.

368
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:13,161
-Hello.
-You look smart in your new uniform.

369
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:17,624
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

370
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,043
Yeah, they probably will.

371
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:28,218
<i>I've heard the rumor about the German,</i>
<i>and I wanted to wish you luck.</i>

372
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,846
Thank you.
I'll need it.

373
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:35,559
From what comrade Danilov
tells me, you're going to win.

374
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:40,397
Hmm.

375
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,566
It's time.

376
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:48,238
<i>-Vassili! Vassili!</i>
-Come to my arms.

377
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:53,535
Look in my direction.

378
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,871
Put your cap back on,
you look more heroic.

379
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:58,749
-<i>This way, comrade Zaitsev.</i>
-I love this little fellow.

380
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:02,377
<i>Vassili, is it true that</i>
<i>you volunteered for the front?</i>

381
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:03,420
<i>How old are you, Vassili?</i>

382
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:05,464
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

383
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:09,468
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

384
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,221
<i>Are you proud to be challenged</i>
<i>by the best sharpshooter in Germany?</i>

385
00:50:12,304 --> 00:50:14,264
The Germans are starting
to shit their pants.

386
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,559
<i>Go on, my boy, tell us how</i>
<i>you're going to deal with him.</i>

387
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:21,063
-Or rather, no. Tell it to the boss.
<i>-One more question, please.</i>

388
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:24,316
He likes
good hunting stories.

389
00:50:29,863 --> 00:50:33,033
Look at him with pride,

390
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,869
because he's looking at you.

391
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:39,748
The whole country
is looking at you.

392
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:05,649
Forgive me, forgive me,
Grandfather.

393
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,684
So, it's not the wolf that
chooses the hunting ground...

394
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:43,020
but the hunter.

395
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,735
But I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

396
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:56,158
Except in this case,

397
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,160
I'm the game.

398
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:05,375
<i>However,</i>
<i>today what we're going to do...</i>

399
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,878
<i>is lure the wolf</i>
<i>out of his lair...</i>

400
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,048
<i>to where we want him to be.</i>

401
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:53,298
You're the one whose life is valuable.
You go first.

402
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,053
No, no. We take it in turns.
Next time is your turn to go first,

403
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,097
<i>and then it's you, Volodya.</i>

404
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:19,408
Son of a bitch!

405
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:26,957
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251 st yesterday.

406
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:35,299
Sixteen months I spent
in Germany at the school in Zossen.

407
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:39,303
<i>Of course, those were the days</i>
<i>when we were friends with the Krauts;</i>

408
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:42,806
<i>when our Joseph</i>
<i>and their Adolph...</i>

409
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:45,934
<i>were walking hand in hand.</i>

410
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:50,606
<i>From here to the wire,</i>
<i>160 meters, right?</i>

411
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:58,363
One hundred and fifty-five.

412
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:03,160
<i>Whatever. That'll make 'em</i>
<i>send out a repair guy.</i>

413
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:06,496
<i>Let's relocate.</i>

414
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,963
Aah!

415
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:28,352
Hey, Volodya!

416
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:40,864
After the Germans
invaded us,

417
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:44,952
it wasn't the same
atmosphere anymore.

418
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,579
Threw my ass
in prison.

419
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:50,415
What were you doing
in Germany, huh?

420
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:55,170
Excuse me, says I, but it was
comrade Stalin who sent me there.

421
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:59,925
Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

422
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,428
Confess, spy bastard!
Confess.

423
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:07,516
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

424
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,564
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

425
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:18,151
And bang.
Knocked out all my teeth.

426
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:24,700
<i>That's right, boy.</i>
<i>Have no illusions.</i>

427
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:28,078
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

428
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:36,086
<i>Hey! It's your repair guy.</i>

429
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,672
I got him.

430
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:54,438
It's about soup time,
isn't it?

431
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:57,316
I'm going.

432
00:55:57,399 --> 00:56:00,235
<i>Well, get a move on, Volodya,</i>

433
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,949
<i>and try not to spill it all</i>
<i>on your way back, you Marxist bastard.</i>

434
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,882
The enemy sniper activity reported
during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.

435
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:28,096
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector.

436
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,099
One artillery observer
in the Northern sector.

437
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:34,520
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer
division in the factory sector.

438
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:38,106
<i>Three telephone repairmen</i>
<i>in the workers'housing sector.</i>

439
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,486
<i>They also tell me we have just taken</i>
<i>a prisoner who may interest you.</i>

440
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,488
I hope he's still
able to speak.

441
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:47,199
Excuse me, sir?

442
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,785
Nothing.
Thank you.

443
00:56:51,954 --> 00:56:54,831
<i>So, tell us, Volodya,</i>

444
00:56:54,915 --> 00:56:57,042
<i>which building is he in?</i>

445
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:01,755
There is no way
I know that.

446
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,176
He moves around
all the time.

447
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,179
He jumps from one
to the next.

448
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:11,181
On which floor?

449
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:13,183
I don't know.

450
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:16,395
We'll see about that.

451
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,939
Undress him.

452
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,483
<i>Put him in</i>
<i>one of our uniforms.</i>

453
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:53,140
You see, they are stubborn.

454
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:55,392
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

455
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:59,813
Man, you got to admit
when they get an idea in their heads...

456
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,873
Right.

457
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:20,375
Let's see if our customer
has arrived.

458
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,961
Are you ready?

459
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:24,963
Uh-huh.

460
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:29,259
And now our famous shepherd
from the Urals,

461
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,637
who Major Konig
thinks is an idiot,

462
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,681
gets up to make sure
he has hit his target.

463
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,559
<i>Major Konig sees him.</i>

464
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:43,857
Aims for his helmet.

465
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,485
Fires.

466
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,863
<i>Reveals his position</i>
<i>and is shot in turn.</i>

467
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:05,045
Except...
Major Konig doesn't fire...

468
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,426
because Major Konig
isn't there.

469
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:17,307
Koulikov!

470
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:26,650
Don't you think that was strange,
that last one?

471
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:29,862
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

472
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,864
It's not natural.

473
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:35,409
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

474
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:40,664
Oh, no, I'm the one
who was stupid.

475
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:43,000
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

476
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,002
I mean, it's like us
with the Ukrainians.

477
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:48,547
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

478
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:54,428
Tomorrow, we'll kill us
some generals.

479
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,647
Whose turn is it?

480
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,525
Mine, I think.

481
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:10,861
Oh, you're such a cheater!

482
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,364
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

483
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:18,368
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
it's my turn to go first.

484
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:23,582
And it's your turn to get a hole
in your britches.

485
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,702
To victory.

486
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:53,839
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

487
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,175
What's that little fellow
of yours up to?

488
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:01,513
He's probing,
comrade Kruschev.

489
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,057
He's testing the Germans
for weaknesses.

490
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,059
He's meticulous
in his preparation.

491
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:13,400
Vodka...
is a luxury we have.

492
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:16,862
Caviar is
a luxury we have.

493
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,823
Time is not.

494
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,826
He's aware of that
comrade Kruschev. We both are.

495
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,331
I assure you
he will succeed.

496
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:29,458
<i>Good.</i>

497
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:33,795
It seems your destinies
are entwined.

498
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,861
They're keeping you busy.

499
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:04,826
I picked this up
in the kitchen.

500
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:08,622
It's from the reception the other day.
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

501
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:12,626
Um, she will be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

502
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,963
There's plenty more
if you're hungry.

503
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:19,842
You're Jewish,
aren't you?

504
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:24,263
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

505
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:28,851
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

506
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:31,061
You mean the war?

507
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:35,148
<i>He understood that the hatred</i>
<i>of the Jews ran deep.</i>

508
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:39,444
He was saving up to buy
some land in Palestine.

509
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:43,740
He said it was the only land
we truly belonged in;

510
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,702
the only land
we had a duty to defend.

511
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:50,873
<i>He insisted I learn</i>
<i>to use a rifle.</i>

512
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,208
I learned to shoot.

513
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:02,926
I know that in times of war, personal
feelings should be put aside, but...

514
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:05,053
I have a favor
to ask you.

515
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,389
Of course.
Anything you want.

516
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:10,601
I want to be reassigned.

517
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:15,355
What's happened, Tania?

518
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,965
<i>He shot him.</i>

519
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:48,263
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

520
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,184
Shot him on the run.

521
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,520
<i>It was</i>
<i>an impossible shot.</i>

522
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:56,897
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like it.</i>

523
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:00,400
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

524
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:05,239
I don't stand a chance
against this man.

525
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:07,407
You mustn't talk
like that, Vassili.

526
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:12,704
<i>What if I told you we found</i>
<i>a way to track his movements?</i>

527
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,915
We've got someone, Vassili.

528
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,210
Someone close to him
passing us information.

529
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:21,338
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

530
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:25,008
I promise.

531
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:38,063
Now I have a favor to ask.

532
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:40,065
From me?

533
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:44,903
It's about Tania.

534
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,327
Come in.

535
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,376
<i>He doesn't even know you exist.</i>

536
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:03,213
<i>But at that moment, you are closer</i>
<i>to him than anyone else on earth.</i>

537
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,466
You see his face
through the sight.

538
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,886
You see whether he shaved
that morning or not.

539
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:12,723
You can see whether he's married
by whether he has a wedding ring on.

540
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:17,352
It's not like...

541
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:20,689
just firing at a distant shape,
not just a uniform.

542
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:23,817
It's a man's face.

543
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:27,613
Those faces don't go away.

544
01:06:27,696 --> 01:06:32,868
<i>They come back and they just...</i>
<i>they get replaced by more faces.</i>

545
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:36,121
Did Danilov ask you
to tell me this?

546
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:39,958
He likes you very much. I think he'd try
anything to change your mind.

547
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,794
Did he tell you
why I asked for the transfer?

548
01:06:42,878 --> 01:06:44,796
No.

549
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,799
<i>This morning, a list</i>
<i>arrived at headquarters.</i>

550
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:50,511
It was a list of civilians
who'd been...

551
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:53,055
rounded up and sent to Germany
in a convoy...

552
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:55,682
that left Stalingrad
three weeks ago.

553
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:59,686
My parents
were amongst them.

554
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,109
After 30 kilometers,
the German soldiers...

555
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:10,322
stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

556
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:16,620
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

557
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,623
two by two.

558
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,292
Mothers with daughters.

559
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,294
Husbands and wives.

560
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:30,467
They... lined them up
against the railing,

561
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:33,846
and then they fired
a single shot at each pair...

562
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,848
to save bullets.

563
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:39,685
It worked.

564
01:07:39,768 --> 01:07:44,356
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

565
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:49,903
I know they died together.

566
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,074
They never would have let
themselves be separated.

567
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:13,093
That's Koulikov's rifle.
It's a good... rifle.

568
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,271
Thank you.

569
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,178
I know how he leaves
the shelter.

570
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,180
He goes through
the tractor factory.

571
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:01,475
The tractor factory is big.

572
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:06,855
I know exactly where.
He crawls through a gutter,

573
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,858
under a grate
where the vats are,

574
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,944
then he goes out
from the workshop.

575
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:15,239
<i>In between the two,</i>
<i>there's a place where he's in the open.</i>

576
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:18,200
It's under
a long, iron foot walk.

577
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:54,194
Good luck, comrade.

578
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,010
I know exactly where
he's waiting for me.

579
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:47,975
He'll be on the foot walk
over the gutter.

580
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,519
We'll take him out
from behind.

581
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:15,752
We'll get to the other end
of the workshop through these pipes.

582
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:17,754
<i>Follow me.</i>

583
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,405
You go that way.
I'll go around this way.

584
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:09,283
Okay?

585
01:14:25,048 --> 01:14:26,967
Shit!

586
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:37,769
Sergei,
you should go back.

587
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:41,064
-No, I'll be all right.
<i>-Go back.</i>

588
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:43,525
No, you go!

589
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,032
Keep your legs in.

590
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:37,746
Come on. Come on. Come on.

591
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:39,808
Comrade Stalin is asking for
one last effort!

592
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,894
<i>The fate of the motherland</i>
<i>is at risk!</i>

593
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,563
<i>The fate of all those</i>
<i>you love and cherish!</i>

594
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,024
It's for them
that we fight today.

595
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:52,863
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

596
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,866
If they're lucky, one in ten
of these soldiers will come back alive.

597
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:58,952
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

598
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:02,414
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

599
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:06,335
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

600
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,504
You have a duty to survive.

601
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:11,131
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
It's what he knows.

602
01:17:11,215 --> 01:17:14,885
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

603
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,804
If Vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

604
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:25,562
Where is he?
Where is Vassili?

605
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,505
<i>Keep your head down.</i>

606
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:36,216
-Tell me where he is.
<i>-Stay into that pipe, Tania.</i>

607
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,302
Stay in. Stay in!
Get your head in!

608
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:48,312
Slow down.

609
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,314
Don't shoot.

610
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,112
He's over there.

611
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:13,587
Do you see the pillar
in front of you?

612
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,925
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to move round behind it.</i>

613
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,728
Go.

614
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:36,818
<i>Tania, I need you to find</i>
<i>a large piece of glass.</i>

615
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:40,072
Piece of glass.

616
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:45,536
<i>Do you see the kiln...</i>

617
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:49,331
behind me to the left
of the factory?

618
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,585
Yes? I can't hear you.

619
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:56,797
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Yes.

620
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,132
Do you see...

621
01:19:59,216 --> 01:20:02,219
the two louvers?

622
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:06,390
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Do you see the one...

623
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:09,226
with a broken slat?

624
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:11,228
Yes.

625
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,397
This is what
I want you to do.

626
01:20:20,404 --> 01:20:23,615
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

627
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:27,911
Three... two... one...

628
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:48,682
Hello, Sacha.

629
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:56,899
He was right
where you said he'd be.

630
01:20:58,442 --> 01:21:00,360
Nearly there.

631
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:05,532
He's very clever.

632
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:12,789
Tell me about him.

633
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:23,842
Why was it his grandfather taught him
how to shoot and not his father?

634
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:27,513
His father's dead.
His mother too.

635
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:32,476
Does he talk
about his father?

636
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:34,978
No. He didn't know him.

637
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,274
Did he go to school?

638
01:21:39,316 --> 01:21:42,945
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

639
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:46,073
Hmm. Is it girls
who write to him?

640
01:21:46,156 --> 01:21:48,951
Everyone writes to him.

641
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,036
Is there a girl
he loves in his village?

642
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,998
-Not in his village, here.
-Does she love him?

643
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:58,001
Yes, because he's handsome.

644
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:01,129
Because he's brave
and she's very beautiful.

645
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,590
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

646
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:06,635
<i>She went to the university.</i>
<i>They're handsome together.</i>

647
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,804
<i>Later, the two of them</i>
<i>will get married.</i>

648
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:16,812
At least, I think so.

649
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:21,984
And you, Sacha,

650
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:23,986
why are you helping
the Germans?

651
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:31,410
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

652
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:34,746
And because you like
chocolate, huh?

653
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:54,349
<i>All these people here</i>
<i>know they're gonna die.</i>

654
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:57,728
So each night
when they make it back,

655
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:00,522
it's a bonus.

656
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:03,192
Excuse me.

657
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:05,694
So, every cup of tea,

658
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:07,988
every cigarette...

659
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:11,575
<i>becomes a little celebration.</i>

660
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:14,119
<i>Because for a lot of us,</i>
<i>it may be our last night.</i>

661
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:19,499
It's just something
you have to accept here.

662
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,502
Everyone has their time.

663
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:30,552
<i>In the forest,</i>
<i>the wolf lives for three years,</i>

664
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,554
the donkey for nine.

665
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:39,269
So, that's-that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

666
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,313
It makes no sense to me
whatsoever.

667
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:45,275
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

668
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:47,277
Makes absolute sense.

669
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,446
There aren't any donkeys
in the forest.

670
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,449
You made it up.

671
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:56,411
So... I'm a donkey?

672
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:03,377
People like you
and Danilov...

673
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,379
have to survive this.

674
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:08,799
People who have read books,
had an education.

675
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,803
We'll need you
when the war is over.

676
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:15,597
<i>And if you survive?</i>

677
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:19,393
What will the <i>useless</i>
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

678
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:22,688
<i>I wanna work in a factory.</i>

679
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:27,317
My granddad took me
to a factory once.

680
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:32,364
<i>There was this man there,</i>
<i>high up on a...</i>

681
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:34,825
on a foot walk.

682
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:38,078
He wasn't wearing blue
like the others.

683
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:42,374
The people he was supervising
didn't understand what they were doing.

684
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:44,710
But for him,
for him up there,

685
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:47,462
it was simple;
it was clear.

686
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:52,718
And I thought, "One day,
I could be that man."

687
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:02,144
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

688
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:05,814
Why shouldn't it?

689
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:10,027
You'll outlive us all.

690
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,154
Hmm.

691
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:15,199
You'll be the oldest donkey
in the forest.

692
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:35,052
<i>"150 meters stand between</i>
<i>the Germans and the Volga.</i>

693
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:37,513
<i>"Today the whole world</i>
<i>is watching these 150 meters.</i>

694
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:40,641
They are what makes
Stalingrad..."

695
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:42,643
the capitol...

696
01:25:42,726 --> 01:25:44,937
of the war.

697
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,527
Your friend, Tania...

698
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:54,863
have you see her?

699
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:57,699
She stays over there now,
with the snipers.

700
01:26:00,077 --> 01:26:02,871
Tell the major we're sending in
all of our sharpshooters...

701
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:05,582
to support the attack
on the factory.

702
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:09,336
Tell him Vassili
will be there.

703
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,152
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure.

704
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:03,070
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure.

705
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,618
-Danilov.
-Hmm?

706
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:24,883
You have to
stop writing about me.

707
01:30:28,262 --> 01:30:30,848
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

708
01:30:30,931 --> 01:30:34,852
Sooner or later, he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

709
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:37,187
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

710
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:42,568
This time it's different.

711
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,488
You've built me up...

712
01:30:46,572 --> 01:30:50,075
and up into someone I'm not.

713
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:54,705
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I wanna fight.

714
01:30:55,873 --> 01:30:59,668
I want to fight just
as a regular soldier.

715
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:02,713
I understand.

716
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:06,508
The thing is, you're not a regular
soldier. You're extraordinary.

717
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:10,179
No, I'm what
you've made me.

718
01:31:10,262 --> 01:31:12,806
Nothing more.

719
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,730
Why are you
telling me this now?

720
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:22,149
Hmm? What's happened?

721
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:27,613
What's changed?

722
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:34,661
<i>Did you speak</i>
<i>to Tania for me?</i>

723
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,999
-Yes.
-Well...

724
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:41,460
will she reconsider?

725
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:47,341
I don't know.

726
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:53,722
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should, you know that.

727
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:57,392
-Yeah.
<i>-It'll be easier to get her reassigned.</i>

728
01:31:57,434 --> 01:32:00,646
<i>The Germans are preparing</i>
<i>another offensive in the city center.</i>

729
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:03,982
<i>The propaganda battle is crucial</i>
<i>for morale. We need you more than ever.</i>

730
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:06,026
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

731
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:13,617
-Tell him what you know, Sacha.
-Hello, Sacha.

732
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,827
There was dust
on the major's boots.

733
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:20,332
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

734
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:23,377
<i>I don't need to tell you</i>
<i>the risks he's taking.</i>

735
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,839
<i>The dust was yellow. There's only</i>
<i>one place where there's dust like that...</i>

736
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:30,175
in the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap on the tracks.

737
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:34,096
Well done.

738
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,974
Sacha...

739
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:39,476
wait for me outside then.

740
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:48,110
-Danilov,
-Hmm?

741
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:52,072
You had no right
to use him.

742
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:55,284
No, no, I didn't use him,
Vassili.

743
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,453
He did it of his own accord.

744
01:32:58,537 --> 01:33:01,039
You know why?

745
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:03,208
Because he believes in you!

746
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:13,969
Tomorrow morning, we're going
to take back the chemical factory.

747
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:17,306
Sacha's informed the major
you'll be there,

748
01:33:17,347 --> 01:33:20,058
so now you know where
you have to wait for him.

749
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:23,312
-In the middle of an assault.
-I'm following orders.

750
01:33:23,395 --> 01:33:25,564
I suggest you do the same.

751
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:30,360
Now, I'm aware
of the risks.

752
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,362
You'll be fine.

753
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,869
Comrade.

754
01:34:05,354 --> 01:34:07,272
That's the Germans
up there.

755
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:09,316
And yesterday
was the Russians.

756
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:11,485
We're not very far now.

757
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:16,240
Sacha...

758
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:18,617
you're playing
a very dangerous game.

759
01:34:20,202 --> 01:34:22,287
I want you to win.

760
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:26,708
See there?
Keep going along the river.

761
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:29,378
It's safe... for a while.

762
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:12,244
<i>He's dead.</i>
<i>We found this on his corpse.</i>

763
01:39:15,038 --> 01:39:18,792
<i>Your reason for being here</i>
<i>has ceased to exist.</i>

764
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:21,003
Pardon me, Herr General,

765
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:23,881
but I do not believe...

766
01:39:23,964 --> 01:39:26,258
<i>There is a plane bound for Berlin</i>
<i>tomorrow evening.</i>

767
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:28,635
<i>You will be on it.</i>

768
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:34,975
Until then, I must ask you
for your dog tags.

769
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:40,355
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

770
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:42,816
If you fall,
you will fall unknown.

771
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:45,235
You've already had
a near miss.

772
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:57,372
Also please take
this War Merit Cross.

773
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:58,957
It was awarded posthumously...

774
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:01,376
to a lieutenant of the 116th
Infantry Division...

775
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:03,587
who fell here during the first days
of the battle.

776
01:40:03,587 --> 01:40:04,963
Who fell here during the first days
of the battle.

777
01:40:06,173 --> 01:40:08,091
He was my son.

778
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:13,680
<i>If the landing is captured,</i>
<i>everything's lost!</i>

779
01:40:16,183 --> 01:40:18,101
Come here.

780
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:23,315
What did I tell you?

781
01:40:23,398 --> 01:40:26,026
You've been playing
your fiddle too much!

782
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:28,862
If it's confirmed
that he's dead, we're sunk!

783
01:40:28,946 --> 01:40:32,658
<i>-Well, you're sunk.</i>
-It isn't true.

784
01:40:32,741 --> 01:40:35,577
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

785
01:40:35,619 --> 01:40:38,497
What do they have to do,
dangle his body in front our our men?

786
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:41,542
They're lying.

787
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:45,754
That's good.
Very good.

788
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:49,633
Write it, then.
"Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

789
01:40:49,716 --> 01:40:52,135
"This is what he had
for breakfast this morning.

790
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:56,640
This is a picture of him reading
today's newspaper." You're the poet.

791
01:40:57,224 --> 01:40:58,642
<i>What?</i>

792
01:40:58,725 --> 01:41:01,270
<i>You won't give up</i>
<i>the riverbank!</i>

793
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:04,356
<i>I don't care if you've lost</i>
<i>half your men!</i>

794
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:07,526
Lose the other half,
or lose yourself!

795
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:15,868
Is he back?

796
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:19,955
He should be back soon.

797
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:24,668
The German attack cut the lines.
That's why he's late.

798
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:29,298
Can we go outside?

799
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,182
I wrote to my mother
about you.

800
01:41:38,265 --> 01:41:40,684
<i>She wanted me to tell you</i>
<i>that once this war was over,</i>

801
01:41:40,767 --> 01:41:43,145
if there's anything you needed...
anything at all...

802
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:45,480
our family
will be there for you.

803
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:50,027
You know I'm here for you.

804
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:57,242
They're saying
Vassili is dead.

805
01:41:57,326 --> 01:42:01,663
Vassili Zaitsev
will never see his loved ones again.

806
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:05,334
<i>Surrender!</i>
<i>This is your only hope.</i>

807
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:11,757
You're upset.

808
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,092
Because Zaitsev is dead?

809
01:42:17,054 --> 01:42:19,848
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

810
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:23,268
You're a Russian
like he is.

811
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:28,273
<i>Don't listen to them.</i>

812
01:42:28,357 --> 01:42:31,610
It's just propaganda.

813
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:33,737
He isn't dead.

814
01:42:34,905 --> 01:42:36,823
And do you know why?

815
01:42:38,075 --> 01:42:40,244
Because I haven't
killed him yet.

816
01:42:47,251 --> 01:42:49,211
I'm going to tell you
a little secret.

817
01:42:51,088 --> 01:42:54,132
Only you, because
I know I can trust you.

818
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:57,386
But you must swear to me that
you won't tell another soul.

819
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:02,850
You swear?

820
01:43:02,933 --> 01:43:05,978
I found a terrific spot.

821
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:08,814
It's by the exit
from the train station.

822
01:43:08,897 --> 01:43:11,733
I'll hide
in the water tower.

823
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:14,778
<i>Tomorrow.</i>
<i>I'll wait for him there.</i>

824
01:43:14,862 --> 01:43:18,866
You'll see.
He'll be there.

825
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:24,162
He always is.

826
01:43:31,295 --> 01:43:35,132
I also want you to swear that from now
on, you'll stay home where you belong.

827
01:43:37,467 --> 01:43:41,138
Do you swear?
Yes?

828
01:43:44,224 --> 01:43:47,144
Good.

829
01:43:47,227 --> 01:43:49,229
"We know he's alive.
We know he won't fail us.

830
01:43:49,313 --> 01:43:52,608
We know because he is a part of us now.
Vassili is eternal."

831
01:43:55,652 --> 01:43:59,114
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

832
01:43:59,156 --> 01:44:02,826
<i>Oh, didn't you hear?</i>
<i>I was dead.</i>

833
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:06,914
<i>At least the noble sniper</i>
<i>Zaitsev...</i>

834
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:11,835
Vassili was dead.

835
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:13,837
The real one.

836
01:44:16,256 --> 01:44:19,051
Me...

837
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:21,053
I was asleep,

838
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:23,055
<i>and I missed my chance.</i>

839
01:44:23,138 --> 01:44:28,477
<i>Then, I was curled up</i>
<i>in a corner, hiding...</i>

840
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:31,021
from a man
who wants to kill me.

841
01:44:31,104 --> 01:44:33,899
I'll talk to Kruschev.

842
01:44:33,982 --> 01:44:37,027
He'll send you back
to your old division.

843
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:40,447
-Where's Tania?
-She's at the shelter.

844
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:42,783
I've been to the shelter.

845
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:44,993
<i>I told her you weren't dead.</i>

846
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:50,290
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

847
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:53,460
He told me you were waiting
for him at the station.

848
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:59,299
Vassili.

849
01:45:19,736 --> 01:45:21,697
Vassili.

850
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,158
Vassili.

851
01:45:31,915 --> 01:45:34,251
My little Sacha.

852
01:45:34,334 --> 01:45:36,253
I knew it.

853
01:45:54,271 --> 01:45:56,982
<i>-Vassili.</i>
<i>-Tania.</i>

854
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,074
I knew you weren't dead.

855
01:46:06,116 --> 01:46:08,577
How?

856
01:46:08,619 --> 01:46:11,413
Because we only just met.

857
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:20,339
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

858
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:23,717
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there...

859
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,969
waiting to give me
the good news.

860
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:31,934
I think he loves you
even more than I do.

861
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:59,002
<i>To the proper military authority,</i>

862
01:46:59,086 --> 01:47:01,630
I'm calling to the commandant's
attention the recent changes noticed...

863
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:05,801
in the attitude towards fighting
of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

864
01:47:05,843 --> 01:47:09,972
<i>He has attempted on several occasions</i>
<i>to escape his duties,</i>

865
01:47:10,013 --> 01:47:12,432
voiced doubts on the chances
of our victory...

866
01:47:12,516 --> 01:47:14,434
and made defeatist comments
in public.

867
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:18,647
<i>The inexplicable</i>
<i>duration of his duel...</i>

868
01:47:18,689 --> 01:47:23,610
with the Nazi sharpshooter
can only be explained by...

869
01:47:23,694 --> 01:47:26,488
his lack of belief
in the communist ideal.

870
01:47:34,413 --> 01:47:36,331
Good morning, Sacha.

871
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:42,212
Once again, he knew
exactly where to find me.

872
01:47:42,296 --> 01:47:45,757
Don't you think
that's strange?

873
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:49,636
Apart from me, only you knew.

874
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,472
I don't hold it against you,
Sacha.

875
01:47:52,556 --> 01:47:55,893
You've done
a very brave thing.

876
01:47:55,976 --> 01:47:58,937
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

877
01:47:59,021 --> 01:48:00,939
But it isn't my camp.

878
01:48:01,023 --> 01:48:03,901
We're both soldiers,

879
01:48:03,984 --> 01:48:08,697
and we're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

880
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:14,369
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha, for
not staying home as I made you swear to.

881
01:48:14,453 --> 01:48:17,831
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

882
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:27,299
I've never seen anyone
frown so much in their sleep.

883
01:48:30,385 --> 01:48:32,846
How long have you been
watching me?

884
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:35,349
All night.

885
01:48:35,432 --> 01:48:38,393
You've been snoring away
happily for hours.

886
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:41,396
I don't snore.
Do I?

887
01:48:41,438 --> 01:48:43,398
Like a pig.

888
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,984
I suppose I talk
in my sleep as well.

889
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:47,986
Yes.

890
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:52,241
There's something
I should tell you.

891
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:02,668
On the train...

892
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:04,670
coming here...

893
01:49:06,547 --> 01:49:08,632
we were in the same car.

894
01:49:08,715 --> 01:49:10,634
No.

895
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:12,928
I saw you.

896
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:16,431
You were reading,
and you fell asleep.

897
01:49:18,934 --> 01:49:22,479
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

898
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:26,149
It was scary.

899
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:33,115
Afterwards, I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

900
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,117
It made me smile.

901
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:40,998
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you...

902
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,377
who'd make you laugh...

903
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:49,840
how lucky they were.

904
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:54,678
And now I'm the one
lying next to you.

905
01:49:54,678 --> 01:49:56,471
And now I'm the one
lying next to you.

906
01:49:59,057 --> 01:50:02,019
-Was I snoring?
-Like a pig.

907
01:50:34,176 --> 01:50:36,136
What?

908
01:50:39,806 --> 01:50:43,018
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no.

909
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:45,020
-Oh, my God!
-Tania, no.

910
01:50:45,062 --> 01:50:47,064
-Tania, no!
-No, get off me!

911
01:50:47,147 --> 01:50:49,816
-Get off me! Get off me!
-It's what he wants!

912
01:50:49,858 --> 01:50:51,818
-This is what he wants!
-Get off me!

913
01:50:51,860 --> 01:50:55,197
-No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you!
-Let me go!

914
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,408
-I'll run after you, and he'll kill me.
-Let me go!

915
01:50:58,534 --> 01:51:01,328
-Let me go!
-This is what he wants! I'll get him.

916
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:04,248
I promise I'll get him.

917
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:07,376
I'll get his rifle for you.
I promise, Tania.

918
01:51:26,603 --> 01:51:29,940
I need you.

919
01:51:33,151 --> 01:51:36,196
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

920
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:39,032
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

921
01:51:39,074 --> 01:51:42,452
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

922
01:51:42,536 --> 01:51:45,289
Gather your things, and we'll help you
carry them to the landing stage.

923
01:51:45,372 --> 01:51:48,959
I'm not leaving.
This is my home.

924
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:52,045
This is my Sacha's home.
I can't leave.

925
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:54,423
<i>I have to tell you something,</i>
<i>Mrs. Filipov.</i>

926
01:51:57,009 --> 01:52:00,012
Something very difficult
to understand.

927
01:52:00,095 --> 01:52:02,014
It's about Sacha.

928
01:52:16,445 --> 01:52:19,198
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

929
01:52:19,281 --> 01:52:21,658
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

930
01:52:24,536 --> 01:52:26,455
Oh, my God.

931
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,376
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

932
01:52:34,296 --> 01:52:37,508
He's become a traitor.

933
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:40,469
<i>The poor little thing.</i>

934
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:43,388
<i>What has he done?</i>

935
01:52:46,141 --> 01:52:48,143
So, he's going to
stay over there?

936
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:58,529
Yes... he's going to
stay over there.

937
01:52:58,612 --> 01:53:02,324
<i>I shouldn't be saying this,</i>
<i>comrade Commissar,</i>

938
01:53:02,366 --> 01:53:05,244
but maybe
it's for the best.

939
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:07,663
If the Germans have won,
he'll be safe.

940
01:53:07,746 --> 01:53:11,667
<i>I know it's wrong, but perhaps</i>
<i>he has made the right choice.</i>

941
01:53:30,936 --> 01:53:33,814
<i>-Oh! Oh, Tania!</i>
<i>-Tania?</i>

942
01:53:34,982 --> 01:53:37,734
<i>-Oh, Tania!</i>
<i>-Tania!</i>

943
01:53:38,819 --> 01:53:41,780
<i>Oh, my God! Oh!</i>

944
01:53:58,046 --> 01:54:02,718
I need a doctor!
A doctor!

945
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:09,308
I have a pass.
I have a pass!

946
01:54:09,391 --> 01:54:11,310
You must let her cross.

947
01:54:14,021 --> 01:54:15,939
Please!

948
01:54:16,023 --> 01:54:20,068
-It's useless. She'll never make it.
-No! No, she will!

949
01:54:20,152 --> 01:54:23,238
She's my daughter!
She's my daughter!

950
01:54:23,322 --> 01:54:25,741
-I beg of you!
-All right.

951
01:54:25,824 --> 01:54:28,660
-Oh, thank you!
-Put this one on the boat.

952
01:55:15,499 --> 01:55:18,168
Where is he?

953
01:55:18,252 --> 01:55:20,754
<i>Where's the major?</i>

954
01:55:20,838 --> 01:55:23,048
A few inches
from your face.

955
01:55:25,843 --> 01:55:28,846
<i>I've been such a fool,</i>
<i>Vassili.</i>

956
01:55:28,929 --> 01:55:33,141
Man will always be man.

957
01:55:33,225 --> 01:55:35,310
There is no new man.

958
01:55:36,645 --> 01:55:39,982
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

959
01:55:40,065 --> 01:55:42,818
<i>where there'd be nothing</i>
<i>to envy your neighbor.</i>

960
01:55:42,901 --> 01:55:46,280
But there's always
something to envy.

961
01:55:47,906 --> 01:55:49,992
A smile...

962
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:51,994
a friendship.

963
01:55:53,495 --> 01:55:57,541
<i>Something you don't have</i>
<i>and want to appropriate.</i>

964
01:55:57,624 --> 01:56:01,211
<i>In this world...</i>
<i>even a Soviet one...</i>

965
01:56:01,295 --> 01:56:04,464
there will always
be rich and poor.

966
01:56:06,216 --> 01:56:08,302
Rich in gifts...

967
01:56:09,803 --> 01:56:11,722
poor in gifts.

968
01:56:12,806 --> 01:56:14,725
Rich in love...

969
01:56:15,934 --> 01:56:17,853
poor in love.

970
01:56:24,193 --> 01:56:27,237
Tania isn't coming back.

971
01:56:27,821 --> 01:56:30,782
<i>She's dead, Vassili.</i>

972
01:56:38,957 --> 01:56:43,212
<i>She was cut down by shrapnel.</i>
<i>It was quick.</i>

973
01:56:43,295 --> 01:56:45,297
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she even saw it coming.</i>

974
01:56:47,049 --> 01:56:49,092
She was on her way
back to you.

975
01:56:49,176 --> 01:56:54,264
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to
the boats, she was coming back for you.

976
01:56:54,348 --> 01:56:59,186
<i>She was right.</i>
<i>You're a good man, Vassili.</i>

977
01:57:03,315 --> 01:57:05,859
<i>I want to help you,</i>
<i>Vassili.</i>

978
01:57:05,943 --> 01:57:08,612
<i>Let me do one last thing.</i>

979
01:57:08,695 --> 01:57:11,198
Something useful
for a change.

980
01:57:16,745 --> 01:57:18,747
Let me show you
where the major is.

981
01:57:18,789 --> 01:57:21,250
Don't do that.
Don't do that!

982
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:41,134
<i>Today, February 3, 1943,</i>
<i>is an ominous day for Hitler...</i>

983
02:01:41,176 --> 02:01:45,639
<i>and the endless columns of hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of German prisoners.</i>

984
02:01:45,764 --> 02:01:49,601
It is an unforgettable day
of hope for our motherland.

985
02:02:02,489 --> 02:02:06,493
<i>After 180 days of heroic combat...</i>

986
02:02:06,577 --> 02:02:08,662
<i>in the market city</i>
<i>of Stalingrad,</i>

987
02:02:08,704 --> 02:02:13,959
<i>and as a result of the valor</i>
<i>and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,</i>

988
02:02:14,042 --> 02:02:17,171
<i>the commander</i>
<i>of our glorious Red Army...</i>

989
02:02:17,212 --> 02:02:20,382
<i>received</i>
<i>the unconditional surrender...</i>

990
02:02:20,465 --> 02:02:24,178
<i>of the German fascist invaders.</i>

991
02:02:36,356 --> 02:02:40,569
Sorry. No, young man,
I cannot find...

992
02:02:40,652 --> 02:02:42,571
-a matching name in the book.
-Could you check again?

993
02:02:42,654 --> 02:02:45,490
-This is the address and her name.
<i>-She is not here.</i>

994
02:02:45,574 --> 02:02:50,162
Yes, this is our address,
but we don't have her anymore.

995
02:02:50,245 --> 02:02:52,998
<i>-This is the address. She's been here.</i>
-I'm so sorry.

996
02:02:53,081 --> 02:02:55,792
-She wrote to me.
<i>-I looked three times. She's not here.</i>

997
02:02:55,876 --> 02:03:01,340
<i>Believe me, there is no Tania Chernova.</i>
<i>I can't help you.</i>

998
02:03:01,423 --> 02:03:03,342
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
