1
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,140
I am a stone.

2
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,060
I do not move.

3
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,740
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth,

4
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,870
then he won't see my breath.

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,890
I take my time. I let him come closer.

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,760
I have only one bullet. I aim at his eye.

7
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,170
Very gently, my finger presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,140
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,650
I have no fear. I'm a big boy now.

10
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,760
Ready, Vassili?

11
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,620
Now, Vassili. Fire!

12
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,860
Fire, Vassili! Fire!

13
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,160
Come on, pick your feet up.

14
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,660
Get on your feet. Prepare to board the train.

15
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,130
You there, come along with me now. This way, pal.

16
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,810
All civilians, get out!

17
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,370
Make way, let the civilians off.

18
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,750
This is a military convoy.

19
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,490
No one stays on board but our valiant soldiers.

20
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,150
This is a convoy to Stalingrad...

21
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,720
only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

22
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,380
All aboard!

23
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,510
Autumn, 1942.

24
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,080
Europe lies crushed beneath the Nazi jackboot.

25
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,820
The German Third Reich I sat the height of its power.

26
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,260
Hitler's armies are charging through the heart of the Soviet Union...

27
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,820
towards the oilfields of Asia.

28
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,430
One last obstacle remains. A city on the Volga...

29
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,640
where the fate of the world is being decided. Stalingrad.

30
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,730
Glorious comrade Stalin...

31
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,630
has ordered not another step backwards.

32
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,900
The people of the Soviet Union shall be free.

33
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,310
Go forward, comrades. Not a step backwards!

34
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Listen to these letters sent by Russian mothers...

35
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,540
to their sons on the front.

36
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,780
"Volodya, my child, I know that it's for our motherland-

37
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,790
"I know that it's for our motherland that you are giving your life.

38
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,610
"Everyone here knows that you will not fall back.

39
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,740
"Everyone here is proud of you.

40
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,450
"Your father is dead. Your brothers are dead.

41
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,050
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists."

42
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,300
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

43
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,510
Get back or I'll shoot!

44
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,970
Back from the rails, or we shoot. Shoot the traitors!

45
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,180
Come on, come on! Move!

46
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,550
Come on, comrades, come on!

47
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,560
Move, or you'll be shot!

48
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,080
Over here, stretcher!

49
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,480
The one with the rifle shoots!

50
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,210
One out of two gets a rifle.

51
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,660
The one without follows him!

52
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,360
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

53
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,200
the one who is following picks up the rifle and shoots!

54
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,500
The one with the rifle shoots!

55
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,940
The one without follows him!

56
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,710
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

57
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,270
the one who is following...

58
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,380
picks up the rifle and shoots!

59
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,440
The one with the rifle shoots!

60
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,520
This way, now. The one without follows him!

61
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,740
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army, from now on...

62
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,220
it is either victory or death!

63
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,320
Those who retreat will be shot. I need a rifle.

64
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,990
There will be no mercy For cowards and traitors!

65
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,160
Achtung!

66
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,420
Aah!

67
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,180
It's hopeless, comrades. Get back!

68
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,880
Pullback!

69
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,750
Pullback!

70
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,690
Get back! Get back!

71
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,750
In the name of the Soviet Union,

72
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,630
not a step backwards, or we shoot.

73
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,960
No retreat! Not a step back!

74
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,030
No mercy! Deserters will be shot.

75
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,770
Fire! Shoot the traitors!

76
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,470
Cowards will be shot!

77
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,880
No mercy for cowards!

78
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,760
Russians, surrender. You will see your home again.

79
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,520
This is not your war.

80
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,030
Join your German comrades, They understand your suffering...

81
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,000
and will care more for you than your own officers,

82
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,370
who are only sending you to your death.

83
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,930
The Third Reich Is not your enemy.

84
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,610
The enemy is blood thirsty Stalin And his Bolshevik camp,

85
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,340
who have stolen your land, who have deported your father-

86
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,870
Fire!

87
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,190
You'll get us caught, comrade Commissar.

88
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,450
With your permission, comrade Commissar.

89
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,520
Which one should I aim at first? You should wait...

90
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,590
till there's an explosion.

91
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,110
Do you know how to shoot? A little.

92
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,090
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. He's looking at us.

93
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,070
Thank you, comrade Commissar.

94
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,680
Danilov, political officer, second class.

95
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,700
Twenty-first infantry.

96
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,440
"Vassili Zaitsev."

97
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,820
"On this day, September the 20th, 1942,

98
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,590
"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

99
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,460
"arrived in the city of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga.

100
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,370
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

101
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,200
"Like thousands before him, he came to answer comrade Stalin's call.

102
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,810
"Armed with a rifle, he quickly made the fascist invader realize that...

103
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,010
"from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland;

104
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,420
that from here on, the only way was back."

105
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,390
What do you think?

106
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,230
I think comrade Commissar's been overgenerous.

107
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,410
Let me go! Let me go!

108
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,960
By order of comrade Stalin, no civilian can leave the city.

109
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,930
Get back!

110
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,440
Stand away, or we will open fire.

111
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,550
Stand away!

112
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,610
Get back!

113
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,560
Get back or we shoot!

114
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,290
Back! Keep back!

115
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,820
Make way for comrade Stalin 's envoy!

116
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,700
I carried out my orders.

117
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,040
I sent in all of my boys.

118
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,670
But the Germans engulfed us.

119
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,910
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

120
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,150
And me, what did I have? The sacred duty to resist!

121
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,690
I have to report to the boss.

122
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,950
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape.

123
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,550
My name is...

124
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,290
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

125
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,390
I've come to take things in hand here.

126
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,460
This city is not Kursk...

127
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,370
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

128
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,000
This city is Stalingrad.

129
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,810
Stalingrad!

130
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,040
This city bears the name of the boss.

131
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,710
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

132
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:45,020
If the Germans capture this city,

133
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,550
the entire country will collapse.

134
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,790
Now, I want our boys...

135
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,500
to raise their heads.

136
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,230
I want them to act like they have balls!

137
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,470
I want them to stop shitting their pants!

138
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,420
That's your job.

139
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,820
As political officers, I'm counting on you.

140
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,360
You, what's your suggestion?

141
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,870
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated...

142
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,130
and their chiefs of staff too.

143
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,040
M-Make some examples.

144
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,370
D-D-Deport families of the deserters- Yeah, that's all been done.

145
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,810
Give them hope!

146
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,760
Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours.

147
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,920
But there's another way. The way of courage.

148
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,430
The way of love of the motherland.

149
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,440
We must publish the army newspaper again.

150
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,600
We must tell magnificent stories. Stories that extol...

151
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,660
sacrifice, bravery.

152
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,010
We must make them believe in the victory.

153
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,100
We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight.

154
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,280
Yes, we need to make examples.

155
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,480
But examples to follow.

156
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,420
What we need... are heroes.

157
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,820
Do you know any heroes around here?

158
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,360
Yes, comrade, I know one.

159
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,270
That's me!

160
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,310
"Vassili Zaitsev." That's me!

161
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,440
No, you're not dreaming. It's your name.

162
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,280
We made the front page.

163
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,620
They haven't changed a word.

164
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,100
Do you have any idea what this means?

165
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,720
It's not the back page, it's not the second page,

166
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,060
it's the front page. The front page!

167
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,540
They're going to reprint our article everywhere.

168
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea, even in the Urals.

169
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,040
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast,

170
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,840
reading my words, memorizing your name.

171
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,610
We're famous, Vassili. Kruschev loved the article.

172
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,740
He's promoted me to the general staff.

173
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,310
And you to sniper division.

174
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,430
Well, that's good. It's very good.

175
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,690
It's very good. It's great. It's very great!

176
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,000
It's great! For us because we did it together.

177
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,560
Together!

178
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,690
Although I did all the hard work. oh, yeah?

179
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,100
You're very lucky I can't fight back. Why's that?

180
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,510
Because Kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you.

181
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,570
You're too important. I'm too valuable.

182
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,170
Yes, careful of my- careful of my glasses, please. They're new.

183
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,240
Sorry, sir.

184
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,850
I'm famous! We're famous! I'm famous! I'm famous!

185
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,480
Vassili, the young shepherd from the Urals,

186
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,490
killed his 12th German officer today.

187
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,550
He used to hunt wolves, Now he shoots fascists.

188
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,760
Today, Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd German officer.

189
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,820
He is an example to us all.

190
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,460
Vassili shot his 32ndGerman officer.

191
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,180
Count only the Germans you have killed.

192
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Today, Vassili Zaitsev- Here is the evidence-

193
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,970
11 dog tags retrieved by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.

194
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,780
More and more men and women, fighters from all branches of our armed forces,

195
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,290
join the sniper division and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

196
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,390
I am a stone.

197
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,530
I am a stone.

198
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,630
I breathe slowly.

199
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,520
I aim at the eye.

200
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,880
So it is you,

201
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,620
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

202
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,180
My mother makes potatoes with bacon. Sounds good.

203
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,750
When she sees you, she won't believe her eyes.

204
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,070
How many today? Only two.

205
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,970
And the last one, why didn't you shoot him?

206
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,740
He was only a foot soldier. Wasn't worth giving away my position.

207
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,060
Bless you.

208
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,020
We know how much we owe you.

209
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,590
We pray for you every day.

210
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,470
Every evening, we listen to them talk about you on Radio Moscow.

211
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,230
Thanks. You've certainly managed well down here.

212
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,940
My parents used to store furniture down here before the war.

213
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,670
Sacha, drop that right now.

214
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,740
It's loaded.

215
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,130
This way, comrade Commissar.

216
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,190
Thank you, comrade.

217
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,330
Good evening.

218
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,290
Comrade Zaitsev?

219
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,470
My God, where does all this mail come from?

220
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,610
From all over the country, Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

221
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,750
This one's from the workers of the Kouzbass.

222
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,810
They want to name their mine after Vassili.

223
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,880
Right, let's start with the miners.

224
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,890
Come on, let's get to work.

225
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,830
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass,

226
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,900
Kouzbass. I thank you for your letter of praise.

227
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,810
Praise? R-A-I-S-E.

228
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,680
And... I hope that I can live up...

229
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,690
to your expectations A-T-I-O-N-S.

230
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,490
Expectations.

231
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,360
You're interested in German literature, Mrs. Filipov?

232
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,470
It's all right, it's our neighbor.

233
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,100
Right, where were we? Tania, we have guests.

234
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,010
Your offer to name-

235
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,050
I...

236
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,050
I-I recognize you.

237
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,790
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

238
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,860
I saw your picture in the paper.

239
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,960
Thank you For everything you're doing.

240
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,730
And this is his friend, Commissar... Danilov.

241
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,940
Danilov.

242
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,100
Tania is like a daughter to me.

243
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,510
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory.

244
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,740
She even taught him German. All these books are hers.

245
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,450
Oh, they're yours? She studied German at the university.

246
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,820
Which university? Moscow.

247
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,400
Moscow. Moscow.

248
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,660
Shouldn't we, uh-

249
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes, let's continue.

250
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,510
Your offer to name Your mine after me...

251
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,240
is... a great honor.

252
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,050
Yes, I know. Honor.

253
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,820
Very good.

254
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:24,330
Shouldn't we make the point that I'm not the only one fighting?

255
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,390
That...That's excellent...excellent idea, Vassili.

256
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,530
We can take it even further though. Oh.

257
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,540
We can take it further.

258
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,670
Your battle for The production of coal...

259
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,340
is as worthy as mine.

260
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,250
There's no "K" in coal.

261
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,310
Just-just one "L."

262
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,760
Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.

263
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,590
No, you're not going too fast. You sure?

264
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,760
I just thought is there Any other improvements?

265
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,330
Why don't you get some rest? These letters can wait until tomorrow.

266
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,840
We should carry on. We're not tired.

267
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,070
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov. These people...

268
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,010
took the trouble to write to us.

269
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,410
Tomorrow, we may not be around to write back.

270
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,880
Major Konig, Herr General.

271
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,040
I was expecting someone...

272
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,050
else.

273
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,990
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

274
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,050
I imagine you have your reasons...

275
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,960
for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation.

276
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,000
My army is not designed For this kind of fighting.

277
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,300
Yesterday, yet again, I had to promote...

278
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,860
25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters.

279
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,510
Those snipers are demoralizing my people.

280
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,920
This city is no more than...

281
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,010
a heap of ruins.

282
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,250
But the fuehrer's persisting.

283
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,520
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself.

284
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,370
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct.

285
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,070
He always managed to lead us to victory.

286
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,780
We shall be back home For Christmas.

287
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,450
How are you going to go about finding this young Russian?

288
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,460
I'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me.

289
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,530
Vassili. Vassili.

290
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,690
Come on, time to get up. What?

291
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,570
They have a problem in the department store sector. They need us. Come on.

292
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,850
Look, Vassili, he's hiding in the department store. Over there.

293
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,790
So far this morning,

294
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,200
he's knocked off five officers, plus two machine gunners.

295
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,270
Look, third floor, fourth window from the left.

296
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,070
Fourth window from the left.

297
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,780
See him?

298
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,510
Yeah, I see him.

299
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,960
There, you got him!

300
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,870
Great shot.

301
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,170
Let's go get his dog tag.

302
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,210
Good-bye, comrade Commissar.

303
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,940
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.

304
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,220
You can borrow whatever you like.

305
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,990
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters...

306
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,000
if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller.

307
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,130
There's some Marx too.

308
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,900
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district?

309
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,200
No, I volunteered.

310
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,510
It's such a coincidence meeting you like this.

311
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,570
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday...

312
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,050
how desperately we're in need of operators who speak German.

313
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,920
I can't. Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighbourhood.

314
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,980
We're already desperately short of men.

315
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,050
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German.

316
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,060
I'd rather stay and fight.

317
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,260
Serving at headquarters is fighting. You'd be far more useful there.

318
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,800
You stay here. You cover us.

319
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,030
All right. We go.

320
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,740
Take care.

321
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,280
Ludmilla, come on.

322
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,310
Check the stairway.

323
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,130
It's a trap.

324
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,530
I know.

325
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,860
Move back.

326
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,110
He's still here.

327
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,500
They're coming straight for us! Ludmilla,

328
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,340
stay where you are, he's over there somewhere.

329
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,650
We have to get out of here!

330
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,090
We have to get out of here! Just stay where you are!

331
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,700
What are we gonna do?

332
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,170
Ludmilla, stay where you are!

333
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,810
Fuck this, I'm going.

334
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,810
Ludmilla, no!

335
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,940
What does this mean?

336
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,440
"The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,

337
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,290
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62, with its 3.5-Power P.U. Telescope.

338
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,350
Pride of precision of Soviet production."

339
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,790
I've seen that rifle close up. Have you?

340
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,600
I've even touched it. I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

341
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,680
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today, and it was my fault.

342
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,190
No, I'm sure that's not true.

343
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,630
There was a German sniper. I walked them right into his trap.

344
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,100
What else can you tell me? He didn't relocate.

345
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:26,000
A sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal.

346
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:33,550
He was very good. It wasn't just his shooting, it was his instinct.

347
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,270
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

348
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:40,480
That's because he knows everything about you.

349
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,450
His name is Konig, Major Konig.

350
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,190
They've sent him here to ki-

351
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,390
to find you.

352
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,540
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.

353
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,630
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.

354
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,170
You've caused them so many sleepless nights, they sent their top marksman.

355
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,240
What do we know about him? He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

356
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,310
He's director of their sniper school in Zossen.

357
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,880
Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.

358
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,330
He knows all his tricks. From now on, he'll go with you everywhere.

359
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,830
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer...

360
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,100
against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves.

361
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,110
It's more than a confrontation between two nations.

362
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,740
It's the essence of class struggle.

363
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,480
I'm glad you're so happy.

364
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,720
He had all the advantages. Next time you'll be even.

365
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,520
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

366
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,430
She's been transferred.

367
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,000
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

368
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,040
Hello. You look smart in your new uniform.

369
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,510
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished.

370
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,920
Yeah, they probably will.

371
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,100
I've heard the rumor about the German, and I wanted to wish you luck.

372
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,720
Thank you. I'll need it.

373
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,460
From what comrade Danilov tells me, you're going to win.

374
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,270
Hmm.

375
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,470
It's time.

376
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,120
Vassili! Vassili! Come to my arms.

377
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,420
Look in my direction.

378
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,750
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic.

379
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,660
This way, comrade Zaitsev. I love this little fellow.

380
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,250
Vassili, is it true that you volunteered for the front?

381
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,280
How old are you, Vassili?

382
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,340
Do you know what this duel means for our country?

383
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,320
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?

384
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,090
Are you proud to be challenged By the best sharpshooter in Germany?

385
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,150
The Germans are starting to shit their pants.

386
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,430
Go on, my boy, tell us how you're going to deal with him.

387
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,960
Or rather, no. Tell it to the boss. One more question, please.

388
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,200
He likes good hunting stories.

389
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,910
Look at him with pride,

390
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,750
because he's looking at you.

391
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,620
The whole country is looking at you.

392
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,540
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

393
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,540
So, it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground...

394
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,920
but the hunter.

395
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,620
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that.

396
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,030
Except in this case,

397
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,040
I'm the game.

398
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,270
However, today what we're going to do...

399
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,740
is lure the wolf out of his lair...

400
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,910
to where we want him to be.

401
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,160
You're the one whose life is valuable. You go first.

402
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,930
No, no. We take it in turns. Next time is your turn to go first,

403
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,970
and then it's you, Volodya.

404
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,280
Son of a bitch!

405
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,820
These are new pants. I just took them off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

406
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,190
Sixteen months I spent in Germany at the school in Zossen.

407
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:40,170
Of course, those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts, :

408
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,680
When our Joseph and their Adolph...

409
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,800
were walking hand in hand.

410
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,480
From here to the wire, 160meters, right?

411
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,250
One hundred and fifty-five.

412
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,030
Whatever. That'll make 'em Send out a repair guy.

413
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,400
Let's relocate.

414
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,840
Aah!

415
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,220
Hey, Volodya!

416
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,730
After the Germans invaded us,

417
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,830
it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.

418
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,470
Threw my ass in prison.

419
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,310
What were you doing in Germany, huh?

420
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,040
Excuse me, says I, but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there.

421
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,820
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery.

422
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:04,330
Confess, spy bastard! Confess.

423
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:08,390
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

424
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,460
Well, there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer.

425
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,030
And bang. Knocked out all my teeth.

426
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,570
That's right, boy. Have no illusions.

427
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,980
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you.

428
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,990
Hey! It's your repair guy.

429
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,550
I got him.

430
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,310
It's about soup time, isn't it?

431
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,210
I'm going.

432
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,110
Well, get a move on, Volodya,

433
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,800
and try not to spill it all on your way back, you Marxist bastard.

434
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,740
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.

435
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,950
Two sentries shot in the train station sector.

436
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,960
One artillery observer in the Northern sector.

437
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,390
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector.

438
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,990
Three telephone repairmen in the workers' housing sector.

439
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:43,360
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you.

440
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,370
I hope he's still able to speak.

441
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,070
Excuse me, sir?

442
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,630
Nothing. Thank you.

443
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,940
So, tell us, Volodya,

444
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,140
which building is he in?

445
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,850
There is no way I know that.

446
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,280
He moves around all the time.

447
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:10,290
He jumps from one to the next.

448
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,290
On which floor?

449
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,290
I don't know.

450
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,490
We'll see about that.

451
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,030
Undress him.

452
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,570
Put him in one of our uniforms.

453
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,230
You see, they are stubborn.

454
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,500
That's the good thing about the Germans.

455
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,910
Man, you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads-

456
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,950
Right.

457
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,460
Let's see if our customer has arrived.

458
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,060
Are you ready?

459
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,070
Uh-huh.

460
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:30,370
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals,

461
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,740
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,

462
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,780
gets up to make sure he has hit his target.

463
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,640
Major Konig sees him.

464
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,950
Aims for his helmet.

465
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,580
Fires.

466
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,960
Reveals his position And is shot in turn.

467
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:06,140
Except... Major Konig doesn't fire...

468
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,510
because Major Konig isn't there.

469
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,420
Koulikov!

470
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,760
Don't you think that was strange, that last one?

471
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,960
They sent him out to get shot like the others.

472
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,970
It's not natural.

473
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,500
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him.

474
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,770
Oh, no, I'm the one who was stupid.

475
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,080
They don't give a shit about telephone guys.

476
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,080
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.

477
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,640
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts.

478
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:55,520
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.

479
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,730
Whose turn is it?

480
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,640
Mine, I think.

481
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,970
Oh, you're such a cheater!

482
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,470
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

483
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:19,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's my turn to go first.

484
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,630
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches.

485
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,750
To victory.

486
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:54,890
This sniper business has been dragging on too long.

487
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,230
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

488
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,570
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

489
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,110
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.

490
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,110
He's meticulous in his preparation.

491
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:14,450
Vodka... is a luxury we have.

492
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,920
Caviar is a luxury we have.

493
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,850
Time is not.

494
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,890
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. We both are.

495
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,390
I assure you he will succeed.

496
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,520
Good.

497
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,830
It seems your destinies are entwined.

498
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,560
They're keeping you busy.

499
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,490
I picked this up in the kitchen.

500
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,300
It's from the reception the other day. I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

501
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,310
Um, she will be thrilled. That's very sweet of you.

502
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,640
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

503
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,510
You'e Jewish, aren't you?

504
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:24,950
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon.

505
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:29,510
My father had a premonition all this would happen.

506
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,750
You mean the war?

507
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:35,820
He understood that the hatred of the jews ran deep.

508
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,130
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine.

509
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,430
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in;

510
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,370
the only land we had a duty to defend.

511
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,540
He insisted learn to use a rifle.

512
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,880
I learned to shoot.

513
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:03,580
I know that in times of war, personal feelings should be put aside, but...

514
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,720
I have a favor to ask you.

515
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,060
Of course. Anything you want.

516
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:11,290
I want to be reassigned.

517
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,030
What's happened, Tania?

518
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,630
He shot him.

519
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,940
He shot him even though he jumped first.

520
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,870
Shot him on the run.

521
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,210
It was an impossible shot.

522
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,580
I've never seen anything like it.

523
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:01,080
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver.

524
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,920
I don't stand a chance against this man.

525
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,080
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

526
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,390
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements?

527
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,590
We've got someone, Vassili.

528
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:18,900
Someone close to him passing us information.

529
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,030
Next time you will be one step ahead of him.

530
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,680
I promise.

531
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,750
Now I have a favor to ask.

532
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,760
From me?

533
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,600
It's about Tania.

534
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,000
Come in.

535
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,070
He doesn't even know you exist.

536
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:03,910
But at that moment, you are closer to him than anyone else on earth.

537
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,150
You see his face through the sight.

538
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,580
You see whether he shaved that morning or not.

539
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:13,420
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on.

540
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,060
It's not like...

541
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:21,360
just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform.

542
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,500
It's a man's face.

543
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,300
Those faces don't go away.

544
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,540
They come back and they just- they get replaced by more faces.

545
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,810
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

546
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,650
He likes you very much. I think he'd try anything to change your mind.

547
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,480
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer?

548
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,490
No.

549
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,490
This morning, a list arrived at headquarters.

550
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,190
It was a list of civilians who'd been...

551
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,730
rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy...

552
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,360
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

553
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,370
My parents were amongst them.

554
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,810
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers...

555
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,010
stopped the train and forced everyone out.

556
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,320
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together,

557
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,290
two by two.

558
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,990
Mothers with daughters.

559
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,000
Husbands and wives.

560
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,130
They... lined them up against the railing,

561
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,540
and then they fired a single shot at each pair...

562
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,540
to save bullets.

563
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:40,380
It worked.

564
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:45,050
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water.

565
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,590
I know they died together.

566
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,760
They never would have let themselves be separated.

567
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:13,780
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good... rifle.

568
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,950
Thank you.

569
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,020
I know how he leaves the shelter.

570
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,030
He goes through the tractor factory.

571
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,330
The tractor factory is big.

572
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:07,730
I know exactly where. He crawls through a gutter,

573
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,710
under a grate where the vats are,

574
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,800
then he goes out from the workshop.

575
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,110
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open.

576
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:19,050
It's under a long, iron foot walk.

577
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,040
Good luck, comrade.

578
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,850
I know exactly where he's waiting for me.

579
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,820
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.

580
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,390
We'll take him out from behind.

581
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:16,590
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes.

582
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,590
Follow me.

583
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,260
You go that way. I'll go around this way.

584
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,140
Okay?

585
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,820
Shit!

586
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,640
Sergei, you should go back.

587
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,930
No, I'll be all right. Go back.

588
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,370
No, you go!

589
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,880
Keep your legs in.

590
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,600
Come on. Come on. Come on.

591
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:40,650
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort!

592
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,760
The fate of the motherland is at risk!

593
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:45,430
The fate of all those you love and cherish!

594
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,900
It's for them that we fight today.

595
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,730
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans are throwing everything at us.

596
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,750
If they're lucky, one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive.

597
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,810
You're highly educated. You know languages.

598
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,280
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives.

599
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:07,190
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs.

600
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,350
You have a duty to survive.

601
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,990
Vassili was born to fire a gun. It's what he knows.

602
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,760
You and I were born for a different purpose.

603
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:18,670
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing.

604
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:26,430
Where is he? Where is Vassili?

605
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:34,370
Keep your head down.

606
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:37,080
Tell me where he is. Stay into that pipe, Tania.

607
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,170
Stay in. Stay in! Get your head in!

608
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:49,190
Slow down.

609
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,200
Don't shoot.

610
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,970
He's over there.

611
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,450
Do you see the pillar in front of you?

612
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,790
I need you to move round behind it.

613
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,600
Go.

614
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:37,680
Tania, I need you to find a large piece of glass.

615
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,940
Piece of glass.

616
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,420
Do you see the kiln...

617
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:50,220
behind me to the left of the factory?

618
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,460
Yes? I can't hear you.

619
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:57,660
Yes. Yes.

620
01:19:57,730 --> 01:20:00,000
Do you see...

621
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:03,100
the two louvers?

622
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:07,270
Yes. Do you see the one...

623
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,110
with a broken slat?

624
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,030
Yes.

625
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,220
This is what I want you to do.

626
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:24,440
Are you ready? Yes.

627
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:28,740
Three... two... one...

628
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,490
Hello, Sacha.

629
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,700
He was right where you said he'd be.

630
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,180
Nearly there.

631
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,350
He's very clever.

632
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,620
Tell me about him.

633
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,670
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?

634
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:28,330
His father's dead. His mother too.

635
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,300
Does he talk about his father?

636
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,780
No. He didn't know him.

637
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:40,080
Did he go to school?

638
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,750
He knows how to write. He answers lots of letters.

639
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,890
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?

640
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,760
Everyone writes to him.

641
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:51,860
Is there a girl he loves in his village?

642
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:55,840
Not in his village, here. Does she love him?

643
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,840
Yes, because he's handsome.

644
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:01,970
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful.

645
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,410
I know her well. She's from my neighbour hood.

646
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,470
She went to the university. They're handsome together.

647
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:09,610
Later, the two of them will get married.

648
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,630
At least, I think so.

649
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,790
And you, Sacha,

650
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:24,800
why are you helping the Germans?

651
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:32,240
Because they're stronger. Because they're going to win the war.

652
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:35,570
And because you like chocolate, huh?

653
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,170
All these people here know they're gonna die.

654
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,570
So each night when they make it back,

655
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,330
it's a bonus.

656
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:04,000
Excuse me.

657
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,510
So, every cup of tea,

658
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,810
every cigarette...

659
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,410
becomes a little celebration.

660
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,950
Because for a lot of us, it maybe our last night.

661
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:20,320
It's just something you have to accept here.

662
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:22,330
Everyone has their time.

663
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:31,370
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years,

664
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,370
the donkey for nine.

665
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:40,100
So, that's-that's got to be a proverb from the Urals.

666
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,150
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

667
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:46,120
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful.

668
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:48,120
Makes absolute sense.

669
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,280
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.

670
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,290
You made it up.

671
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,230
So... I'm a donkey?

672
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,200
People like you and Danilov...

673
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,210
have to survive this.

674
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:09,640
People who have read books, had an education.

675
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,650
We'll need you when the war is over.

676
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,410
And if you survive?

677
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,210
What will the useless Vassili Zaitsev do then?

678
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:23,520
I wanna work in a factory.

679
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:28,150
My granddad took me to a factory once.

680
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:33,190
There was this man there, high up on a-

681
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,670
on a foot walk.

682
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,900
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

683
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:43,210
The people he was supervising didn't understand what they were doing.

684
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,540
But for him, for him up there,

685
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,270
it was simple; it was clear.

686
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:53,550
And I thought, "One day, I could be that man."

687
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,960
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen.

688
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,630
Why shouldn't it?

689
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,870
You'll outlive us all.

690
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,000
Hmm.

691
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,050
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

692
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,860
"150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga.

693
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,330
"Today the whole world is watching these 150meters.

694
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,460
They are what makes Stalingrad..."

695
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,470
the capitol...

696
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,770
of the war.

697
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,350
Your friend, Tania...

698
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,680
have you see her?

699
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,520
She stays over there now, with the snipers.

700
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:03,690
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters...

701
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,420
to support the attack on the factory.

702
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,170
Tell him Vassili will be there.

703
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,940
I need to talk to you. Sure.

704
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,880
I need to talk to you. Sure.

705
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:10,420
Danilov. Hmm?

706
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,690
You have to stop writing about me.

707
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,670
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough.

708
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:35,640
Sooner or later, he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me.

709
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:38,010
I've warned you before not to talk like this.

710
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,380
This time it's different.

711
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,320
You've built me up...

712
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:50,880
and up into someone I'm not.

713
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,530
I can't carry that weight anymore. I wanna fight.

714
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,470
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

715
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:03,540
I understand.

716
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:07,300
The thing is, you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary.

717
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:11,010
No, I'm what you've made me.

718
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,610
Nothing more.

719
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,550
Why are you telling me this now?

720
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,960
Hmm? What's happened?

721
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,430
What's changed?

722
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,460
Did you speak to Tania for me?

723
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,810
Yes. Well...

724
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,280
will she reconsider?

725
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,150
I don't know.

726
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:54,520
She should. She'll be much safer. She should, you know that.

727
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:58,190
Yeah. It'll be easier to get her reassigned.

728
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,460
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center.

729
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:04,800
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. We need you more than ever.

730
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:06,860
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

731
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:14,450
Tell him what you know, Sacha. Hello, Sacha.

732
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:16,640
There was dust on the major's boots.

733
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:21,150
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side.

734
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,210
I don't need to tell you the risk she's taking.

735
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:27,660
The dust was yellow. There's only one place where there's dust like that-

736
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,990
in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks.

737
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,900
Well done.

738
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:37,800
Sacha...

739
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:40,310
wait for me outside then.

740
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,910
Danilov, Hmm?

741
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,890
You had no right to use him.

742
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:56,120
No, no, I didn't use him, Vassili.

743
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,280
He did it of his own accord.

744
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,850
You know why?

745
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:04,020
Because he believes in you!

746
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:14,800
Tomorrow morning, we're going to take back the chemical factory.

747
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,110
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there,

748
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,880
so now you know where you have to wait for him.

749
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:24,150
In the middle of an assault. I'm following orders.

750
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,380
I suggest you do the same.

751
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:31,180
Now, I'm aware of the risks.

752
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,190
You'll be fine.

753
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:39,700
Comrade.

754
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,100
That's the Germans up there.

755
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,130
And yesterday was the Russians.

756
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,290
We're not very far now.

757
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,070
Sacha...

758
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,440
you're playing a very dangerous game.

759
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:23,100
I want you to win.

760
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,510
See there? Keep going along the river.

761
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,210
It's safe... for a while.

762
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,250
Aah!

763
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:13,070
He's dead. We found this on his corpse.

764
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,610
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist.

765
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:21,810
Pardon me, Herr General,

766
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:24,720
but I do not believe-

767
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:27,090
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening.

768
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,460
You will be on it.

769
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,800
Until then, I must ask you for your dog tags.

770
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:41,170
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death.

771
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,640
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

772
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:46,080
You've already had a near miss.

773
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:58,220
Also please take this War Merit Cross.

774
01:39:58,290 --> 01:39:59,780
It was awarded posthumously...

775
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:02,190
to a lieutenant of the 116th Infantry Division...

776
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:04,370
who fell here during the first days of the battle.

777
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:05,770
Who fell here during the first days of the battle.

778
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,910
He was my son.

779
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:14,480
If the landing is captured, everything's lost!

780
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:18,920
Come here.

781
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:24,120
What did I tell you?

782
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:26,820
You've been playing your fiddle too much!

783
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:29,660
If it's confirmed that he's dead, we're sunk!

784
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:33,460
Well, you'll sunk. It isn't true.

785
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:36,370
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters.

786
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,310
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front of our men?

787
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:42,370
They're lying.

788
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:46,580
That's good. Very good.

789
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:50,450
Write it, then. "Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.

790
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,950
"This is what he had for breakfast this morning.

791
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:57,460
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper."You're the poet".

792
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:59,460
What?

793
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:02,090
You won't give up the riverbank!

794
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:05,160
I don't care if you'll lost half your men!

795
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:08,330
Lose the other half, or lose yourself!

796
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,680
Is he back?

797
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,750
He should be back soon.

798
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:25,490
The German attack cut the lines. That's why he's late.

799
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,090
Can we go outside?

800
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:38,990
I wrote to my mother about you.

801
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:41,500
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over,

802
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:43,940
if there's anything you needed- anything at all...

803
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,310
...our family will be there for you.

804
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:50,840
You know I'm here for you.

805
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:58,050
They're saying Vassili is dead.

806
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:02,460
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again.

807
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:06,120
Surrender! This is your only hope.

808
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:12,560
You're upset.

809
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,900
Because Zaitsev is dead?

810
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,640
You don't have to hide it. There's no shame in it.

811
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:24,080
You're a Russian like he is.

812
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,080
Don't listen to them.

813
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:32,420
It's just propaganda.

814
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:34,550
He isn't dead.

815
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,630
And do you know why?

816
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:41,060
Because I haven't killed him yet.

817
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:50,010
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

818
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,940
Only you, because I know I can trust you.

819
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,180
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul.

820
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:03,660
You swear?

821
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,780
I found a terrific spot.

822
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:09,620
It's by the exit from the train station.

823
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,530
I'll hide in the water tower.

824
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,590
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there.

825
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:19,700
You'll see. He'll be there.

826
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:24,970
He always is.

827
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,950
I also want you to swear that from now on, you'll stay home where you belong.

828
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:41,960
Do you swear? Yes?

829
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:47,970
Good.

830
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,030
"We know he's alive. We know he won't fail us.

831
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:53,400
We know because he is a part of us now. Vassili is eternal."

832
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,920
Where have you been? We've looked everywhere for you.

833
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:03,650
Oh, didn't you hear? I was dead.

834
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,710
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev...

835
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:12,660
Vassili was dead.

836
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:14,660
The real one.

837
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,860
Me...

838
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,870
I was asleep,

839
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,870
and I missed my chance.

840
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:29,280
Then, I was curled up in a corner, hiding...

841
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:31,840
from a man who wants to kill me.

842
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,710
I'll talk to Kruschev.

843
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:37,850
He'll send you back to your old division.

844
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,250
Where's Tania? She's at the shelter.

845
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,590
I've been to the shelter.

846
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:45,790
I told her you weren't dead.

847
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:51,090
The major said so. He said the other Germans were lying.

848
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:54,260
He told me you were waiting for him at the station.

849
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:00,110
Vassili.

850
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:22,500
Vassili.

851
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,970
Vassili.

852
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:35,080
My little Sacha.

853
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,080
I knew it.

854
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,800
Vassili. Tania.

855
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,880
I knew you weren't dead.

856
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:09,380
How?

857
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:12,210
Because we only just met.

858
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:21,160
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl.

859
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:24,530
When I opened my eyes, Sacha was standing there...

860
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,790
waiting to give me the good news.

861
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:32,740
I think he loves you even more than I do.

862
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:59,830
To the proper military authority,

863
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,460
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed...

864
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:06,600
in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

865
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:10,770
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties,

866
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:13,250
voiced doubts on the chances of our victory...

867
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,250
and made defeatist comments in public.

868
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:19,450
The inexplicable duration of his duel...

869
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:24,430
with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by...

870
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:27,290
his lack of belief in the communist ideal.

871
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,170
Good morning, Sacha.

872
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:43,040
Once again, he knew exactly where to find me.

873
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:46,570
Don't you think that's strange?

874
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:50,450
Apart from me, only you knew.

875
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:53,290
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.

876
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,730
You've done a very brave thing.

877
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:59,760
You've chosen your camp. I respect that.

878
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:01,770
But it isn't my camp.

879
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:04,730
We're both soldiers,

880
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:09,540
and we're both enemies, so I know you understand.

881
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:15,200
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha, for not staying home as I made you swear to.

882
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,650
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do.

883
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:28,130
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep.

884
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,690
How long have you been watching me?

885
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:36,170
All night.

886
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:39,200
You've been snoring away happily for hours.

887
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:42,210
I don't snore. Do I?

888
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:44,210
Like a pig.

889
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,800
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.

890
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,810
Yes.

891
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:53,080
There's something I should tell you.

892
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:03,490
On the train...

893
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,500
coming here...

894
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:09,460
we were in the same car.

895
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,470
No.

896
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,730
I saw you.

897
01:49:13,810 --> 01:49:17,260
You were reading, and you fell asleep.

898
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:23,310
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful.

899
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,990
It was scary.

900
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:33,920
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking about you.

901
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,930
It made me smile.

902
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:41,830
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you...

903
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,200
who'd make you laugh...

904
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:50,680
how lucky they were.

905
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,440
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

906
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,240
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

907
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:02,810
Was I snoring? Like a pig.

908
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:36,910
What?

909
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:43,780
Oh, my God! Oh, no.

910
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,790
Oh, my God! Tania, no.

911
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,850
Tania, no! No, get off me!

912
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:50,590
Get off me! Get off me! It's what he wants!

913
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:52,600
This is what he wants! Get off me!

914
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:56,000
No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you! Let me go!

915
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:59,180
I'll run after you, and he'll kill me. Let me go!

916
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:02,070
Let me go! This is what he wants! I'll get him.

917
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:05,010
I promise I'll get him.

918
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,140
I'll get his rifle for you. I promise, Tania.

919
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,670
I need you.

920
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,940
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov. Stalingrad may fall.

921
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:39,740
The last of the boats are leaving. The Germans will be here any moment.

922
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:43,180
He's brought you a pass. You'll be safe on the other side.

923
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:46,020
Gather your things, and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage.

924
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:49,680
I'm not leaving. This is my home.

925
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,750
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

926
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:55,160
I have to tell you something, Mrs. Filipov.

927
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,720
Something very difficult to understand.

928
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,740
It's about Sacha.

929
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:19,920
He's gone over to the Germans. He's betrayed his country.

930
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:22,390
He's with the enemy now. He won't be coming back.

931
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:27,200
Oh, my God.

932
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:32,100
Oh, my God.

933
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:38,240
He's become a traitor.

934
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:41,180
The poor little thing.

935
01:52:41,250 --> 01:52:44,110
What has he done?

936
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:48,880
So, he's going to stay over there?

937
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:59,260
Yes... he's going to stay over there.

938
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:03,030
I shouldn't be saying this, comrade Commissar,

939
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:05,970
but maybe it's for the best.

940
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,400
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

941
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:12,380
I know it's wrong, but perhaps he has made the right choice.

942
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:34,530
Oh! Oh, Tania! Tania?

943
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,470
Oh, Tania! Tania!

944
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:42,510
Oh, my God! Oh!

945
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,460
I need a doctor! A doctor!

946
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:10,030
I have a pass. I have a pass!

947
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:12,040
You must let her cross.

948
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,680
Please!

949
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:20,810
It's useless. She'll never make it. No! No, she will!

950
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,980
She's my daughter! She's my daughter!

951
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:26,490
I beg of you! All right.

952
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:29,390
Oh, thank you! Put this one on the boat.

953
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,900
Where is he?

954
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,500
Where's the major?

955
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:23,770
A few inches from your face.

956
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:29,580
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

957
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:33,890
Man will always be man.

958
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:36,050
There is no new man.

959
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:40,730
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal,

960
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,560
where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor.

961
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:47,000
But there's always something to envy.

962
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,730
A smile...

963
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:52,740
a friendship.

964
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:58,270
Something you don't have and want to appropriate.

965
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:01,940
In this world- even a Soviet one-

966
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:05,180
there will always be rich and poor.

967
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,050
Rich in gifts...

968
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,460
poor in gifts.

969
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,470
Rich in love...

970
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,600
poor in love.

971
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:27,970
Tania isn't coming back.

972
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:31,020
She's dead, Vassili.

973
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:43,960
She was cut down by shrapnel. It was quick.

974
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:46,020
I don't think she even saw it coming.

975
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,830
She was on her way back to you.

976
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:55,000
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to the boats, she was coming back for you.

977
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:59,910
She was right. You're a good man, Vassili.

978
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:06,610
I want to help you, Vassili.

979
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:09,350
Let me do one last thing.

980
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,910
Something useful for a change.

981
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,470
Let me show you where the major is.

982
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:22,000
Don't do that. Don't do that!

983
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:41,870
Today, February3, 1943, is an ominous day for Hitler...

984
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:46,330
and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners.

985
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:50,300
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland.

986
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:07,210
After 180 days of heroic combat...

987
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:09,340
in the market city of Stalingrad,

988
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:14,660
and as a result of the valor and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

989
02:02:14,730 --> 02:02:17,860
the commander of our glorious Red Army...

990
02:02:17,930 --> 02:02:21,090
received the unconditional surrender...

991
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:24,900
of the German fascist invaders.

992
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:41,280
Sorry. No, young man, I cannot find...

993
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,290
a matching name in the book. Could you check again?

994
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:46,190
This is the address and her name. She is not here.

995
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:50,860
Yes, this is our address, but we don't have her anymore.

996
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:53,700
This is the address. She's been here. I'm so sorry.

997
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:56,500
She wrote to me. I looked three times. She's not here.

998
02:02:56,570 --> 02:03:02,030
Believe me, there is no Tania Chernova. I can't help you.

999
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:04,040
I'm so sorry.
