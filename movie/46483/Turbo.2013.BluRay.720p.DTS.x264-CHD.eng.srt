1
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,469
<i>And we're back at the final stretch
of the Indianapolis 500.</i>

2
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,537
<i>Guy Gagné is gaining 
an the pack.</i>

3
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,267
<i>The young French Canadian
is making quite an impression</i>

4
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,606
<i>in his debut here at the 
Motor Speedway.</i>

5
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:24,777
<i>In all my years of racing, I've never
seen a driver with this much raw talent.</i>

6
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,975
But what's this?

7
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,646
Out of nowhere,
a dark horse is challenging Gagné.

8
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,051
He's gaining on the pack.

9
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,588
<i>And down the front stretch.</i>

10
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,750
Moving into fourth position... third...
Now, second!

11
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,726
<i>Going to the outside
as they crass the bricks!</i>

12
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,729
And it looks like the winner is Turbo!

13
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,096
Amazing! Unbelievable!

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,569
Instant replay. Again, in super slo-mo.

15
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,406
<i>Welcome back, race fans.</i>

16
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,914
<i>We're here with lady's brightest new star,</i>
<i>Guy Gagné.</i>

17
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,985
<i>Tell us, Guy, what inspired you
to became a race driver?</i>

18
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:06,217
You know, Dan, everybody's got
that one thing that makes them happy.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,555
And for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed.

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,854
<i>Guy!</i>

21
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,828
- One at a time, please.
-Theo!

22
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,935
Yes, the handsome fellow in the back.

23
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:18,961
What are you doing?

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,733
What I've always done.
Stay focused, try to run my race.

25
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,070
That's all any driver can do.
Next question.

26
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,640
Can you please go to sleep?

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,247
We've got work tomorrow.

28
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,438
Sleep? Are you kidding me?

29
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,607
It takes hours to come down
after a big race like this.

30
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,479
Yeah, I bet. Okay.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,513
<i>They are the fuel that keeps me running!</i>

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,125
<i>Guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the Indy Lights,</i>

33
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,625
<i>did you ever dream
that you'd be standing here today?</i>

34
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,026
<i>Well, as my dear father</i>
<i>always told me,</i>

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,261
<i>"No dream is too big,</i>
<i>and no dreamer</i>

36
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,426
<i>- "too small. "
-Too small.</i>

37
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,699
Sleep!

38
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,314
Head in the game. Head in the game.

39
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,638
Yes! Seventeen minutes!
That's a new record!

40
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,398
Theo!

41
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,007
Good morning.

42
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,927
Let's go, people! Pick it up!

43
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,759
Turbo, ready to make his move.

44
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,870
Did you see that? She cut me off!

45
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,935
The joys of racing.

46
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,769
How could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,

47
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,503
drive around in circles
for hours on end?

48
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,613
Left turn! Left turn! Left turn!

49
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,613
Your ignorance saddens me to no end.

50
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,185
Left turn! "What do I do here?
Oh, no, wait a minute. Left turn!"

51
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,611
'Morning, Chet!

52
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:16,778
How's it going, Sally?

53
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,515
-'Morning, Chet.
-'Morning, Phil.

54
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,522
Well, that's a shame.

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,766
And so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant.

56
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,700
All right, people, we got
a lot of tomatoes to harvest today.

57
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,109
We got to pick them,
we got to sort them, we got to eat them.

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,115
But most importantly, we got to be...

59
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,275
Safe.

60
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,978
Yes! Music to my ears.

61
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,113
Look at her.

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,486
Nice curves.

63
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,154
You are one giant, juicy temptress.

64
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,993
Big Red.

65
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,432
Any day now.

66
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,497
Any day now.

67
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,638
Overripe!

68
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,175
Overripe!

69
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,773
Overripe!

70
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,248
Oh, no.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,183
Here we go.

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,188
Bring it on.

73
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,932
Not this time.

74
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,176
And the cars are at the starting line.

75
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,939
Gagné's in the top pole position,

76
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,515
driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato.

77
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,015
Next to him
is that feisty young upstart, Turbo.

78
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,349
Gentlemen, start your engines.

79
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,390
Gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn

80
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,959
with Turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway.

81
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,027
Hey, there he goes again.

82
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,131
And down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!

83
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,257
Go, Turbo!

84
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,394
They're neck and neck!
Gagné, Turbo! Turbo, Gagné!

85
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,006
- And it looks like the winner is...
-Turbo! Turbo! Turbo!

86
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,665
So close!

87
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,039
It's a photo finish!

88
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,507
Overripe!

89
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,150
All right, all right, knock it off.

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,858
Talk to your brother, Chet. 
Or I will.

91
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,082
I'm on it, Carl.

92
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,920
This will not happen again.

93
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,923
Heard that before.

94
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,427
Okay.

95
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,526
That's lunch!

96
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,118
You do this to yourself, you know.

97
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,682
I mean, look at you.

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,352
How could they not make fun of you?

99
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,689
It's like you're almost forcing them.

100
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,728
If you'd just quit it
with the speed stuff...

101
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,061
I can't help it.

102
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,696
It's in me.

103
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,234
No. It is not "in" you.

104
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,428
Says who?

105
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,270
Nature. Mother Nature.

106
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,399
Maybe you've heard of her?

107
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,705
We all have our limitations, Theo.

108
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,874
And the sooner you accept the dull,
miserable reality of your existence,

109
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,246
the happier you'll be.

110
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,419
Wow. Aren't you
just a little ray of sunshine?

111
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,528
Heads up! Shell crusher, two o' clock!

112
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,393
All right, people, you know the drill.

113
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,061
Tuck and roll!

114
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,468
Can't tuck. I can't tuck!

115
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,546
Theo, tuck and roll!

116
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,309
We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll.

117
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,955
You have a shell for a reason.
Use it.

118
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,452
You use it.

119
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,557
I mean, come on,
he's not even looking this way.

120
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,955
Hey, Juice Box, nice tricycle!

121
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,219
You see what I'm saying?

122
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,132
All right, good hustle.

123
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,270
Good hustle, everybody!

124
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,463
Almost everybody.

125
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,566
Quitting time!

126
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,732
Good night, Jim! Night, Sally!

127
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,173
Night, Steve!
I don't know your name.

128
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,006
I'm out of here! Bye!

129

<i>Well, there comes a time

143

<i>when a driver is forced to make
that one, key, split-second decision.</i>

<i>Fall behind, or push ahead.</i>

145
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,278
Push ahead!

146

<i>To take a chance and risk it all,

Yes!

<i>...that one thing that separates
the ordinary from the extra ordinary...</i>

163
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,956
I daresay we've had
a breakthrough, here.

164
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,721
With that TV gone,
you can finally get out of that garage

165
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,355
and put all that racing nonsense
behind you.

166
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,694
And do what?

167
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,427
Start living your life.

168
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,798
I have a life?

169
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,263
Big Red?

170
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,705
Big Red!

171
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,478
I can't tuck. I can't tuck!

172
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,882
Yes!
.Finally!

173
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,949
All right, let's chow down!

174
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,621
Hit the brakes, people.

175
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,418
It's Gardener Day.

176
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,159
You're quitting? Just like that?

177
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,306
Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

178
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,770
That's a bad thing.

179
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,844
"There comes a time in every race

180
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,783
"when a driver is forced to make
that one, key, split-second decision."

181
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,247
What did he just say?

182
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:35,020
"Take a chance and risk it all,
or play it safe and suffer defeat."

183
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,824
Okay, enough with the crazy talk, Theo.

184
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,933
Just step away from the grass
and get back to work.

185
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,159
Theo!

186
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,301
And the cars are at the starting line.

187
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,664
Gentlemen, start your engines.

188
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,179
And once again, it's Turbo out front.

189
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,647
No dream is too big.

190
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,697
In the high lane! At the stripe!

191
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,835
And it looks like the winner is...

192
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,773
Tuck and roll, Theo! Tuck and roll!

193
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,446
No!

194
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,080
Are you insane?

195
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,943
You could've gotten yourself killed!

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,880
Theo, what were you thinking?

197
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,656
I thought I could get there.

198
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,594
When are you gonna wake up?

199
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,547
I wish...

200
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,543
I wish I was...

201
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,722
That was close.

202
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,203
Oh, no.

203
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,653
Yeah!

204
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,397
No, no, no! Come on! Faster!

205
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,656
No, no, no!

206
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,366
What happened?

207
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,142
Hey, hey, hey! 
Get out of here!

208
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,209
Not dead! Not dead!

209
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,722
It reeks in here.

210
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,485
It's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.

211
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,297
Home.

212
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,818
All right.

213
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,547
I'm okay.

214
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,352
That's peculiar.

215
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,329
Okay, what's happening to me?

216
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,235
What? That's me!

217
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,673
Come on! Stop it!

218
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,373
Quiet, quiet!

219
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,881
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

220
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,617
Welcome, everyone,
to this monthly safety meeting.

221
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,961
Well, there goes Jerry.

222
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,726
I'm going to
hand things over to Chet, now,

223
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,097
who has some important
new policies to go over.

224
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,763
Thank you very much, Carl.
Good afternoon, everyone.

225
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,810
I'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.

226
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,776
Okay. I would like to begin
with some very exciting news.

227
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,386
The latest figures are in.

228
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,751
Accidental smushes 
were down 15 percent.

229
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,050
Well done, team.

230
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:36,099
<i>Yo, yo! You're listening to 98.6
where hip-hop... beats.</i>

231
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,660
Finally.

232
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,500
Huh?

233
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,544
What in the...

234
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,240
Help!

235
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,112
Stop! stop, stop!

236
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,614
Mom!

237
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,148
Yeah!

238
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,750
Oh, no!

239
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:37,227
And so, in preparation for
Crow Awareness Week,

240
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,228
I'd just like to say...

241
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,726
Tuck and roll!

242
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,562
No, I'm not kidding! Tuck and roll!

243
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,262
Look out!

244
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,176
Granted, yes,

245
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,981
I admit that there's been
a wee bit of damage to inventory, here,

246
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,589
but if you'd just let me explain...

247
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,848
You're fired!

248
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,289
Whoa, okay, Carl,
if you just give him one more chance,

249
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,691
I promise that this will never, ever...

250
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,662
You don't understand.
You're fired.

251
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:19,737
"You," plural.
Youse. Y'all. Both of you!

252
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,643
Chet. I'm so sorry.

253
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,411
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean for this to...

254
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,849
All my life.

255
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,221
All my life,
I've defended you, covered for you,

256
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:46,388
stood up for you, apologized for you,
and this is what I get in return.

257
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,591
Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.

258
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,363
A nice, comfy deck chair
on the <i>5.5'.</i> Thea!

259
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,165
Aye-aye, Captain!

260
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,264
I'm really sorry.

261
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,070
What is wrong with you?

262
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,439
I don't know.
All I know is, the other night,

263
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,842
I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...

264
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,914
It was a rhetorical question!

265
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,142
Chet!

266
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,950
Help! The world is moving!

267
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,629
Coming through!

268
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,709
Okay, I'm gonna wake up any minute now.

269
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,109
Wake up! Wake up!

270
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,283
Chet?

271
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,413
Easy now, fellas.
You really don't wanna do this.

272
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,115
Chet!

273
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,879
Am I dead? Is this heaven?

274
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,213
I pictured it cleaner.

275
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,683
Come on, get up.

276
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,890
Theo. The crows got you, too.

277
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,222
What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was...

278
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,355
Look at this place.

279
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,331
- Broken glass, rusty nails.
-Breathe.

280
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,766
- Discarded salt packets!
-A few, yeah.

281
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,133
It's like a minefield out here.

282
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,269
Oh, no.
I've got tetanus. I've got tetanus.

283
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,004
My jaw is locking up.

284
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,380
Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic.

285
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,317
Everything's gonna be just fine.

286
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,959
Well, well, well.
<i>Buenas</i> noches, little amigos.

287
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,723
This must be my lucky day.

288
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,230
<i>Hula.</i>It's Tito.

289
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,065
Hey, tell everyone I'm bringing it.

290
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,104
What is this place?

291
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,539
Well, well, well.

292
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,380
Somebody better call the cops,
because I'm about to make a killing.

293
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,745
Killing?

294
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,288
What'd he drag in this time?

295
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,220
Whiplash is going to eat them up.

296
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,560
It's gonna be a slaughter.

297
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,596
Mm-hmm, dead meat.

298
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,467
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

299
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,871
Come on, come on. Now, hurry up.

300
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,380
A little far from home aren't you,
garden snail?

301
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,118
Hey, I think we got a crier here.

302
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,258
Let's do this!

303
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,655
I got this one! Oh, I got this one!

304
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,786
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

305
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:11,919
Come on! This is me!

306
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,792
Time to go, Theo.

307
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,657
Ready...

308
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,326
Set...

309
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,532
Go!

310
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,078
Look. He dead.

311
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,555
Taco Man found dead snail.

312
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,322
What?

313
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,458
Run!

314
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,294
Santa Maria!

315
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,433
What did you say your name was again?

316
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,300
My name is Turbo.

317
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,469
I wish I could rename myself.

318
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,635
Where did you find him?

319
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,701
How did he do that?

320
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,768
Where did you come from?

321
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,644
Hey, how'd you do that?

322
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,214
Theo. A word, please.

323
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,476
Okay, that was...

324
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,710
Amazing, right?

325
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,820
If you think that's something,
check this out.

326
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,946
Turn it off!

327
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,321
Sorry. High beams. Sorry.

328
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,051
That's a new one.

329
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,290
It's okay, it's okay, Theo.
Just hang in there.

330
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,831
As soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.

331
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,127
What? I don't need to be fixed.

332
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,326
There's nothing wrong with me, Chet.

333
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,064
Nothing wrong with you? Well, you're...

334
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,571
You're a freak of nature.

335
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,540
I know, I know! isn't it great?

336
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,600
Theo!

337
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,646
You know what? I prefer "Turbo."

338
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,709
I don't know
what crazy lab you escaped from

339
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,514
but you're amazing, Little Amigo.
Amazing!

340
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,712
Tito!

341
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,919
One second, please.

342
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,062
Do you see that sign? What does it say?

343
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,452
Angelo...

344
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,931
It says, "Dos Bros Tacos."

345
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,830
"Dos "Bros, Tito. 
Not "Uno"Bro.

346
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,596
You're supposed to be out there,
selling tacos,

347
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,035
not racing snails.

348
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,675
I know, but this little guy
is something special.

349
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,037
I'm telling you, Angelo,

350
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,077
the customers are gonna be lining up
around the block.

351
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,840
I can see it already.

352
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:48,919
"Come for the snail racing,
stay for the chimichangas."

353
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,889
Get your head out of the clouds, Tito.
it's enough with your crazy schemes.

354
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,460
No! You're a taco genius, Angelo.

355
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:02,226
And it is my mission in life
to share your gift with the world.

356
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,029
Great.
Then first thing in the morning,

357
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:09,470
get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.

358
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,334
Tito.

359
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,176
You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?

360
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,550
Here, I made up your bed.

361
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,520
Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.

362
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,128
So, I warmed up your blanket.

363
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:36,297
There you go. All comfy and cozy.

364
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:41,262
Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning.

365
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,502
Did he really just kiss you goodnight?

366
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,611
He did. Jealous?

367
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,078
Question.
What gives with the super-speed?

368
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,617
Hey. hey, you a robot?

369
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,948
Are you radioactive, homie?

370
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,213
Is it contagious?

371
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,451
Give the kid some space.

372
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,029
I'm Whiplash. And this here is my crew.

373
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,756
I'm Skidmark!

374
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,032
Ah. yeah!

375
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,661
And I'm Burn. Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.

376
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,809
The name is Smoove Move.
I set the tone around here, you dig?

377
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,375
Now check this. Right about now,

378
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,640
I'm moving so fast, the whole world's
going in slow motion, baby.

379
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,018
Here one second, gone the next.

380
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,211
They call me the White Shadow!

381
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,188
Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.

382
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,118
I don't get it.

383
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,956
I'm fast, like a shadow!

384
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,556
Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.

385
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,466
White Shadow...

386
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,661
I can still see you.

387
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,504
Listen, garden snail, you clearly
got the skills to pay the bills.

388
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,243
If snails had to pay bills, that is.

389
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,901
You would be able to pay them.

390
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,547
Yeah, bills.

391
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,113
Paid in full, son.

392
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:01,913
So, I'm here to invite you
to join our crew.

393
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,616
Join your crew?

394
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,552
Did I say something humorous?

395
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,592
I'm sorry.
it's just that you guys are, you know,

396
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,129
kind of slow-ish.

397
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,099
Really? To our faces?

398
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,098
Theo, what are you doing?

399
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,865
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

400
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,372
Heard what? I didn't hear anything.

401
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,237
Nothing out of order, did you, Theo?

402
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,435
I meant what I said.

403
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,810
Then you better put your money
where your mouth is.

404
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,246
Snails don't have money.

405
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,249
Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?

406
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,547
Your trash talk
is needlessly complicated.

407
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:41,249
Is it? Or is it that your unpaid bills
are overdue?

408
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,420
Enough talk. it's time for action.

409
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,098
It's simple. First one to the top
of that shooting star

410
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,662
wins.

411
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,034
You guys? Way up there, huh? Awesome.

412
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,107
Let me get my calendar
so I can time you.

413
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,974
You got jokes, rookie?

414
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,340
Laugh it up, garden snail.

415
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,039
On your mark...

416
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,945
Get yourself set...

417
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,315
Prepare to be White Shadowed!

418
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,015
Whoa!

419
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,884
Yeah!

420
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,553
Yeah! Bam!

421
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:22,957
Coming through!

422
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,729
Those guys are crazy!

423
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,631
Those guys are awesome.

424
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,967
Hey. player! The party up here!

425
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,706
How do I get up there?

426
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,828
Later!

427
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,876
Coming through!

428
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,875
Yeah!

429
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,914
Who's "slow-ish" now, garden snail?

430
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,957
Today, everything changes!

431
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,897
Tito, what are you doing?

432
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,969
Planning a "taco-volution"!

433
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,801
It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words...

434
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,705
"Taco" and "revolution." I get it.

435
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,471
But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?

436
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,982
Patience, bro.
Taco-volutions don't happen in a day.

437
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,751
<i>And next up an our tour
is the L.A. River.</i>

438
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,557
<i>Famous for its appearance...</i>

439
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,903
Get! Get out!

440
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:17,772
Sorry, Paz. 
Can you throw that up here?

441
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,447
Coming to getcha!
I'm coming to getcha!

442
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,608
Bye.

443
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,545
Hey!

444
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,316
Valley Hobby, this is Bobby,
how can I help you?

445
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,694
No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay.

446
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,288
That's what I'm talking about!

447
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,867
You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe.

448
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,835
Sure, knock yourself out.

449
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
Can't get no better.

450
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,879
Okay. So, what's your plan?

451
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,184
Stay herein this rundown strip mall?

452
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,727
With a bunch of lunatic snails,

453
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:41,559
and a nut so taco man
who is using you to sell Mexican food?

454
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:46,226
Because if that's your plan,
then whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!

455
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:50,841
My ears are burning.
I hope you're not talking about me.

456
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,374
You two seem to have
a special connection, Little Amigo,

457
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,448
and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo.

458
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,708
Is this your mother?

459
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,112
Your sister?

460
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,954
Say no more. it's your girlfriend.

461
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,062
She's a cutie.

462
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,194
Women.

463
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,131
I have to admit,

464
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,709
I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.

465
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,084
It doesn't make sense.

466
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,721
With my brains and your speed,

467
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,879
we should be destined for greatness,
right?

468
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,916
We need to think big, 
Little Amigo.

469
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,122
I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.

470
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,291
Flea markets.
No, farmers' markets. No, supermarkets.

471
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,401
We'll cover all the markets.

472
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,797
Quinceañers,
confirmations, graduations.

473
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,643
The Indy 500.

474
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,372
I got it.
We can have our very own telenovela!

475
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,107
What? No.

476
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,901
This is it, Chet.
I knew we ended up here for a reason.

477
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,935
Will you just slow down for a second?

478
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,171
Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!

479
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,969
Theo, stop.

480
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,478
What are you trying to say?

481
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,014
I wanna enter him in the Indy 500.

482
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,811
The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?

483
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,249
What is he talking about?

484
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,981
Now, look,
I know it may sound a little crazy...

485
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,683
No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.

486
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,487
Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy.

487
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,290
What? People love sushi.

488
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:59,266
Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy.

489
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,804
The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean.

490
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:05,499
Taco Man and his sidekick, the Churro.

491
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,872
That was off-the-hook crazy!

492
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,472
Crazy awesome.

493
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:14,551
But this, Tito?
This is in a category all by itself.

494
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,880
Angelo, please.

495
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,044
Come on, Chet. Just hear me out.

496
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,022
Theo, a snail cannot race
in a competition meant for cars.

497
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,661
There are rules.

498
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,626
Actually,
I've been doing a lot of research,

499
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,857
and there's nothing in the rules
that says a snail can't enter the race.

500
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,661
There's nothing that says this sponge
can't enter the race either,

501
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,168
but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.

502
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,500
Millions of people watch that race.

503
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,335
This could put us on the map, bro.

504
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,240
- Trying to work, here.
-Come on, Angelo.

505
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,881
All we have to do
is raise the $20,000 registration fee.

506
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,972
What?

507
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,017
- I figured, once we sell the truck...
-Sell the...

508
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,482
Are you even
listening to yourself, Tito?

509
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:54,819
You want to invest
our entire life savings in a snail!

510
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,428
I'm telling you, this snail
crawled into our lives for a reason.

511
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,162
I think he could be
our little shooting star.

512
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,495
Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me.

513
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,659
That guy is as crazy as you are.

514
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,396
They'll never let you into that race.

515
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,064
And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.

516
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,607
- Yeah, but...
-Angelo, listen...

517
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,767
- Tito!
-Theo!

518
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,536
Not every dream is meant to come true.

519
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,547
Yeah, what he said.

520
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,049
A snail in the Indy 500.

521
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,384
What will you think of next?

522
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,463
Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow.

523
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:51,377
Now, I know some people may say
$20,000 sounds like a lot of money.

524
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,641
It is a lot of money.

525
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,048
And I know some people
may say I'm crazy.

526
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,589
But I say, when a snail crawls
into your life at 200 miles an hour,

527
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,386
then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,

528
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,461
and take a ride of a lifetime.

529
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,888
Now,
in case you're still not convinced...

530
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:12,092
Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.

531
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,140
What's your point, Tito?

532
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,908
My point is, we got a chance
to change our lives for the better.

533
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:31,146
To make Starlight Plaza
the great place we all know it could be.

534
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,346
Now, come on.

535
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:36,960
Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?

536
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,135
Sorry, Tito, but I've got work to do.

537
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,100
No, you don't. None of you do.

538
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,807
I don't get it. That poster was awesome.

539
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,044
Well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo.

540
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,315
We're going to Indianapolis, Chet.

541
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,385
Don't you worry
your chubby little face about that.

542
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,547
All right, team.

543
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,958
Snail up!

544
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,989
<i>And next up an our tour
is the L.A. River.</i>

545
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,395
Famous for its appearance
in such movies as...

546
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,834
You've just been White Shadowed!

547
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,197
Next stop is the Starlight Plaza.

548
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,570
Yes!

549
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,207
Burn. Let's get this party started.

550
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,716
You know it.

551
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,047
Snailed it.

552
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,888
Skidmark. 
You bringing the beverages?

553
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,651
I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you.

554
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,639
Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby.

555
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,207
Whoa.

556
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,014
Hey, Angelo! We got customers.

557
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,309
Whoa!

558
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,685
Okay. you ready?

559
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,053
Go!

560
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,063
All right. You're good to go.

561
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,503
Okay, everybody. Back on the bus.

562
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,602
Mama, you look good!

563
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,747
Bye. Come again.
I do weddings, bar mitzvahs.

564
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,382
Thank you. 
Come back soon.

565
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,677
Tomorrow, later on today.
I'll be here.

566
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,508
Good luck with that snail of yours.

567
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,120
Thank you, my friend.

568
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,778
I gotta hand it to you, Tito.

569
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,687
For once,
one of your crazy schemes worked.

570
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:49,849
I know!

571
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,294
And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,

572
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,932
just imagine what the Indy 500 could do.

573
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,261
Hey, don't go crazy on me.

574
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,893
We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos.

575
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,267
It's good enough.

576
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,151
You better not mess this up, Tito.

577
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,620
Oh, no.

578
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,892
Oh, yes.
We're going to Indianapolis, Chet!

579
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:34,504
"I" to the "N" to the "Dizzy"
to the "Wizzah." You dig?

580
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,071
Yes, sir.

581
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,999
One breakfast burrito, please.

582
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:48,446
That's it.
I'm sorry, honey. Today is the day.

583
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,092
Tito!

584
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:00,953
Are you ready, big man?

585
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,691
On three. One, two...

586
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,563
Indy. baby!

587
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,721
I got it!
"pasty"!

588
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,259
Are you kidding me?

589
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,101
"Turbo"!

590
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,404
All right, as the kids say,
"Time to plump your ride."

591
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,610
Heck, no!

592
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,442
Let's do this.

593
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,879
Now, that's more like it.

594
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,796
No twitching. Voila'!

595
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,201
Suited and booted, gooted and looted,
dipped and whipped!

596
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,565
We've got a contender, baby!

597
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,809
Look at him go!

598
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,820
Fresh air, baby.

599
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,990
We ain't in Van Nuys no more.

600
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,736
Hi, Chet.

601
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,781
You're gonna be my boyfriend!

602
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,612
I'm gonna call you "boo."

603
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,309
"Boo"? What does that even mean?

604
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,521
Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?

605
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,159
I can't believe you're doing this.

606
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,822
"We." We are doing this.

607
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,491
You. I'm just a hostage.

608
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:25,532
Theo, what happens if you wake up
tomorrow, and your powers are gone?

609
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,308
What then?

610
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,508
Then I better make the most of today.

611
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,517
This is even bigger than Hobby-Con.

612
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,695
Wow. Now, that's a car.

613
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,498
Whoa. Shiny.

614
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,790
Gagné.

615
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,083
And Guy Gagné wins the pole,

616
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,322
with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.

617
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,725
That's Gagné's best time yet.

618
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,966
Turbo has never gone that fast.

619
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,432
I mean, yet.

620
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:37,164
So, you got a plan, Taco Man?

621
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,309
Of course I do.

622
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,807
Please tell me those phony glasses
are not your plan.

623
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,483
No. That would be ridiculous.

624
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,014
Come on, phony glasses, do your thing.

625
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,924
This great.
I'm gonna go have heart attack.

626
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,168
Oué pasa, my friend?

627
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,001
I have a driver that
I'd like to enter into the race.

628
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,108
What team does your driver race for?

629
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,870
Dos Bros Tacos and Company.

630
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,714
Has he passed the rookie test?

631
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,452
Hey, come here.
Let's cut to the chase, okay?

632
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,318
You have glasses, I have glasses.

633
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,550
What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?

634
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,320
Hey, let go. Come on, man, let go!

635
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,296
This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff.

636
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:37,661
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,876
Guy, how do you do it, shattering
your own records year after year?

638
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,644
Well,
when a cheetah chases after a gazelle,

639
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:54,182
does he ever stop to think,
"Maybe I've caught enough gazelles.

640
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,252
"Maybe I should just settle down,
try the vegan thing."

641
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,686
No! He keeps running
as long as his legs will carry him.

642
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,350
I am like the cheetah. I never give up.

643
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,428
Next question.

644
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,931
All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home.

645
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,865
Whoa!
What gives?

646
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,672
No, no, no!

647
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,848
<i>Can</i> I <i>help you, monsieur?</i>

648
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,209
One second, please.

649
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,581
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get me arrested?

650
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,348
Oh.

651
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,726
Sorry! So sorry.
We'll have this under control...

652
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,557
Ladies and gentlemen!

653
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:46,362
I give you the next Indy 500 champion!

654
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,742
Is that a snail?

655
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,401
Your driver is a snail?

656
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,251
What kind of welcome is that?

657
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,584
I'd say an appropriate welcome,
given the situation.

658
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,225
All right. Game over, nut job.

659
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,484
Let's go.

660
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,528
Have a nice flight, Chet.

661
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,289
- Hit it!
-White Shadow!

662
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,963
<i>Banzai!</i>

663
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,825
Get off!

664
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,131
Pedal to the metal, Turbo.

665
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,930
Go!

666
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,570
Whoa!

667
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:41,615
Yeah!

668
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,717
Whoa! That snail is fast!

669
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,113
What did I miss? What did I miss?

670
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,761
226! That's fast enough to qualify!

671
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,632
That's what I'm talking about!

672
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,204
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

673
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,244
Man, wait until people see this!

674
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,409
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!
What? Are you seeing this?</i>

675
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,523
<i>- Hello?
-Have you heard?</i>

676
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,090
Yes, I've heard.

677
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,852
<i>That snail is fast.</i>

678
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,689
Forget about it.
This will blow over by noon.

679
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,264
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

680
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,062
<i>- Hello?
-Have you seen it?</i>

681
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,102
Yes, I've seen it!

682
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,075
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

683
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,336
<i>What?</i>

684
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,103
<i>Snail is fast!</i>

685
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,148
<i>You see the snail moving fast
You slow, you gonna get passed</i>

686
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:15,978
<i>You see him gaining position for first</i>

687
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,142
<i>He won't be last</i>

688
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,788
<i>He's ready to make a dash</i>

689
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,548
<i>Snail quicker than a lightning ﬂash</i>

690
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,489
<i>His engine's roaring, he's ﬂooring
He won't run out of gas</i>

691
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,255
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

692
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,629
Whoa! Are you seeing this?

693
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,860
Whoa!

694
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,235
<i>You cannot have a snail in the Indy 500.</i>

695
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,272
<i>It's a miracle of nature!</i>

696
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,433
<i>Will the snail be crushed
by the giant race cars?</i>

697
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,738
<i>That snail is fast, fast, fast</i>
<i>Fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

698
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,519
Whoa. That snail is fast.

699
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:58,962
We've just received word that the CEO
of Indy Car is about to make a statement.

700
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,970
And so,
after careful consideration and...

701
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,143
<i>That snail is fast
That snail is fast</i>

702
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,971
Sorry. My bad.

703
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,581
I've decided...

704
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,011
Please, say yes. Please, say yes.

705
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,617
Please, say no. Please, say no.

706
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,651
White Shadow.

707
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:29,457
I've decided that I simply cannot permit
a snail to enter...

708
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:34,291
Please, sir, give my snail a shot,
and I swear, you won't regret it.

709
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:39,493
Mr. Lopez, while I appreciate
your enthusiasm, my decision is...

710
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,034
Let him race!

711
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,535
Let him race!

712
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:43,969
Let him race!

713
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,201
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

714
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,939
Now, now. Order.

715
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,514
Sir, if I may.

716
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,879
You might want to get a two-shot here.

717
00:55:56,052 --> 00:56:01,684
I, like this passionate gentleman here,
came from humble beginnings.

718
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,691
In the words of my dear father,

719
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:10,322
"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small."

720
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,833
And that is why I, for one,

721
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:17,337
believe that if the Indy 500
isn't going to put a limit on speed,

722
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:21,102
then it shouldn't put a limit on spirit!

723
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,212
Give the people what they want.

724
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,974
Let him race!

725
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:30,711
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

726
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,184
Just me.

727
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,021
Whole frame, my face.

728
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,723
All right!

729
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,729
"All right," what?

730
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:47,234
Your snail can compete
in the Indianapolis 500.

731
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,464
Yeah!

732
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,005
Has the world lost its mind?

733
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,878
To Turbo!

734
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,047
Starlight Plaza! Hey!

735
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,554
He ain't slow no more.

736
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,749
That's for sure.

737
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,850
Shut the door.

738
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,691
Get on the floor.

739
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,694
Barbeque sauce!

740
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,761
<i>And we're back with more
from Indianapolis.</i>

741
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,663
Check it out. We're on TV.

742
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:23,033
<i>Mr. Lopez, haw do you feel about
getting to compete in the Indy 500.7</i>

743
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,265
<i>I'm just so happy.</i>

744
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,208
<i>And we'd all be happy to see you
come an down to the Starlight Plaza.</i>

745
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,405
<i>Just north of the 707</i>
<i>in Van Nays, California.</i>

746
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,348
<i>Kim Ly Nail Salon.
Where we put the "nail" in "snail."</i>

747
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,550
Taco Man cried
in front of millions of people.

748
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,604
Here you go, Paz. Nice and warm.

749
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:05,805
Goodnight, Tito.

750
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,610
- You comfy enough, Bobby?
-No.

751
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,274
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

752
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,352
Hey! No touching!

753
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,957
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

754
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:21,296
Sleep tight, Little Amigo.
We got a big day tomorrow.

755
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,255
Yep.

756
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,196
Big day, indeed.

757
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,398
I'm detecting
a refreshing note of disapproval.

758
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,599
I'm worried. And you should be, too.

759
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,002
I'll be fine.

760
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,809
You are delusional, you know that?

761
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:41,076
It's Big Red all over again.

762
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,947
Only this time,
instead of one lawn mower,

763
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,557
it'll be 32 giant, fire-breathing cars!

764
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,458
And I won't be able to save you.

765
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,962
You won't have to, because this time,
I have speed.

766
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,226
You're not a car. You're a snail.

767
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:02,965
I got a shot here, Chet.
I can do this. You'll see.

768
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,504
No, I won't.

769
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,844
I will not stand by
and watch the only brother I've got

770
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:13,313
risk his life
chasing some impossible dream.

771
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,646
I'm sorry, Theo.

772
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,781
All of these people, they believe in me.

773
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,553
Guy Gagné believes in me.

774
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,197
Why won't you?

775
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:32,130
And by the way, my name is Turbo.

776
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,361
All right. <i>Tout</i> suite, let's go.

777
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,669
Whoa.

778
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,436
2.2-liter turbo V6.

779
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,578
24-valve quad-overhead cam.

780
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,279
Fastest open-wheel,
single-seat machine on the planet.

781
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,188
I think I'm in love.

782
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:30,682
No way.

783
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,368
You're not trying
to steal my trophy from me, are you?

784
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:49,569
Because if you want one for yourself,
you may have a long wait.

785
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:50,804
Espresso?

786
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:55,977
So, you are my little competition, eh?

787
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,553
The underdog versus the champion.

788
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,747
The world loves the underdogs, you know.

789
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,791
The dreamers out there, they need them.

790
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:09,626
Need to believe that one day, maybe
they could achieve the impossible, too.

791
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:16,963
Well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.

792
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,900
And dreamers?

793
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:23,102
Let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.

794
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:31,283
I've never talked to a snail before.
So small, so amusing.

795
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,786
No wonder they want to see you race, eh?

796
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,482
Vroom! Vroom!

797
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,491
Look at him go.

798
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,459
Thank you, plucky snail.

799
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:45,466
Because of you,
the whole world will be watching this race.

800
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:50,835
And when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.

801
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,708
Crawl home, garden snail,

802
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,774
while you still can.

803
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,021
<i>Good afternoon, race fans,</i>

804
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:12,458
and welcome to this year's running
of the Indianapolis 500.

805
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:17,065
<i>Televised in aver 200 countries
and aired in 3.7 different languages,</i>

806
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,894
<i>this is no longer just a race,</i>

807
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,197
<i>this is the day you'll be telling
your grandchildren about.</i>

808
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:29,210
<i>Where were you the day they let
a snail race in the Indy 500.7</i>

809
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,907
Okay, time to go. You ready?

810
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,656
All right, team meeting. Bring it in.

811
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:48,091
This is it, Little Amigo.
This is our moment. Our time.

812
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,824
Today is the day we make our mark.

813
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,933
Everybody in! it's go time!

814
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:06,609
Oh, Theo. Be careful out there.

815
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,676
Hey, little snail. Are you lost?

816
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:10,842
No.

817
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,184
Are you a boy, or a girl?

818
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,624
Why is this confusing? I'm not a girl!

819
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,892
And there they are, folks.
Some of the biggest names in motorsport.

820
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,363
<i>Shelby Stone,</i>
<i>hot off her win in Sao Paulo.</i>

821
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,893
<i>And there's Claudio Cruz,
a.k.a. "The Brazilian Butcher. "</i>

822
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,062
<i>He actually was a butcher
before he got into race car driving.</i>

823
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,039
Gagné! Gagné! Gagné!

824
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,271
Hey!

825
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:42,079
<i>And here he comes, folks,
le man, le myth, le legend...</i>

826
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:46,019
le "if I could choose anybody in the world
to be my best friend it would be..."

827
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,987
<i>Guy Gagné!</i>

828
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:52,519
Yes, yes. "Gagné, Gagné!"

829
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,269
You know, food trucks
are actually very popular these days.

830
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,433
<i>And I tell you what,
I do lave a good torta.</i>

831
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:18,885
Yeah!

832
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,389
<i>And would you look at those t-shirts?</i>

833
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,823
<i>It is amazing what you can do
an your printer at home.</i>

834
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,999
Tito, you better know what you're doing.

835
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,625
Here you go, little snail.
Now you've got the best seat in the house.

836
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,975
Oh, no. Nope.
This isn't happening.

837
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,633
I gotta get out of here.

838
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,978
Stay here. I'll be right back.

839
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:48,310
Help! Let me out. Let me out!

840
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,317
Breathe.

841
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,945
<i>Good afternoon and welcome</i>

842
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:58,720
<i>to what has became the most
anticipated and unprecedented</i>

843
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,694
<i>running of the Indianapolis 500.</i>

844
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,128
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

845
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,238
<i>ladies and gentlemen, and snail,</i>

846
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,807
<i>start your engines!</i>

847
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,183
It's like an earthquake!

848
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,152
I love it. Is it weird that I love it?

849
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,223
Everyone, off the track, please.

850
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,360
See you in the winner's circle,
garden snail.

851
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,188
Easy to the peasy, baby.

852
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,195
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
We can do this, right?

853
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,701
I wish I was tiny,
so I can give you a hug.

854
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:40,859
Get off the track!

855
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,598
Okay, okay, I'm going!
Good luck out there, Turbo!

856
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,958
Did anybody bring earplugs?

857
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,153
What?

858
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,455
I can't watch this.

859
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,364
The pace car is off
and the parade laps are underway.

860
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:19,737
<i>Only moments until the green ﬂag drops,
and history is made here at Indianapolis.</i>

861
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,305
Let's do this.

862
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,338
<i>And the race is an!</i>

863
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,571
You go, Turbo!

864
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:17,827
<i>Turbo, struggling out there.</i>

865
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,026
Looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.

866
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,674
He's getting killed out there.

867
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,141
What have we done?

868
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,875
Whoa. That snail is history.

869
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,446
I think I'm gonna be sick.

870
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,206
Come on, garden snail.
Get your head in the game!

871
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,926
Go, go, go!

872
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,370
All right, go, go. so!

873
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,237
Come on!
We're supposed to be a team, here!

874
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,368
We're trying.

875
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,539
It's a snail.
There's not that much to do.

876
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,513
That's it. This pit crew
is officially under new management.

877
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,055
Now, this is how it's done. Air jack.

878
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,782
Jack-tivate.

879
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,255
- Lube.
-Applied liberally.

880
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,384
Detailing.

881
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,019
Wax on, wax off.

882
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,492
- Fuel!
-Down the hatch.

883
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,655
Chug! Chug! Chug!

884
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:56,789
Foot massage.

885
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,197
You know it.

886
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,057
Relaxing vibes.

887
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,398
Own it, brother.

888
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,972
Now, de-lax those vibes!

889
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:06,299
Are you crazy?

890
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,806
Yeah, I'm crazy!
What made you think I was sane?

891
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,241
I don't know how to...

892
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,977
- Are you a car?
-No.

893
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,673
Are you a car?

894
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:14,841
No!

895
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,249
Then stop driving like one!

896
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,752
Now get out there. Snail up, baby!

897
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,891
Go, T-boogie, go!

898
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,828
Gagné with a commanding lead now.

899
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,595
Followed by Claudio Cruz,
Shelby Stone and Takao Noguchi.

900
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,099
Go!
Come on.

901
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,411
Snail up.

902
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,957
Snail up!

903
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,494
Yes!

904
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:09,298
I don't believe it!
Turbo just went under a car!

905
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,336
Did you see that?

906
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,110
<i>Despite a rocky start,
it looks like Turbo is gaining some ground.</i>

907
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,446
Yeah! Now we're talking!

908
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:32,020
Where is he? Where is he?

909
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,541
He passed another one!

910
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,907
<i>Yeah!</i>

911
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,547
That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!

912
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,359
Go, go, go! Left turn! Left turn!

913
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,830
Yeah! Left turn!

914
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:30,041
<i>Turbo maneuvers past Shelby Stone</i>
<i>and into second place!</i>

915
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,187
He is hot on Gagné's heels!

916
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,220
The snail's not going away, Guy.

917
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,916
All right, I know, I know!

918
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,027
<i>These racers better watch it</i>
<i>coming in to turn four.</i>

919
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:52,196
This late in the race,
that outside edge is full of marbles.

920
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,775
And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.

921
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,641
That rubber peeling off the tires
can be a minefield for these drivers.

922
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:01,948
Here we go.

923
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:26,865
Turbo!

924
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:28,971
Oh, no.

925
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,472
Oh, man.

926
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,617
What are we gonna do?
If he takes another hit like that last one...

927
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,688
You gotta pull him, Tito.

928
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,820
I'm sorry, Little Amigo. it's over.

929
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:57,963
Hey.

930
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,074
We got this far. it's good enough.

931
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,807
No, it's not.

932
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:13,281
<i>With the green ﬂag about to be waved,
it looks like a mere formality at this point.</i>

933
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:16,720
<i>Gagné, just five laps a way from victory.</i>

934
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,260
Wait a minute!
Turbo is still in this thing!

935
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,466
What?

936
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,275
Whoa! What happened there?

937
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,249
Come on, come on!

938
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,181
No!

939
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,282
Theo!

940
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,090
No!

941
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,060
Not this time. Come on!

942
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,012
Come on, Turbo. Come on, Turbo.

943
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,444
Come on,
just hold in there a little longer.

944
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,252
No!

945
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:37,901
No!

946
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,870
Farewell, little snail.

947
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,353
<i>Unbelievable! Turbo takes the lead.</i>

948
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,222
Snail-style, baby!

949
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,391
Bad idea. Bad idea.

950
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:09,368
And the white flag is in the air
as we enter the 200th and final lap.

951
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:12,736
<i>Turbo weaving between lapped cars
like a snail possessed.</i>

952
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:16,538
<i>He is determined to hold onto his lead.</i>

953
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,747
No!

954
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:32,917
I will not lose to a snail!

955
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,090
Gagné is in the marbles!

956
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,565
Guy, what are you doing?

957
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,281
Theo!

958
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:08,755
Turbo!

959
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:14,432
<i>The track is hacked up</i>
<i>all the way down the front straight.</i>

960
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,664
<i>It's complete gridlock down there.</i>

961
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:22,004
I can't see him. I can't see him.

962
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:23,804
Guy, are you okay?

963
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,009
Where am I?

964
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:38,851
There he is.

965
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,917
Theo.

966
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,656
Let's finish this.

967
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,581
Oh, no.

968
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,815
Turbo.

969
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:22,370
No, no, no.
Theo, what are you doing? Don't give up.

970
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,013
Hey! Where are you going?

971
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,243
No, no!

972
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,254
Get back here! No, wait!

973
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:45,691
No! Little snail!

974
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,124
Theo!

975
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,061
Is that Chet?

976
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:58,972
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

977
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,436
Salt!

978
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,419
Crows? Are you kidding me?

979
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,820
Long time no see, Chet!

980
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,829
Hey! Don't test me, crow.

981
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,588
White Shadow!

982
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,398
Nice moves back there, boo.

983
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,367
Is this really necessary?

984
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,014
No, man. But it's fun.

985
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,676
Theo!

986
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,146
Theo!

987
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,188
Chet?

988
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,664
Finish this!

989
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,228
I can't.

990
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,599
Oh, yes, you can.

991
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,331
You're right, you know.

992
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:09,375
It is in you. it's always been in you.

993
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:14,372
Now, I did not just face
every fear known to snail-kind

994
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:18,076
to come down here
and watch you hide in your shell.

995
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,416
I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!

996
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,549
Don't even think about it.

997
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,623
And my little brother never gives up.

998
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,898
That's the best thing about you.

999
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:37,094
So, you get out there
and you win this...

1000
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,302
Turbo.

1001
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,457
He's still going.

1002
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,105
Son of a gun.

1003
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,586
Come on, come on!

1004
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,701
Unbelievable! The race is back on!

1005
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,442
- Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1006
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,042
Little Amigo!

1007
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:59,680
Hey, snail!
He's gradually gaining on you!

1008
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,013
Come on! Come on!

1009
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,551
Turbo! Tuck and roll!

1010
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,419
And Turbo wins it by a shell!

1011
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,954
That's what I'm talking about!

1012
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,527
Chet! Chet!

1013
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:15,053
Turbo!

1014
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,322
Chet!

1015
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,723
We won, right? We just won?

1016
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,958
We won.

1017
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:26,306
Hey, everybody!
My brother won the Indy 5,000!

1018
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:29,910
Wow. That's so romantic.

1019
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:33,541
<i>Hey, Angela. We did it!</i>

1020
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,943
We did it. We did it!

1021
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,313
Free tacos for everybody!

1022
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,320
Snail power, baby!

1023
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,085
Mom.

1024
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,227
Hey, Gagné! Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1025
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,165
- You big bad boy!
-Security!

1026
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,167
I step on you! Do you like that?

1027
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,566
- Sleeper hold!
-All right.

1028
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,332
Let go of me! I'm just an old lady!

1029
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:03,173
Kim Ly Nail Salon!

1030
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,213
That's our snail!

1031
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:18,025
It's like I always said, Little Amigo,
you are amazing!

1032
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:21,487
Okay, wait.

1033
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,654
Just keep your eyes closed
until I say so, okay?

1034
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,028
Tito, this is stupid.

1035
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,293
Ta-da!

1036
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:31,138
<i>Hello, Angela. Let's get cooking.</i>

1037
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:32,364
Boom!

1038
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,976
The stove talks, bro.

1039
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,244
No, honey, soonest available
three months from now, 6:00 AM.

1040
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,145
Brenda, that daisy
really brings out your foot!

1041
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,716
Hey, I'm not paying you guys
to sit around and look pretty.

1042
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,251
Now, that's more like it.

1043
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:51,616
Check it out.

1044
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,818
Whoa. This guy is good.

1045
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,589
And last, but not least, Sanitation.

1046
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,755
Nice choice, young man.

1047
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:01,391
Come on, boys.
it's time to take out the trash.

1048
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,242
Take a look at this place.

1049
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,677
Like I said,
your skills have truly paid the bills.

1050
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,781
Yeah, bills.

1051
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:25,883
What you saying, bro?

1052
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:37,571
All racers to the starting line.

1053
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,729
Hey, T.

1054
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,742
You gonna be okay
without those fancy magic superpowers?

1055
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,436
Sure. It never stopped any of you.

1056
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:51,608
Yeah!

1057
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,917
Oué pasa, my friend?

1058
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,259
You see that? All these people?

1059
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,991
You did that, Little Amigo.
You put this place on the map.

1060
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,770
You really are my little shooting star.

1061
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,064
I almost forgot. I got you something.

1062
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,232
Pam!

1063
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,071
You won't be missing this.

1064
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:19,839
What? You're all better.

1065
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,582
That's nice.

1066
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:31,281
Okay, listen up.
Let's have a nice, safe race out there today.

1067
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,086
Don't want any accidents.

1068
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:34,786
That being said,

1069
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,761
blow them off the track, bro.

1070
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,993
I love a man in uniform. For real!

1071
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,672
Simmer down, boo. I'm on duty, here.

1072
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,036
On your mark.

1073
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:51,474
All right, so, you got a new shell.

1074
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,115
But can yours do this? Hit it, Burn!

1075
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:13,324
Get set.

1076
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:22,901
Go.

1077
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,218
- Come on! Let's do it!
-Yeah!

1078
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:38,216
Hello!

1079
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:48,825
Yes, sir.

1080
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,219
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

1081
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:25,233
Oh. yeah!

1082
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:40,914
White Shadow!

1083
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:24,090
I can tuck. I can tuck.

1084
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,989
Okay, baby, here we go.

1085
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:27,926
Come on.

1086
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,336
I did it!
I tucked! I tucked!

1087
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,539
I can't get out.
