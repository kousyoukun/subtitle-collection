1
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>And we're back at the final stretch
of the Indianapolis 500.</i>

2
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>Guy Gagné is gaining on the pack.</i>

3
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>The young French Canadian
is making quite an impression</i>

4
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,662
<i>in his debut here at the Motor Speedway.</i>

5
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:24,834
<i>In all my years of racing, I've never
seen a driver with this much raw talent.</i>

6
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,002
But what's this?

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,672
Out of nowhere,
a dark horse is challenging Gagné.

8
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,090
He's gaining on the pack.

9
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>And down the front stretch.</i>

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,803
Moving into fourth position... third...
Now, second!

11
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,770
<i>Going to the outside
as they cross the bricks!</i>

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,766
And it looks like the winner is Turbo!

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,144
Amazing! Unbelievable!

14
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,606
Instant replay. Again, in super slo-mo.

15
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,448
<i>Welcome back, race fans.</i>

16
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>We're here with Indy's brightest new star,
Guy Gagné.</i>

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>Tell us, Guy, what inspired you
to become a race driver?</i>

18
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:06,251
You know, Dan, everybody's got
that one thing that makes them happy.

19
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,588
And for me, it's terrifying,
terrifying blazing speed.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,881
<i>Guy!</i>

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,884
- One at a time, please.
- Theo!

22
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,970
Yes, the handsome fellow in the back.

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,014
What are you doing?

24
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,766
What I've always done.
Stay focused, try to run my race.

25
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,102
That's all any driver can do.
Next question.

26
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,688
Can you please go to sleep?

27
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,273
We've got work tomorrow.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,482
Sleep? Are you kidding me?

29
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,810
It takes hours to come down
after a big race like this.

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,528
Yeah, I bet. Okay.

31
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,574
<i>They are the fuel that keeps me running!</i>

32
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,301
<i>Guy, when you were just a rookie
starting out in the Indy Lights,</i>

33
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,662
<i>did you ever dream
that you'd be standing here today?</i>

34
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,082
<i>Well, as my dear father
always told me,</i>

35
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,295
<i>"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer</i>

36
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,502
<i>- "too small."</i>
- Too small.

37
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,756
Sleep!

38
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,352
Head in the game. Head in the game.

39
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,665
Yes! Seventeen minutes!
That's a new record!

40
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,459
Theo!

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,052
Good morning.

42
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,979
Let's go, people! Pick it up!

43
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,818
Turbo, ready to make his move.

44
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,904
Did you see that? She cut me off!

45
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,990
The joys of racing.

46
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,827
How could anyone not see the appeal
of watching a bunch of cars,

47
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,538
drive around in circles
for hours on end?

48
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,665
Left turn! Left turn! Left turn!

49
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,667
Your ignorance saddens me to no end.

50
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,212
Left turn! "What do I do here?
Oh, no, wait a minute. Left turn!"

51
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,672
Morning, Chet!

52
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,840
How's it going, Sally?

53
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,550
- Morning, Chet.
- Morning, Phil.

54
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,555
Well, that's a shame.

55
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:28,810
And so begins another wonderful
work week at the plant.

56
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,737
All right, people, we got
a lot of tomatoes to harvest today.

57
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:42,157
We got to pick them,
we got to sort them, we got to eat them.

58
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,160
But most importantly, we got to be...

59
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,327
Safe.

60
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,039
Yes! Music to my ears.

61
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,166
Look at her.

62
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,542
Nice curves.

63
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,213
You are one giant, juicy temptress.

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,050
Big Red.

65
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,469
Any day now.

66
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,556
Any day now.

67
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
Overripe!

68
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,228
Overripe!

69
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,813
Overripe!

70
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,277
Oh, no.

71
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,239
Here we go.

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,243
Bring it on.

73
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,958
Not this time.

74
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,364
And the cars are at the starting line.

75
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,972
Gagné's in the top pole position,

76
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,558
driving his trademark
number one overripe tomato.

77
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,061
Next to him
is that feisty young upstart, Turbo.

78
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,398
Gentlemen, start your engines.

79
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,441
Gagné rolls into the lead
around the first turn

80
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,985
with Turbo hot on his tail
into the straightaway.

81
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,071
Hey, there he goes again.

82
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,157
And down the homestretch,
the crowd goes wild!

83
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,283
Go, Turbo!

84
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,453
They're neck and neck!
Gagné, Turbo! Turbo, Gagné!

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,040
- And it looks like the winner is...
- Turbo! Turbo! Turbo!

86
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,709
So close!

87
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,085
It's a photo finish!

88
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,550
Overripe!

89
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,179
All right, all right, knock it off.

90
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,891
Talk to your brother, Chet. Or I will.

91
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,143
I'm on it, Carl.

92
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,978
This will not happen again.

93
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,980
Heard that before.

94
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,481
Okay.

95
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,570
That's lunch!

96
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,171
You do this to yourself, you know.

97
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,716
I mean, look at you.

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,385
How could they not make fun of you?

99
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,721
It's like you're almost forcing them.

100
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,767
If you'd just quit it
with the speed stuff...

101
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,101
I can't help it.

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,728
It's in me.

103
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,271
No. It is not "in" you.

104
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,481
Says who?

105
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,317
Nature. Mother Nature.

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,443
Maybe you've heard of her?

107
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,738
We all have our limitations, Theo.

108
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,910
And the sooner you accept the dull,
miserable reality of your existence,

109
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,287
the happier you'll be.

110
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,458
Wow. Aren't you
just a little ray of sunshine?

111
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,546
Heads up! Shell crusher, two o' clock!

112
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,429
All right, people, you know the drill.

113
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,098
Tuck and roll!

114
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,520
Can't tuck. I can't tuck!

115
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,567
Theo, tuck and roll!

116
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,496
We've been over this.
I don't tuck and roll.

117
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,988
You have a shell for a reason.
Use it.

118
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,490
You use it.

119
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,575
I mean, come on,
he's not even looking this way.

120
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,994
Hey, Juice Box, nice tricycle!

121
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,246
You see what I'm saying?

122
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,169
All right, good hustle.

123
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,296
Good hustle, everybody!

124
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,507
Almost everybody.

125
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,592
Quitting time!

126
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,760
Good night, Jim! Night, Sally!

127
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,367
Night, Steve!
I don't know your name.

128
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,055
I'm out of here! Bye!

129
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,224
<i>You're watching Fast!</i>

130
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,185
<i>Sponsored by Adrenalode!</i>

Adrenalode, not legal in
Utah and South Dakota.

132
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,023
Do not exceed more than two cans

133

Do not expose Adrenalode

Yes!

That tastes awesome.

Oh, my gosh. That's me, that's me.

142
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,004
<i>Well, there comes a time
in every race</i>

143
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>when a driver is forced to make
that one, key, split-second decision.</i>

144
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,136
<i>Fall behind, or push ahead.</i>

145
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,304
Push ahead!

146
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:19,851
<i>To take a chance and risk it all,
or play it safe and suffer defeat.</i>

147
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,186
Risk it all, Guy!

148

<i>But what really separates
the racers from the champions...</i>

149
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,023
Yes!

150
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,903
<i>...that one thing that separates
the ordinary from the extraordinary...</i>

151
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,279
What is it?

152
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,366
<i>That one thing is...</i>

No, you didn't!

No! No! No! No! No!

156

00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,002
I daresay we've had
a breakthrough, here.

164
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,755
With that TV gone,
you can finally get out of that garage

165
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,384
and put all that racing nonsense
behind you.

166
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,719
And do what?

167
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,470
Start living your life.

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,847
I have a life?

169
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,308
Big Red?

170
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,728
Big Red!

171
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,523
I can't tuck. I can't tuck!

172
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,903
- Yes!
- Finally!

173
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,989
All right, let's chow down!

174
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,658
Hit the brakes, people.

175
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,452
It's Gardener Day.

176
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,211
You're quitting? Just like that?

177
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,340
Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

178
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,800
That's a bad thing.

179
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,046
"There comes a time in every race

180
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,813
"when a driver is forced to make
that one, key, split-second decision."

181
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,273
What did he just say?

182
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,070
"Take a chance and risk it all,
or play it safe and suffer defeat."

183
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,865
Okay, enough with the crazy talk, Theo.

184
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,951
Just step away from the grass
and get back to work.

185
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,203
Theo!

186
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,330
And the cars are at the starting line.

187
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,709
Gentlemen, start your engines.

188
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,219
And once again, it's Turbo out front.

189
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,684
No dream is too big.

190
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,731
In the high lane! At the stripe!

191
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,871
And it looks like the winner is...

192
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,834
Tuck and roll, Theo! Tuck and roll!

193
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,507
No!

194
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,115
Are you insane?

195
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,992
You could've gotten yourself killed!

196
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,910
Theo, what were you thinking?

197
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,710
I thought I could get there.

198
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,629
When are you gonna wake up?

199
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,593
I wish...

200
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,596
I wish I was...

201
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,760
That was close.

202
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,238
Oh, no.

203
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,710
Yeah!

204
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,428
No, no, no! Come on! Faster!

205
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,707
No, no, no!

206
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,415
What happened?

207
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,169
Hey, hey, hey! Get out of here!

208
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,254
Not dead! Not dead!

209
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,768
It reeks in here.

210
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,521
It's like wearing a hat
made out of feet.

211
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,323
Home.

212
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,836
All right.

213
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,588
I'm okay.

214
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,388
That's peculiar.

215
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,357
Okay, what's happening to me?

216
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,276
What? That's me!

217
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,696
Come on! Stop it!

218
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,407
Quiet, quiet!

219
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,910
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

220
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,669
Welcome, everyone,
to this monthly safety meeting.

221
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,007
Well, there goes Jerry.

222
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,759
I'm going to
hand things over to Chet, now,

223
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:58,138
who has some important
new policies to go over.

224
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,808
Thank you very much, Carl.
Good afternoon, everyone.

225
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:06,855
I'm happy to "poli-see"
you all here today.

226
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:13,820
Okay. I would like to begin
with some very exciting news.

227
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,405
The latest figures are in.

228
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,783
Accidental smushes were down 15 percent.

229
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,076
Well done, team.

230
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,134
<i>Yo, yo! You're listening to 98.6
where hip-hop... beats.</i>

231
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,705
Finally.

232
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,545
Huh?

233
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,591
What in the...

234
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,281
Help!

235
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,159
Stop! Stop, stop!

236
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,661
Mom!

237
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,205
Yeah!

238
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,793
Oh, no!

239
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:37,255
And so, in preparation for
Crow Awareness Week,

240
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,257
I'd just like to say...

241
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,760
Tuck and roll!

242
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,597
No, I'm not kidding! Tuck and roll!

243
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,308
Look out!

244
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,233
Granted, yes,

245
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,031
I admit that there's been
a wee bit of damage to inventory, here,

246
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,616
but if you'd just let me explain...

247
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,909
You're fired!

248
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,329
Whoa, okay, Carl,
if you just give him one more chance,

249
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,748
I promise that this will never, ever...

250
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,709
You don't understand.
You're fired.

251
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:19,756
"You," plural.
Youse. Y'all. Both of you!

252
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,684
Chet. I'm so sorry.

253
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,436
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean for this to...

254
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,897
All my life.

255
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:41,277
All my life,
I've defended you, covered for you,

256
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:46,449
stood up for you, apologized for you,
and this is what I get in return.

257
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,619
Dragged down with you
on your sinking ship.

258
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,415
A nice, comfy deck chair
on the <i>S.S. Theo!</i>

259
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,208
Aye-aye, Captain!

260
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,292
I'm really sorry.

261
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,128
What is wrong with you?

262
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,463
I don't know.
All I know is, the other night,

263
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,882
I'm standing above the 101,
and all of a sudden...

264
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,968
It was a rhetorical question!

265
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,178
Chet!

266
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,973
Help! The world is moving!

267
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,657
Coming through!

268
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,748
Okay, I'm gonna wake up any minute now.

269
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,166
Wake up! Wake up!

270
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,346
Chet?

271
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,449
Easy now, fellas.
You really don't wanna do this.

272
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,164
Chet!

273
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:45,902
Am I dead? Is this heaven?

274
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,238
I pictured it cleaner.

275
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:49,739
Come on, get up.

276
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,910
Theo. The crows got you, too.

277
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,247
What? No, Chet, it wasn't the crows.
It was...

278
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,417
Look at this place.

279
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,378
- Broken glass, rusty nails.
- Breathe.

280
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,797
- Discarded salt packets!
- A few, yeah.

281
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,174
It's like a minefield out here.

282
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,303
Oh, no.
I've got tetanus. I've got tetanus.

283
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,056
My jaw is locking up.

284
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,436
Chet, will you calm down?
There is no reason to panic.

285
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,356
Everything's gonna be just fine.

286
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,987
Well, well, well.<i>
Buenas noches, </i> little <i>amigos.</i>

287
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,781
This must be my lucky day.

288
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,288
Hola. It's Tito.

289
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,124
Hey, tell everyone I'm bringing it.

290
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,160
What is this place?

291
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,584
Well, well, well.

292
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,421
Somebody better call the cops,
because I'm about to make a killing.

293
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:29,798
Killing?

294
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,342
What'd he drag in this time?

295
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,262
Whiplash is going to eat them up.

296
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,598
It's gonna be a slaughter.

297
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,642
Mm-hmm, dead meat.

298
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,520
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

299
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,974
Come on, come on. Now, hurry up.

300
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:01,413
A little far from home aren't you,
garden snail?

301
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,166
Hey, I think we got a crier here.

302
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,293
Let's do this!

303
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,713
I got this one! Oh, I got this one!

304
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:10,839
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

305
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:11,965
Come on! This is me!

306
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,842
Time to go, Theo.

307
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,719
Ready...

308
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,388
Set...

309
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,561
Go!

310
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,116
Look. He dead.

311
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,577
Taco Man found dead snail.

312
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,376
What?

313
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,489
Run!

314
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,329
Santa Maria!

315
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,456
What did you say your name was again?

316
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,334
My name is Turbo.

317
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,503
I wish I could rename myself.

318
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:32,671
Where did you find him?

319
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,755
How did he do that?

320
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:34,798
Where did you come from?

321
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,675
Hey, how'd you do that?

322
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,259
Theo. A word, please.

323
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,512
Okay, that was...

324
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,763
Amazing, right?

325
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,848
If you think that's something,
check this out.

326
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:44,974
Turn it off!

327
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,352
Sorry. High beams. Sorry.

328
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,104
That's a new one.

329
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:52,315
It's okay, it's okay, Theo.
Just hang in there.

330
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,859
As soon as we get home,
we're gonna get you fixed.

331
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:57,153
What? I don't need to be fixed.

332
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,363
There's nothing wrong with me, Chet.

333
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,117
Nothing wrong with you? Well, you're...

334
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,618
You're a freak of nature.

335
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,578
I know, I know! Isn't it great?

336
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,663
Theo!

337
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,665
You know what? I prefer "Turbo."

338
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,752
I don't know
what crazy lab you escaped from

339
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,548
but you're amazing, Little Amigo.
Amazing!

340
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,757
Tito!

341
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,969
One second, please.

342
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:24,097
Do you see that sign? What does it say?

343
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:25,515
Angelo...

344
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,976
It says, "Dos Bros Tacos."

345
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:30,854
<i>"Dos" </i> Bros, Tito. Not <i>"Uno" </i> Bro.

346
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,648
You're supposed to be out there,
selling tacos,

347
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,066
not racing snails.

348
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,694
I know, but this little guy
is something special.

349
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,070
I'm telling you, Angelo,

350
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,115
the customers are gonna be lining up
around the block.

351
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,867
I can see it already.

352
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:48,955
"Come for the snail racing,
stay for the chimichangas."

353
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:54,919
Get your head out of the clouds, Tito.
It's enough with your crazy schemes.

354
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,505
No! You're a taco genius, Angelo.

355
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:02,260
And it is my mission in life
to share your gift with the world.

356
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,055
Great.
Then first thing in the morning,

357
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:09,517
get in that truck
and go sell some tacos.

358
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,395
Tito.

359
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,238
You sure you had enough to eat?
Are you tired?

360
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,575
Here, I made up your bed.

361
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,579
Now, it might get
a little chilly tonight.

362
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,164
So, I warmed up your blanket.

363
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:36,336
There you go. All comfy and cozy.

364
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:41,299
Sweet dreams, Little Amigo.
I'll see you in the morning.

365
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,553
Did he really just kiss you goodnight?

366
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,639
He did. Jealous?

367
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,104
Question.
What gives with the super-speed?

368
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,647
Hey, hey, you a robot?

369
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:56,981
Are you radioactive, homie?

370
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,274
Is it contagious?

371
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,443
Give the kid some space.

372
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:05,073
I'm Whiplash. And this here is my crew.

373
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,784
I'm Skidmark!

374
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,079
Ah, yeah!

375
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,708
And I'm Burn. Sizzle, sizzle, uh-uh.

376
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,836
The name is Smoove Move.
I set the tone around here, you dig?

377
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,421
Now check this. Right about now,

378
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:23,675
I'm moving so fast, the whole world's
going in slow motion, baby.

379
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,054
Here one second, gone the next.

380
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,265
They call me the White Shadow!

381
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:34,227
Because I'm so fast,
all you see is my shadow.

382
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,146
I don't get it.

383
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,982
I'm fast, like a shadow!

384
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,610
Yeah, but shadows,
they're not inherently fast.

385
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,488
White Shadow...

386
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:46,698
I can still see you.

387
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:50,535
Listen, garden snail, you clearly
got the skills to pay the bills.

388
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,288
If snails had to pay bills, that is.

389
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,956
You would be able to pay them.

390
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,583
Yeah, bills.

391
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,168
Paid in full, son.

392
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:01,963
So, I'm here to invite you
to join our crew.

393
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,674
Join your crew?

394
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,594
Did I say something humorous?

395
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,638
I'm sorry.
It's just that you guys are, you know,

396
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,183
kind of slow-ish.

397
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,143
Really? To our faces?

398
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,145
Theo, what are you doing?

399
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:21,900
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

400
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,402
Heard what? I didn't hear anything.

401
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,279
Nothing out of order, did you, Theo?

402
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:27,489
I meant what I said.

403
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,866
Then you better put your money
where your mouth is.

404
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,284
Snails don't have money.

405
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:34,287
Otherwise, we'd be able to
pay the bills. Remember?

406
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,581
Your trash talk
is needlessly complicated.

407
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:41,294
Is it? Or is it that your unpaid bills
are overdue?

408
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:45,465
Enough talk. It's time for action.

409
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,136
It's simple. First one to the top
of that shooting star

410
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,722
wins.

411
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:56,059
You guys? Way up there, huh? Awesome.

412
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,144
Let me get my calendar
so I can time you.

413
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,021
You got jokes, rookie?

414
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:02,399
Laugh it up, garden snail.

415
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,068
On your mark...

416
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,986
Get yourself set...

417
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,365
Prepare to be White Shadowed!

418
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,077
Whoa!

419
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:16,913
Yeah!

420
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,583
Yeah! Bam!

421
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,003
Coming through!

422
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,754
Those guys are crazy!

423
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,673
Those guys are awesome.

424
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,011
Hey, player! The party up here!

425
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,768
How do I get up there?

426
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,869
Later!

427
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,926
Coming through!

428
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,928
Yeah!

429
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,975
Who's "slow-ish" now, garden snail?

430
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:27,984
Today, everything changes!

431
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,945
Tito, what are you doing?

432
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,989
Planning a "taco-volution"!

433
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:36,826
It's a little concept that I came up with.
When you combine the words...

434
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,746
"Taco" and "revolution." I get it.

435
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,499
But how is that supposed
to help us sell tacos?

436
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:47,003
Patience, bro.
Taco-volutions don't happen in a day.

437
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,806
<i>And next up on our tour
is the L.A. River.</i>

438
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,600
<i>Famous for its appearance...</i>

439
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,939
Get! Get out!

440
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,826
Sorry, Paz. Can you throw that up here?

441
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,495
Coming to getcha! I'm coming to getcha!

442
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:21,663
Bye.

443
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,581
Hey!

444
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,376
Valley Hobby, this is Bobby,
how can I help you?

445
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,714
No, you got the wrong number.
Yeah, okay.

446
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,342
That's what I'm talking about!

447
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,887
You want Jackson Five on your feet?
One Jackson per toe.

448
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,891
Sure, knock yourself out.

449
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,321
Can't get no better.

450
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,940
Okay. So, what's your plan?

451
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:34,235
Stay here in this rundown strip mall?

452
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,780
With a bunch of lunatic snails,

453
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:41,618
and a nutso taco man
who is using you to sell Mexican food?

454
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:46,289
Because if that's your plan,
then whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up!

455
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:50,877
My ears are burning.
I hope you're not talking about me.

456
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:54,422
You two seem to have
a special connection, Little Amigo,

457
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:58,468
and Snail Who Seems To Be
Friends With Little Amigo.

458
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,761
Is this your mother?

459
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,138
Your sister?

460
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:06,976
Say no more. It's your girlfriend.

461
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,107
She's a cutie.

462
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:20,240
Women.

463
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,159
I have to admit,

464
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:26,746
I was kind of hoping the taco-volution
would've started by now.

465
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:34,129
It doesn't make sense.

466
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,756
With my brains and your speed,

467
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,926
we should be destined for greatness,
right?

468
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,971
We need to think big, Little Amigo.

469
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,183
I'm talking commercials,
talk shows, county fairs.

470
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,354
Flea markets.
No, farmer's markets. No, supermarkets.

471
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,440
We'll cover all the markets.

472
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,861
<i>Quinceanéras,</i>
confirmations, graduations.

473
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,697
The Indy 500.

474
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:04,409
I got it.
We can have our very own <i>telenovela!</i>

475
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,161
What? No.

476
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,929
This is it, Chet.
I knew we ended up here for a reason.

477
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,973
Will you just slow down for a second?

478
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:31,227
Slow down? Are you kidding?
I'm never going slow again!

479
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:33,021
Theo, stop.

480
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,524
What are you trying to say?

481
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:39,069
I wanna enter him in the Indy 500.

482
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,863
The Indy 500?
What are you talking about?

483
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,281
What is he talking about?

484
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,034
Now, look,
I know it may sound a little crazy...

485
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,745
No, no, no, Tito,
that doesn't sound crazy.

486
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:52,540
Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi.
That was crazy.

487
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,334
What? People love sushi.

488
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:59,297
Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo.
That was crazy.

489
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,841
The babies were cute.
The adults were just so mean.

490
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:05,553
Taco Man and his sidekick, the Churro.

491
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,931
That was off-the-hook crazy!

492
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,516
Crazy awesome.

493
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:14,604
But this, Tito?
This is in a category all by itself.

494
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:15,939
Angelo, please.

495
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,108
Come on, Chet. Just hear me out.

496
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:22,070
Theo, a snail cannot race
in a competition meant for cars.

497
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,697
There are rules.

498
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,657
Actually,
I've been doing a lot of research,

499
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:28,910
and there's nothing in the rules
that says a snail can't enter the race.

500
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,705
There's nothing that says this sponge
can't enter the race either,

501
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,207
but that doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen.

502
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,543
Millions of people watch that race.

503
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,378
This could put us on the map, bro.

504
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:41,297
- Trying to work, here.
- Come on, Angelo.

505
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,925
All we have to do
is raise the $20,000 registration fee.

506
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,010
What?

507
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,133
- I figured, once we sell the truck...
- Sell the...

508
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,514
Are you even
listening to yourself, Tito?

509
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:54,853
You want to invest
our entire life savings in a snail!

510
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,481
I'm telling you, this snail
crawled into our lives for a reason.

511
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:02,193
I think he could be
our little shooting star.

512
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,529
Did you hear that, Chet?
This guy believes in me.

513
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,698
That guy is as crazy as you are.

514
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,450
They'll never let you into that race.

515
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,119
And even if they did,
you wouldn't survive one lap.

516
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:12,662
- Yeah, but...
- Angelo, listen...

517
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:13,830
- Tito!
- Theo!

518
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,583
Not every dream is meant to come true.

519
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,586
Yeah, what he said.

520
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,091
A snail in the Indy 500.

521
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:28,428
What will you think of next?

522
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:40,523
Don't worry, Little Amigo.
We'll get that entrance fee somehow.

523
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:51,409
Now, I know some people may say
$20,000 sounds like a lot of money.

524
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:52,702
It is a lot of money.

525
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:56,081
And I know some people
may say I'm crazy.

526
00:40:56,247 --> 00:41:00,627
But I say, when a snail crawls
into your life at 200 miles an hour,

527
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,421
then you'd have to be crazy
not to grab onto that shell,

528
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,507
and take a ride of a lifetime.

529
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,927
Now,
in case you're still not convinced...

530
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:12,138
Boom! Check out my well-designed
endorsement poster.

531
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,190
What's your point, Tito?

532
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,945
My point is, we got a chance
to change our lives for the better.

533
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:31,199
To make Starlight Plaza
the great place we all know it could be.

534
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:32,409
Now, come on.

535
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:36,996
Who's ready to sponsor
the next Indy 500 champion?

536
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,170
Sorry, Tito, but I've got work to do.

537
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:48,133
No, you don't. None of you do.

538
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:51,845
I don't get it. That poster was awesome.

539
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:57,100
Well, good try, you did your best.
Time to go home, Theo.

540
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,353
We're going to Indianapolis, Chet.

541
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,440
Don't you worry
your chubby little face about that.

542
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:05,608
All right, team.

543
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,988
Snail up!

544
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:15,035
<i>And next up on our tour
is the L.A. River.</i>

545
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,454
Famous for its appearance
in such movies as...

546
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,873
You've just been White Shadowed!

547
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,252
Next stop is the Starlight Plaza.

548
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:29,632
Yes!

549
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,262
Burn. Let's get this party started.

550
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,764
You know it.

551
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,101
Snailed it.

552
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,936
Skidmark. You bringing the beverages?

553
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:45,690
I got a beverage for you.
And a beverage for you.

554
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,659
Light her up, Turbo.
Do your thing, baby.

555
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,247
Whoa.

556
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:06,044
Hey, Angelo! We got customers.

557
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,337
Whoa!

558
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,720
Okay, you ready?

559
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,098
Go!

560
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:29,109
All right. You're good to go.

561
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,528
Okay, everybody. Back on the bus.

562
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:33,655
Mama, you look good!

563
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:36,783
Bye. Come again.
I do weddings, bar mitzvahs.

564
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,410
Thank you. Come back soon.

565
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,704
Tomorrow, later on today. I'll be here.

566
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:42,539
Good luck with that snail of yours.

567
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,165
Thank you, my friend.

568
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:45,834
I gotta hand it to you, Tito.

569
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:48,712
For once,
one of your crazy schemes worked.

570
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:49,879
I know!

571
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,340
And, hey, if we did better
because of that billboard,

572
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:54,968
just imagine what the Indy 500 could do.

573
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,303
Hey, don't go crazy on me.

574
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,932
We had a good day.
We sold a few extra tacos.

575
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,309
It's good enough.

576
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:23,204
You better not mess this up, Tito.

577
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:26,666
Oh, no.

578
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,919
Oh, yes.
We're going to Indianapolis, Chet!

579
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:34,549
"I" to the "N" to the "Dizzy"
to the "Wizzah." You dig?

580
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,092
Yes, sir.

581
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,054
One breakfast burrito, please.

582
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:48,480
That's it.
I'm sorry, honey. Today is the day.

583
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:56,112
Tito!

584
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:00,992
Are you ready, big man?

585
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,745
On three. One, two...

586
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:07,624
Indy, baby!

587
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,772
I got it!
"Fasty"!

588
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,315
Are you kidding me?

589
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,156
"Turbo"!

590
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,453
All right, as the kids say,
"Time to plump your ride."

591
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:47,664
Heck, no!

592
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,501
Let's do this.

593
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,920
Now, that's more like it.

594
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,851
No twitching. <i>Voilà!</i>

595
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,230
Suited and booted, gooted and looted,
dipped and whipped!

596
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,607
We've got a contender, baby!

597
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,868
Look at him go!

598
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:40,884
Fresh air, baby.

599
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:44,054
We ain't in Van Nuys no more.

600
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:55,774
Hi, Chet.

601
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:57,817
You're gonna be my boyfriend!

602
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,652
I'm gonna call you "boo."

603
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,364
"Boo"? What does that even mean?

604
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,578
Sure beats the view
from the garden, huh?

605
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:13,208
I can't believe you're doing this.

606
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,877
"We." We are doing this.

607
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,546
You. I'm just a hostage.

608
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:25,595
Theo, what happens if you wake up
tomorrow, and your powers are gone?

609
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:29,349
What then?

610
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:34,562
Then I better make the most of today.

611
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,561
This is even bigger than Hobby-Con.

612
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,740
Wow. Now, that's a car.

613
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:29,534
Whoa. Shiny.

614
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:57,854
Gagné.

615
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:23,129
And Guy Gagné wins the pole,

616
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:27,384
with a four-lap average
of 230 miles per hour.

617
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,761
That's Gagné's best time yet.

618
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,013
Turbo has never gone that fast.

619
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,473
I mean, yet.

620
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,227
So, you got a plan, Taco Man?

621
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:39,354
Of course I do.

622
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,858
Please tell me those phony glasses
are not your plan.

623
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,529
No. That would be ridiculous.

624
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,073
Come on, phony glasses, do your thing.

625
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,955
This great.
I'm gonna go have heart attack.

626
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,215
<i>QuГ© Pasa, </i> my friend?

627
00:50:07,882 --> 00:50:11,052
I have a driver that
I'd like to enter into the race.

628
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,138
What team does your driver race for?

629
00:50:13,304 --> 00:50:15,932
Dos Bros Tacos and Company.

630
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:19,769
Has he passed the rookie test?

631
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,482
Hey, come here.
Let's cut to the chase, okay?

632
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:27,360
You have glasses, I have glasses.

633
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:29,612
What do we gotta do
to get this done, bro?

634
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:32,365
Hey, let go. Come on, man, let go!

635
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:36,327
This is no way to treat a guy with glasses.
I have astigmatism and stuff.

636
00:50:36,494 --> 00:50:37,704
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:46,921
Guy, how do you do it, shattering
your own records year after year?

638
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,675
Well,
when a cheetah chases after a gazelle,

639
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:54,220
does he ever stop to think,
"Maybe I've caught enough gazelles.

640
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:57,307
"Maybe I should just settle down,
try the vegan thing."

641
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:00,727
No! He keeps running
as long as his legs will carry him.

642
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,397
I am like the cheetah. I never give up.

643
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,483
Next question.

644
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,988
All right, give me the keys.
I'll drive the first shift home.

645
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:13,907
Whoa!
What gives?

646
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:20,705
No, no, no!

647
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,877
Can I help you, <i>monsieur?</i>

648
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,254
One second, please.

649
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:30,632
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get me arrested?

650
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:36,388
Oh.

651
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,766
Sorry! So sorry.
We'll have this under control...

652
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,601
Ladies and gentlemen!

653
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:46,398
I give you the next Indy 500 champion!

654
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:51,778
Is that a snail?

655
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:55,448
Your driver is a snail?

656
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:04,290
What kind of welcome is that?

657
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:07,627
I'd say an appropriate welcome,
given the situation.

658
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,254
All right. Game over, nut job.

659
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,547
Let's go.

660
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,549
Have a nice flight, Chet.

661
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:14,342
- Hit it!
- White Shadow!

662
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:17,012
<i>Bonzai!</i>

663
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:18,888
Get off!

664
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,181
Pedal to the metal, Turbo.

665
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:22,976
Go!

666
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:26,604
Whoa!

667
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:41,661
Yeah!

668
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:44,748
Whoa! That snail is fast!

669
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,148
What did I miss? What did I miss?

670
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:18,782
226! That's fast enough to qualify!

671
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,663
That's what I'm talking about!

672
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:32,253
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

673
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,298

<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!
What? Are you seeing this?</i>

675
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,560
- Hello?<i>
- Have you heard?</i>

676
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:49,145
Yes, I've heard.

677
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:50,897
<i>That snail is fast.</i>

678
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,733
Forget about it.
This will blow over by noon.

679
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,319
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

680
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:59,114

681
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,157
Yes, I've seen it!

00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:11,167
<i>Snail is fast!</i>

685

<i>You see the snail moving fast
You slow, you gonna get passed</i>

686
00:54:14,337 --> 00:54:16,006
<i>You see him gaining position for first</i>

687
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:17,173
<i>He won't be last</i>

688
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,842
<i>He's ready to make a dash</i>

689
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,593
<i>Snail quicker than a lightning flash</i>

690
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,513
<i>His engine's roaring, he's flooring
He won't run out of gas</i>

691
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,307
<i>Whoa! That snail is fast!</i>

692
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:32,689
Whoa! Are you seeing this?

693
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:33,898
Whoa!

694
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:36,276
<i>You cannot have a snail in the Indy 500.</i>

695
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,319
<i>It's a miracle of nature!</i>

696
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:41,489
<i>Will the snail be crushed
by the giant race cars?</i>

697
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,785
<i>That snail is fast, fast, fast
Fast, fast, fast, fast</i>

698
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:52,542
Whoa. That snail is fast.

699
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:59,007
We've just received word that the CEO
of IndyCar is about to make a statement.

700
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,018
And so,
after careful consideration and...

701
00:55:10,226 --> 00:55:13,188
<i>That snail is fast
That snail is fast</i>

702
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:15,023
Sorry. My bad.

703
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,610
I've decided...

704
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:20,098
Please, say yes. Please, say yes.

705
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,654
Please, say no. Please, say no.

706
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:23,698
White Shadow.

707
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:29,496
I've decided that I simply cannot permit
a snail to enter...

708
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:34,334
Please, sir, give my snail a shot,
and I swear, you won't regret it.

709
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:39,547
Mr. Lopez, while I appreciate
your enthusiasm, my decision is...

710
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,091
Let him race!

711
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:42,592
Let him race!

712
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:44,010
Let him race!

713
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:47,263
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

714
00:55:49,432 --> 00:55:51,976
Now, now. Order.

715
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:53,561
Sir, if I may.

716
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:55,939
You might want to get a two-shot here.

717
00:55:56,106 --> 00:56:01,736
I, like this passionate gentleman here,
came from humble beginnings.

718
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:04,739
In the words of my dear father,

719
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:10,370
"No dream is too big,
and no dreamer, too small."

720
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:12,872
And that is why I, for one,

721
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,377
believe that if the Indy 500
isn't going to put a limit on speed,

722
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:21,131
then it shouldn't put a limit on spirit!

723
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:24,259
Give the people what they want.

724
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:26,011
Let him race!

725
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:30,765
Let him race! Let him race!
Let him race!

726
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:32,225
Just me.

727
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,060
Whole frame, my face.

728
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,773
All right!

729
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:42,777
"All right," what?

730
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:47,282
Your snail can compete
in the Indianapolis 500.

731
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:50,493
Yeah!

732
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:54,039
Has the world lost its mind?

733
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,924
To Turbo!

734
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:07,093
Starlight Plaza! Hey!

735
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,595
He ain't slow no more.

736
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:09,804
That's for sure.

737
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:10,889
Shut the door.

738
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:12,724
Get on the floor.

739
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,726
Barbeque sauce!

740
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,812
<i>And we're back with more
from Indianapolis.</i>

741
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:19,689
Check it out. We're on TV.

742

<i>Mr. Lopez, how do you feel about
getting to compete in the Indy 500?</i>

743
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:25,320
<i>I'm just so happy.</i>

744
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:29,240
<i>And we'd all be happy to see you
come on down to the Starlight Plaza.</i>

749
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:05,860

- No.

751
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,382
Okay, let me know if you need anything.

752

Hey! No touching!

753
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,995
Smooth, smooth, smooth.

754
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:21,334
Sleep tight, Little Amigo.
We got a big day tomorrow.

755
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,295
Yep.

756
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,257
Big day, indeed.

757
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,427
I'm detecting
a refreshing note of disapproval.

758
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:33,638
I'm worried. And you should be, too.

759
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,056
I'll be fine.

760
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,851
You are delusional, you know that?

761
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:41,104
It's Big Red all over again.

762
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:43,982
Only this time,
instead of one lawn mower,

763
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:48,611
it'll be 32 giant, fire-breathing cars!

764
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,489
And I won't be able to save you.

765
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:54,993
You won't have to, because this time,
I have speed.

766
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,288
You're not a car. You're a snail.

767
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:03,001
I got a shot here, Chet.
I can do this. You'll see.

768
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:04,544
No, I won't.

769
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,882
I will not stand by
and watch the only brother I've got

770
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:13,345
risk his life
chasing some impossible dream.

771
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,680
I'm sorry, Theo.

772
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,811
All of these people, they believe in me.

773

Why won't you?

775
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,155
And by the way, my name is Turbo.

01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:02,394
All right. <i>Tout suite, </i> let's go.

2.2-liter turbo V6.

24-valve quad-overhead cam.

No way.

783
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:42,392
You're not trying
to steal my trophy from me, are you?

784
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:49,607
Because if you want one for yourself,
you may have a long wait.

The underdog versus the champion.

788
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:01,786
The world loves the underdogs, you know.

789
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:04,831
The dreamers out there, they need them.

790
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:09,669
Need to believe that one day, maybe
they could achieve the impossible, too.

791
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:17,010
Well, the sad truth is,
underdogs seldom win.

792
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:19,929
And dreamers?

793
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:23,141
Let's just say, eventually,
they have to wake up.

794
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:31,316
I've never talked to a snail before.
So small, so amusing.

795
01:01:31,483 --> 01:01:33,818
No wonder they want to see you race, eh?

796
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:36,529
Vroom! Vroom!

797
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:38,531
Look at him go.

798
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:40,492
Thank you, plucky snail.

799
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:45,497
Because of you,
the whole world will be watching this race.

800
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:50,877
And when the checkered flag drops,
they'll be watching me win.

and aired in 33 different languages,</i>

806
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:18,947
<i>this is no longer just a race,</i>

807
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:22,242
<i>this is the day you'll be telling
your grandchildren about.</i>

808
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:29,249
<i>Where were you the day they let
a snail race in the Indy 500?</i>

809
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,961
Okay, time to go. You ready?

810
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:43,680
All right, team meeting. Bring it in.

811
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:48,143
This is it, Little Amigo.
This is our moment. Our time.

812
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:50,854
Today is the day we make our mark.

813
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,984
Everybody in! It's go time!

814
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,661
Oh, Theo. Be careful out there.

815
01:03:07,662 --> 01:03:09,706
Hey, little snail. Are you lost?

816
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,874
No.

817
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:13,209
Are you a boy, or a girl?

818
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,671
Why is this confusing? I'm not a girl!

819
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:20,925
And there they are, folks.
Some of the biggest names in motorsport.

820
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:24,387
<i>Shelby Stone,
hot off her win in Sao Paulo.</i>

821
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,932
<i>And there's Claudio Cruz,
a.k.a. "The Brazilian Butcher."</i>

822
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:31,102
<i>He actually was a butcher
before he got into race car driving.</i>

823
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:37,067
Gagné! Gagné! Gagné!

824
01:03:37,233 --> 01:03:38,318
Hey!

825
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:42,113
<i>And here he comes, folks,</i>
le <i>man, </i> le <i>myth, </i> le <i>legend...</i>

826
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:46,076
<i>le </i> "if I could choose anybody in the world
to be my best friend it would be..."

827
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:48,036
<i>Guy Gagné!</i>

828
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:52,582
Yes, yes. "GagnГ©, Gagné!"

829
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:05,303
You know, food trucks
are actually very popular these days.

830
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,473
<i>And I tell you what,
I do love a good torta.</i>

831
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:18,942
Yeah!

832
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,445
<i>And would you look at those t-shirts?</i>

833
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:25,865
<i>It is amazing what you can do
on your printer at home.</i>

834
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:30,036
Tito, you better know what you're doing.

835
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:33,665
Here you go, little snail.
Now you've got the best seat in the house.

836
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:41,006
Oh, no. Nope.
This isn't happening.

837
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:42,674
I gotta get out of here.

838
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:45,010
Stay here. I'll be right back.

839
01:04:45,176 --> 01:04:48,346
Help! Let me out. Let me out!

840
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:51,349
Breathe.

841
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,977
<i>Good afternoon and welcome</i>

842
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:58,773
<i>to what has become the most
anticipated and unprecedented</i>

843
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,735
<i>running of the Indianapolis 500.</i>

844
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:04,154
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

845
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:09,284
<i>ladies and gentlemen, and snail,</i>

846
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:12,829
<i>start your engines!</i>

847
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:25,216
It's like an earthquake!

848
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:27,177
I love it. Is it weird that I love it?

849
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,262
Everyone, off the track, please.

850
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,389
See you in the winner's circle,
garden snail.

851
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:33,224
Easy to the peasy, baby.

852
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:36,227
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
We can do this, right?

853
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,731
I wish I was tiny,
so I can give you a hug.

854
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:40,899
Get off the track!

855
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:44,652
Okay, okay, I'm going!
Good luck out there, Turbo!

856
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,008
Did anybody bring earplugs?

857
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:08,218
What?

858
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,512
I can't watch this.

859
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,390
The pace car is off
and the parade laps are underway.

860
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:19,771
<i>Only moments until the green flag drops,
and history is made here at Indianapolis.</i>

861
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:49,342
Let's do this.

862
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,386
<i>And the race is on!</i>

863
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,596
You go, Turbo!

864
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:17,871
<i>Turbo, struggling out there.</i>

865
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:21,082
Looks like the party is over
for the motoring mollusk.

866
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:27,714
He's getting killed out there.

867
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:30,175
What have we done?

868
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,931
Whoa. That snail is history.

869
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:39,476
I think I'm gonna be sick.

870
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,246
Come on, garden snail.
Get your head in the game!

871
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:22,977
Go, go, go!

872
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,400
All right, go, go, go!

873
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,280
Come on!
We're supposed to be a team, here!

874
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:35,407
We're trying.

875
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:38,576
It's a snail.
There's not that much to do.

876
01:08:38,827 --> 01:08:42,539
That's it. This pit crew
is officially under new management.

877
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,085
Now, this is how it's done. Air jack.

878
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,837
Jack-tivate.

879
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,296
- Lube.
- Applied liberally.

880
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,423
Detailing.

881
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:53,049
Wax on, wax off.

882
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,551
- Fuel!
- Down the hatch.

883
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:55,719
Chug! Chug! Chug!

884
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,845
Foot massage.

885
01:08:56,886 --> 01:08:58,221
You know it.

886
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:00,098
Relaxing vibes.

887
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,434
Own it, brother.

888
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,020
Now, de-lax those vibes!

889
01:09:05,228 --> 01:09:06,354
Are you crazy?

890
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,857
Yeah, I'm crazy!
What made you think I was sane?

891
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:10,275
I don't know how to...

892
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,027
- Are you a car?
- No.

893
01:09:12,193 --> 01:09:13,737
Are you a car?

894
01:09:13,778 --> 01:09:14,904
No!

895
01:09:14,946 --> 01:09:17,282
Then stop driving like one!

896
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,785
Now get out there. Snail up, baby!

897
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,912
Go, T-boogie, go!

898
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:30,879
Gagné with a commanding lead now.

899
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:34,632
Followed by Claudio Cruz,
Shelby Stone and Takao Noguchi.

900
01:09:39,095 --> 01:09:41,139
Go!
Come on.

901
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:51,441
Snail up.

902
01:09:57,655 --> 01:09:58,990
Snail up!

903
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,538
Yes!

904
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:09,334
I don't believe it!
Turbo just went under a car!

905
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:11,378
Did you see that?

906
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:22,138
<i>Despite a rocky start,
it looks like Turbo is gaining some ground.</i>

907
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:24,474
Yeah! Now we're talking!

908
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:32,065
Where is he? Where is he?

909
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:49,582
He passed another one!

910
01:10:49,749 --> 01:10:50,959
<i>Yeah!</i>

911
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:54,587
That's my brother, right there.
That's the back of his head!

912
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:10,395
Go, go, go! Left turn! Left turn!

913
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:12,856
Yeah! Left turn!

914
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:30,081
<i>Turbo maneuvers past Shelby Stone
and into second place!</i>

915
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:32,208
He is hot on Gagné's heels!

916
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:34,252
The snail's not going away, Guy.

917
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,963
All right, I know, I know!

918
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:49,059
<i>These racers better watch it
coming into turn four.</i>

919
01:11:49,225 --> 01:11:52,228
This late in the race,
that outside edge is full of marbles.

920
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,814
And you don't want to play
with these marbles, kids.

921
01:11:54,981 --> 01:11:58,693
That rubber peeling off the tires
can be a minefield for these drivers.

922
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,988
Here we go.

923
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:26,930
Turbo!

924
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:29,015
Oh, no.

925
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,522
Oh, man.

926
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:38,650
What are we gonna do? If he takes
another hit like that last one...

927
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:41,736
You gotta pull him, Tito.

928
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:47,867
I'm sorry, Little Amigo. It's over.

929
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,003
Hey.

930
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:02,132
We got this far. It's good enough.

931
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,845
No, it's not.

932
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:13,309
<i>With the green flag about to be waved, it
looks like a mere formality at this point.</i>

933
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:16,771
<i>Gagné, just five laps away from victory.</i>

934
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:20,316
Wait a minute!
Turbo is still in this thing!

935
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:33,496
What?

936
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,332
Whoa! What happened there?

937
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:41,296
Come on, come on!

938
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,220
No!

939
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:50,347
Theo!

940
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,145
No!

941
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:02,108
Not this time. Come on!

942
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,034
Come on, Turbo. Come on, Turbo.

943
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:17,499
Come on,
just hold in there a little longer.

944
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:27,300
No!

945
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:37,936
No!

946
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,898
Farewell, little snail.

947
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:58,415
<i>Unbelievable! Turbo takes the lead.</i>

948
01:14:59,624 --> 01:15:01,251
Snail-style, baby!

949
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:03,420
Bad idea. Bad idea.

950
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:09,426
And the white flag is in the air
as we enter the 200th and final lap.

951
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:12,762
<i>Turbo weaving between lapped cars
like a snail possessed.</i>

952
01:15:12,929 --> 01:15:16,599
<i>He is determined to hold onto his lead.</i>

953
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:28,778
No!

954
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,949
I will not lose to a snail!

955
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,119
Gagné is in the marbles!

956
01:15:38,246 --> 01:15:39,622
Guy, what are you doing?

957
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:02,312
Theo!

958
01:16:07,692 --> 01:16:08,818
Turbo!

959
01:16:10,195 --> 01:16:14,491
<i>The track is backed up
all the way down the front straight.</i>

960
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:17,702
<i>It's complete gridlock down there.</i>

961
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:22,040
I can't see him. I can't see him.

962
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,833
Guy, are you okay?

963
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:30,048
Where am I?

964
01:16:37,847 --> 01:16:38,890
There he is.

965
01:16:38,973 --> 01:16:39,974
Theo.

966
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:41,685
Let's finish this.

967
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,621
Oh, no.

968
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:03,873
Turbo.

969
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:22,392
No, no, no.
Theo, what are you doing? Don't give up.

970
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,073
Hey! Where are you going?

971
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,283
No, no!

972
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:40,285
Get back here! No, wait!

973
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:45,749
No! Little snail!

974
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:47,167
Theo!

975
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,085
Is that Chet?

976
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:59,012
Now, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear
what I clearly just heard.

977
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:04,476
Salt!

978
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,442
Crows? Are you kidding me?

979
01:18:13,526 --> 01:18:15,862
Long time no see, Chet!

980
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:20,867
Hey! Don't test me, crow.

981
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:23,620
White Shadow!

982
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:28,458
Nice moves back there, boo.

983
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,424
Is this really necessary?

984
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:39,052
No, man. But it's fun.

985
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:44,724
Theo!

986
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:47,185
Theo!

987
01:18:56,194 --> 01:18:57,237
Chet?

988
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,697
Finish this!

989
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:01,282
I can't.

990
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:03,660
Oh, yes, you can.

991
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:05,370
You're right, you know.

992
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:09,416
It is in you. It's always been in you.

993
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:14,421
Now, I did not just face
every fear known to snail-kind

994
01:19:14,587 --> 01:19:18,133
to come down here
and watch you hide in your shell.

995
01:19:18,299 --> 01:19:21,469
I'm sitting on a crow,
for crying out loud!

996
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:24,597
Don't even think about it.

997
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:29,686
And my little brother never gives up.

998
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,939
That's the best thing about you.

999
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:37,152
So, you get out there
and you win this...

1000
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,362
Turbo.

1001
01:19:58,173 --> 01:19:59,507
He's still going.

1002
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,144
Son of a gun.

1003
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:26,618
Come on, come on!

1004
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:47,764
Unbelievable! The race is back on!

1005
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,475
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1006
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:53,103
Little Amigo!

1007
01:20:56,606 --> 01:20:59,734
Hey, snail!
He's gradually gaining on you!

1008
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:26,052
Come on! Come on!

1009
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:40,608
Turbo! Tuck and roll!

1010
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,469
And Turbo wins it by a shell!

1011
01:22:07,635 --> 01:22:09,012
That's what I'm talking about!

1012
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:13,558
Chet! Chet!

1013
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:15,101
Turbo!

1014
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:16,353
Chet!

1015
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,772
We won, right? We just won?

1016
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,023
We won.

1017
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:26,363
Hey, everybody!
My brother won the Indy 5,000!

1018
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:29,949
Wow. That's so romantic.

1019
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,578
<i>Hey, Angelo. We did it!</i>

1020
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:36,998
We did it. We did it!

1021
01:22:37,248 --> 01:22:40,377
Free tacos for everybody!

1022
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,380
Snail power, baby!

1023
01:22:47,133 --> 01:22:48,134
Mom.

1024
01:22:48,551 --> 01:22:51,262
Hey, Gagné! Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1025
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,223
- You big bad boy!
- Security!

1026
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:55,225
I step on you! Do you like that?

1027
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,601
- Sleeper hold!
- All right.

1028
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:59,396
Let go of me! I'm just an old lady!

1029
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:03,233
Kim Ly Nail Salon!

1030
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:11,241
That's our snail!

1031
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:18,081
It's like I always said, Little Amigo,
you are amazing!

1032
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,543
Okay, wait.

1033
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,712
Just keep your eyes closed
until I say so, okay?

1034
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:26,089
Tito, this is stupid.

1035
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:27,340
Ta-da!

1036
01:23:27,757 --> 01:23:31,177
<i>Hello, Angelo. Let's get cooking.</i>

1037
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:32,429
Boom!

1038
01:23:33,596 --> 01:23:36,016
The stove talks, bro.

1039
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:39,269
No, honey, soonest available
three months from now, 6:00 AM.

1040
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:42,188
Brenda, that daisy
really brings out your foot!

1041
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:47,777
Hey, I'm not paying you guys
to sit around and look pretty.

1042
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:50,280
Now, that's more like it.

1043
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:51,656
Check it out.

1044
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:52,866
Whoa. This guy is good.

1045
01:23:52,949 --> 01:23:55,618
And last, but not least, Sanitation.

1046
01:23:55,785 --> 01:23:57,787
Nice choice, young man.

1047
01:23:57,954 --> 01:24:01,458
Come on, boys.
It's time to take out the trash.

1048
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,298
Take a look at this place.

1049
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:12,719
Like I said,
your skills have truly paid the bills.

1050
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:14,804
Yeah, bills.

1051
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:25,940
What you saying, bro?

1052
01:24:34,657 --> 01:24:37,619
All racers to the starting line.

1053
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:38,787
Hey, T.

1054
01:24:38,828 --> 01:24:41,790
You gonna be okay
without those fancy magic superpowers?

1055
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:44,501
Sure. It never stopped any of you.

1056
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:51,675
Yeah!

1057
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,970
<i>Qué Pasa, </i> my friend?

1058
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:02,310
You see that? All these people?

1059
01:25:02,477 --> 01:25:06,022
You did that, Little Amigo.
You put this place on the map.

1060
01:25:06,856 --> 01:25:09,818
You really are my little shooting star.

1061
01:25:11,027 --> 01:25:13,113
I almost forgot. I got you something.

1062
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,281
Pam!

1063
01:25:15,448 --> 01:25:17,117
You won't be missing this.

1064
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,869
What? You're all better.

1065
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:25,625
That's nice.

1066
01:25:28,336 --> 01:25:31,339
Okay, listen up. Let's have a
nice, safe race out there today.

1067
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,133
Don't want any accidents.

1068
01:25:33,299 --> 01:25:34,843
That being said,

1069
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,803
blow them off the track, bro.

1070
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:42,058
I love a man in uniform. For real!

1071
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,730
Simmer down, boo. I'm on duty, here.

1072
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:48,064
On your mark.

1073
01:25:48,231 --> 01:25:51,526
All right, so, you got a new shell.

1074
01:25:51,693 --> 01:25:54,154
But can yours do this? Hit it, Burn!

1075
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,381
Get set.

1076
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:22,932
Go.

1077
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:34,277
- Come on! Let's do it!
- Yeah!

1078
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:38,281
Hello!

1079
01:26:47,874 --> 01:26:48,875
Yes, sir.

1080
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:11,272
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

1081
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:25,286
Oh, yeah!

1082
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:40,969
White Shadow!

1083
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,137
I can tuck. I can tuck.

1084
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:26,056
Okay, baby, here we go.

1085
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,974
Come on.

1086
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:34,397
I did it!
I tucked! I tucked!
