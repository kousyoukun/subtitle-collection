( Woman #1) To lose
an 18-year-old brother.

3
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:24,542
He didn't get a chance to graduate
from high school. It was a blow.

4
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,811
It destroyed me.
It made me feel like--

5
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,250
I was afraid
to love anybody.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,620
I was really afraid
to let people get close to me.

7
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,819
I feIt
if I loved somebody,

8
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:40,556
deeply, you know,
like I do my family,

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,996
they would be taken away.

10
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:27,209
( Man ) I said, "Where'd you learn
to do that?"

11
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,973
She said, "Practicing on
an old flame since I was 16."

( Audience Laughs )

13
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,982
Look at this guy here. He's lookin' at
me and beatin' his meat. I like that.

14
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:41,649
There she is. Right?
Miss America, 1912.

15
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,558
lna !
Let's hear it for lna.

16
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,687
Comes here every night,
huh, sweetie?

17
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:49,391
Right.
Let me have a kiss.

- ( Audience Cheers )

19

Let me at him !
Let me at him !

20
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,228
Somebody throw a net
over this broad.

21
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,206
Did you see him kiss
that fat fucker?

22
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,368
( Woman #2 ) Steve.
I'll always know him as 18.

23
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,206
He, uh--

24
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:07,410
He was killed by a drunk driver just
a month before he was to graduate.

25
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,418
And--

26
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:12,478
( Woman #3 ) It's hard when you have
two policemen come in and say,

27
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,819
"Your daughter's dead."

28
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,258
I op-- I opened the door
and I saw 'em standing there,

29
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,762
and I said,
"Mandy's dead, isn't she?"

30
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,730
A mom knows.

31

- ( Men Cheer )
- All right !

32
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:45,210
Freddy, he's comin' over here.
You better slide in... a lot.

33
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:48,587
- He needs half a booth.
- Sunny. How ya doin', Sunny?
Everything good?

34
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,558
( Men Laugh )

35
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,561
How 'bout that?
How'd you like to spank it?

36
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,189
- Nice !
- Oh, yeah ! But softly.

37
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:58,257
- Sunny, you had to spank that, right?
- Nice.

38
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:01,031
My wife,
you know Joan.

39
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,733
We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.

40
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,436
So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,740
She don't wanna walk down
two steps.

42
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:12,441
I still have to get over that.
It's something that...

43
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:16,508
-you have to work with on a daily basis.
-it's not gonna come back.

44
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:21,046
It's just something of-- It's yours.
It's like your body lost...

45
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,854
something inside,
something ofyourself.

46
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,623
I miss me.

47
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:30,132
I miss... me.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,294
It's over five years now,
and...

49
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,830
I look in the mirror,
"Where's Bobby?"

50
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,465
I don't know.

51
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,807
My family drives me
up the fuckin' wall.

52
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,543
I mean, they, I guess they still,
they still think I'm me, Bobby.

53
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:52,020
But... they joke about it.

54
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,991
They call me...
sibling number three, all right?

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,088
And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

56
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,725
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.

57
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:09,704
And...

58
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,641
he was sibling number one.

59
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,645
And...

60
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:21,081
they, th-they didn't--

61
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,711
Did they forget?
I don't know.

62
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,381
I'm gone !

63

( Chuckles )
And--

64

65
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,428
So...

66
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:42,266

display of gray feIt. What's goin' on?

98
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:23,218
Mr. Gale, you took all the vauIt keys
home last night.

99
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:26,744
- For fuck sakes.
- I think...

100
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:29,485
it would be wonderful to put emerald
pieces in front of the diamonds.

I trust your preference
in stones, Jefferey, but...

get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

159
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:38,176
( Boys Chatting, Keys Jingling )

160
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,279
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:45,926
- ( Boys Chatting )
- ( Mary ) Hold on, guys.

162
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,620
Hold on.

163
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,722
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Dad !
- Hi, guys.

164
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,199
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.

165
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,329
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.

166
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,445
Well...

167
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,680
look at this.

168
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:14,488
My own kids
call me Freddy.

169
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,324
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think,
would be pushing it.

170
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,993
No, you do.
You look wonderful.

171
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,836
Thank you.

172
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:35,207
So, how's business?

173
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,837
So-so.

174
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

175
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,479
It's business.

176
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

177
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

178
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,953
I'm still representing
some properties.

179
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:58,125
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.

180
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh, well, wonderful.

181
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:07,175
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.

182
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,939
Um--

183
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,980
Um...

184
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

185
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:21,654
It's the reason
I came here.

186
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,557
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

187
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

188
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:34,166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

189
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:38,696
And I have great news.
That's two.

190
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

191
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

192
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,709
( Sighs, Muttering )

193
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

194
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,382
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

196
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

197
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,266
He's out.

198
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:09,270
John Booth is out.

199
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,272
I'm gonna kill him.

200
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,205
Get out of here, Freddy.

201
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

202
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

203
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

204
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,349
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

205
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

206
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,849
I must never mention
my daughter !

207
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:34,191
- Get out of our house !
- This is my house.

208
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,596
By any natural law,
this is my house !

209
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,193
If my children live here,
my children,

210
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

211
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you !

212
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

213
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,343
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.

214
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

215
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,420
Yes, Emily. Emily !
And she is dead.

216
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

217
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't !

218
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,527
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--

219
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:18,039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth !
- Let go of him !

220
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened !

221
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,646
- Let go of him !
- Freddy !

222
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:29,172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

223
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,049
Come on.

224
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,147
Coffee. Good.

225
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:37,385
I'd like some coffee.

226
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:42,419
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

227
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,262
Come on.

228
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,929
( Sighs )
You know what?

229
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,867
I don't want any coffee.
I--

230
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,877
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )

231
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

232
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,183
You sure?

233
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:10,453
Yes. Uh... no.

234
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,756
I'm gonna go.

235
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,922
I feel good.

236
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:24,862
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.

237
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,875
I just want to say this.

238
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

239
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,043
A lot of things.

240
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:37,575
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

241
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:41,089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

242
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:45,354
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong !

243
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you !

244
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:52,228
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

245
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

246
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

247
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,499
no matter what you do !

248
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,603
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

249
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,807
Why?

250
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

251
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,816
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

252
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

253
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

254
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

255
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:28,432
What color is it?

256
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

257
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:34,968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

258
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,484
That's what I thought.

259
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:50,752
Roger, man to man,

260
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,192
when you two read
in the newspaper...

261
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

262
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:01,869
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

263
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

264

## ( Whistling )

265
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:39,271
## ( Whistling Continues )

266
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,370
( Man ) So, listen to me.

267
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

268
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

269
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

270
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,575
So, I told 'em.

271
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:24,847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

272
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )

273
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,126
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?

274
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

275
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

276
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy !

277
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:48,208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

278
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:51,768
( Men Laughing )

279
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

280
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:59,485
over a period of days?

281
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

282
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:06,150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

283
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:09,026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

284
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

285
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,130
Enjoyed it...

286
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:22,600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

287
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:27,172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.

288
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,945
Take my advice, Freddy.

289
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:32,919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

290

( Men Laughing )

291
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

292
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:50,366
Freddy, where you goin' ?
It's only 11:00.

293
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,202
Oh, man.

294
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,208
Commitments.

295
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner ! ( Laughing )

00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

310
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,922
When the thing happened,

311
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,554
I wanted to be dead.

312
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,427
But there wasn't--
You know.

313
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,837
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

314
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

315
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,449
But...

316
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,527
I guess you, uh...

317
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:11,055
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

318
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,896
It's all right.
Sit down.

319
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,374
Sit down.

320
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,073
I know it's been
a long wait.

321
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:28,274
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

322
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm not callin' any cops.

323
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:39,322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

324
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,030
Would you maybe,
you know--

325
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,939
Would you take
a couple days...

326
00:30:57,012 --> 00:31:00,038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

327
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,084
Look.

328
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:07,884
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

329
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:12,484
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

330
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,358
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

331
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,890
Shut up ! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't !

332
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,294
All right.

333
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:44,219
I'm gonna give you
three days.

334
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,351
Three days.

335
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

336
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,429
Son of a bitch !

337
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:01,632
( Speaking Spanish )

338
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,372
( Woman On TV ) And up. Let's go !

339
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

340
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:11,815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

341
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,014
Front and back.
And step.

342
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

343
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,661
Don't you understand?

344
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:34,868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

345
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,968
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

346
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,775
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

347
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:43,045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

348
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

349
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

350
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

351
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

352
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:58,458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

353
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:03,766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

354
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

355
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:09,207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

356
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:12,804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

357
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:16,044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

358
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:22,021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

359
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,191
Ahh.

360
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

361
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,990
A perfect fucking seven.

362
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:55,780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

363
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,692
Pardon?

364
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:05,324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

365
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:12,036
I don't know.

366
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

367
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,903
I don't know.

368
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

369
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:35,185
My sister has a car.

370
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,027
A Valiant.

371
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,629
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.

372
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

373
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:58,251
I ride the bus
all day long.

374
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:01,447
( Laughing )

375
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,218
I have
a disability card...

376
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,624
so I don't have to pay.

377
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:09,288
( Laughing )

378
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,033
( Girl ) Daddy !

379
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:14,557
( Phone Rings )

380
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,398
Hello.
Mary Manning.

381
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,265
Hello?

382
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:34,143
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey ! Get in the car.

383
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,116
Okay, we're late.

384
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:39,119
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

385
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,155
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

386
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

387
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

388
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,888
- A party?
- Girls.

389
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:53,525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--

390
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,535
- ln the joint,
- Yeah?

391
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:58,731
did you get
butt-fucked?

392
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,206
It only hurts
the first time.

393
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,572
I know.

394
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:09,376
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

395
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,318
# I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #

396
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:17,449
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

397
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:21,427
- # I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #
- Yee-hoo !

398
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:25,432
# I will die before my time
But then my kind always do #

399
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,733
# I will die before my time
I will die ##

400
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:35,037
- ( Laughing )
- ( Sunny ) Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

401
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,977
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...

402
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna !

403
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,249
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

404
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's !

405
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,911
- I didn't know. Is she goin' ?
- Of course she's goin'.

406
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

407
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

408
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

409
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

410
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

411
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,338
( Woman ) Hey !

412
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,345
The train's
a-movin' on.

413
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,177
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

414
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:19,379
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

415
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:22,184
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...

416
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:26,386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

417
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,395
That's your spirituality.

418
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:31,990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

419
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:35,058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

420
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:38,503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

421
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:43,476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

422
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:47,139
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

423
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,149
you don't give it to them.

424
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

425
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

426
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,587
Okay. Well--
( Laughing )

427
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,990
## ( Jazz )

428
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,054
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?

429
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,760
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

430
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,496
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

431
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,903
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

432
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,340
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half--

433
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,775
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

434
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,178
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

435
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,240
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.

436
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,309
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.

437
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:28,116
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.

438
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,919
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.
- ( Girls Giggling )

439
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,018
# Can't last #

440
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:38,361
# Any time
Any place #

441
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:43,426
This-- This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?

442
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:46,302
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.

443
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:49,969
- We can see the bar really good.
- ( Laughing )

444
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:53,411
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.

445
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,949
After years of bullshit,

446
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,578
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.

447
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:01,884
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around...

448
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:04,220
on a,
on a piece of canvass--

449
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,953
- Paper.
- Paper.

450
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:09,292
You were trying
to represent God.

451
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:14,130
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

452
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,466
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

453
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,904
She looks for God
and she finds,

454
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:22,875
she finds herself.

455
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:26,038
( Laughing )

456
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,181
( Laughing Continues )

457
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:37,418
Whoo !

458
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:40,688
( Verna ) Ate all the clams

( Laughing, Cheering, Hooting )

772
01:12:41,503 --> 01:12:44,336
Go for it !
Go for it !

773
01:12:48,543 --> 01:12:53,276
( Audience Hooting, Laughing )

774
01:12:57,385 --> 01:13:01,481
# If you eat too much
Oh, oh #

775
01:13:01,556 --> 01:13:04,719
# You'll awake
with a tummy ache #

776
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:09,457
# On the good ship Lollipop
It's a nice trip ##

777
01:13:09,531 --> 01:13:11,522
( Laughing, Shouting )

778
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,763
Whoo !
Freddy, come on !

779

( Dog Barking )

780
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:37,923
- Mmm.
- ( Giggling )

781
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:40,826
You tickled me !
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.

782
01:13:40,895 --> 01:13:43,693
I really wanna fuck you.
Stop !

783
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:46,666
First I gotta play you
this song I wrote. Okay?

784
01:13:46,735 --> 01:13:48,726
Song?

785
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:50,862
Gimme that bottle.

786
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:52,930
Oh.

787
01:13:56,344 --> 01:14:01,338
Okay. I hope you like this
'cause I wrote this just for you.

788
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:04,943
Don't let me go to sleep.
I got business tonight.

# Four little ducks went out one day #

to make me a copy, ahh #

I won't ask why #

( Phone Ringing )

810
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,239
( Coughs )

811
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:42,743
- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.

812
01:16:42,811 --> 01:16:46,838
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.

813
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:50,715
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need--

814
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:57,784
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.

815
01:16:57,859 --> 01:17:02,421
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.

816
01:17:02,497 --> 01:17:04,055
What?

817
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:07,590
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,

818
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:12,333
it feels real big
like it's driving me.

819
01:17:15,977 --> 01:17:20,505
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.

820
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:25,916
And there's a crosswalk.
( Breathes Deeply )

821
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:32,091
And all these little kids
are being...

822
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,926
h-helped across
by a crossing guard.

823
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:40,193
The crossing guard
is John Booth.

824
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:45,739
Em's one
of the little kids.

825
01:17:50,745 --> 01:17:55,808
I'm gettin'...
closer and closer.

826
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:59,320
And I'm...
I'm hittin' the brakes.

827
01:17:59,387 --> 01:18:01,617
The car won't slow down.

828
01:18:01,689 --> 01:18:06,683
( Sobbing ) I'm turning the wheel...
but the car won't turn.

829
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:09,525
Oh, Freddy.

830
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,298
Freddy.

831
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:18,806
Then I just plow
right through... through 'em.

832
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,573
Then I--

833
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:27,206
Then I see Em's face...

834
01:18:27,282 --> 01:18:30,217
just, just before...

835
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:32,412
just before I hit her.

836
01:18:32,487 --> 01:18:36,947
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.

837
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:40,517
( Whispering )
Come on. Come on.

838
01:18:42,063 --> 01:18:44,588
Come on.

839
01:18:51,739 --> 01:18:54,173
( Dog Barking )

840
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:26,563
Two coffees.

841
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:28,871
Sit there.

842
01:19:37,218 --> 01:19:39,152
( Sighs )

843
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:42,280
Oh, Freddy.

844
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:51,264
( Sighs )
Mary, I--

845
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:55,132
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.

846
01:19:57,372 --> 01:20:02,105
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.

847
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:08,509
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

848
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:15,786
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

849
01:20:15,857 --> 01:20:18,087
I did see you...

850
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,059
( Sighs )

851
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:23,825
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

852
01:20:29,003 --> 01:20:32,871
I can see
you're a good man.

853
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,808
And you loved her
so, so much.

854
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:40,974
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

855
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:44,382
I needed you so badly.

856
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:49,955
But you--

857
01:21:00,334 --> 01:21:05,601
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,

858
01:21:05,673 --> 01:21:09,109
and the wind, God--
( Sighs )

859
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:12,078
The plane was bouncing
all around.

860
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:16,275
I thought--

861
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:19,444
I was shaking.

862
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,080
Do you remember
what you said?

863
01:21:25,326 --> 01:21:26,918
No.

864
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:31,131
Uh, tell me.

865
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,066
- ( Waitress ) Anything else?
- No, thanks.

866
01:21:34,135 --> 01:21:37,298
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

867
01:21:37,371 --> 01:21:40,534
And you took my hand
and you said-- Do you remember?

868
01:21:41,576 --> 01:21:44,602
No, no.
Tell me.

869
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,975
You said,
"Pray we crash.

870
01:21:50,051 --> 01:21:53,487
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."

871
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:55,613
( Chuckles )

872
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:00,719
You were so--
( Sighs )

873
01:22:02,296 --> 01:22:04,890
Where'd that guy go?

874
01:22:10,037 --> 01:22:12,369
Then Emmy died.

875
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:19,775
It's--

876
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:22,475
It's made you so small
and weak.

877
01:22:26,654 --> 01:22:30,522
I needed you
to be big and strong.

878
01:22:32,693 --> 01:22:34,752
I hated you
for your weakness.

879
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:37,161
I hated you.

880
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:43,170
Now I'm pitying you.

881
01:22:46,474 --> 01:22:50,205
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

882
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:59,715
( Chuckles )

883
01:22:59,787 --> 01:23:03,883
You look around...

884
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:07,655
at the marriages
people have.

885
01:23:07,728 --> 01:23:11,164
We had a good one,
didn't we?

886
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,568
Yes.

887
01:23:14,635 --> 01:23:17,229
Good times.

888
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:19,967
No hidden agendas.

889
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:25,813
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

890
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:31,308
( Sighs )
We were turned on.

891
01:23:31,385 --> 01:23:34,218
We were hot
for one another.

892
01:23:36,757 --> 01:23:41,387
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

893
01:23:41,462 --> 01:23:43,327
Best buddies.

894
01:23:49,103 --> 01:23:52,937
( Sighs ) Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

895
01:23:53,007 --> 01:23:56,204
No.

896
01:23:56,277 --> 01:23:58,472
No.

897
01:24:01,048 --> 01:24:05,451
( Chuckles )

898
01:24:05,519 --> 01:24:07,749
No, but...

899
01:24:15,763 --> 01:24:17,788
you pity me.

900
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:21,601
( Chuckles )

901
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:27,469
( Sighs )
You pity me.

902
01:24:37,184 --> 01:24:39,982
Oh, boy, this is a--

903
01:24:40,054 --> 01:24:43,455
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this--

904
01:24:43,524 --> 01:24:46,960
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

905
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:50,088
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."

906
01:24:51,499 --> 01:24:53,967
I hope you die.

907
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:58,233
I hope you fucking die.

908
01:25:21,595 --> 01:25:23,586
Come on ! Come on !

909
01:25:23,664 --> 01:25:25,859
Come on !
Come on !

910
01:25:25,933 --> 01:25:29,699
( Tires Screeching )

911
01:25:49,323 --> 01:25:52,884
( Siren Wailing )

912
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,863
( Policeman ) Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

913
01:26:05,673 --> 01:26:10,201
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

914
01:26:10,277 --> 01:26:12,575
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

915
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:15,342
Step back here.

916
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:19,517
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

917
01:26:19,587 --> 01:26:22,385
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

918
01:26:22,456 --> 01:26:24,617
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

919
01:26:24,692 --> 01:26:26,557
No.

920
01:26:26,627 --> 01:26:28,857
Spread your feet for me.

921
01:26:28,929 --> 01:26:32,228
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

922
01:26:32,299 --> 01:26:34,290
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

923
01:26:34,368 --> 01:26:37,496
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

924
01:26:37,571 --> 01:26:41,029
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

925
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:44,134
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

926
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:46,509
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

927
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,980
( Policeman ) Put your hands down
for me.

928
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:52,918
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

929
01:26:52,987 --> 01:26:55,080
It's loaded?
Okay.

930
01:26:55,156 --> 01:26:57,556
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

931
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:00,788
Yes, sir.

932
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:02,226
Here,
just hand it to me.

933
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:04,821
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so--

934
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:08,232
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.

935
01:27:08,302 --> 01:27:10,293
Have you had anything
to drink?

936
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:14,933
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

937
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:17,375
All right.

938
01:27:17,445 --> 01:27:21,142
We're gonna conduct a few tests
to see how much your ability
to operate a motor vehicle...

939
01:27:21,215 --> 01:27:23,308
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.

940
01:27:23,384 --> 01:27:26,478
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.

941
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:31,116
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

942
01:27:31,192 --> 01:27:34,423
Okay, I want you to tiIt
your head back and close your eyes.

943
01:27:34,495 --> 01:27:39,159
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

944
01:27:39,233 --> 01:27:41,463
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.

945
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:45,437
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

946
01:27:45,506 --> 01:27:48,202
Let's do
the left finger again.

947
01:27:48,275 --> 01:27:50,835
- Okay, sir. Put your hands
down at your side.
- Permit's good.

948
01:27:50,911 --> 01:27:53,072
The permit's good?
Okay.

949
01:27:53,147 --> 01:27:55,547
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.

950
01:27:57,852 --> 01:28:01,481
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.

951
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:05,753
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.

952
01:28:05,826 --> 01:28:07,794
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

953
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:11,559
When you get down here, I want
you to turn around and take ten
steps back. You understand?

954
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:14,192
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

955
01:28:14,268 --> 01:28:17,601
One, two, three,

956
01:28:17,671 --> 01:28:22,301
four, five, six,

957
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:26,278
seven, eight, nine, ten.

958
01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:29,407
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

959
01:28:29,483 --> 01:28:31,849
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,

960
01:28:31,919 --> 01:28:33,944
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.

961
01:28:34,021 --> 01:28:37,787
So, turn around, put your hands
behind your back. You're
under arrest for drunk driving.

962
01:28:37,858 --> 01:28:40,292
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

963
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:44,794
Freeze ! Stop !
Jesus.

964
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:47,325
Show us in foot pursuit.

965
01:28:47,401 --> 01:28:49,926
( Policewoman ) 14-0-9. We're in
foot pursuit. Man with a gun.

966

Southbound on lnglewood from the 90
freeway. Request an air unit.

967
01:28:56,977 --> 01:28:59,741

( Grunting )

971
01:29:46,627 --> 01:29:49,391
- Police officers, sir. Police !
- ( Man ) What's going on?

972
01:29:49,463 --> 01:29:52,660
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?

973
01:29:52,733 --> 01:29:54,792
( Man ) I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.

974
01:29:54,868 --> 01:29:58,770
- ( Policewoman )
Hey, the back door's open.
- ( Man ) I got kids here.

975
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:05,970
( Policeman ) Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.

976
01:30:06,046 --> 01:30:08,344
Just stay with us.

( Footsteps, Door Opens )

978

Honey, you all right?

979
01:30:23,497 --> 01:30:27,092
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?

980
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:30,398
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.

981
01:30:30,471 --> 01:30:33,872
( Policeman ) We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.

982
01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:37,877
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.

983
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,214
Good night, sweetheart.

984
01:31:09,843 --> 01:31:13,074

Gonna give you a laugh,
kid.

992
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:35,413
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

993
01:33:35,489 --> 01:33:38,185
The whole bit.

994
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:44,257
You wanna guess
what for?

995
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:50,568
Drunk driving.
( Chuckles )

996
01:33:52,372 --> 01:33:56,001
Drunk driving.

997
01:33:56,076 --> 01:33:58,806
And I had my gun.

998
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:08,653
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...

999
01:34:08,722 --> 01:34:10,690
I'm on the run,

1000
01:34:10,757 --> 01:34:13,988
I'm on your property
and I got my gun.

1001
01:34:15,629 --> 01:34:19,895
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

1002
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:27,469
So, I'm gonna--

1003
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:32,740
I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.

1004
01:34:43,056 --> 01:34:45,149
And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.

1005
01:35:11,618 --> 01:35:13,813
Huh?

1006

Hey !

01:37:03,997 --> 01:37:05,931
( Woman ) This just isn't working
for you out here.

1012
01:37:05,999 --> 01:37:08,399
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

1013
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:11,494
- ( Man ) I don't understand.
- ( Woman ) What don't you understand?

1014
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:14,335
I come out here. I see you
don't have a cent to your name.
I wanna know what you're doing.

1015
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:17,275
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

1016
01:37:17,344 --> 01:37:20,438
( Man ) I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?

1017
01:37:20,514 --> 01:37:22,641
( Man ) If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

1018
01:37:28,722 --> 01:37:32,715
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.

1019
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:36,456
- ( Woman ) I don't understand
what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.

1020
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,794
- ( Woman ) I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

1021
01:37:38,865 --> 01:37:40,833
- ( Woman ) Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

1022
01:37:40,901 --> 01:37:44,962
( Woman ) Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

1023
01:37:45,038 --> 01:37:48,235
( Woman ) It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

1024
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:50,970
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

1025
01:37:51,044 --> 01:37:54,013
- lf it's gonna be this major thing--
- It is a major thing.

1026
01:37:54,081 --> 01:37:58,882
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?

1027
01:37:58,952 --> 01:38:01,216
( Woman ) That's easy.
That's what you always do.

1028
01:38:01,288 --> 01:38:03,984
Not right now.
That's it?

1029
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,024
- Whatever, okay?
I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?

1030
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,034
You don't listen.

1031
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:18,902
- ( Woman ) I don't listen?
- What am I doing? I have a job.

1032
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:21,463
( Man ) And I'm working.
I'm working for, you know.

1033
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:26,205
- ( Woman ) For what?
- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.

1034
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:29,976
( Man ) So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

1035
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:34,214
I think that your standards are like,
like so high. So I don't have a car !

1036
01:38:34,287 --> 01:38:37,154
- ( Woman ) What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?

1037
01:38:37,224 --> 01:38:39,818
- It's telemarketing.
What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?

1038
01:38:39,893 --> 01:38:42,418
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.
