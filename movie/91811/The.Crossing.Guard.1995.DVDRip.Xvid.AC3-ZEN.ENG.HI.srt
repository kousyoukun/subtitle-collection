( Woman #1) To lose
an 18-year-old brother.

He didn't get a chance to graduate
from high school. It was a blow.

3
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,811

to love anybody.

My wife,

38
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,733
We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.

39
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,436
So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.

40

She don't wanna walk down
two steps.

41

It's something that...

-you have to work with on a daily basis.
-it's not gonna come back.

It's over five years now,
and...

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,830
I look in the mirror,

50

up the fuckin' wall.

They call me...

54

And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

55
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,725
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.

( Boys Chatting, Keys Jingling )

159
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,279
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:45,926
- ( Boys Chatting )
- ( Mary ) Hold on, guys.

161
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,620
Hold on.

162
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,722
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Dad!
- Hi, guys.

163
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,199
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.

164
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,329
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.

165
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,445
Well...

166
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,680
look at this.

167
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:14,488
My own kids
call me Freddy.

168
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,324
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think,
would be pushing it.

169
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,993
No, you do.
You look wonderful.

170
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,836
Thank you.

171
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:35,207
So, how's business?

172
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,837
So-so.

173
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

174
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,479
It's business.

175
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

176
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

177
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,953
I'm still representing
some properties.

178
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:58,125
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.

179
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh, well, wonderful.

180
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:07,175
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.

181
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,939
Um--

182
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,980
Um...

183
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

184
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:21,654
It's the reason
I came here.

185
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,557
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

186
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

187
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:34,166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

188
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:38,696
And I have great news.
That's two.

189
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

190
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

191
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,709
( Sighs, Muttering )

192
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

193
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,382
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

195
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

196
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,266
He's out.

197
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:09,270
John Booth is out.

198
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,272
I'm gonna kill him.

199
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,205
Get out of here, Freddy.

200
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

201
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

202
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

203
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,349
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

204
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

205
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,849
I must never mention
my daughter!

206
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:34,191
- Get out of our house!
- This is my house.

207
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,596
By any natural law,
this is my house!

208
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,193
If my children live here,
my children,

209
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

210
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you!

211
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

212
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,343
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.

213
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

214
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,420
Yes, Emily. Emily!
And she is dead.

215
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

216
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't!

217
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,527
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--

218
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:18,039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth!
- Let go of him!

219
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened!

220
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,646
- Let go of him!
- Freddy!

221
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:29,172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

222
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,049
Come on.

223
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,147
Coffee. Good.

224
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:37,385
I'd like some coffee.

225
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:42,419
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

226
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,262
Come on.

227
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,929
( Sighs )
You know what?

228
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,867
I don't want any coffee.
I--

229
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,877
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )

230
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

231
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,183
You sure?

232
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:10,453
Yes. Uh... no.

233
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,756
I'm gonna go.

234
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,922
I feel good.

235
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:24,862
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.

236
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,875
I just want to say this.

237
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

238
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,043
A lot of things.

239
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:37,575
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

240
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:41,089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

241
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:45,354
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong!

242
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you!

243
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:52,228
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

244
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

245
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

246
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,499
no matter what you do!

247
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,603
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

248
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,807
Why?

249
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

250
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,816
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

251
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

252
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

253
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

254
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:28,432
What color is it?

255
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

256
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:34,968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

257
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,484
That's what I thought.

258
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:50,752
Roger, man to man,

259
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,192
when you two read
in the newspaper...

260
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

261
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:01,869
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

262
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

263
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:27,152
## ( Whistling )

264
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:39,271
## ( Whistling Continues )

265
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,370
( Man ) So, listen to me.

266
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

267
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

268
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

269
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,575
So, I told 'em.

270
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:24,847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

271
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )

272
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,126
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?

273
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

274
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

275
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy!

276
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:48,208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

277
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:51,768
( Men Laughing )

278
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

279
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:59,485
over a period of days?

280
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

281
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:06,150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

282
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:09,026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

283
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

284
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,130
Enjoyed it...

285
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:22,600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

286
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:27,172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.

287
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,945
Take my advice, Freddy.

288
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:32,919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

289
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:36,480
( Men Laughing )

290
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

291
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:50,366
Freddy, where you goin'?
It's only 11:00.

292
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,202
Oh, man.

293
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,208
Commitments.

294
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner! ( Laughing )

Fuckin'--
Fuckin' clip is empty.

This fuckin' gun ain't got
no fuckin' clip. You cock.

304
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:39,106
All right
I get a cigarette?

305
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,111
All right.

306
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,893
You know--

307
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:04,629
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

308
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,554
I wanted to be dead.

311
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,427
But there wasn't--
You know.

312
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,837
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

313
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

314
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,449
But...

315
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,527
I guess you, uh...

316
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:11,055
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

317
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,896
It's all right.
Sit down.

318
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,374
Sit down.

319
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,073
I know it's been
a long wait.

320
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:28,274
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

321
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm not callin' any cops.

322
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:39,322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

323
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,030
Would you maybe,
you know--

324
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,939
Would you take
a couple days...

325
00:30:57,012 --> 00:31:00,038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

326
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,084
Look.

327
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:07,884
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

328
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:12,484
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

329
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,358
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

330
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,890
Shut up! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't!

331
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,294
All right.

332
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:44,219
I'm gonna give you
three days.

333
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,351
Three days.

334
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

335
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,429
Son of a bitch!

336
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:01,632
( Speaking Spanish )

337
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,372
( Woman On TV ) And up. Let's go!

338
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

339
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:11,815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

340
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,014
Front and back.
And step.

341
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

342
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,661
Don't you understand?

343
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:34,868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

344
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,968
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

345
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,775
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

346
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:43,045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

347
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

348
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

349
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

350
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

351
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:58,458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

352
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:03,766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

353
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

354
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:09,207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

355
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:12,804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

356
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:16,044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

357
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:22,021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

358
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,191
Ahh.

359
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

360
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,990
A perfect fucking seven.

361
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:55,780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

362
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,692
Pardon?

363
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:05,324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

364
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:12,036
I don't know.

365
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

366
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,903
I don't know.

367
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

368
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:35,185
My sister has a car.

369
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,027
A Valiant.

370
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,629
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.

371
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

372
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:58,251
I ride the bus
all day long.

373
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:01,447
( Laughing )

374
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,218
I have
a disability card...

375
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,624
so I don't have to pay.

376
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:09,288
( Laughing )

377
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,033
( Girl ) Daddy!

378
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:14,557
( Phone Rings )

379
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,398
Hello.
Mary Manning.

380
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,265
Hello?

381
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:34,143
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey! Get in the car.

382
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,116
Okay, we're late.

383
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:39,119
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

384
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,155
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

385
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

386
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

387
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,888
- A party?
- Girls.

388
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:53,525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--

389
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,535
- ln the joint,
- Yeah?

390
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:58,731
did you get
butt-fucked?

391
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,206
It only hurts
the first time.

392
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,572
I know.

393
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:09,376
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

394
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,318
# I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #

395
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:17,449
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

396
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:21,427
- # I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #
- Yee-hoo!

397
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:25,432
# I will die before my time
But then my kind always do #

398
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,733
# I will die before my time
I will die ##

399
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:35,037
- ( Laughing )
- ( Sunny ) Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

400
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,977
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...

401
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna!

402
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,249
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

403
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's!

404
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,911
- I didn't know. Is she goin'?
- Of course she's goin'.

405
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

406
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

407
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

408
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

409
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

410
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,338
( Woman ) Hey!

411
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,345
The train's
a-movin' on.

412
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,177
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

413
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:19,379
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

414
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:22,184
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...

415
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:26,386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

416
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,395
That's your spirituality.

417
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:31,990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

418
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:35,058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

419
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:38,503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

420
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:43,476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

421
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:47,139
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

422
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,149
you don't give it to them.

423
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

424
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

425
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,587
Okay. Well--
( Laughing )

426
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,990
## ( Jazz )

427
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,054
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?

428
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,760
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

429
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,496
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

430
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,903
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

431
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,340
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half--

432
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,775
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

433
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,178
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

434
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,240
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.

435
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,309
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.

436
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:28,116
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.

437
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,919
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.
- ( Girls Giggling )

438
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:34,018
# Can't last #

439
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:38,361
# Any time
Any place #

440
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:43,426
This-- This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?

441
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:46,302
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.

442
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:49,969
- We can see the bar really good.
- ( Laughing )

443
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:53,411
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.

444
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,949
After years of bullshit,

445
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,578
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.

446
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:01,884
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around...

447
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:04,220
on a,
on a piece of canvass--

448
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,953
- Paper.
- Paper.

449
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:09,292
You were trying
to represent God.

450
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:14,130
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

451
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,466
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

452
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,904
She looks for God
and she finds,

453
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:22,875
she finds herself.

454
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:26,038
( Laughing )

455
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,181
( Laughing Continues )

456
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:37,418
Whoo!

457
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:40,688
( Verna ) Ate all the clams
in the house, did you?

458
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:44,720
( Jennifer ) Oh, don't torture
yourself, sweetheart.

459
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:47,029
She wants to be your woman,

moving a little bit.

631
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:55,316
Her mouth
was kind of moving.

I thought she was
talking to someone.

her father.

I, uh,

638
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:27,120
I kinda kneIt down,

639
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:33,728
and she wasn't talkin'
to someone else.

She was apologizing to me.

642

She was apologizing
for not having looked both ways.

643

And there were some people who were...
gathering around there.

644
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:08,361
Somebody called
for an ambulance, so I--

# If you eat too much
Oh, oh #

774
01:13:00,595 --> 01:13:03,758
# You'll awake
with a tummy ache #

775
01:13:03,832 --> 01:13:08,496
# On the good ship Lollipop
It's a nice trip ##

( Laughing, Shouting )

777
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:18,802
Whoo!
Freddy, come on!

778
01:13:27,722 --> 01:13:29,917
( Dog Barking )

779
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:36,962
- Mmm.
- ( Giggling )

780
01:13:37,032 --> 01:13:39,865
You tickled me!
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.

781
01:13:39,934 --> 01:13:42,732
I really wanna fuck you.
Stop!

782
01:13:42,804 --> 01:13:45,705
First I gotta play you
this song I wrote. Okay?

783
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:47,765
Song?

784
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,901
Gimme that bottle.

785
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:51,969
Oh.

786
01:13:55,383 --> 01:14:00,377
Okay. I hope you like this
'cause I wrote this just for you.

787
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:03,982
Don't let me go to sleep.
I got business tonight.

# Four little ducks went out one day #

789
01:14:10,565 --> 01:14:14,433
# Over the hills
and far away #

# Quack, quack
quack, quack #

792
01:14:26,147 --> 01:14:31,517
# But only... three little ducks
came back ##

( Mia ) # If you could only
look and see #

794
01:14:37,425 --> 01:14:39,586

# Surrounding you Mmm #

796
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:51,796
# You're the one that holds the key #

797
01:14:51,873 --> 01:14:59,370
# And you don't have
to make me a copy, ahh #

798
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:04,316
# Oh, you are just the earth #

799
01:15:06,254 --> 01:15:12,090
# I am just the sky #

I won't ask why #

01:15:21,035 --> 01:15:25,597
# I'll take our nights
and say good-bye #

01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:29,469
Chorus.

803

# Freddy and Mia #

( Dialing Phone )

808
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:34,000
( Phone Ringing )

809
01:16:36,344 --> 01:16:38,278
( Coughs )

810
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:41,782
- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.

811
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:45,877
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.

812
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:49,754
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need--

813
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:56,823
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.

814
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:01,460
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.

815
01:17:01,536 --> 01:17:03,094
What?

816
01:17:03,171 --> 01:17:06,629
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,

817
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:11,372
it feels real big
like it's driving me.

818
01:17:15,016 --> 01:17:19,544
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.

819
01:17:21,656 --> 01:17:24,955
And there's a crosswalk.
( Breathes Deeply )

820
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:31,130
And all these little kids
are being...

821
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:34,965
h-helped across
by a crossing guard.

822
01:17:36,104 --> 01:17:39,232
The crossing guard
is John Booth.

823
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,778
Em's one
of the little kids.

824
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:54,847
I'm gettin'...
closer and closer.

825
01:17:54,923 --> 01:17:58,359
And I'm...
I'm hittin' the brakes.

826
01:17:58,426 --> 01:18:00,656
The car won't slow down.

827
01:18:00,728 --> 01:18:05,722
( Sobbing ) I'm turning the wheel...
but the car won't turn.

828
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,564
Oh, Freddy.

829
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,337
Freddy.

830
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:17,845
Then I just plow
right through... through 'em.

831
01:18:19,781 --> 01:18:21,612
Then I--

832
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:26,245
Then I see Em's face...

833
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:29,256
just, just before...

834
01:18:29,324 --> 01:18:31,451
just before I hit her.

835
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:35,986
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.

836
01:18:36,064 --> 01:18:39,556
( Whispering )
Come on. Come on.

837
01:18:41,102 --> 01:18:43,627
Come on.

838
01:18:50,778 --> 01:18:53,212
( Dog Barking )

839
01:19:23,111 --> 01:19:25,602
Two coffees.

840
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,910
Sit there.

841
01:19:36,257 --> 01:19:38,191
( Sighs )

842
01:19:38,259 --> 01:19:41,319
Oh, Freddy.

843
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:50,303
( Sighs )
Mary, I--

844
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:54,171
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.

845
01:19:56,411 --> 01:20:01,144
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.

846
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:07,548
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

847
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:14,825
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

848
01:20:14,896 --> 01:20:17,126
I did see you...

849
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:19,098
( Sighs )

850
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:22,864
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

851
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:31,910
I can see
you're a good man.

852
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:35,847
And you loved her
so, so much.

853
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:40,013
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

854
01:20:40,088 --> 01:20:43,421
I needed you so badly.

855
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:48,994
But you--

856
01:20:59,373 --> 01:21:04,640
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,

857
01:21:04,712 --> 01:21:08,148
and the wind, God--
( Sighs )

858
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:11,117
The plane was bouncing
all around.

859
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:15,314
I thought--

860
01:21:15,389 --> 01:21:18,483
I was shaking.

861
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:21,119
Do you remember
what you said?

862
01:21:24,365 --> 01:21:25,957
No.

863
01:21:28,236 --> 01:21:30,170
Uh, tell me.

864
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,105
- ( Waitress ) Anything else?
- No, thanks.

865
01:21:33,174 --> 01:21:36,337
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

866
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:39,573
And you took my hand
and you said-- Do you remember?

867
01:21:40,615 --> 01:21:43,641
No, no.
Tell me.

868
01:21:45,419 --> 01:21:49,014
You said,
"Pray we crash.

869
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,526
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."

870
01:21:52,593 --> 01:21:54,652
( Chuckles )

871
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:59,758
You were so--
( Sighs )

872
01:22:01,335 --> 01:22:03,929
Where'd that guy go?

873
01:22:09,076 --> 01:22:11,408
Then Emmy died.

874
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,814
It's--

875
01:22:18,886 --> 01:22:21,514
It's made you so small
and weak.

876
01:22:25,693 --> 01:22:29,561
I needed you
to be big and strong.

877
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:33,791
I hated you
for your weakness.

878
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:36,200
I hated you.

879
01:22:38,773 --> 01:22:42,209
Now I'm pitying you.

880
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:49,244
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

881
01:22:54,488 --> 01:22:58,754
( Chuckles )

882
01:22:58,826 --> 01:23:02,922
You look around...

883
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:06,694
at the marriages
people have.

884
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:10,203
We had a good one,
didn't we?

885
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:13,607
Yes.

886
01:23:13,674 --> 01:23:16,268
Good times.

887
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:19,006
No hidden agendas.

888
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:24,852
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

889
01:23:28,356 --> 01:23:30,347
( Sighs )
We were turned on.

890
01:23:30,424 --> 01:23:33,257
We were hot
for one another.

891
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:40,426
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

892
01:23:40,501 --> 01:23:42,366
Best buddies.

893
01:23:48,142 --> 01:23:51,976
( Sighs ) Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

894
01:23:52,046 --> 01:23:55,243
No.

895
01:23:55,316 --> 01:23:57,511
No.

896
01:24:00,087 --> 01:24:04,490
( Chuckles )

897
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:06,788
No, but...

898
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:16,827
you pity me.

899
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,640
( Chuckles )

900
01:24:23,778 --> 01:24:26,508
( Sighs )
You pity me.

901
01:24:36,223 --> 01:24:39,021
Oh, boy, this is a--

902
01:24:39,093 --> 01:24:42,494
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this--

903
01:24:42,563 --> 01:24:45,999
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

904
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:49,127
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."

905
01:24:50,538 --> 01:24:53,006
I hope you die.

906
01:24:53,074 --> 01:24:57,272
I hope you fucking die.

907
01:25:20,634 --> 01:25:22,625
Come on! Come on!

908
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,898
Come on!
Come on!

909
01:25:24,972 --> 01:25:28,738
( Tires Screeching )

910
01:25:48,362 --> 01:25:51,923
( Siren Wailing )

911
01:25:51,999 --> 01:25:56,902
( Policeman ) Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

912
01:26:04,712 --> 01:26:09,240
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

913
01:26:09,316 --> 01:26:11,614
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

914
01:26:11,685 --> 01:26:14,381
Step back here.

915
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,556
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

916
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:21,424
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

917
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:23,656
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

918
01:26:23,731 --> 01:26:25,596
No.

919
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,896
Spread your feet for me.

920
01:26:27,968 --> 01:26:31,267
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

921
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:33,329
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

922
01:26:33,407 --> 01:26:36,535
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

923
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:40,068
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

924
01:26:40,147 --> 01:26:43,173
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

925
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,548
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

926
01:26:45,619 --> 01:26:48,019
( Policeman ) Put your hands down
for me.

927
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:51,957
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

928
01:26:52,026 --> 01:26:54,119
It's loaded?
Okay.

929
01:26:54,195 --> 01:26:56,595
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

930
01:26:56,664 --> 01:26:59,827
Yes, sir.

931
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,265
Here,
just hand it to me.

932
01:27:01,335 --> 01:27:03,860
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so--

933
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:07,271
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.

934
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:09,332
Have you had anything
to drink?

935
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:13,972
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

936
01:27:14,048 --> 01:27:16,414
All right.

937
01:27:16,484 --> 01:27:20,181
We're gonna conduct a few tests
to see how much your ability
to operate a motor vehicle...

938
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:22,347
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.

939
01:27:22,423 --> 01:27:25,517
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.

940
01:27:25,593 --> 01:27:30,155
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

941
01:27:30,231 --> 01:27:33,462
Okay, I want you to tiIt
your head back and close your eyes.

942
01:27:33,534 --> 01:27:38,198
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

943
01:27:38,272 --> 01:27:40,502
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.

944
01:27:40,574 --> 01:27:44,476
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

945
01:27:44,545 --> 01:27:47,241
Let's do
the left finger again.

946
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:49,874
- Okay, sir. Put your hands
down at your side.
- Permit's good.

947
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,111
The permit's good?
Okay.

948
01:27:52,186 --> 01:27:54,586
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.

949
01:27:56,891 --> 01:28:00,520
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.

950
01:28:00,594 --> 01:28:04,792
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.

951
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:06,833
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

952
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:10,598
When you get down here, I want
you to turn around and take ten
steps back. You understand?

953
01:28:10,671 --> 01:28:13,231
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

954
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:16,640
One, two, three,

955
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:21,340
four, five, six,

956
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:25,317
seven, eight, nine, ten.

957
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:28,446
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

958
01:28:28,522 --> 01:28:30,888
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,

959
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,983
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.

960
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,826
So, turn around, put your hands
behind your back. You're
under arrest for drunk driving.

961
01:28:36,897 --> 01:28:39,331
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

962
01:28:40,568 --> 01:28:43,833
Freeze! Stop!
Jesus.

963
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:46,364
Show us in foot pursuit.

964
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,965
( Policewoman ) 14-0-9. We're in
foot pursuit. Man with a gun.

965

Southbound on lnglewood from the 90
freeway. Request an air unit.

966
01:28:56,016 --> 01:28:58,780

( Grunting )

970
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,430
- Police officers, sir. Police!
- ( Man ) What's going on?

971
01:29:48,502 --> 01:29:51,699
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?

972
01:29:51,772 --> 01:29:53,831
( Man ) I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.

973
01:29:53,907 --> 01:29:57,809
- ( Policewoman )
Hey, the back door's open.
- ( Man ) I got kids here.

974
01:30:01,949 --> 01:30:05,009
( Policeman ) Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.

975
01:30:05,085 --> 01:30:07,383
Just stay with us.

Honey, you all right?

978
01:30:22,536 --> 01:30:26,131
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?

979
01:30:26,206 --> 01:30:29,437
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.

980
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,911
( Policeman ) We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.

981
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:36,916
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.

982
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:48,253
Good night, sweetheart.

983
01:31:08,882 --> 01:31:12,113

Gonna give you a laugh,
kid.

991
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:34,452
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

992
01:33:34,528 --> 01:33:37,224
The whole bit.

993

You wanna guess
what for?

994
01:33:46,206 --> 01:33:49,607
Drunk driving.
( Chuckles )

995
01:33:51,411 --> 01:33:55,040
Drunk driving.

996
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:57,845
And I had my gun.

997
01:34:00,854 --> 01:34:07,692
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...

I'm on the run,

999
01:34:09,796 --> 01:34:13,027
I'm on your property
and I got my gun.

1000
01:34:14,668 --> 01:34:18,934
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

1001

So, I'm gonna--

1002

I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.

1003
01:34:42,095 --> 01:34:44,188
And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.

Huh?

Hey!

01:37:03,036 --> 01:37:04,970
( Woman ) This just isn't working
for you out here.

1011
01:37:05,038 --> 01:37:07,438
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

1012
01:37:07,507 --> 01:37:10,533
- ( Man ) I don't understand.
- ( Woman ) What don't you understand?

1013
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:13,374
I come out here. I see you
don't have a cent to your name.
I wanna know what you're doing.

1014
01:37:13,447 --> 01:37:16,314
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

1015
01:37:16,383 --> 01:37:19,477
( Man ) I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?

1016
01:37:19,553 --> 01:37:21,680
( Man ) If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

1017
01:37:27,761 --> 01:37:31,754
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.

1018
01:37:31,832 --> 01:37:35,495
- ( Woman ) I don't understand
what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.

- ( Woman ) I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

1020
01:37:37,904 --> 01:37:39,872
- ( Woman ) Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

1021
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,001
( Woman ) Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

1022
01:37:44,077 --> 01:37:47,274
( Woman ) It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

1023
01:37:47,347 --> 01:37:50,009
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

1024
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:53,052
- lf it's gonna be this major thing--
- It is a major thing.

1025
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,921
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?

1026
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:00,255
( Woman ) That's easy.
That's what you always do.

1027
01:38:00,327 --> 01:38:03,023
Not right now.
That's it?

1028
01:38:08,969 --> 01:38:12,063
- Whatever, okay?
I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?

1029
01:38:12,139 --> 01:38:14,073
You don't listen.

1030

- ( Woman ) I don't listen?
- What am I doing? I have a job.

1031
01:38:18,011 --> 01:38:20,502
( Man ) And I'm working.
I'm working for, you know.

1032
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:25,244
- ( Woman ) For what?
- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.

1033
01:38:25,318 --> 01:38:29,015
( Man ) So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

1034
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:33,253
I think that your standards are like,
like so high. So I don't have a car!

1035
01:38:33,326 --> 01:38:36,193
- ( Woman ) What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?

1036
01:38:36,263 --> 01:38:38,857
- It's telemarketing.
What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?

1037
01:38:38,932 --> 01:38:41,457
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.

1038
01:38:41,535 --> 01:38:44,129
Well, you know.
