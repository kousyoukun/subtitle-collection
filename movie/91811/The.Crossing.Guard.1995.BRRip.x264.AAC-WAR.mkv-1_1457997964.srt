- For fuck sakes.
- I think...

190
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,940
我觉得把裴翠放在钻石前会好点

191
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:30,485
it would be wonderful to put emerald
pieces in front of the diamonds.

you know what I mean?

All the time,
I'm very busy.

00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,800
所以你得想先一步

199
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:43,399
So, uh, think ahead
a little bit.

生意怎样?

322
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:36,207
So, how's business?

323
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,447
一般般

324
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,837
So-so.

325
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,321
只是间小珠宝店我还能说什么?

326
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

327
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,880
是生意

328
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:44,479
It's business.

329
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,960
你呢?你还在做地产啊?

330
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:47,487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

331
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,894
嗅，现在市道不是很好

332
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:50,285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

333
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,562
我还是一些物业的代理人

334
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:53,953
I'm still representing
some properties.

335
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:57,735
但罗杰挺好的，我打算不要太操心，花多点时间陪孩于

336
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:59,125
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.

337
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,813
嗅，好的

338
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:03,170
Oh, well, wonderful.

339
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:06,807
这，对，这真的太好了

340
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:08,175
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.

341
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,548
哈．．．

342
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:10,939
Um--

343
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,612
嗅．．．

344
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,980
Um...

345
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,317
玛丽，有些亨你该知道

346
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:17,708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

347
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,263
这就是我来这儿的原因

348
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:22,654
It's the reason
I came here.

349
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,166
一弗瑞迪．．．我有亨要和你说

350
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,557
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

351
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,569
你向我承诺过的．我希望你遵守你的诺言

352
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:28,960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

353
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,775
两件亨：我向你承诺过，这是其一

354
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:35,166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

355
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:38,306
我有个好消息．这是其

356
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:39,696
And I have great news.
That's two.

357
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,442
你让我说还是不说?

358
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

359
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,656
不好意思．什么好消息?

360
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:47,013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

361
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:49,709
( Sighs, Muttering )

362
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,362
真的是好消息捧权的消息

363
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:52,753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

364
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,991
我问你．休会听吗?―好

365
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,382
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,468
真的要听?―是的

367
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

368
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,128
―准备好了吗?―准备好了

369
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

370
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,875
他出狱7

371
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,266
He's out.

372
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,879
约翰布思出狱了

373
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:10,270
John Booth is out.

374
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,881
我要千掉他

375
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,272
I'm gonna kill him.

376
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,814
出去，弗瑞迪

377
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,205
Get out of here, Freddy.

378
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,286
我不会走的除非我看到你够胆量说出真相

379
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:17,676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

380
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,879
真相?什么真相，弗瑞迪?

381
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:20,270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

382
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,619
―你答应过不会不会?不会什么，玛丽?

383
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:23,010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

384
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,958
―说起我们的女儿?为什么因为休会威胁我―威胁?

385
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:26,349
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

386
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,363
如果我曾和我孩子的母亲说过

387
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

388
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,458
我就永远不会说起我的女儿[

389
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,849
I must never mention
my daughter !

390
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,801
滚出我的家―这是我的家

391
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:35,191
- Get out of our house !
- This is my house.

392
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,205
任何的法律都可以证明这是我的家

393
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,596
By any natural law,
this is my house !

394
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,801
如果我的孩子住在这儿，我的孩于

395
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:42,193
If my children live here,
my children,

396
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,872
那谁敢说我就他妈的不能随时来这看他们?

397
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

398
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,440
你真的要这样做啊―没人和你说话

399
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:49,435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you !

400
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,714
―休会我报警吗?你就他妈的去报吧

401
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

402
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,950
你什么时候认回这些孩子的你负过父亲的责任吗?

403
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,343
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.

404
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,587
你从未管过我们的女儿―艾米丽是她的名字

405
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

406
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,300
对，艾米丽[她死了

407
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:02,420
Yes, Emily. Emily !
And she is dead.

408
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,398
但我还欠上面这两个小男孩的情

409
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

410
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,337
而这也你难受，我能给他们爱而你不能

411
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't !

412
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,137
弗瑞迪，我要你离开我们的家．．

413
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,527
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--

414
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,647
―说真相，玛丽．休会我去杀约翰“布思吧―放开他

415
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:19,039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth !
- Let go of him !

416
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,243
这是我生存的意义而你的生存意义是扮着什么也没发生

417
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:23,635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened !

418
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,255
放开他―弗瑞迪

419
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:26,646
- Let go of him !
- Freddy !

420
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,793
弗瑞迪，你怎么就不能放开我吗?我给你们泡点咖啡

421
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:30,172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

422
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,658
来啊

423
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:33,049
Come on.

424
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,755
咖啡，好的

425
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:36,147
Coffee. Good.

426
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,993
我想喝点咖啡

427
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:38,385
I'd like some coffee.

428
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,290
我们不如坐下，喝点咖啡客客气气的聊吗?

429
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:43,419
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

430
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,871
好吧

431
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:46,262
Come on.

432
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,538
你知道吧

433
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,929
( Sighs )
You know what?

434
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,477
我不想喝咖啡．我

435
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,867
I don't want any coffee.
I--

436
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,486
我根本就不喜欢咖啡让我心脏不舒服

437
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,877
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )

438
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,856
你不是说休会咖啡吗―不

439
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:04,247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

440
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,793
真的吗?

441
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:06,183
You sure?

442
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:10,610
对．不用

443
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:11,453
Yes. Uh... no.

444
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,365
我要走7

445
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:13,756
I'm gonna go.

446
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,531
我很好

447
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,922
I feel good.

448
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:24,471
他当时就站在门口．我没有―嗅，天啊，罗杰

449
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:25,862
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.

450
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,518
我只是想说一句

451
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,875
I just want to say this.

452
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,350
我为你做74女女你是知道的

453
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:31,741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

454
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,652
4良多

455
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,043
A lot of things.

456
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:37,184
我觉得你真是够低格了居然不听我说

457
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:38,575
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

458
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,720
―玛丽很难过7等等，我并不难过

459
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:42,089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

460
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,964
如果你还想着我会记仇谁对谁干了什么你就完完全全错了

461
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:46,354
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong !

462
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,528
而如果你认为这是低格那你就去死吧[

463
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:48,918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you !

464
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,837
我不知道你是否说真的要杀死那家伙但这点我还是知道的

465
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:53,228
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

466
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,207
这与我们的女儿无关

467
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:55,599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

468
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,975
我们的小女孩死了弗瑞迪．她不会再回来了

469
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

470
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,109
无论你千什么都好

471
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:01,499
no matter what you do !

472
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,212
你从未去过艾米丽的基地，弗瑞迪

473
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:05,603
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

474
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,416
为什么7

475
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,807
Why?

476
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:11,258
就因为我没去过你的小舞会?你的葬礼?

477
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:12,649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

478
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,424
我自己去过的玛丽．．．自己一个人

479
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,816
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

480
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,940
我自己去过的玛丽．．．自己一个人

481
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

482
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,662
那你可是我想像个勇敢的人

483
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

484
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,264
墓碑石上都写了什么，弗瑞迪?

485
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

486
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,410
是什么颜色的

487
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:29,432
What color is it?

488
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,911
是在山上?还是在树底下?

489
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:32,302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

490
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,577
是平放还是竖着放?

491
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:35,968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

492
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,930
这就是我所想的

493
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:45,484
That's what I thought.

494
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,362
罗杰，男人之间的话

495
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:51,752
Roger, man to man,

496
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,801
当你们俩在报纸上看到

497
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:54,192
when you two read
in the newspaper...

498
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,964
约翰布思被枪杀7

499
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:57,356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

500
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,502
我要你看看她的脸并告诉我是否看到自豪与解脱

501
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,869
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

502
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,141
自豪与解脱，玛丽

503
00:23:02,937 --> 00:23:06,532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

504
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:28,152
## ( Whistling )

505
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:40,271
## ( Whistling Continues )

506
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,980
嘿，听着

507
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:10,370
( Man ) So, listen to me.

508
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,514
我从洗手间走出

509
00:24:10,438 --> 00:24:12,906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

510
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,518
有两个东方人他们在吵，他们在嚷着

511
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:15,909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

512
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,384
他们互相吼着都在讲日语

513
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:18,775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

514
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,184
接着，我对他们说

515
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:24,456
“嘿，你们现在可是在美国．讲西班牙语吧
So, I told 'em.

516
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:25,847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

517
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:31,358
天啊，你他妈的今晚可真凄凉

518
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:32,726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )

519
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,736
他在这男人的世界里千什么?

520
00:24:32,793 --> 00:24:36,126
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?

521
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,401
嘿，弗瑞迪．怎么了?

522
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:39,792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

523
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,410
嘿，弗瑞迪，你可是和我们在一起?

524
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

525
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,675
我想我们把他催眠7，弗瑞迪

526
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:45,066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy !

527
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,817
嘿?―他精神恍愧

528
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:49,208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

529
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,768
( Men Laughing )

530
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,189
你们这些家伙有没试过头脑个，

531
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:57,580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

532
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,940
一段时间有一个声音?

533
00:24:57,652 --> 00:25:00,485
over a period of days?

534
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,689
就好像吸尘器?

535
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:03,079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

536
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,759
而你最近有一个想法

537
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:07,150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

538
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,635
你就会感到自豪并又耸驾它?

539
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:10,026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

540
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,232
耸驾什么?一耸驾思想

541
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

542
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,739
享受一下吧

543
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:17,130
Enjoyed it...

544
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:22,210
立到你真的听到有个吸尘器在你的脑海响

545
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:23,600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

546
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,781
你可不是说今晚吧不．他是说其它晚上

547
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:28,172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.

548
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,554
接受一下我的建议吧，弗瑞迪

549
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:30,945
Take my advice, Freddy.

550
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,562
去找一个小妊周末好好玩玩吧

551
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:33,919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

552
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:37,480
( Men Laughing )

553
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,138
我得走了．我们再见吧

554
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

555
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,976
弗瑞迪休会去哪儿?才11点

556
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:51,366
Freddy, where you goin' ?
It's only 11:00.

560
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,912
他要把他妈的吸尘器关7

561
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:59,303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'

Fuckin'--
Fuckin' clip is empty.

574
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,202
他妈的手枪没上子弹

575
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,592
This fuckin' gun ain't got
no fuckin' clip. You cock.

00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,738
好的，我这有香烟?

I get a cigarette?

You know--

582
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,239
把门关上好吗?我不想惊醒我的父母

583
00:29:02,796 --> 00:29:05,629
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

584
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,585
可以他妈的惊醒他的父母

585
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

事情发生后

587

When the thing happened,

588
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,163
我也不想活7

589
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,554

I didn't want
your forgiveness.

594
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,613
我并不觉得我该得到这些宽恕

595
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:51,003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,580
但．．．

a long wait.

但我不会逃

609

But I'm not goin' anywhere.

610

我也不会报誓

611
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:35,986
I'm not callin' any cops.

612
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,932
我就在这儿，试着去刁惯

613
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:40,322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,639
你或许

615
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:51,030
Would you maybe,
you know--

616
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:56,548
花几天

617
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,939
Would you take
a couple days...

618
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,647
或许你就不会想杀我了

619
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:01,038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

620
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,693
听着

621

- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

628

Three days.

636
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,342
或许我就会给枪上子弹了

637
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

638
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,360
他妈的

639
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:56,429
Son of a bitch !

640
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:02,632
( Speaking Spanish )

641
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,981
起．好的

642
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:06,372
( Woman On TV ) And up. Let's go !

643
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,480
我们热一下身让血脉J顷通

644
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:09,439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

645
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,424
弯臂

646
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:12,815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

647
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,624
前后，踏步

648
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:16,014
Front and back.
And step.

649
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,204
我不要其它的戒指我就要这个7专大的

650
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:29,596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

651
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,270
你难道不明白吗?

652
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,661
Don't you understand?

653
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:34,477
周二我的手是7专大的今天也是．但这戒指不是7专

654
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:35,868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

655
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,576
你的手指可能某天会肿些

656
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:37,968
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

657
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,384
我要和自责人说这不是7专

658
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:40,775
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

659
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,653
这可能是6专，或6．5

660
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:44,045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

661
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,356
―我帮你量过两次了我今晚可要戴这戒指的

662
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:47,747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

663
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,797
今晚我有个非常重要的约会

664
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:50,187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

665
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,334
不，我不要其它的戒指我就要这个．．．

666
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:52,725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

667
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,893
我下的订单就是7专的―有什么亨吗，女士?

668
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:55,284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

669
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,660
―你是负债人吗对，我是这里的经营者

670
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:59,458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

671
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:03,375
谢天谢地．我告诉这日本家伙我订的戒指是7专

672
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:04,766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

673
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,916
我戒指的足寸都是7专的但这个不是7专

674
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:07,306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

675
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,815
―我的手戴不下我可以看看你的戒指吗?

676
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:10,207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

677
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,412
好的．我的手戴不7，不合适

678
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:13,804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

679
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,651
这是6．5．或许是6．95

680
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

681
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,630
这他妈的在你看来就是6．5吗?

682
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:23,021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

683
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,834
对

684
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:27,191
Ahh.

685
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,464
你说的对，你是要戴7专的

686
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

687
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,599
一个不折不扣的7专

688
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,990
A perfect fucking seven.

689
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,389
你知道这车在哪儿回头吗?

690
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:56,780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

691
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,301
什么?

692
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,692
Pardon?

693
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,933
这车会在格伦代尔停吗?

694
00:34:02,763 --> 00:34:06,324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

695
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,645
我不知道

696
00:34:10,704 --> 00:34:13,036
I don't know.

697
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,449
会回头回到玛格街吗?

698
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:18,840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

699
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,513
不知道

700
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:20,902
I don't know.

701
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,895
你回玛格街吗?―不

702
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

703
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:34,794
我妹妹有一辆车

704
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:36,185
My sister has a car.

705
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,636
一辆开蓬车

706
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:39,027
A Valiant.

707
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:44,238
你试过开开蓬车吗一没有

708
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:45,629
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.

709
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,217
我妹妹有一辆绿色的开蓬车

710
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:49,574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

711
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,860
我整天坐车

712
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:59,251
I ride the bus
all day long.

713
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:02,447
( Laughing )

714
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,828
我有残疾证明

715
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:05,218
I have
a disability card...

716
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,233
所有我不用付钱

717
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,624
so I don't have to pay.

718
00:35:07,694 --> 00:35:10,288
( Laughing )

719
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,677

Okay, we're late.

734
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,265
在船上的．是份好工作

735
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

736
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,861
还有，我家里来了一帮人给你开个宴会

737
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:48,252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

738
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,498
宴会?―还有女孩

739
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:50,888
- A party?
- Girls.

740
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,135
―哇―我们不去任何地方立到．．

741
00:36:50,964 --> 00:36:54,525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--

742
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144

- ln the joint,

744

did you get
butt-fucked?

746
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,849
第一次挺疼的

747
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:02,206
It only hurts
the first time.

748
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,182
我知道

749

# I was born a cowboy

762
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,646
把手从口袋个拿出来吧让我们听听掌声

00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:36,037
- ( Laughing )
- ( Sunny ) Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

764
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,587
这是弗娜．来，多点掌声

765
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:39,977
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...

766
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,850
让阳光射进来吧，弗娜

767
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:42,241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna !

768
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,893

Oh, Verna,

00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,452
你最好快点．我们要迟到了

00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:46,842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's !

772
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,520
我不知道．她们也去啊?―当然，她们也去啊

773
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,911
- I didn't know. Is she goin' ?
- Of course she's goin'.

774
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,431
我以为晚餐就只有我们俩

775
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

776
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,564
在饭店里我们不能干的，弗娜

777
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:57,955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

778
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,872
这有什么区别7

779
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:01,262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

780
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,572
休会走还是不去?

781
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:03,962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

782
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,105
谁要去，就来吧我在车上等

783
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:07,495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

792
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,793
关于同情我之前和你说过你怎样才能得到同情．．．

793
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:23,184
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...

794
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,996
对于人来说，你每天都得判断对谁该有同情，谁不该有

795
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:27,386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

796
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,380
这就是你的天性

797
00:38:27,461 --> 00:38:29,395
That's your spirituality.

798
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,599
如果那个人是个黑人并暴死街头，那么就值得同情

799
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:32,990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

800
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,668
如果那个是有钱人他的妹妹死了．他就只会得到一点点同情

801
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:36,058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

802
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:38,146
但如果那个人虽然有钱但碰到倒霉的一天，那就算了

803
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:39,503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

804
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:43,850
他们就不值得同情．你也不会过那种人的生活

805
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:44,476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

806
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,749
但因为他们没有什么好值得同情的东西

807
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:48,139
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

808
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,757
你就不用赋予他们同情

809
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,149
you don't give it to them.

810
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,659
我没见过你这样做过

811
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:54,051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

812

I know.
I'm Jojo.

958
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:18,527
你知道关于我的亨―彼特告诉过我

959
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:19,919
- You know. You know about me?
- Peter told me.

960
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,859
嗅

961
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:22,250
Mmm.

我所杀的女孩父亲

The father of the, uh,

964

他昨晚威胁要杀了我

965
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:34,857
the girl I killed,
he threatened to kill me last night.

966
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,245
那是一次意外，对吧?

967
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:38,636
It was an accident,
right?

968
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,811
他说真的吗?你，你也说真的吗?

969
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:43,203
Was he serious?
You, you-- Serious?

970
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,854
我想他是说真的

971
00:43:43,276 --> 00:43:46,211
I think he was serious.

972
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,356
我想他是个较真的人

973
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:48,747
I think he's a serious man.

974
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,785
我只告诉给你听

975
00:43:51,117 --> 00:43:53,176
You're the only person
I've told.

976
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,797
为什么7

977
00:43:54,254 --> 00:43:56,188
Why?

978
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,658
嗅，我

979
00:43:58,057 --> 00:44:00,048
Well, I--

980
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,667
我想这会很浪漫

981
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:05,058
I think I thought
it would be romantic.

982
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,682
你为什么想要浪漫?

983
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:15,073
Why would you
want to be romantic?

984
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:25,489
你头上的伤疤是怎么回亨?

985
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,880
How'd you get
that scar on your head?

986
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,724
撞铁门弄的

987
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:30,116
Banged my head
against the wall.

988
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,235
在监狱里啊?―对

989
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,626
- ln jail?
- Uh-huh.

990
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,470
你自己弄的还是别人弄的?

991
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,861
You or somebody else?

992
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,340
你自己?一对

993
00:44:39,332 --> 00:44:41,425
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

994
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,374
你受不了监狱之苦?

995
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,765
You just couldn't stand jail?

996
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,745
不．我只是受不了我自已

997
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:47,136
No. I just couldn't
stand me.

998
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:56,482
对，我想打电话，但很晚了我想你们还没起床

999
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:57,873
Yeah, I was gonna call, but
it got so late, I didn't think
you guys would be up.

1000
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,425
我们当然起床了

1001
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,816
( Helen ) Of course we're up !

1002
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,929
你就刚回家．我们想见到你

1003
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:02,320
You just got home.
We want to see you.

1004
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,668
不好意思．只是

1005
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,059
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh--

1006
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:09,172
我找到一份工作了一嗅，好的

1007
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:10,562
- I got the job.
- Ah, good.

1008
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,266
彼特和他的弟弟清我去了家庭宴会

1009
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,657
And Peter and his brother threw me
a coming-home party.

1010
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,334
就这样

1011
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,725
The day
just kinda happened.

1012
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:19,678
你什么时候到船上工作?―几个小时之后

1013
00:45:16,803 --> 00:45:21,069
- When do you start on the boat?
- Actually in a few hours.

1014
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,548
你就要开工了还在外面待这么晚?

1015
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,938
Why do you stay out so late
before you start a job?

1016
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:26,714
你的朋友就不在乎你是否休息了

1017
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,106
Your friends don't care
if you get any rest.

1018
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,659
今晚有些亨触动了我

1019
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:33,050
Something hit me tonight.

1020
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,196
是个奇怪的农晚

1021
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,587
It was a strange night.

1022
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,502
你知道，嗅

1023
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,893
You know, uh,

1024
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,677
我千了件可怕的事情

1025
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:49,068
( Sighs )
I've done a horrible thing.

1026
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,542
嗅

1027
00:45:49,135 --> 00:45:51,933
And, uh,

1028
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,583
我总是在自责

1029
00:45:52,005 --> 00:45:54,974
I'm always
gonna feel the guiIt...

1030
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,777
和悔疚

1031
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:57,168
and remorse.

1032
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,512
但．．．

1033
00:45:58,344 --> 00:46:00,904
But...

1034
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:05,294
当你听到这样的亨

1035
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:06,685
when you hear about
a thing like that,

1036
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:10,332
一个承受这种亨的人

1037
00:46:06,753 --> 00:46:11,713
about someone who has
to carry a thing like that,

1038
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:15,831
你也将心比心，就

1039
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:17,221
when you're in it,
it's just, it's--

1040
00:46:17,297 --> 00:46:19,288
( Sighs )

1041
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,977
你所想就

1042
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:25,368
It's very different...

1043
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,948
会不同7

1044
00:46:25,438 --> 00:46:28,339
from what you might think.

1045
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,281
我并不是一个不高兴的人

1046
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:34,672
( Sighs )
I'm not an unhappy person.

1047
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:38,260
我只是

1048
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:39,650
I'm just--
( Clears Throat ) I'm just--

1049
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:42,788
我只是一个造成很多不快的人

1050
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:44,179
I'm someone who has caused
a lot of... unhappiness.

1051
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:47,631
一个导致别人死亡的人

1052
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:49,023
And a person
who's caused death.

1053
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,639
我，我爱你们

1054
00:46:58,071 --> 00:47:02,030
I, uh,
I love you...

1055
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,346
非常爱你们

1056
00:47:02,108 --> 00:47:05,737
both so much.

1057
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:09,160
不只是因为你们是我的父母．但．．

1058
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:10,408
Not just as my parents,
but...

1059
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,186
也是两个支持着

1060
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:13,577
as two people who,

1061
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:16,824
不断地给予爱

1062
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:18,215
who stood by
and kept giving...

1063
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,900
给一个人

1064
00:47:20,593 --> 00:47:24,290
your love... to that person.

1065
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,767
这个人．．．

1066
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,134
That person...

1067
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,183
却老是给你们俩带来痛苦

1068
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:35,539
who has also caused you both
so much pain.

1069
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:39,178
你是我们的儿子我们当然爱你

1070
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:40,545
You're our son.
Of course we love you.

1071
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,191
无论发生什么亨

1072
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:42,581
No matter what.

1073
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,362
我们立说吧，每个人都是按照小时计酬的

1074
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,753
( Verna ) Let's get this straight,
girl. Everyone gets paid by the hour.

1075
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:54,132

The car won't slow down.

而我．．．

1542
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:26,125
我看到了艾米丽的脸
Then I--

1543
01:18:23,644 --> 01:18:28,206
Then I see Em's face...

1544
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:29,135

1565
01:19:58,372 --> 01:20:03,105
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.

1566
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:07,429
讨厌见到你听到你的声音或关心你

1567
01:20:05,345 --> 01:20:09,509
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

1568
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,704
但当我今晚听到你的电话

1569
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:16,786
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

1570
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,600
我就想见你

1571
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:19,087
I did see you...

1572
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,744
这是艾米丽死后的头一回
( Sighs )

1573
01:20:21,128 --> 01:20:24,825
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

1574
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:31,790
我知道你是一个好男人

1575
01:20:30,003 --> 01:20:33,871
I can see
you're a good man.

1576
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,762
而又你也深深地爱着她

1577
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:37,808
And you loved her
so, so much.

1578
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,893
但我也爱她啊，弗瑞迪

1579
01:20:37,878 --> 01:20:41,974
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

1580
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,301
我非常需要你

1581
01:20:42,049 --> 01:20:45,382
I needed you so badly.

1582
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,874
但你．．．

1583
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:50,955
But you--

1584
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:04,520
你还记得．．．当我们从维加斯回来

1585
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:06,601
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,

1586
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:08,290
那些风，天啊

1587
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:10,109
and the wind, God--
( Sighs )

1588
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,997
飞机不断地晃动

1589
01:21:10,177 --> 01:21:13,078
The plane was bouncing
all around.

1590
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,194
我想

1591
01:21:14,715 --> 01:21:17,275
I thought--

1592
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:18,363
我在抖

1593
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:20,444
I was shaking.

1594
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,000
还记得你说了什么吗?

1595
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,080
Do you remember
what you said?

1596
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,838
不

1597
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:27,918
No.

1598
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,500
嗅，你告诉我

1599
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:33,190
还要点什么吗―不用了，谢谢
Uh, tell me.

1600
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:35,066
- ( Waitress ) Anything else?
- No, thanks.

1601
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,217
我真不敢相信你是如此的冷静

1602
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:38,298
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

1603
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:39,452
你握着我的手说你还记得吗?

1604
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:41,534
And you took my hand
and you said-- Do you remember?

1605
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:43,520
不、告诉我吧

1606
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:45,602
No, no.
Tell me.

1607
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:48,894
你说，“就让我们撞机吧“

1608
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,975
You said,
"Pray we crash.

1609
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:52,428
“这样我们就可以称呼自己为生存者了“

1610
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:54,487
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."

1611
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:56,613
( Chuckles )

1612
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:59,638
你是如此的

1613
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:01,719
You were so--
( Sighs )

1614
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,809
你是如此的

1615
01:22:03,296 --> 01:22:05,890
Where'd that guy go?

1616
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,289
接着艾米丽死了

1617
01:22:11,037 --> 01:22:13,369
Then Emmy died.

1618
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,694
这．．．

1619
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:20,775
It's--

1620
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,395
这让你变得如此的渺小和脆弱

1621
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:23,475
It's made you so small
and weak.

1622
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:29,475
我要你变得强大点

1623
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:31,522
I needed you
to be big and strong.

1624
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,672
我讨厌你的脆弱

1625
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,800
我讨厌你
I hated you
for your weakness.

1626
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:38,161
I hated you.

1627
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,880
现在我可可怜起你来了

1628
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:44,170
Now I'm pitying you.

1629
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:49,124
我不知道该如何帮你，弗瑞迪

1630
01:22:47,474 --> 01:22:51,205
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

1631
01:22:56,449 --> 01:23:00,715
( Chuckles )

1632
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,803
你看看周围

1633
01:23:00,787 --> 01:23:04,883
You look around...

1634
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:06,574
结了婚的人

1635
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:08,655
at the marriages
people have.

1636
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:10,106
我们不是也幸福过吗?

1637
01:23:08,728 --> 01:23:12,164
We had a good one,
didn't we?

1638
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,510
对

1639
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,149
过得很开
Yes.

1640
01:23:15,635 --> 01:23:18,229
Good times.

1641
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,886
没什么隐藏的

1642
01:23:18,305 --> 01:23:20,967
No hidden agendas.

1643
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,732
你也没看到其他人肮脏的一面

1644
01:23:23,844 --> 01:23:26,813
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

1645
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,227
我们变7

1646
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,136
我们对对方吹毛求疵
( Sighs )
We were turned on.

1647
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:35,218
We were hot
for one another.

1648
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:40,307
我们当时都还年轻，对吧―那是段快乐的时光

1649
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:42,387
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

1650
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,247
过得痛快

1651
01:23:42,462 --> 01:23:44,327
Best buddies.

1652
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,856
如果我想到这个有什么错的就纠正我吧

1653
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:53,937
( Sighs ) Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

1654
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,123
不

1655
01:23:54,007 --> 01:23:57,204
No.

1656
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,391
不

1657
01:23:57,277 --> 01:23:59,472
No.

1658
01:24:02,048 --> 01:24:06,451
( Chuckles )

1659
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,667
不，但．．．

1660
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:08,749
No, but...

1661
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:16,707
你可怜我

1662
01:24:16,763 --> 01:24:18,788
you pity me.

1663
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,601
( Chuckles )

1664
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:26,387
你可怜我

1665
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:28,469
( Sighs )
You pity me.

1666
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,902
嗅，伙计．这是

1667
01:24:38,184 --> 01:24:40,982
Oh, boy, this is a--

1668
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,408
这可真是快乐的亨，这

1669
01:24:41,054 --> 01:24:44,455
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this--

1670
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:45,902
弗瑞迪，无论你在千什么，别做了

1671
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:47,960
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

1672
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:49,700
“弗瑞迪，无论你在千什么，别做了

1673
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:51,088
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."

1674
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,909
我希望你死

1675
01:24:52,954 --> 01:24:57,152
我希望你他妈的去死
I hope you die.

1676
01:24:55,035 --> 01:24:59,233
I hope you fucking die.

1677
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,516
来啊[

1678
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,779
来啊[来啊
Come on ! Come on !

1679
01:25:24,664 --> 01:25:26,859
Come on !
Come on !

1680
01:25:26,933 --> 01:25:30,699
( Tires Screeching )

1681
01:25:50,323 --> 01:25:53,884
( Siren Wailing )

1682
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,783
先生，清把车往右靠

1683
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,863
( Policeman ) Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

1684
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:09,120
先生，把车停下―座位上有枪

1685
01:26:06,673 --> 01:26:11,201
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

1686
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,495
有枪在车上?往后站，先生

1687
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:14,261
往后站
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

1688
01:26:13,646 --> 01:26:16,342
Step back here.

1689
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,436
就站在那儿先生．转速身来

1690
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:21,304
把手放在头上，手指交又
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

1691
01:26:20,587 --> 01:26:23,385
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

1692
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,536
身上还有其它武器吗?

1693
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,476
没了
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

1694
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,777
把腿展开
No.

1695
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:31,148
我有手枪执照的―你有手枪执照?
Spread your feet for me.

1696
01:26:29,929 --> 01:26:33,228
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

1697
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,210
一对你为什么要拿枪，先生?

1698
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:36,415
我是个珠宝商我经营珠宝店
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

1699
01:26:35,368 --> 01:26:38,496
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

1700
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,960
这是我的所有．我拿枪是要保护我的所有

1701
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:42,029
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

1702
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,540
我明白这个．你带了执照了吗?

1703
01:26:42,108 --> 01:26:45,134
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

1704
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,429
带了，就在我钱包里一好的

1705
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,933
把手放下吧
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

1706
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:51,837
舟尼、是一把A45．上7子弹．有一颗子弹
( Policeman ) Put your hands down
for me.

1707
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:53,918
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

1708
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,999
上了子弹?好的

1709
01:26:53,987 --> 01:26:56,080
It's loaded?
Okay.

1710
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:56,475
把你的钱包拿出来吧你的驾使执照也在里面啊?

1711
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,707
对
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

1712
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,788
Yes, sir.

1713
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,146
给我看看

1714
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,740
他说这有枪支执照

1715
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:03,226
Here,
just hand it to me.

1716
01:27:03,296 --> 01:27:05,821
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so--

1717
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:07,150
而我们让你停车是你今晚驾使有点问题，先生

1718
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:09,232
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.

1719
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,223
喝了什么吗?

1720
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:13,852
几个小时以前我喝了点酒―对我的手吹一下
Have you had anything
to drink?

1721
01:27:11,371 --> 01:27:15,933
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

1722
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,294
好的

1723
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:20,610
我们要做一些测试看看你是否还能驾使．．．
All right.

1724
01:27:18,445 --> 01:27:22,142
We're gonna conduct a few tests
to see how much your ability
to operate a motor vehicle...

1725
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,227
看看喝了酒后的驾使能力有没减弱

1726
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:25,397
首先把脚并拢

you've had to drink tonight.

1727
01:27:24,384 --> 01:27:27,478

I want you to put your feet together.

1728
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:30,350
然后把双臂展开并伸出你的食指

1729
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:32,116
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

1730
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,342
把头往后靠一下并闭上眼睛

1731
01:27:32,192 --> 01:27:35,423
Okay, I want you to tiIt
your head back and close your eyes.

1732
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:38,780
现在用你右手的食指触摸你的弃尖

1733
01:27:35,495 --> 01:27:40,159
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

1734
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,381
摸了之后把手放回原处

1735
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:44,390
接着用你左手触摸你的弃尖
Okay, just put your hand back

1736
01:27:42,535 --> 01:27:46,437
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

1737
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:47,121
再摸一次

1738
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:49,202
Let's do
the left finger again.

1739
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,755
好的，先生．把手放下吧一有执照的

1744
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:00,399

1747
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:06,753
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.

1748
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:06,714
你走的同时要数步数

1749
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:10,477
走完后，转身再走十步，明白了吗?
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

1750
01:28:08,862 --> 01:28:12,559
When you get down here, I want
you to turn around and take ten
steps back. You understand?

1751
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:13,111
明白了―走，巴

1752

好的，转身吧，先生我们不需要走回了

1760
01:28:27,347 --> 01:28:30,407
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

1761
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,768

Just turn around,

Gonna give you a laugh,

1813
01:33:31,851 --> 01:33:36,413
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

1814
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,104
糟透顶7

And I had my gun.

1824

我并不太熟悉法律，但

1825
01:34:02,815 --> 01:34:09,653
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...

我想你可以杀了我然后跑掉也没亨

I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

这可说不通
( Woman ) This just isn't working
for you out here.

1850
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:10,414
一我不明白你不明白什么?
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

1851
01:37:09,468 --> 01:37:12,494
- ( Man ) I don't understand.
- ( Woman ) What don't you understand?

1852
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:13,255
我出来了，我看到你身上一分钱都没．我想知道你千了什么

1853
01:37:12,571 --> 01:37:15,335
I come out here. I see you
don't have a cent to your name.
I wanna know what you're doing.

1854
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,193
我不知道你是怎样赚钱的你什么也没赚

1855
01:37:15,408 --> 01:37:18,275
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

1856
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:19,357
我有工作．我在赚钱你怎么说我没呢?

1857
01:37:18,344 --> 01:37:21,438
( Man ) I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?

1858
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:21,559
我付了房租，我有pt的我也在赚钱

1859
01:37:21,514 --> 01:37:23,641
( Man ) If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

1860
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,634
这就是你所想的―你没自力更生．也没付房租

1861
01:37:29,722 --> 01:37:33,715
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.

1862
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:35,375
我真不明白你是怎样营生的―你没这个必要

1863
01:37:33,793 --> 01:37:37,456
- ( Woman ) I don't understand
what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.

1864
01:37:35,482 --> 01:37:37,712
有这个必要我过得很好

1865
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:39,776
当然我是有这个必要一为什么?
- ( Woman ) I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

1866
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:43,881
因为债权人给我打了电话而我是和你一起签字的
- ( Woman ) Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

1867
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:45,962
( Woman ) Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

1868
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:47,154
把我的名字去掉就是你说得倒轻松

1869
01:37:46,038 --> 01:37:49,235
( Woman ) It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

1870
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:49,890
是非常轻杉―搞错站了

1871
01:37:49,308 --> 01:37:51,970
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

1872
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,932
如果这是主要的事情―是主要的事情

1873
01:37:52,044 --> 01:37:55,013
- lf it's gonna be this major thing--
- It is a major thing.

1874
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,801
―我们要处理好我觉得没什么好处理

1875
01:37:55,081 --> 01:37:59,882
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?

1876
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:00,135
说得轻松．这就是你的一贡作风

1877
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:02,903
但不是现在．就这样?
( Woman ) That's easy.
That's what you always do.

1878

Not right now.
That's it?

I don't wanna talk about this.

01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,953
你没在听

1882
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,821
我没听?―我在千什么?我有一份工作
You don't listen.

1883
01:38:16,102 --> 01:38:19,902
- ( Woman ) I don't listen?

1884
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:20,393
我在工作．我为了什么而工作，你是知道的

1885

- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.

1887
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:28,895
所以我觉得我表现得很好

1888
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:30,976
( Man ) So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

―你在千什么?电话推销．有什么不同?

1892
01:38:35,287 --> 01:38:38,154

- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?

What's the difference?

- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.

1897
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:44,800
而这些钱是用来付房租的

1898
01:38:43,496 --> 01:38:46,090
Well, you know.
Hey. It pays the rent.
