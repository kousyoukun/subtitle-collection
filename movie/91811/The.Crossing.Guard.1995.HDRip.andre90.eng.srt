My wife,

We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.

So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.

And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

that we lost.

00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,146
( Boys Chatting, Keys Jingling )

159
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:43,249
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:48,896
- ( Boys Chatting )
- ( Mary ) Hold on, guys.

161
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,590
Hold on.

162
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,692
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Dad !
- Hi, guys.

163
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,169
- ( Boys Together ) Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.

164
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:59,299
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.

165
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,415
Well...

166
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,650
look at this.

167
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:17,458
My own kids
call me Freddy.

168
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,294
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think,
would be pushing it.

169
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:28,963
No, you do.
You look wonderful.

170
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,806
Thank you.

171
00:17:33,342 --> 00:17:38,177
So, how's business?

172
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,807
So-so.

173
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:43,681
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

174
00:17:43,753 --> 00:17:46,449
It's business.

175
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:49,457
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

176
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,255
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

177
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:55,923
I'm still representing
some properties.

178
00:17:55,998 --> 00:18:01,095
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.

179
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,140
Oh, well, wonderful.

180
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:10,145
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.

181
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,909
Um--

182
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,950
Um...

183
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:19,678
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

184
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:24,624
It's the reason
I came here.

185
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:27,527
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

186
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,930
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

187
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:37,136
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

188
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:41,666
And I have great news.
That's two.

189
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,803
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

190
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,983
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

191
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:51,679
( Sighs, Muttering )

192
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:54,723
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

193
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,352
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,828
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

195
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,489
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

196
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:08,236
He's out.

197
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:12,240
John Booth is out.

198
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,242
I'm gonna kill him.

199
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,175
Get out of here, Freddy.

200
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:19,646
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

201
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:22,240
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

202
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,980
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

203
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:28,319
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

204
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:31,724
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

205
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,819
I must never mention
my daughter !

206
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:37,161
- Get out of our house !
- This is my house.

207
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:40,566
By any natural law,
this is my house !

208
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:44,163
If my children live here,
my children,

209
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,233
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

210
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:51,405
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you !

211
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,074
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

212
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,313
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.

213
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,947
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

214
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:04,390
Yes, Emily. Emily !
And she is dead.

215
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,759
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

216
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,664
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't !

217
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:17,497
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--

218
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:21,009
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth !
- Let go of him !

219
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:25,605
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened !

220
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:28,616
- Let go of him !
- Freddy !

221
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:32,142
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

222
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,019
Come on.

223
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:38,117
Coffee. Good.

224
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:40,355
I'd like some coffee.

225
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:45,389
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

226
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:48,232
Come on.

227
00:20:48,304 --> 00:20:51,899
( Sighs )
You know what?

228
00:20:55,277 --> 00:20:57,837
I don't want any coffee.
I--

229
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:02,847
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )

230
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:06,217
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

231
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:08,153
You sure?

232
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:13,423
Yes. Uh... no.

233
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:15,726
I'm gonna go.

234
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,892
I feel good.

235
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:27,832
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.

236
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,845
I just want to say this.

237
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,711
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

238
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,013
A lot of things.

239
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:40,545
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

240
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:44,059
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

241
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:48,324
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong !

242
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,888
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you !

243
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:55,198
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

244
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,569
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

245
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,336
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

246
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,469
no matter what you do !

247
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:07,573
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

248
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,777
Why?

249
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:14,619
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

250
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,786
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

251
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,455
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

252
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,022
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

253
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,625
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

254
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,402
What color is it?

255
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:34,272
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

256
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:37,938
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

257
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,454
That's what I thought.

258
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,722
Roger, man to man,

259
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,162
when you two read
in the newspaper...

260
00:22:56,232 --> 00:22:59,326
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

261
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:04,839
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

262
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:08,502
Pride and relief,
Mary.

263
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:30,122
## ( Whistling )

264
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:42,241
## ( Whistling Continues )

265
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:12,340
( Man ) So, listen to me.

266
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:14,876
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

267
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:17,879
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

268
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,745
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

269
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:22,545
So, I told 'em.

270
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:27,817
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

271
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,696
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )

272
00:24:34,763 --> 00:24:38,096
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?

273
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:41,762
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

274
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,771
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

275
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,036
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy !

276
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:51,178
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

277
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:54,738
( Men Laughing )

278
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:59,550
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

279
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:02,455
over a period of days?

280
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:05,049
Like a vacuum cleaner?

281
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:09,120
That the last time
you had an original thought,

282
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:11,996
you got cocky
and rode on it?

283
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:15,594
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

284
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:19,100
Enjoyed it...

285
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:25,570
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

286
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:30,142
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.

287
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,915
Take my advice, Freddy.

288
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:35,889
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

289
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:39,450
( Men Laughing )

290
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:50,499
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

291
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:53,336
Freddy, where you goin' ?
It's only 11:00.

292
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,172
Oh, man.

293
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:57,178
Commitments.

294
00:25:57,246 --> 00:26:01,273
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner ! ( Laughing )

All right
I get a cigarette?

All right.

You know--

Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:30,892
When the thing happened,

310
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,524
I wanted to be dead.

311
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:45,397
But there wasn't--
You know.

312
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:48,807
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

313
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:52,973
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

314
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,419
But...

315
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,497
I guess you, uh...

316
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:14,025
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

317
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:16,866
It's all right.
Sit down.

318
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,344
Sit down.

319
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,043
I know it's been
a long wait.

320
00:30:28,116 --> 00:30:31,244
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

321
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:37,956
I'm not callin' any cops.

322
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:42,292
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

323
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,000
Would you maybe,
you know--

324
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:59,909
Would you take
a couple days...

325
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:03,008
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

326
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,054
Look.

327
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:10,854
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

328
00:31:10,926 --> 00:31:15,454
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

329
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,328
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

330
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,860
Shut up ! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't !

331
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,264
All right.

332
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:47,189
I'm gonna give you
three days.

333
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:49,321
Three days.

334
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:56,704
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

335
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,399
Son of a bitch !

336
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:04,602
( Speaking Spanish )

337
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,342
( Woman On TV ) And up. Let's go !

338
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,409
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

339
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:14,785
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

340
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:17,984
Front and back.
And step.

341
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:31,566
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

342
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,631
Don't you understand?

343
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,838
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

344
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,938
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

345
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:42,745
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

346
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:46,015
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

347
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:49,717
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

348
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,157
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

349
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:54,695
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

350
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:57,254
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

351
00:32:57,332 --> 00:33:01,428
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

352
00:33:01,503 --> 00:33:06,736
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

353
00:33:06,808 --> 00:33:09,276
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

354
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:12,177
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

355
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:15,774
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

356
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:19,014
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

357
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:24,991
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

358
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:29,161
Ahh.

359
00:33:29,231 --> 00:33:31,825
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

360
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,960
A perfect fucking seven.

361
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:58,750
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

362
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:04,662
Pardon?

363
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:08,294
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

364
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:15,006
I don't know.

365
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:20,810
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

366
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:22,873
I don't know.

367
00:34:26,388 --> 00:34:30,256
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

368
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:38,155
My sister has a car.

369
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,997
A Valiant.

370
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:47,599
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.

371
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:51,544
My sister has
a green Valiant.

372
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:01,221
I ride the bus
all day long.

373
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:04,417
( Laughing )

374
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:07,188
I have
a disability card...

375
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:09,594
so I don't have to pay.

376
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:12,258
( Laughing )

377
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:50,003
( Girl ) Daddy !

378
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:17,527
( Phone Rings )

379
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,368
Hello.
Mary Manning.

380
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,235
Hello?

381
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:37,113
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey ! Get in the car.

382
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:40,086
Okay, we're late.

383
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,089
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

384
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:44,125
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

385
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:46,626
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

386
00:36:46,695 --> 00:36:50,222
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

387
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:52,858
- A party?
- Girls.

388
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:56,495
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--

389
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,505
- ln the joint,
- Yeah?

390
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:01,701
did you get
butt-fucked?

391
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:04,176
It only hurts
the first time.

392
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:05,542
I know.

393
00:37:07,716 --> 00:37:12,346
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

394
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,288
# I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #

395
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:20,419
# I was born a cowboy
And a cowboy I will die #

396
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:24,397
- # I was born a cowboy
And I'll die #
- Yee-hoo !

397
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:28,402
# I will die before my time
But then my kind always do #

398
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,703
# I will die before my time
I will die ##

399
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:38,007
- ( Laughing )
- ( Sunny ) Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

400
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,947
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter...

401
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,211
and let the sunlight in.
Verna !

402
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,219
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

403
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,812
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's !

404
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,881
- I didn't know. Is she goin' ?
- Of course she's goin'.

405
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:56,791
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

406
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:59,925
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

407
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,232
What difference does it make?
Geez.

408
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:05,932
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

409
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:09,465
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

410
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:12,308
( Woman ) Hey !

411
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,315
The train's
a-movin' on.

412
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:18,147
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

413
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:22,349
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

414
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:25,154
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...

415
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:29,356
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

416
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:31,365
That's your spirituality.

417
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,960
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

418
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:38,028
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

419
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:41,473
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

420
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:46,446
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

421
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:50,109
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

422
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:52,119
you don't give it to them.

423
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:56,021
Not once have I seen you
do that.

424
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,650
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

425
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:00,557
Okay. Well--
( Laughing )

426
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:02,960
## ( Jazz )

427
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:08,024
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?

428
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:10,730
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

429
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,466
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

430
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,873
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

431
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:18,310
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half--

432
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,745
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

433
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:24,148
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

434
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:26,210
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.

435
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:29,279
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.

436
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:31,086
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.

437
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,889
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.
- ( Girls Giggling )

438
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:36,988
# Can't last #

439
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:41,331
# Any time
Any place #

440
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:46,396
This-- This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?

441
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:49,272
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.

442
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:52,939
- We can see the bar really good.
- ( Laughing )

443
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:56,381
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.

444
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,919
After years of bullshit,

445
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:02,548
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.

446
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:04,854
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around...

447
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:07,190
on a,
on a piece of canvass--

448
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:08,923
- Paper.
- Paper.

449
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:12,262
You were trying
to represent God.

450
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:17,100
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

451
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,436
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

452
00:40:20,508 --> 00:40:22,874
She looks for God
and she finds,

453
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:25,845
she finds herself.

454
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:29,008
( Laughing )

455
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,151
( Laughing Continues )

456
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:40,388
Whoo !

457
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,658
( Verna ) Ate all the clams
in the house, did you?

458
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,690
( Jennifer ) Oh, don't torture

( Laughing, Cheering, Hooting )

772
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:45,408
Go for it !
Go for it !

773
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:54,348
( Audience Hooting, Laughing )

774

# If you eat too much
Oh, oh #

775
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,791
# You'll awake
with a tummy ache #

776
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:10,529
# On the good ship Lollipop
It's a nice trip ##

( Laughing, Shouting )

778
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:20,835

Freddy, come on !

( Dog Barking )

780
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:38,995
- Mmm.
- ( Giggling )

781
01:13:39,065 --> 01:13:41,898
You tickled me !
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.

782
01:13:41,967 --> 01:13:44,765
I really wanna fuck you.
Stop !

783
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,738
First I gotta play you
this song I wrote. Okay?

784
01:13:47,807 --> 01:13:49,798
Song?

785
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,934
Gimme that bottle.

786
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,002
Oh.

787
01:13:57,416 --> 01:14:02,410
Okay. I hope you like this
'cause I wrote this just for you.

788
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:06,015
Don't let me go to sleep.
I got business tonight.

I won't ask why #

( Phone Ringing )

810
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:40,311
( Coughs )

811
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:43,815
- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.

812
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:47,910
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.

813
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:51,787
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need--

814
01:16:53,759 --> 01:16:58,856
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.

815
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:03,493
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.

816
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:05,127
What?

817
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:08,662
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,

818
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:13,405
it feels real big
like it's driving me.

819
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:21,577
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.

820
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:26,988
And there's a crosswalk.
( Breathes Deeply )

821
01:17:28,794 --> 01:17:33,163
And all these little kids
are being...

822
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,998
h-helped across
by a crossing guard.

823
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:41,265
The crossing guard
is John Booth.

824
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:46,811
Em's one
of the little kids.

825
01:17:51,817 --> 01:17:56,880
I'm gettin'...
closer and closer.

826
01:17:56,956 --> 01:18:00,392
And I'm...
I'm hittin' the brakes.

827
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,689
The car won't slow down.

828
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:07,755
( Sobbing ) I'm turning the wheel...
but the car won't turn.

829
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,597
Oh, Freddy.

830
01:18:13,072 --> 01:18:15,370
Freddy.

831
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:19,878
Then I just plow
right through... through 'em.

832
01:18:21,814 --> 01:18:23,645
Then I--

833
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:28,278
Then I see Em's face...

834
01:18:28,354 --> 01:18:31,289
just, just before...

835
01:18:31,357 --> 01:18:33,484
just before I hit her.

836
01:18:33,559 --> 01:18:38,019
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.

837
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:41,589
( Whispering )
Come on. Come on.

838
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,660
Come on.

839
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:55,245
( Dog Barking )

840
01:19:25,144 --> 01:19:27,635
Two coffees.

841
01:19:27,713 --> 01:19:29,943
Sit there.

842
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:40,224
( Sighs )

843
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:43,352
Oh, Freddy.

844
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:52,336
( Sighs )
Mary, I--

845
01:19:52,404 --> 01:19:56,204
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.

846
01:19:58,444 --> 01:20:03,177
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.

847
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:09,581
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

848
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:16,858
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

849
01:20:16,929 --> 01:20:19,159
I did see you...

850
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,131
( Sighs )

851
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,897
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

852
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,943
I can see
you're a good man.

853
01:20:34,012 --> 01:20:37,880
And you loved her
so, so much.

854
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:42,046
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

855
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:45,454
I needed you so badly.

856
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,027
But you--

857
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:06,673
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,

858
01:21:06,745 --> 01:21:10,181
and the wind, God--
( Sighs )

859
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:13,150
The plane was bouncing
all around.

860
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,347
I thought--

861
01:21:17,422 --> 01:21:20,516
I was shaking.

862
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:23,152
Do you remember
what you said?

863
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:27,990
No.

864
01:21:30,269 --> 01:21:32,203
Uh, tell me.

865
01:21:32,271 --> 01:21:35,138
- ( Waitress ) Anything else?
- No, thanks.

866
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:38,370
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

867
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:41,606
And you took my hand
and you said-- Do you remember?

868
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:45,674
No, no.
Tell me.

869
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:51,047
You said,
"Pray we crash.

870
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:54,559
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."

871
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:56,685
( Chuckles )

872
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,791
You were so--
( Sighs )

873
01:22:03,368 --> 01:22:05,962
Where'd that guy go?

874
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:13,441
Then Emmy died.

875
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:20,847
It's--

876
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:23,547
It's made you so small
and weak.

877
01:22:27,726 --> 01:22:31,594
I needed you
to be big and strong.

878
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:35,824
I hated you
for your weakness.

879
01:22:35,901 --> 01:22:38,233
I hated you.

880
01:22:40,806 --> 01:22:44,242
Now I'm pitying you.

881
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:51,277
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

882
01:22:56,521 --> 01:23:00,787
( Chuckles )

883
01:23:00,859 --> 01:23:04,955
You look around...

884
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:08,727
at the marriages
people have.

885
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,236
We had a good one,
didn't we?

886
01:23:13,672 --> 01:23:15,640
Yes.

887
01:23:15,707 --> 01:23:18,301
Good times.

888
01:23:18,377 --> 01:23:21,039
No hidden agendas.

889
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:26,885
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

890
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:32,380
( Sighs )
We were turned on.

891
01:23:32,457 --> 01:23:35,290
We were hot
for one another.

892
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:42,459
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

893
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:44,399
Best buddies.

894
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:54,009
( Sighs ) Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

895
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,276
No.

896
01:23:57,349 --> 01:23:59,544
No.

897
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:06,523
( Chuckles )

898
01:24:06,591 --> 01:24:08,821
No, but...

899
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:18,860
you pity me.

900
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:22,673
( Chuckles )

901
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,541
( Sighs )
You pity me.

902
01:24:38,256 --> 01:24:41,054
Oh, boy, this is a--

903
01:24:41,126 --> 01:24:44,527
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this--

904
01:24:44,596 --> 01:24:48,032
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

905
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,160
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."

906
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:55,039
I hope you die.

907
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:59,305
I hope you fucking die.

908
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,658
Come on ! Come on !

909
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:26,931
Come on !
Come on !

910
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:30,771
( Tires Screeching )

911
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:53,956
( Siren Wailing )

912
01:25:54,032 --> 01:25:58,935
( Policeman ) Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

913
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:11,273
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

914
01:26:11,349 --> 01:26:13,647
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

915
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:16,414
Step back here.

916
01:26:18,223 --> 01:26:20,589
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

917
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:23,457
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

918
01:26:23,528 --> 01:26:25,689
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

919
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,629
No.

920
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:29,929
Spread your feet for me.

921
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:33,300
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

922
01:26:33,371 --> 01:26:35,362
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

923
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,568
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

924
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:42,101
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

925
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:45,206
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

926
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,581
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

927
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:50,052
( Policeman ) Put your hands down
for me.

928
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:53,990
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

929
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:56,152
It's loaded?
Okay.

930
01:26:56,228 --> 01:26:58,628
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

931
01:26:58,697 --> 01:27:01,860
Yes, sir.

932
01:27:01,933 --> 01:27:03,298
Here,
just hand it to me.

933
01:27:03,368 --> 01:27:05,893
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so--

934
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,304
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.

935
01:27:09,374 --> 01:27:11,365
Have you had anything
to drink?

936
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:16,005
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

937
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:18,447
All right.

938
01:27:18,517 --> 01:27:22,214
We're gonna conduct a few tests
to see how much your ability
to operate a motor vehicle...

939
01:27:22,287 --> 01:27:24,380
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.

940
01:27:24,456 --> 01:27:27,550
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.

941
01:27:27,626 --> 01:27:32,188
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

942
01:27:32,264 --> 01:27:35,495
Okay, I want you to tiIt
your head back and close your eyes.

943
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:40,231
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

944
01:27:40,305 --> 01:27:42,535
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.

945
01:27:42,607 --> 01:27:46,509
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

946
01:27:46,578 --> 01:27:49,274
Let's do
the left finger again.

947
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,907
- Okay, sir. Put your hands
down at your side.
- Permit's good.

948
01:27:51,983 --> 01:27:54,144
The permit's good?
Okay.

949
01:27:54,219 --> 01:27:56,619
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.

950
01:27:58,924 --> 01:28:02,553
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.

951
01:28:02,627 --> 01:28:06,825
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.

952
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:08,866
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

953
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:12,631
When you get down here, I want
you to turn around and take ten
steps back. You understand?

954
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:15,264
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

955
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:18,673
One, two, three,

956
01:28:18,743 --> 01:28:23,373
four, five, six,

957
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:27,350
seven, eight, nine, ten.

958
01:28:27,419 --> 01:28:30,479
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

959
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,921
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,

960
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:35,016
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.

961
01:28:35,093 --> 01:28:38,859
So, turn around, put your hands
behind your back. You're
under arrest for drunk driving.

962
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:41,364
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

963
01:28:42,601 --> 01:28:45,866
Freeze ! Stop !
Jesus.

964
01:28:46,304 --> 01:28:48,397
Show us in foot pursuit.

965
01:28:48,473 --> 01:28:50,998
( Policewoman ) 14-0-9. We're in

01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:50,463
- Police officers, sir. Police !
- ( Man ) What's going on?

972
01:29:50,535 --> 01:29:53,732
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?

973
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,864
( Man ) I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.

974
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:59,842
- ( Policewoman )
Hey, the back door's open.
- ( Man ) I got kids here.

975
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,042
( Policeman ) Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.

976
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:09,416
Just stay with us.

Honey, you all right?

979
01:30:24,569 --> 01:30:28,164
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?

980
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:31,470
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.

981
01:30:31,543 --> 01:30:34,944
( Policeman ) We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.

982
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:38,949
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.

983
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:50,286
Good night, sweetheart.

Gonna give you a laugh,
kid.

992
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:36,485
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

993
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:39,257
The whole bit.

994

You wanna guess
what for?

995
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,640
Drunk driving.
( Chuckles )

996
01:33:53,444 --> 01:33:57,073
Drunk driving.

997
01:33:57,148 --> 01:33:59,878
And I had my gun.

998
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:09,725
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...

I'm on the run,

I'm on your property
and I got my gun.

1001
01:34:16,701 --> 01:34:20,967
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

So, I'm gonna--

1003

I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.

1004

And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.

( Woman ) This just isn't working
for you out here.

Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

1013
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:12,566
- ( Man ) I don't understand.
- ( Woman ) What don't you understand?

1014
01:37:12,643 --> 01:37:15,407
I come out here. I see you
don't have a cent to your name.
I wanna know what you're doing.

1015
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,347
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

1016
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,510
( Man ) I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?

1017
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,713
( Man ) If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

1018
01:37:29,794 --> 01:37:33,787
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.

1019
01:37:33,865 --> 01:37:37,528
- ( Woman ) I don't understand
what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.

- ( Woman ) I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

1021
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,905
- ( Woman ) Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

1022
01:37:41,973 --> 01:37:46,034
( Woman ) Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

1023
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,307
( Woman ) It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

1024
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,042
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

1025
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,085
- lf it's gonna be this major thing--
- It is a major thing.

1026
01:37:55,153 --> 01:37:59,954
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?

1027
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:02,288
( Woman ) That's easy.
That's what you always do.

1028
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:05,056
Not right now.
That's it?

1029
01:38:11,002 --> 01:38:14,096
- Whatever, okay?
I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?

1030
01:38:14,172 --> 01:38:16,106
You don't listen.

- What am I doing? I have a job.

I'm working for, you know.

1033
01:38:22,613 --> 01:38:27,277
- ( Woman ) For what?
- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.

1034
01:38:27,351 --> 01:38:31,048
( Man ) So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

like so high. So I don't have a car !

- ( Woman ) What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?

1037
01:38:38,296 --> 01:38:40,890
- It's telemarketing.
What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?

1038
01:38:40,965 --> 01:38:43,490
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.
