1
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:24,542
He didn't get a chance to graduate
from high school. It was a blow.

2
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,811
It destroyed me.
It made me feel like..

3
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,250
I was afraid
to love anybody.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,620
I was really afraid
to let people get close to me.

5
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,819
I felt
if I loved somebody,

6
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:40,556
deeply, you know,
like I do my family,

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,996
they would be taken away.

8
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:27,209
I said, "Where'd you learn
to do that?"

9
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,973
She said, "Practicing on
an old flame since I was 16."

10
00:01:32,249 --> 00:01:36,982
Look at this guy here. He's lookin' at
me and beatin' his meat. I like that.

11
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:41,649
There she is. Right?
Miss America, 1912.

12
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,558
Ina!
Let's hear it for lna.

13
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,687
Comes here every night,
huh, sweetie?

14
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:49,391
Right.
Let me have a kiss.

15
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,162
Bring out the broads!

16
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,169
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

17
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,228
Somebody throw a net
over this broad.

18
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,206
Did you see him kiss
that fat fucker?

19
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:02,206
He, uh..

20
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:07,410
He was killed by a drunk driver just
a month before he was to graduate.

21
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,418
And..

22
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,819
"Your daughter's dead."

23
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:18,258
I op.. I opened the door
and I saw 'em standing there,

24
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:20,762
and I said,
"Mandy's dead, isn't she?"

25
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,730
A mom knows.

26
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:42,146
All right!

27
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:45,210
Freddy, he's comin' over here.
You better slide in.. a lot.

28
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:48,587
- He needs half a booth.
- Sunny. How ya doin', Sunny?
Everything good?

29
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,561
How 'bout that?
How'd you like to spank it?

30
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,189
- Nice!
- Oh, yeah! But softly.

31
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:58,257
- Sunny, you had to spank that, right?
- Nice.

32
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:01,031
My wife,
you know Joan.

33
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,733
We got a step-down living room.
It's like two steps down.

34
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:07,436
So the bitch don't wanna walk.
She wants me to raise it.

35
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,740
She don't wanna walk down
two steps.

36
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:12,441
I still have to get over that.
It's something that..

37
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:16,508
- you have to work with on a daily basis.
- It's not gonna come back.

38
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:21,046
It's just something of.. It's yours.
It's like your body lost..

39
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,854
something inside,
something of yourself.

40
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,623
I miss me.

41
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:30,132
I miss.. me.

42
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,294
It's over five years now,
and..

43
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,830
I look in the mirror,
"Where's Bobby?"

44
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,465
I don't know.

45
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,807
My family drives me
up the fuckin' wall.

46
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,543
I mean, they, I guess they still,
they still think I'm me, Bobby.

47
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:52,020
But.. they joke about it.

48
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:56,991
They call me..
sibling number three, all right?

49
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,088
And.. it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

50
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,725
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.

51
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:09,704
And..

52
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:13,641
he was sibling number one.

53
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,645
And..

54
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:21,081
they, th-they didn't..

55
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,711
Did they forget?
I don't know.

56
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,381
I'm gone!

57
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,392
And..

58
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:34,387
I miss me.

59
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,428
So..

60
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:42,266
that's it.

61
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,200
Who's runnin'
this fuckin' show?

62
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,146
- You oughta go.
- What?

63
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,148
Go.

64
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,811
- You should go.
- Okay, yeah. I'm gonna go.

65
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,580
Um.. Freddy,
can I use your shower?

66
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:37,649
Help yourself.

67
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,171
Jefferey.

68
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:20,204
It's five after 10:00. I got a window
display of gray felt. What's goin' on?

69
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:23,218
Mr. Gale, you took all the vault keys
home last night.

70
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:26,744
- For fuck sakes.
- I think..

71
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:29,485
it would be wonderful to put emerald
pieces in front of the diamonds.

72
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,826
I trust your preference
in stones, Jefferey, but..

73
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:36,956
I'm very busy,
you know what I mean?

74
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,092
All the time,
I'm very busy.

75
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:42,399
So, uh, think ahead
a little bit.

76
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:45,066
I'm walkin' out the door,
you're closin' up,

77
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,666
you don't have the vault keys
in your pocket, stop me.

78
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,268
Yes, sir.

79
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,813
Emeralds in the front.
Wonderful.

80
00:12:25,635 --> 00:12:28,968
What's so funny?

81
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:35,303
What are you
laughing at?

82
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,846
Ah, it's been
six fucking years!

83
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:40,678
I mean, I have my son here.
Can't I be happy?

84
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,810
I've never heard
that word out of your mouth.

85
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,480
And in front of John.

86
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:49,991
Ma!
I've been in prison.

87
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:54,655
Don't make excuses for him.
Listen, do you still have
that little TV I sent you?

88
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,358
- Yeah. It's in the box.
- Oh, good, because..

89
00:12:57,433 --> 00:13:00,596
I'm cleaning out the trailer for you
if you want some privacy.

90
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,831
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.

91
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:06,363
- Or you could stay in your own room.
- No, no, no. Trailer's great.

92
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,547
Because that's
a good fucking TV.

93
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,348
Oh, my God!

94
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:19,511
Freddy.
How's it goin'?

95
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:25,944
Roger.
Good to see you.

96
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:28,115
Come in.

97
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:37,194
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

98
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,565
- Phil, yeah. Let me call
you back in five minutes.
- No, I'm fine.

99
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:43,628
All right. Thank you.
I'm sorry?

100
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:46,834
Uh, no, thank you.

101
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:53,212
Emily really loved
this thing.

102
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:59,244
We used to keep it
over there on the counter.

103
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:06,792
Stretch her whole body out
trying to reach it.

104
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,922
Last joint
on her little finger.

105
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,809
What?

106
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,209
N-Nothin'.

107
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,382
Come in.
Sit down, Freddy.

108
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,557
Boy. Tch.

109
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,226
You really look like a natural family.
You could be their father.

110
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:51,865
Thank you, Freddy.

111
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,570
Spectacular looking family,
really.

112
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:03,815
Um, what can I, uh,
do for you?

113
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:09,253
I really came to see Mary.

114
00:16:09,325 --> 00:16:14,991
Oh. Well, I don't mean to be
nosy, Freddy, but what about?

115
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:18,830
Well, I'd really rather
talk to Mary about that.

116
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,762
Well..

117
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,441
Well, well, well.

118
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:35,575
- Um, you sure I can't
get you something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

119
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,279
- Anyway, I think they're here.
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:45,926
Hold on, guys.

121
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,620
Hold on.

122
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,722
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, guys.

123
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,199
- Hi, Freddy.
- Hi, darling.

124
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,329
- We've got a visitor.
- Come on, Dad.

125
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,445
Well..

126
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,680
look at this.

127
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:14,488
My own kids
call me Freddy.

128
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,324
- You look wonderful.
- Wonderful, I think,
would be pushing it.

129
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:25,993
No, you do.
You look wonderful.

130
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,836
Thank you.

131
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:35,207
So, how's business?

132
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,837
So-so.

133
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

134
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,479
It's business.

135
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

136
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

137
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,953
I'm still representing
some properties.

138
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,565
But Roger's been doing
so well, I've been able

139
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:58,125
to back off some. Spend
more time with the kids.

140
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh, well, wonderful.

141
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:07,175
That's, uh, yeah..
That's, uh, really wonderful.

142
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,939
Um..

143
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,980
Um..

144
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

145
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:21,654
It's the reason
I came here.

146
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,557
- Freddy..
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

147
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

148
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:34,166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

149
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:38,696
And I have great news.
That's two.

150
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

151
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

152
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

153
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,382
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

154
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

155
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

156
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,266
He's out.

157
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:09,270
John Booth is out.

158
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,272
I'm gonna kill him.

159
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,205
Get out of here, Freddy.

160
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

161
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

162
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

163
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,349
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

164
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

165
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,849
I must never mention
my daughter!

166
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:34,191
- Get out of our house!
- This is my house.

167
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,596
By any natural law,
this is my house!

168
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,193
If my children live here,
my children,

169
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

170
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you!

171
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

172
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,750
Where do you get off calling
them your children?

173
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:54,343
You haven't been a
father to those kids.

174
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

175
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,420
Yes, Emily. Emily!
And she is dead.

176
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

177
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't!

178
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,527
Freddy, I want you
to leave our home..

179
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:18,039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth!
- Let go of him!

180
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened!

181
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,646
- Let go of him!
- Freddy!

182
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:29,172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

183
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,049
Come on.

184
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,147
Coffee. Good.

185
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:37,385
I'd like some coffee.

186
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:42,419
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

187
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,262
Come on.

188
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,929
You know what?

189
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,867
I don't want any coffee.
I..

190
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,877
- I don't like coffee at all.
- It makes my heart..

191
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

192
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,183
You sure?

193
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:10,453
Yes. Uh.. no.

194
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,756
I'm gonna go.

195
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,922
I feel good.

196
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:24,862
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't..
- Jesus, God, Roger.

197
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,875
I just want to say this.

198
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

199
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,043
A lot of things.

200
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:37,575
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

201
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:41,089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

202
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:45,354
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong!

203
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you!

204
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:52,228
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

205
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

206
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back..

207
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,499
no matter what you do!

208
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,603
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

209
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,807
Why?

210
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

211
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,816
I went on my own time,
Mary.. in private.

212
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

213
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

214
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

215
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:28,432
What color is it?

216
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

217
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:34,968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

218
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,484
That's what I thought.

219
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:50,752
Roger, man to man,

220
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,192
when you two read
in the newspaper..

221
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

222
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:01,869
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

223
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

224
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,370
So, listen to me.

225
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

226
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

227
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

228
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,575
So, I told 'em.

229
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:24,847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

230
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.

231
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,126
What was he doin' in the mens' room?

232
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

233
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

234
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy!

235
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:48,208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

236
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head..

237
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:59,485
over a period of days?

238
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

239
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:06,150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

240
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:09,026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

241
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

242
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,130
Enjoyed it..

243
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:22,600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

244
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:27,172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- No.
He means some other night.

245
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,945
Take my advice, Freddy.

246
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:32,919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

247
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

248
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:50,366
Freddy, where you goin'?
It's only 11:00.

249
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,202
Oh, man.

250
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,208
Commitments.

251
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner!

252
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,521
Pride and relief, Mary.

253
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:20,988
Goddamn it!

254
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,923
Goddamn it!

255
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:27,860
Fuckin'..
Fuckin' clip is empty.

256
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,592
This fuckin' gun ain't got
no fuckin' clip. You cock.

257
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:39,106
All right
I get a cigarette?

258
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,111
All right.

259
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,893
You know..

260
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:04,629
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

261
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

262
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,922
When the thing happened,

263
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,554
I wanted to be dead.

264
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,427
But there wasn't..
You know.

265
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,837
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

266
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

267
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,449
But..

268
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,527
I guess you, uh..

269
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:11,055
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

270
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,896
It's all right.
Sit down.

271
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,374
Sit down.

272
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,073
I know it's been
a long wait.

273
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:28,274
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

274
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm not callin' any cops.

275
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:39,322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

276
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,030
Would you maybe,
you know..

277
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,939
Would you take
a couple days..

278
00:30:57,012 --> 00:31:00,038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

279
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,084
Look.

280
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:07,884
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

281
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:12,484
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

282
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,358
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

283
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,890
Shut up! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't!

284
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,294
All right.

285
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:44,219
I'm gonna give you
three days.

286
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,351
Three days.

287
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

288
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,429
Son of a bitch!

289
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,372
And up. Let's go!

290
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

291
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:11,815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

292
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,014
Front and back.
And step.

293
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

294
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,661
Don't you understand?

295
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:34,868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

296
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,968
You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

297
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,775
I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

298
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:43,045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

299
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

300
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

301
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring..

302
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

303
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:58,458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

304
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:03,766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

305
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

306
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:09,207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

307
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:12,804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

308
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:16,044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

309
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:22,021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

310
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,191
Ahh.

311
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

312
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,990
A perfect fucking seven.

313
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:55,780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

314
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,692
Pardon?

315
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:05,324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

316
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:12,036
I don't know.

317
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

318
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,903
I don't know.

319
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

320
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:35,185
My sister has a car.

321
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,027
A Valiant.

322
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,629
- Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
- No.

323
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

324
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:58,251
I ride the bus
all day long.

325
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,218
I have
a disability card..

326
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,624
so I don't have to pay.

327
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,033
Daddy!

328
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,398
Hello.
Mary Manning.

329
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,265
Hello?

330
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:34,143
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey! Get in the car.

331
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,116
Okay, we're late.

332
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:39,119
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

333
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,155
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

334
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

335
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

336
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,888
- A party?
- Girls.

337
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:53,525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until..

338
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,535
- In the joint,
- Yeah?

339
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:58,731
Did you get
butt-fucked?

340
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,206
It only hurts
the first time.

341
00:37:01,275 --> 00:37:02,572
I know.

342
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:35,037
Take your hands out
of your pockets. Let's hear it.

343
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:38,977
That's Verna. Come on, now.
Let's open up your sphincter..

344
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna!

345
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,249
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

346
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's!

347
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,911
- I didn't know. Is she goin'?
- Of course she's goin'.

348
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

349
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

350
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

351
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

352
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

353
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,338
Hey!

354
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,345
The train's
a-movin' on.

355
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,177
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

356
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:19,379
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

357
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:22,184
And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion..

358
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:26,386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

359
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,395
That's your spirituality.

360
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:31,990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

361
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:35,058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

362
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:38,503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

363
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:43,476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

364
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:47,139
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

365
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,149
you don't give it to them.

366
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

367
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

368
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,587
Okay. Well..

369
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:05,054
Nine is taken.
I'll give him 22. Okay?

370
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,760
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

371
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,496
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

372
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,903
Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

373
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,340
It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half..

374
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,775
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

375
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,178
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

376
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,240
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.

377
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,309
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.

378
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:28,116
Come on, girls.
Look how beautiful they are.

379
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:30,919
- You're always with
pretty girls, Mr. Gale.

380
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:43,426
This.. This is, uh,
a nice table, huh?

381
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:46,302
- It's fine. Fine.
- I guess.

382
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:49,969
We can see the bar really good.

383
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:53,411
Forgive me. I have this painting.
Jojo did this painting.

384
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,949
After years of bullshit,

385
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,578
I'm sorry, finally reaches a point
where she does this incredible work.

386
00:39:59,654 --> 00:40:01,884
She smears herself with paint,
she rolls herself around..

387
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:04,220
on a,
on a piece of canvass..

388
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,953
- Paper.
- Paper.

389
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:09,292
You were trying
to represent God.

390
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:14,130
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

391
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,466
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

392
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,904
She looks for God
and she finds,

393
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:22,875
she finds herself.

394
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:37,418
Whoo!

395
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:40,688
Ate all the clams
in the house, did you?

396
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:44,720
Oh, don't torture
yourself, sweetheart.

397
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:47,029
She wants to be your woman,
motherfucker.

398
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:50,070
- Better watch your ass.
- Come on!

399
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:52,071
Go easy now.

400
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,404
You girls seem to be having
a good time. You must be a funny guy.

401
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:57,410
I'm a riot.

402
00:40:57,478 --> 00:41:01,539
- Now get the fuck outta here.
- I didn't mean anything.
I just stopped by, having fun.

403
00:41:01,616 --> 00:41:05,017
- Nothin' personal.
- Go have your fun somewhere else.
Just get the fuck outta here.

404
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:07,088
Relax. I don't mean any
offense by this. I

405
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:09,113
just thought maybe you'd
like extra help here.

406
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,318
You got some pretty girls here.
Maybe you need some help.

407
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:15,157
- I don't need no fuckin' help!
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:17,163
Take it easy!
Hey, hey!

409
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:29,739
Are we having fun now,
you motherfucker?

410
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,517
- You had to drag me into this?
- Not to put too fine
a point on it, but..

411
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,752
you know
something about confinement.

412
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:48,921
- I think we all know
something about confinement.
- Well, there's confinement..

413
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:51,965
and there's..
confinement.

414
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,933
I know what you mean.

415
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:58,529
Yeah, at the risk of sounding like
I know what I'm talking about,

416
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,399
I think freedom's overrated.

417
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:06,844
What you're talking about.

418
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:10,406
You know, if there isn't
something bigger than, uh,

419
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,475
than freedom,

420
00:42:12,553 --> 00:42:15,545
then freedom
is just entertainment.

421
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,113
Entertainment?

422
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:28,997
- Like a central computer, you mean?
- We transmit downtown.

423
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,198
- Everybody?
- Everybody that gets booked.

424
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:35,106
- Murderers too?
- Especially murderers.

425
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:39,237
- Ever do any murders?
- Not personally. Have you?

426
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:52,022
Hmm.

427
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:58,331
You all right?

428
00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:01,698
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I'm just..

429
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,841
No, I'm f..
You know, fine.

430
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:11,811
I'm John.

431
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:14,404
I know.
I'm Jojo.

432
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:18,919
- You know. You know about me?
- Peter told me.

433
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:21,250
Mmm.

434
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:29,021
The father of the, uh,

435
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:33,857
the girl I killed,
he threatened to kill me last night.

436
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:37,636
It was an accident,
right?

437
00:43:39,507 --> 00:43:42,203
Was he serious?
You, you.. Serious?

438
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:45,211
I think he was serious.

439
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,747
I think he's a serious man.

440
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:52,176
You're the only person
I've told.

441
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:55,188
Why?

442
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,048
Well, I..

443
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,058
I think I thought
it would be romantic.

444
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:14,073
Why would you
want to be romantic?

445
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,880
How'd you get
that scar on your head?

446
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:29,116
Banged my head
against the wall.

447
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,626
- In jail?
- Uh-huh.

448
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:36,861
You or somebody else?

449
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:40,425
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,765
You just couldn't stand jail?

451
00:44:42,837 --> 00:44:46,136
No. I just couldn't
stand me.

452
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:56,873
Yeah, I was gonna call, but
it got so late, I didn't think
you guys would be up.

453
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:58,816
Of course we're up!

454
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,320
You just got home.
We want to see you.

455
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:06,059
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh..

456
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:09,562
- I got the job.
- Ah, good.

457
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,657
And Peter and his brother threw me
a coming-home party.

458
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,725
The day
just kinda happened.

459
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:20,069
- When do you start on the boat?
- Actually in a few hours.

460
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,938
Why do you stay out so late
before you start a job?

461
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,106
Your friends don't care
if you get any rest.

462
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:32,050
Something hit me tonight.

463
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:34,587
It was a strange night.

464
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,893
You know, uh,

465
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,068
I've done a horrible thing.

466
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:50,933
And, uh,

467
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:53,974
I'm always
gonna feel the guilt..

468
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,168
and remorse.

469
00:45:57,344 --> 00:45:59,904
But..

470
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:05,685
when you hear about
a thing like that,

471
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:10,713
about someone who has
to carry a thing like that,

472
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:16,221
when you're in it,
it's just, it's..

473
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:24,368
It's very different..

474
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,339
from what you might think.

475
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:33,672
I'm not an unhappy person.

476
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:38,650
I'm just..
I'm just..

477
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,179
I'm someone who has caused
a lot of.. unhappiness.

478
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:48,023
And a person
who's caused death.

479
00:46:57,071 --> 00:47:01,030
I, uh,
I love you..

480
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:04,737
both so much.

481
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:09,408
Not just as my parents,
but..

482
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:12,577
as two people who,

483
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:17,215
who stood by
and kept giving..

484
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:23,290
your love.. to that person.

485
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,134
That person..

486
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,539
who has also caused you both
so much pain.

487
00:47:34,608 --> 00:47:39,545
You're our son.
Of course we love you.

488
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,581
No matter what.

489
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,753
Let's get this straight,
girl. Everyone gets paid by the hour.

490
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:54,522
- Listen, I'll see you in a bit.
- Ah, Jefferey. Thank you.
Here, hold this.

491
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:57,063
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

492
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:00,623
I'm, uh,
I'm fuckin' delighted.

493
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:05,738
- Please. We can do
a fashion show outside.
- Thank you.

494
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:08,639
- Who is that, Jefferey?
- It's my boyfriend Gene.

495
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,870
- Did you get the car?
- Yeah. The car's outside.

496
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:13,970
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
Okay. All right.
- Finally!

497
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:17,381
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fuckin' great.

498
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:21,885
- Thank you.
- I can't get this thing.

499
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:25,185
- Where's the fuckin' car?
- Over there.

500
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,695
- Same time tomorrow?
- Same, same.

501
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:16,398
All right. See you then. Hey.

502
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:18,440
- Thanks for coming all the way out here.
- Don't worry about it, man.

503
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,909
I've got a sailor
in every port.

504
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:25,937
- Do you know where we're goin'?
- Yeah, I got, I got directions.

505
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,313
Oh, grand.

506
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:34,623
So, John,

507
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:37,819
you know, there's women
and there's ladies.

508
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:41,360
- Jojo's a lady.
- Yep.

509
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,768
- So, did you fuck her?
- What do you do
with information like this?

510
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,366
What do you think I do? You see
the way I live. Counting angry lovers.

511
00:49:53,443 --> 00:49:57,743
Watching bad cartoons.
Gotta give me somethin'.

512
00:50:20,503 --> 00:50:24,064
Hey!

513
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:30,369
You're it!

514
00:51:13,022 --> 00:51:15,354
Come on, boys.

515
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:17,916
Let's go.

516
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:46,849
And now I'd like to introduce

517
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:48,981
our next artist from Steubenville, Ohio.

518
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:52,653
I'm tellin' you that so tonight
you go home and hump your map.

519
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:19,587
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

520
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,472
"Beautiful girls."

521
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:24,469
You go in there,
you're gonna fall in love.

522
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:34,580
My wife..

523
00:54:38,828 --> 00:54:41,228
is a beautiful woman.

524
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:47,625
I met her in the sun.
S-Sun, sun.

525
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:50,831
Sunny sun.

526
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:54,635
I could never
fall in love at night.

527
00:55:13,462 --> 00:55:15,896
You wanna dance
with the muchachas?

528
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:18,559
Twenty-one dollars.

529
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:23,993
Did you call
the police?

530
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:28,132
No.

531
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:30,138
No?

532
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:35,776
Do you wanna die?

533
00:56:38,714 --> 00:56:41,239
I don't know.

534
00:56:43,786 --> 00:56:45,913
Did you see her die?

535
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,694
No.

536
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,338
I was drunk.

537
00:57:08,277 --> 00:57:11,178
I didn't know
what happened.

538
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:19,351
I just felt a bump.

539
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:23,859
And when I stopped, I knew something
had happened. I just didn't know.

540
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:35,260
She was lying
in the street..

541
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:39,638
all torn up.

542
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:45,444
And I could see her..

543
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:48,415
moving a little bit.

544
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:55,316
Her mouth
was kind of moving.

545
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:58,485
I thought she was
talking to someone.

546
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:04,730
You know,

547
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,236
someone
who wasn't there.

548
00:58:08,304 --> 00:58:10,795
You know, someone..

549
00:58:12,775 --> 00:58:16,108
like her mother,
her father.

550
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:23,646
When I got up to her,
I, uh,

551
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:27,120
I kinda knelt down,

552
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:33,728
and she wasn't talkin'
to someone else.

553
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:36,959
She was talkin' to me.

554
00:58:39,235 --> 00:58:42,568
She was apologizing to me.

555
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:50,073
She was apologizing
for not having looked both ways.

556
00:58:57,753 --> 00:59:02,952
And there were some people who were..
gathering around there.

557
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:08,361
Somebody called
for an ambulance, so I..

558
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:17,271
They found me on the interstate.
I'd gone up north.

559
00:59:21,043 --> 00:59:25,412
I just got in my car
and I drove until I ran out of gas.

560
00:59:46,569 --> 00:59:49,732
You have
such a beautiful face.

561
00:59:55,544 --> 00:59:58,536
The way your eyes
slope.

562
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,440
- Like a little puppy.
- I'm sorry.

563
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:05,146
Don't say that.

564
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:44,519
I think..

565
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:54,762
that your guilt..

566
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:58,466
is a little too much
competition for me.

567
01:01:00,175 --> 01:01:02,643
You should let me know..

568
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:06,670
when you want life.

569
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:23,013
You are such
an asshole.

570
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,855
Where did you go?

571
01:03:44,006 --> 01:03:47,203
I mean, like, what do you think?

572
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:57,583
Like you can just get up and go
in the middle of the night..

573
01:03:57,653 --> 01:04:03,182
and go your merry fucking way,
and then stumble back in here
like it's not rude?

574
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:10,094
Like I don't have
any feelings.

575
01:04:11,734 --> 01:04:14,601
And this means..

576
01:04:16,038 --> 01:04:18,973
I have no emotions..

577
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:23,711
and I'm a whore.

578
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:28,777
And I liked you.

579
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:32,787
You know, I don't fuck
many guys. You know?

580
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:28,226
Goal!

581
01:06:55,664 --> 01:06:57,655
Who is it?

582
01:06:57,733 --> 01:07:00,531
It's John.

583
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:23,683
What's goin' on?

584
01:07:28,163 --> 01:07:30,529
What is guilt?

585
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:34,660
What?

586
01:07:34,736 --> 01:07:38,399
You said guilt.
My guilt, my guilt.

587
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:41,874
What is guilt?
Define it.

588
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:58,555
Do you wanna dance?

589
01:08:07,402 --> 01:08:09,336
Let's dance.

590
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:08,481
Our next entertainer, our next
performer, a wonderful artist
here from Selma, Alabama.

591
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:11,883
Let's have a great big welcome
for Mia! Let's hear it.

592
01:11:22,864 --> 01:11:25,765
This is what I hate.
I hate this fuckin' number.

593
01:11:25,834 --> 01:11:30,271
It takes her four or five
minutes to get the flash off her
for me to see a little titty.

594
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:33,774
And in the meantime,
I've gotta listen to this music.

595
01:11:33,842 --> 01:11:36,470
I hate this fuckin' number!

596
01:11:36,545 --> 01:11:38,945
I like it.

597
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:40,743
He likes it.

598
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:44,251
- It's traditional.
- Oh, traditional!

599
01:11:46,922 --> 01:11:50,323
Without tradition,
new things die.

600
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:52,860
"New things die"?

601
01:11:52,928 --> 01:11:55,829
The son of a bitch
is a poet!

602
01:11:55,897 --> 01:11:59,594
A jeweler poet.
First goddamn jeweler poet I ever saw.

603
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:03,729
Oh, yeah. A Jew jeweler poet.

604
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:08,404
Listen,
I'll kill the guy.

605
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:12,503
You what? What the hell
are you talking about?
Hey, did you hear that?

606
01:12:12,581 --> 01:12:14,276
- What?
- He's gonna kill some guy.

607
01:12:14,349 --> 01:12:17,318
- Who you gonna kill, Freddy?
- Nothing!

608
01:12:17,385 --> 01:12:20,479
- Freddy!
- I missed something.
What's he talkin' about?

609
01:12:20,555 --> 01:12:22,682
Come dance with me!

610
01:12:22,757 --> 01:12:26,124
Yeah! Yeah!
That's it.

611
01:12:26,194 --> 01:12:28,628
Yeah!

612
01:12:28,697 --> 01:12:31,894
Come on, Freddy!

613
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:34,128
Come on, Freddy,
dance with Mia.

614
01:12:34,202 --> 01:12:38,002
Go on, Freddy. Go on.
Dance with the fuckin' whore.

615
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:43,375
Go for it!
Go for it!

616
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:18,802
Whoo!
Freddy, come on!

617
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:36,962
Mmm.

618
01:13:37,032 --> 01:13:39,865
You tickled me!
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.

619
01:13:39,934 --> 01:13:42,732
I really wanna fuck you.
Stop!

620
01:13:42,804 --> 01:13:45,705
First I gotta play you
this song I wrote. Okay?

621
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:47,765
Song?

622
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,901
Gimme that bottle.

623
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:51,969
Oh.

624
01:13:55,383 --> 01:14:00,377
Okay. I hope you like this
'cause I wrote this just for you.

625
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:03,982
Don't let me go to sleep.
I got business tonight.

626
01:15:26,841 --> 01:15:29,469
Chorus.

627
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:41,782
- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.

628
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:45,877
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.

629
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:49,754
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need..

630
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:56,823
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.

631
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:01,460
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.

632
01:17:01,536 --> 01:17:03,094
What?

633
01:17:03,171 --> 01:17:06,629
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,

634
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:11,372
it feels real big
like it's driving me.

635
01:17:15,016 --> 01:17:19,544
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.

636
01:17:21,656 --> 01:17:24,955
And there's a crosswalk.

637
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:31,130
And all these little kids
are being..

638
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:34,965
h-helped across
by a crossing guard.

639
01:17:36,104 --> 01:17:39,232
The crossing guard
is John Booth.

640
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,778
Em's one
of the little kids.

641
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:54,847
I'm gettin'..
closer and closer.

642
01:17:54,923 --> 01:17:58,359
And I'm..
I'm hittin' the brakes.

643
01:17:58,426 --> 01:18:00,656
The car won't slow down.

644
01:18:00,728 --> 01:18:05,722
I'm turning the wheel..
but the car won't turn.

645
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,564
Oh, Freddy.

646
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,337
Freddy.

647
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:17,845
Then I just plow
right through.. through 'em.

648
01:18:19,781 --> 01:18:21,612
Then I..

649
01:18:21,683 --> 01:18:26,245
Then I see Em's face..

650
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:29,256
just, just before..

651
01:18:29,324 --> 01:18:31,451
just before I hit her.

652
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:35,986
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.

653
01:18:36,064 --> 01:18:39,556
Come on. Come on.

654
01:18:41,102 --> 01:18:43,627
Come on.

655
01:19:23,111 --> 01:19:25,602
Two coffees.

656
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,910
Sit there.

657
01:19:38,259 --> 01:19:41,319
Oh, Freddy.

658
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:50,303
Mary, I..

659
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:54,171
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.

660
01:19:56,411 --> 01:20:01,144
I've been so angry at you..
for so goddamn long.

661
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:07,548
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.

662
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:14,825
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,

663
01:20:14,896 --> 01:20:17,126
I did see you..

664
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:22,864
for the first time
since Emily was killed.

665
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:31,910
I can see
you're a good man.

666
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:35,847
And you loved her
so, so much.

667
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:40,013
But I loved her too,
Freddy.

668
01:20:40,088 --> 01:20:43,421
I needed you so badly.

669
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:48,994
But you..

670
01:20:59,373 --> 01:21:04,640
Do you remember..
when we were coming back from Vegas,

671
01:21:04,712 --> 01:21:08,148
and the wind, God..

672
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:11,117
The plane was bouncing
all around.

673
01:21:12,754 --> 01:21:15,314
I thought..

674
01:21:15,389 --> 01:21:18,483
I was shaking.

675
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:21,119
Do you remember
what you said?

676
01:21:24,365 --> 01:21:25,957
No.

677
01:21:28,236 --> 01:21:30,170
Uh, tell me.

678
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,105
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

679
01:21:33,174 --> 01:21:36,337
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.

680
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:39,573
And you took my hand
and you said.. Do you remember?

681
01:21:40,615 --> 01:21:43,641
No, no.
Tell me.

682
01:21:45,419 --> 01:21:49,014
You said,
"Pray we crash.

683
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,526
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."

684
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:59,758
You were so..

685
01:22:01,335 --> 01:22:03,929
Where'd that guy go?

686
01:22:09,076 --> 01:22:11,408
Then Emmy died.

687
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,814
It's..

688
01:22:18,886 --> 01:22:21,514
It's made you so small
and weak.

689
01:22:25,693 --> 01:22:29,561
I needed you
to be big and strong.

690
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:33,791
I hated you
for your weakness.

691
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:36,200
I hated you.

692
01:22:38,773 --> 01:22:42,209
Now I'm pitying you.

693
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:49,244
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.

694
01:22:58,826 --> 01:23:02,922
You look around..

695
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:06,694
at the marriages
people have.

696
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:10,203
We had a good one,
didn't we?

697
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:13,607
Yes.

698
01:23:13,674 --> 01:23:16,268
Good times.

699
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:19,006
No hidden agendas.

700
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:24,852
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.

701
01:23:28,356 --> 01:23:30,347
We were turned on.

702
01:23:30,424 --> 01:23:33,257
We were hot
for one another.

703
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:40,426
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.

704
01:23:40,501 --> 01:23:42,366
Best buddies.

705
01:23:48,142 --> 01:23:51,976
Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.

706
01:23:52,046 --> 01:23:55,243
No.

707
01:23:55,316 --> 01:23:57,511
No.

708
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:06,788
No, but..

709
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:16,827
you pity me.

710
01:24:23,778 --> 01:24:26,508
You pity me.

711
01:24:36,223 --> 01:24:39,021
Oh, boy, this is a..

712
01:24:39,093 --> 01:24:42,494
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this..

713
01:24:42,563 --> 01:24:45,999
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.

714
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:49,127
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."

715
01:24:50,538 --> 01:24:53,006
I hope you die.

716
01:24:53,074 --> 01:24:57,272
I hope you fucking die.

717
01:25:20,634 --> 01:25:22,625
Come on! Come on!

718
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,898
Come on!
Come on!

719
01:25:51,999 --> 01:25:56,902
Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.

720
01:26:04,712 --> 01:26:09,240
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.

721
01:26:09,316 --> 01:26:11,614
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.

722
01:26:11,685 --> 01:26:14,381
Step back here.

723
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,556
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.

724
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:21,424
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

725
01:26:21,495 --> 01:26:23,656
Do you have
any other weapons on you?

726
01:26:23,731 --> 01:26:25,596
No.

727
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,896
Spread your feet for me.

728
01:26:27,968 --> 01:26:31,267
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?

729
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:33,329
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?

730
01:26:33,407 --> 01:26:36,535
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

731
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:40,068
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.

732
01:26:40,147 --> 01:26:43,173
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?

733
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,548
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.

734
01:26:45,619 --> 01:26:48,019
Put your hands down
for me.

735
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:51,957
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.

736
01:26:52,026 --> 01:26:54,119
It's loaded?
Okay.

737
01:26:54,195 --> 01:26:56,595
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?

738
01:26:56,664 --> 01:26:59,827
Yes, sir.

739
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,265
Here,
just hand it to me.

740
01:27:01,335 --> 01:27:03,860
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so..

741
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:07,271
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.

742
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:09,332
Have you had anything
to drink?

743
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:13,972
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.

744
01:27:14,048 --> 01:27:16,414
All right.

745
01:27:16,484 --> 01:27:18,321
We're gonna conduct a
few tests to see how

746
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,181
much your ability to
operate a motor vehicle..

747
01:27:20,254 --> 01:27:22,347
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.

748
01:27:22,423 --> 01:27:25,517
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.

749
01:27:25,593 --> 01:27:30,155
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.

750
01:27:30,231 --> 01:27:33,462
Okay, I want you to tilt
your head back and close your eyes.

751
01:27:33,534 --> 01:27:38,198
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.

752
01:27:38,272 --> 01:27:40,502
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.

753
01:27:40,574 --> 01:27:44,476
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.

754
01:27:44,545 --> 01:27:47,241
Let's do
the left finger again.

755
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:49,874
- Okay, sir. Put your hands
down at your side.
- Permit's good.

756
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,111
The permit's good?
Okay.

757
01:27:52,186 --> 01:27:54,586
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.

758
01:27:56,891 --> 01:28:00,520
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.

759
01:28:00,594 --> 01:28:04,792
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.

760
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:06,833
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.

761
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:08,738
When you get down here,
I want you to turn

762
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,598
around and take ten steps back.
You understand?

763
01:28:10,671 --> 01:28:13,231
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

764
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:16,640
One, two, three,

765
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:21,340
four, five, six,

766
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:25,317
seven, eight, nine, ten.

767
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:28,446
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.

768
01:28:28,522 --> 01:28:30,888
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,

769
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,983
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.

770
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,826
So, turn around, put your hands
behind your back. You're
under arrest for drunk driving.

771
01:28:36,897 --> 01:28:39,331
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.

772
01:28:40,568 --> 01:28:43,833
Freeze! Stop!
Jesus.

773
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:46,364
Show us in foot pursuit.

774
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,965
14-0-9. We're in
foot pursuit. Man with a gun.

775
01:28:49,043 --> 01:28:52,706
Southbound on lnglewood from the 90
freeway. Request an air unit.

776
01:28:56,016 --> 01:28:58,780
Stop, you son of a bitch!

777
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:14,464
Stop!
I'm gonna shoot your ass!

778
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,430
- Police officers, sir. Police!
- What's going on?

779
01:29:48,502 --> 01:29:51,699
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?

780
01:29:51,772 --> 01:29:53,831
I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.

781
01:29:53,907 --> 01:29:57,809
- Hey, the back door's open.
- I got kids here.

782
01:30:01,949 --> 01:30:05,009
Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.

783
01:30:05,085 --> 01:30:07,383
Just stay with us.

784
01:30:18,465 --> 01:30:21,059
Honey, you all right?

785
01:30:22,536 --> 01:30:26,131
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?

786
01:30:26,206 --> 01:30:29,437
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.

787
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,911
We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.

788
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:36,916
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.

789
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:48,253
Good night, sweetheart.

790
01:33:21,982 --> 01:33:25,315
Gonna give you a laugh,
kid.

791
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:34,452
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?

792
01:33:34,528 --> 01:33:37,224
The whole bit.

793
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:43,296
You wanna guess
what for?

794
01:33:46,206 --> 01:33:49,607
Drunk driving.

795
01:33:51,411 --> 01:33:55,040
Drunk driving.

796
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:57,845
And I had my gun.

797
01:34:00,854 --> 01:34:07,692
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but..

798
01:34:07,761 --> 01:34:09,729
I'm on the run,

799
01:34:09,796 --> 01:34:13,027
I'm on your property
and I got my gun.

800
01:34:14,668 --> 01:34:18,934
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.

801
01:34:23,277 --> 01:34:26,508
So, I'm gonna..

802
01:34:28,582 --> 01:34:31,779
I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.

803
01:34:42,095 --> 01:34:44,188
And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.

804
01:35:10,657 --> 01:35:12,852
Huh?

805
01:35:14,094 --> 01:35:16,255
Hey!

806
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:20,162
Hey, you son of a bitch.

807
01:35:24,638 --> 01:35:26,572
Hey!

808
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:38,475
Come on. Come on.

809
01:37:03,036 --> 01:37:04,970
This just isn't working
for you out here.

810
01:37:05,038 --> 01:37:07,438
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?

811
01:37:07,507 --> 01:37:10,533
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

812
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:11,980
I come out here. I see you don't
have a cent to your name.

813
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,374
I wanna know what you're doing.

814
01:37:13,447 --> 01:37:16,314
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.

815
01:37:16,383 --> 01:37:19,477
I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?

816
01:37:19,553 --> 01:37:21,680
If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.

817
01:37:27,761 --> 01:37:29,746
That's all you
ever think about.

818
01:37:29,759 --> 01:37:31,754
You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.

819
01:37:31,832 --> 01:37:33,652
I don't understand what
you do for a living.

820
01:37:33,665 --> 01:37:35,495
You don't have to.

821
01:37:35,569 --> 01:37:37,833
- I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.

822
01:37:37,904 --> 01:37:39,872
- Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?

823
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,001
Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.

824
01:37:44,077 --> 01:37:47,274
It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.

825
01:37:47,347 --> 01:37:50,009
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.

826
01:37:50,083 --> 01:37:53,052
- If it's gonna be this major thing..
- It is a major thing.

827
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,509
And I want us
to figure it out.

828
01:37:55,522 --> 01:37:57,921
I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?

829
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:00,255
That's easy.
That's what you always do.

830
01:38:00,327 --> 01:38:03,023
Not right now.
That's it?

831
01:38:08,969 --> 01:38:12,063
- Whatever, okay?
I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?

832
01:38:12,139 --> 01:38:14,073
You don't listen.

833
01:38:14,141 --> 01:38:17,941
- I don't listen?
- What am I doing? I have a job.

834
01:38:18,011 --> 01:38:20,502
And I'm working.
I'm working for, you know.

835
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:25,244
- For what?
- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.

836
01:38:25,318 --> 01:38:29,015
So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.

837
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:33,253
I think that your standards are like,
like so high. So I don't have a car!

838
01:38:33,326 --> 01:38:36,193
- What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?

839
01:38:36,263 --> 01:38:38,857
- It's telemarketing.
What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?

840
01:38:38,932 --> 01:38:41,457
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.

841
01:38:41,535 --> 01:38:44,129
Well, you know.
Hey. It pays the rent.

842
01:43:19,946 --> 01:43:22,972
Your daddy's coming.

843
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:28,412
He is.

844
01:43:28,488 --> 01:43:30,820
And he needs your help.

845
01:43:55,415 --> 01:43:57,849
It's pink.

846
01:44:01,788 --> 01:44:05,280
Emily's stone is pink.

847
01:45:02,482 --> 01:45:05,246
I'm sorry.

848
01:45:06,486 --> 01:45:09,011
I'm sorry.

849
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:54,400
