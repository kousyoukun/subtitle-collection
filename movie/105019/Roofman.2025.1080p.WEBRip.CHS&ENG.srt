1
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,503
杰德，我需要你开始打扫卫生间
Jade, I need you to start on the bathrooms.

2
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,638
乔斯琳，请把所有的鸡蛋、面糊、
Joslyn, can you please take out all the eggs, batter,

3
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,641
肉饼和麦满分从冰柜里拿出来，好吗？
patties and McMuffins out of the freezer, okay?

4
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,513
等我启动所有设备后就来帮你 
I'll help you once I turn everything on.

5
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,607
早上好，各位 
Good morning, team.

6
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,474
不，不，不要 
No, no, no.

7
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:52,955
别害怕 
Don't be scared.

8
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,787
照我说的做，就不会有人受伤，明白吗？
You just do what I say, no one gets hurt, okay?

9
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,263
不，不，你看 
No, no, look.

10
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,742
枪口朝下 
Pointing it down.

11
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,614
好的，现在我要说一句礼貌
Okay, now, I'm gonna say a polite

12
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,269
又愉快的"早上好"，然后你们要跟着说一遍
and cheerful "Good morning," and then you guys say it back.

13
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,705
早上好 
Good morning.

14
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,491
不...杜安，要等我说完之后
No... Duane, after I say it.

15
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,232
流程是这样的 明白吗？
That's how that works. Okay?

16
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,103
现在，早上好，各位 
Now, good morning, team.

17
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:12,757
早上好 
Good morning.

18
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,672
是的 完美 
Yes. Perfect.

19
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,066
我说做什么，你们就照做 明白吗 
I say what to do and you guys just do it. Okay.

20
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,373
我要你们把外套重新穿上 
I want you to get your coats back on.

21
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,028
杜安，拿上你的外套 
Duane, grab your coat.

22
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,640
嗯？拿上你的外套 
Huh? Grab your coat.

23
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,033
我没有外套，先生 
I don't have one, sir.

24
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,386
你没有外套？你怎么会没有外套？
You don't have a coat? How do you not have a coat?

25
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,736
我刚刚忘了 
I just forgot.

26
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,898
好吧，你今天只能稍微受点冻了 
Well, you're just gonna have to be a little cold today.

27
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,916
好吧，我们走 
All right, let's go.

28
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,572
您先请 女士优先 
After you. Ladies first.

29
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:45,877
现在，听我说 
Now, listen to me.

30
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,184
你们不会死在这里的 
You guys aren't gonna die in here.

31
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,624
我一出去就报警
Soon as I'm out of here, I'm gonna call the cops

32
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,060
他们会放你们出来的 
and they're gonna let you guys out.

33
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,754
说不定还能放一天假 
Probably get the day off.

34
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,105
不，别，别这样 
No, don't, don't.

35
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,399
别那样看着我 
Do not look at me like that.

36
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,153
杜安，住手 
Duane, stop it.

37
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,460
因为这都是你的错 
Cause this is your fault.

38
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,114
好冷 
It's cold.

39
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,681
你是认真的吗？
Are you serious?

40
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,076
该死 
Dang it.

41
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,430
真不知道是哪个白痴
I don't know what kind of jerk

42
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,866
上班连自己的外套都不带 
doesn't bring his own coat to work.

43
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,430
满意了吗？开心了吗？
Okay? Happy now?

44
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:17,605
我耳朵好冷 
My ears are cold.

45
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,651
故事讲到这里
This is the part of the story

46
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,218
我希望你正在好奇
where I hope you're wondering

47
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,047
像我这样的好人怎么会沦落成罪犯 
how a nice guy like me ends up becoming a criminal.

48
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,501
喂？
Hello?

49
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:28,790
这东西开着吗？
This thing on?

50
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,488
喂？
Hello?

51
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,795
妈的！
Shit!

52
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,579
拜托 杜安
Come on, Duane.

53
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,408
早上好 呃 欢迎光临麦当劳
Good morning. Uh, welcome to McDonald's.

54
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,367
我让你稍等一下 
I'm gonna put you on a brief hold.

55
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,381
搞什么鬼，杜安？
What the hell, Duane?

56
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,893
我不能责怪我的父母 
I can't blame my parents.

57
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,809
我有个美好的童年 
I had a good childhood.

58
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:52,335
我从来就不擅长读书或循规蹈矩 
I was just never good at school or behaving.

59
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,163
但我在某些方面确实很有天赋
But I was good at certain things

60
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,166
这些天赋对军队来说极具价值
that were really valuable to the military.

61
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,864
但退伍之后
But after my discharge,

62
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,085
我不知道自己该何去何从
I didn't know where I fit or what to do

63
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,567
也不知道该如何给予我的孩子们其他孩子所拥有的东西
or how to give my kids the things that other kids had.

64
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:11,702
于是我做出了一些糟糕的选择 这些选择让我失去了其他选择的机会
So I made some bad choices that took away some other choices.

65
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:15,097
而那些错误的选择都始于两年前
And those bad choices all started two years ago

66
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,055
在我女儿的六岁生日派对上 
at my daughter's sixth birthday party.

67
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,976
好了，你得许个大愿望 
All right, you got to make a big ol' wish.

68
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,369
再来一个 
One more.

69
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,415
你许愿了吗？许了什么愿？
Did you make a wish? What'd you wish for?

70
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,026
一辆自行车 自行车？
A bike. Bike?

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,423
我不确定自行车能不能正好装进
I don't know if a bike is exactly gonna fit

72
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,160
这个箱子，不过...把它撕开吧 
into this box, but... rip it open.

73
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,126
我要跟你比赛 没错 
I'm gonna race ya. Yeah.

74
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,828
你怎么看？
What do you think?

75
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,875
很酷吧？这是我那套老式建筑模型玩具 
It's cool, right? It's my old Erector Set.

76
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,268
我们打开看看 
Let's open it up.

77
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,793
这里面有 200 个零件 
There's 200 pieces in here.

78
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,534
不！
No!

79
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,753
我是说，有发动机、齿轮、滑轮、
I mean, you got engines, you got gears, pulleys,

80
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,494
轮子、车灯、开关 
wheels, lights, switches.

81
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,975
有了这东西，我们几乎能造出任何想要的东西 
We can make almost anything that we want with this thing.

82
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,239
听着，凡是你能想到的，我们都能造出来，明白吗？
Look, anything that you can dream, we can make it, okay?

83
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,372
你和我一起干 意下如何？
Me and you. What do you say?

84
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,114
能用它造辆自行车吗？
Can you make a bike with it?

85
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,291
是啊 
Yeah.

86
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,771
是啊 
Yeah.

87
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,510
真不敢相信我认识的那个 82 年的家伙
I can't believe the dude I knew

88
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,168
连辆自行车都买不起 
from the 82nd can't even afford a bike.

89
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,732
那你倒是说说你怎么混得这么好 
Well, tell me how you're doing so well.

90
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,259
让我想想 
Well, let me see.

91
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,309
就在这周，我帮两个日本人搞到了护照 
Just this week, I got two Japanese dudes passports.

92
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,176
每本五千美金 
That's 5K a pop.

93
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,917
假护照要五千美金？
Five grand for fake passports?

94
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,440
不，是真护照 老兄...
No, for real passports. Man...

95
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,702
需要我帮忙吗？
Can I help you with that?

96
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,269
帮个屁忙，你不行 
Hell motherfucking no, you can't.

97
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,749
你啥也帮不上 
You can't help me with shit.

98
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,228
你疯了吗？
You crazy, man?

99
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,963
你他妈根本帮不上任何忙 
You ain't helping me do a goddamn thing.

100
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,580
我不需要你的帮助 
I don't need your help.

101
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,803
再说了，我们都知道循规蹈矩
Plus, we already know that doing things the right way

102
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,497
本就不是你的强项 
is not your superpower.

103
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,673
无所谓 那...
Whatever. That's...

104
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,592
好啊，那你倒是说说我的强项是什么？
Okay, then tell me what my superpower is, then?

105
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,198
请赐教，佛陀 嗯 
Enlighten me, Buddha. Mm.

106
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,592
那条水管的流量是多少？
What's the flow rate on that hose?

107
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,159
每分钟 12 加仑 嗯哼 
12 gallons per minute. Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,118
这条街上有多少栋房子？
How many houses is on this street?

109
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,337
二十八 
Twenty-eight.

110
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,995
其中有多少栋有烟囱？
And out of those, how many got chimneys?

111
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,819
车库呢？
Garages?

112
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,043
有多少户使用热泵而非传统空调？
How many of 'em use a heat pump instead of a traditional AC?

113
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,088
你是想让我推销暖通空调系统还是怎么的？只是...
You want me to sell HVAC systems or something? Just...

114
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,655
不，不，老兄，我是想说明一个观点 
No, no, man, I'm trying to make a point.

115
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,261
那就请说明你的观点 
Then make the point, please.

116
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,133
观察 
Observation.

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,048
细节 
Details.

118
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,484
你能看到别人看不到的肮脏勾当 
You see shit people don't see.

119
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,705
你简直像是有透视眼似的 
You got like a little X-ray vision going on. 

120
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,973
怎么，你以为他们把你送到中美洲是因为你枪法准吗？
What, you think they dropped you off in Central America 'cause you a good shot?

121
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,450
你是这么想的吗？不，不是的...
Is that what you think? No. No...

122
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:33,409
不，他们抛弃你是因为你的洞察力
No, they dropped you because of what you see.

123
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,063
妈的，要是我有你这样的头脑
Shit, if I had a brain like yours,

124
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:37,544
我早就统治这该死的世界了
I'd be running the whole goddamn world.

125
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:40,285
你是我见过最聪明的蠢货 
You know, you the smartest dumb nigga I ever known.

126
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,113
这太疯狂了 
That shit crazy.

127
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,767
你现在可以不用继续往泳池里放水了 
You can stop filling up that pool now.

128
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,164
根本没人会进去的 
Ain't nobody gonna get in there.

129
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,293
那玩意儿冷得要命 
That shit cold as hell.

130
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,038
所以，妈妈多半会想知道
So, Mama is probably gonna want to know

131
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,241
派对办得怎么样，嗯，我觉得我们尽力了 
how the party was, and, yeah, I think we did our best.

132
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,777
你怎么看？
What do you think?

133
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:56,867
泳池的事或许就别提了 
Maybe we don't mention the pool. 

134
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,175
重要的是尝试，对吧？
It's the trying that counts, right?

135
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,698
妈妈！
Mommy!

136
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,051
生日快乐，寿星女 
Hi, birthday girl.

137
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,923
你的派对怎么样？
How was your party?

138
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,968
大家都尽力了 
Everybody did their best.

139
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,057
哦 你准备好参加另一个派对了吗？
Oh. Are you ready for your other party?

140
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,321
你好 
Hi.

141
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,411
你好吗？
How are you?

142
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,109
嘿，我能跟你聊一下吗？
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

143
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,632
很快很快，就一会儿 
Real-real quick, real quick.

144
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,566
我知道最近几个月很不容易，
I know the last few months haven't been easy,

145
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,767
而我们却没有真正需要的东西，
and we don't have the things that we actually need,

146
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,160
这是我的错，我承认这一点 
and that's my fault and I own that.

147
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:32,250
好吗？我承认，但我觉得我现在已经想明白了 
Okay? I do, but I-I think I have it figured out now.

148
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:33,778
我只需要运用我的超能力，
I just got to use my superpower and

149
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,906
集中精力在我想要的事情上 你的超能力呢？
put my brain on what I want. Your superpower?

150
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,604
你的超能力？  是的 
Your superpower? Yes.

151
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,696
我做不到，杰夫 听着...不行 
I can't do this, Jeff. Look-- No.

152
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,049
我受够了 拜托，别这样 
I'm done. Come on, please don't do this.

153
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,525
再见 
Goodbye.

154
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:52,532
好的，香蕉脑袋 
All right, banana head.

155
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,229
说再见吧 
Say goodbye.

156
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,888
爱你！
Love you!

157
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,248
等等，等等，等等，等等，等等，等等！
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

158
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,647
我没有怪她嘲笑我 
I didn't blame her for laughing at me.

159
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:24,172
没有怪她觉得我是个笑话 
For thinking I was a joke.

160
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:29,003
但她对我有些事并不了解 
But there were things  that she didn't know about me.

161
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,658
那些并不那么好笑的事 
Things that weren't so funny.

162
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,879
史蒂夫知道我的能耐 
Steve knew what I was capable of.

163
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,578
我确实能看到别人看不到的东西 
I do see things that other people don't see.

164
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,931
就像现在，我看见那个孩子正爬上梯子，
Like right now, I see that kid climbing up that ladder,

165
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,846
而且我知道在那脆弱的屋顶下面
and I know that under that flimsy roof

166
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,501
这是一台能把碎牛肉和土豆变成钞票的机器 
is a machine that turns ground beef and potatoes into money.

167
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,243
同样的用餐区域，
With the same dining room,

168
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,725
同样的油炸锅闪烁着红色计时灯，
the same deep fryers with blinking red timer lights,

169
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,555
同样的奶昔机提供着那两种固定口味
the same shake machine with the same two flavors

170
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,514
同一个装满周末公司汉堡收入的保险箱
and the same safe full of weekend corporate burger money

171
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,952
没人会注意到少了这笔钱
that no one was gonna miss.

172
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,998
每家麦当劳都会在周一早上
They empty that safe at the exact same time

173
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:11,523
同一时间清空那个保险箱
on Monday morning at every single McDonald's.

174
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,047
你好 欢迎光临麦当劳 
Hi. Welcome to McDonald's.

175
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,310
你想好要点什么了吗？
Do you know what you want?

176
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,703
嗯？
Huh?

177
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,879
嗯，嗯，嗯，嗯 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,490
呃，是的，我想好了 
Um, yeah, I figured it out.

179
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,709
谢谢 
Thank you.

180
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,450
全美有超过一万家
There are over 10,000

181
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,931
几乎一模一样的麦当劳 
almost identical McDonald's across the United States.

182
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,108
你需要抢多少家
How many do you need to rob

183
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,893
才能买得起真正的房子，
to get a real house,

184
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:36,200
给孩子买些好东西，就能赢回你的家庭？
buy your kids nice things and win your family back?

185
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,814
结果答案是 45 
Turns out, the answer is 45.

186
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,820
屋顶大盗又出手了，
The Roofman has struck again,

187
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,910
在这家麦当劳的屋顶上开了个洞
cutting a hole through the roof of this McDonald's

188
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:53,043
位于费耶特维尔市麦迪逊街与朱厄尔街的拐角处 
at the corner of Madison and Jewell in Fayetteville.

189
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,220
可想而知，这是一次可怕的经历 
As you can imagine, this was a terrifying experience.

190
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,701
他闯进来，把我们扔进冰柜
He came in, threw us in the freezer

191
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,224
还把他的外套给了我 
and gave me his coat.

192
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,400
他把外套给你了？是的 
He gave you his coat? Yes.

193
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,359
呃，是的，他不想让我着凉 
Uh, yeah, he didn't want me to be cold.

194
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,056
他其实人真的很好 
He was actually really nice.

195
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,106
警方认为这是同一名嫌疑人
Police believe this is the same suspect

196
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,452
他一直在我们社区制造恐慌
who has been terrorizing our local community

197
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,802
已犯下 45 起案件...

198
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,674
嗯...仅过去这一年
Mm. ...this past year alone.

199
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,197
我们已绘制出屋顶大盗的画像
We have a sketch of the Roofman.

200
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,069
他总是戴着口罩 
He is always wearing a mask.

201
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:22,594
据描述他身高六尺二寸，体格健壮 
He's described as six-foot-two with an athletic build.

202
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,466
什么？屋顶大盗还袭击了
What? The Roofman has also struck

203
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,294
汉堡王、肯德基...
Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken...

204
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,688
杰夫，你这台电视真不错 
Nice TV you got here, Jeff.

205
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,037
大 
Big.

206
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,865
你怎么买得起那样的东西？
How you afford something like that?

207
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,344
外面有 15 个饿坏了的孩子
We got 15 hungry kids out there

208
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,698
正为蛋糕而疯狂 
that are losing their minds for cake.

209
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,217
我们得走了 
We got to go.

210
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,614
...所有这些明目张胆的事件...
...all of these brazen incidents...

211
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,002
我们得走了 等等，等等

212
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:40,616
我们现在就得走 让我看看...
We got to go right now. Let me see...

213
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,357
如果她现在拿不到礼物...
If she doesn't get her presents right now...

214
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,881
我想知道那个该死的嫌疑人到底怎么回事 
I want to know what's going on with the damn suspect.

215
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,056
...她会发疯的 我能看看吗？
...she's gonna lose her mind. Can I see?

216
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,141
好吧 你干嘛关掉？
All right. Why you turning it off?

217
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,363
等等，等等，等等，等等，等等，等等 别，别，别，别...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't, d--

All right, we're gonna do this one first this year. 

230
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,552
小盒子里的大惊喜 
Big things in little boxes.

231
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,468
这是什么？
What is this?

232
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,296
车库门遥控器？
A garage door opener?

233
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,255
为什么给我车库门遥控器？
Why'd you give me a garage door opener?

234
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,131
我也不知道 只是想不到还能放哪儿
I don't know. I just couldn't think of anywhere else

235
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,520
把那个，呃，剑齿虎放好，所以...
to put, uh, the saber-toothed tiger, so...

236
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,436
我不知道 总不能放厨房里吧？
I don't know. I couldn't put it in the kitchen, could I?

237
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,395
那它到底在哪儿？
So, where is it?

238
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,361
你是全世界最棒的爸爸！
You're the best daddy in the whole entire world!

239
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,929
现在，去吧，赶紧上车 
Now, go ahead, get on it.

240
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,628
我很喜欢 
I love it.

241
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,767
你们怎么样？
How you guys doing?

242
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,509
我们在找杰弗里·曼彻斯特 
We're looking for Jeffrey Manchester.

243
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,772
是关于登记的事吗？
This about the registration?

244
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,600
就在这儿，稍等 
Yeah, I got it right in here. One second.

245
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:41,689
停下 
Stop.

246
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,605
你被捕了！

247
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,129
喂！嘿 嘿 嘿

248
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,469
不许动！你被捕了！
Freeze! You're under arrest!

249
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:02,118
曼彻斯特先生，请起立 
Mr. Manchester, please rise.

250
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:07,036
检方已超越法定举证责任范围
The State has proved beyond the defined burden

251
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,561
证实您犯下持危险武器抢劫罪 
that you committed the crime of robbery with a dangerous weapon.

252
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:13,173
我希望予以酌情考量
I'd like to take in consideration

253
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,827
你为这个国家在军队中服役
your service to this country in the armed forces

254
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,918
以及你的孩子们失去父亲的影响 
and the impact of your children losing a father.

255
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,399
我知道你骗过了所有人
Now, I know you got everyone fooled

256
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,794
让他们以为你是个好人，但我知道你是个祸害 
thinking you're a nice guy, but I know you're a menace.

257
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,014
虽然你只被指控犯下一桩抢劫案，
Although you're only being tried for one robbery,

258
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,754
但我们知道你犯下的远不止这些 
we know you've done many more.

259
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,539
因此检方已请求
And so the prosecution has requested

260
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:34,368
我以一项重罪绑架罪名起诉
that I issue a single count of felony kidnapping

261
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,761
你关进冰柜的每一个受害者 
for each victim you locked in the freezer.

262
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,504
记录显示，2004年2月4日，
Let the record state that on the 4th of February, 2004,

263
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,811
现判处你 180 个月监禁
you're hereby sentenced to 180 months

264
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,248
三名受害者每人各判此刑期，
for each of the three victims,

265
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:48,251
总计540个月，即45年
for a total of 540 months or 45 years

266
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,993
在北卡罗来纳州惩教署服刑
in the North Carolina Department of Corrections.

267
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,910
警长先生，现将他移交您看管
Mr. Sheriff, he is in your custody.

268
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,173
本案审理到此结束
This concludes this case.

269
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,595
嗨，爸爸 
Hi, Daddy.

270
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,723
我好想你 
I really missed you.

271
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,552
我也想你 我特别特别想你 
Miss you, too. I miss you a lot.

272
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,081
嘿，你收到我画了大房子的那封信了吗？
Hey, did you get the letter that I drew the big ol' house on it?

273
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,774
没有 
No.

274
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,127
嗯，可能信还没到 问问妈妈吧 
Well, maybe it hasn't arrived. Ask Mama.

275
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,864
妈妈说她会把信都收好 
Mom says she'll save the letters.

276
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,084
等我长大些就能看了 
When I'm old enough, I can read them.

277
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,173
不，不对 这样...这样不行 
No, no. That is not... that is not right.

278
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,262
这些信件是给现在的 
These letters are for, they're for right now.

279
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,046
告诉他我们要切断联系 
Tell him we're cutting the cord.

280
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,266
他们说我们必须切断联系 
They said we have to cut the cord.

281
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,011
不，我们不会切断联系 
No, we're not cutting the cord.

282
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,573
谁说的？
Who said that?

283
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,924
我们参加了一个为父亲在监狱的家庭举办的会议 
We went to a meeting for families with dads in prison.

284
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,405
好吧，那很好 
Okay, well, that's good.

285
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,451
那真的很好 他们在那里说了什么？
That's really good. What'd they say there?

286
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,021
这不是我的错 都是你的错 
That it isn't my fault.  It's your fault.

287
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,936
让你彻底离开，
And to let you go, all the way,

288
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:08,810
因为你永远不会回家，即使你嘴上说会 
cause you'll never come home, even if you say you will.

289
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,421
听着，最后那部分并不...那是大错特错的 
Look, that last part is not-- that is very, very wrong.

290
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:14,120
你还有 60 秒 
You have 60 seconds remaining.

291
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,934
嘿，能让你妈妈接一下电话吗？
Hey, can you put your mom on for a second?

292
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,384
他想和你谈谈 
He wants to talk to you.

293
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:19,342
不行 告诉他你得挂电话了 
No. Tell him that you have to hang up.

294
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,116
加里会帮你辅导作业 
Gary's gonna help you with your homework.

295
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,129
她不想和你说话 
She doesn't want to talk to you.

296
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,566
她说我得下线去做作业了 
She said I have to get off and do homework.

297
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,481
加里会来帮我 
Gary is going to help me.

298
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,049
加里？谁是加里？
Gary? Who's Gary?

299
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,268
妈妈的朋友 
Mom's friend.

300
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,705
呵，妈妈交了个叫加里的新朋友 
Huh. Mom's got a new friend named Gary.

301
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,446
这-这很有趣 
That's-that's fun.

302
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,235
没关系，亲爱的 你可以告诉他 
It's okay, sweetheart. You can tell him.

303
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,101
嗯，好的，我明天同一时间会给你打电话
Um, okay, I'm gonna call you tomorrow at the same time

304
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,275
我一直都这样，好吗？
They said no more calls.

305
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,278
他们说别再打电话了 
They said no more calls.

306
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:43,845
不，不 谁说的？不行 
No, no. Who said that? No.

307
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,281
挂掉电话 
Hang up the phone.

308
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:46,674
没事的，贝基 
It's okay, Becky.

309
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,288
你现在可以挂电话了  挂电话？
You can hang up now. Hang up?

310
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,768
那是加里吗？让他马上接电话 
Is that Gary? Put him on the phone right now.

311
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,461
挂掉电话 快挂掉 
Hang up. Hang up.

312
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,812
贝姬，让加里或者你妈妈来接电话，马上，好吗？
Put Gary or your mom on the phone right now, Becky, okay?

313
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,597
我得挂电话了  喂 
I have to hang up. Hey.

314
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,077
听我说，我就要回家了 
Listen to me, I'm coming home.

315
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,948
告诉你的兄弟们我就要回家了 
Tell your brothers I'm coming home.

316
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,562
我们不说再见，因为再见意味着离别
And we don't say goodbye, 'cause goodbye means going away

317
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,086
而离别意味着遗忘，而我们...
and going away means forgetting, and we're...

318
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,345
我们……你-你好？
We're-- H-Hello?

319
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,087
喂？
Hello?

320
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,001
贝……贝琪？
B... Becky?

321
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,679
你怎么还在想他们？
Why is you still thinking about them?

322
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,324
你得放下这件事了 
You got to let that go.

323
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,529
你休想从这里逃出去 
Ain't no getting out of here.

324
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,416
趁早打消这个念头 
Get that idea out your head.

325
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,638
每个囚犯都想要同样的东西：
Every prisoner wants the same thing:

326
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,857
那就是越狱 
to get out of prison.

327
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,382
他们认为出路是穿墙而过
And they think that the way out is through a wall

328
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,731
或是翻越围栏
or over a fence.

329
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,994
但警卫早已严防死守
But the guards got that covered.

330
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,172
越狱的真正途径在于人心
The way out of prison is through the people.

331
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,653
监狱不过是另一栋建筑
Prison was just another building

332
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,221
充斥着各种制度和例行公事
full of systems and routines.

333
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:58,441
保持例行公事 狱警就不会起疑
Keep the routine, and the guards won't get suspicious.

334
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:01,618
如果你足够友善 如果你还有利用价值
If you're nice enough, if you're useful,

335
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,491
他们忘了你被关在这里是有原因的 
they forget you're in there for a reason.

336
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,450
当他们不再监视你时，
And when they stop watching you,

337
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,843
你就可以开始监视他们了 
you can start watching them.

338
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,018
你闻到了吗？
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,018
You smell that?

339
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,889
闻起来像是你在漏气 
Smells like you're leaking.

340
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,369
帮我检查一下怎么样 
How 'bout checking it out for me.

341
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,893
好的，先生 看看有没有发现什么异常 
Yes, sir. See if you see anything.

342
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,550
是啊 
Yeah.

343
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,597
目前看起来还不算太糟 
Doesn't look too bad just yet.

344
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:25,646
我不确定...但应该能让你回到要去的地方 
I don't know-- it'll probably get you back to where you're going.

345
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,689
好的 那么，从那里出来吧 好的 
All right. Well, come on out of there. All right.

346
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,691
是啊，你最好告诉你的维修工 
Yeah, you better tell your maintenance guy.

347
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:32,693
你可能需要一个新的垫圈 
You might need a new gasket.

348
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,107
我很感激，老兄 是的，先生 
I appreciate it, man. Yes, sir.

349
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,783
祝你愉快 你也是 
Have a good one. You, too.

350
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,317
好的 直接回去 
Yeah. Straight back.

351
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,190
两个箱子 是的 
Two boxes.  Yep.

352
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,540
两条长凳 是的，先生 
Two benches. Yes, sir.

353
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,193
好的 
All right.

354
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,328
关掉它 
Shut her down.

355
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,852
卡明斯先生，现在交给你了 谢了，兄弟 
She's all yours, Mr. Cummings. Thank you, bud.

356
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,291
嘿，闻起来像是你修好了 
Hey, smells like you fixed it.

357
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,249
接得好 
Good catch.

358
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:37,078
好的，开车注意安全 祝你一切顺利 
All right, drive safe. All right, have a good one.

359
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,592
天啊 
Jesus.

360
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:44,988
呼 
Phew.

361
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:47,894
是啊 
Yeah.

362
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:51,419
对，踩油门，踩油门，踩油门，踩油门，踩油门 
Yeah, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.

363
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,754
喂？
Hello?

364
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,407
史蒂夫 是我 
Steve. It's me.

365
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,106
杰夫，杰夫，你他妈给我打电话干嘛？
Jeff, Jeff, what the fuck are you doing calling me, man?

366
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,412
你他妈都上新闻了 
You all over the goddamn news and shit.

367
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,110
听着，我必须离开这个国家 
Look, I got to get out of the country.

368
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:32,199
我在考虑去巴西或委内瑞拉 
I'm thinking, like, Brazil or Venezuela.

369
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,857
找个有海滩且没有引渡条约的地方 
Somewhere with a beach and no extradition.

370
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,724
天啊，你听起来简直疯了 
God, you sound fucking crazy.

371
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,334
我知道 对不起 
I know. I'm sorry.

372
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,428
别干蠢事，比如去看望你的家人 
Don't do no stupid shit  like go see your family.

373
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,121
躲起来 明白吗？好的 好的 我会躲起来 
Hide. All right? Okay. Okay. I'll hide.

374
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,561
一个月内别再打来了 
Don't call back for another month.

375
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,041
好吧，我一个月后打给你 
All right, I'm-a call you in a month.

376
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,303
别再打我那该死的电话了 
And don't call my motherfucking phone again.

377
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,562
明白没？好的 
You got it? A'ight.

378
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,520
史蒂夫？
Steve?

379
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,957
史...

380

你 很多 
You. A lot.

381

很多？我们有...是的 你想要什么？
A lot? We have-- Yep. What do you want?

382
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,496
一只猴子 一只猴子？
A monkey. A monkey?

383
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,324
等一下 
Wait a minute.

384
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:55,804
乌龟 乌龟 
Turtle. Turtle.

385
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:57,070
什么...你想要什么？糖果 
What-- and what do you want?  Candy.

386
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,459
糖果？
Candy?

387
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,330
我们收获了很多糖果 
We got a lot of candy.

388
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,594
呃，嗯，先生，我们还有十分钟就要关门了 
Uh, um, sir, we're closing here in ten minutes.

389
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,771
先生？好的，没问题 
Sir? Yeah, no problem.

390
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,126
我抓住你了 
I got you.

391
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:40,913
零，三，六，
Zero, three, six,

392
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,824
五，九，八，二

393
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,793
卫生间安全 
Bathroom's clear.

394
00:29:58,492 --> 00:29:59,772
注意，
Attention,

395
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,277
玩具反斗城的顾客们

396
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,846
本店将在五分钟后结束营业 
Our store will be closing in five minutes.

397
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,370
所以，如果您不是玩具或员工，
So, if you are not a toy or an employee,

00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:10,330
请将选购的商品带到前台结账 
please bring your purchases up to the front.

399

无论您是孩子还是家长
Whether you are a kid or a parent

400
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,335
或是叔叔或朋友让梦想成真，
or an uncle or a friend making a dream come true,

401
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,990
是时候做出选择了
it is time to make your choices

00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,862
请到前方收银台与我们汇合

"屋顶人"，今天早些时候从布朗溪监狱越狱 
as the Roofman, escaped from Brown Creek Prison  earlier today.

408
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:35,954
今晚，他仍然在逃 
Tonight, he's still out there somewhere.

409
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:38,130
当局发现曼彻斯特，
Authorities discovered Manchester,

410
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:42,308
他因持械抢劫和绑架罪正在服刑 45 年，
who was serving 45 years for armed robbery and kidnapping,

411
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,179
今天下午被发现失踪...
was missing this afternoon...

412
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,790
哈 ...在一次例行点名期间 
Ha. ...during a routine head count.

413
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,967
狱警不知道曼彻斯特越狱的方式
Correction officers do not know the method

414
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,537
或确切时间……
or exact time of Manchester's escape...

415
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,057
他们至今仍不知道我是如何逃脱的
They still don't know how I got out.

416
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,537
……但认为他可能仍在夏洛特地区
...but believe he may still be in the Charlotte area.

417
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,717
不，不，不 我早就离开了   我们相信他是在
No, no, no. I'm-I'm long gone. We believe he fled

418
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,978
今天中午 12 点到下午 4 点之间逃走的 
sometime between 12:00 and 4:00 this afternoon.

419
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,502
他是个非常聪明的人，智商超群 
He's a very smart individual. Super intelligent.

420
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,112
可能达到了天才级别 
Probably genius level.

421
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,071
但他也是个彻头彻尾的白痴 
But he's also an absolute idiot.

422
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:09,248
我们认为嫌疑人可能持有武器 
We believe that the suspect could be armed.

423
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:11,990
而且他有暴力行为的前科 
And he has a history of violent behavior.

424
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:13,687
什么？警方正在要求
What? Police are asking

425
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:16,429
如果你看到长得像曼彻斯特的人，
if you see someone who looks like Manchester,

426
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:20,128
请立即联系当局，不要与他正面冲突 
please call authorities and do not confront him.

427
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,872
好的 
Okay.

428
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,353
好的 
All right.

429
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,094
是啊 
Yeah.

430
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,228
一、二、三、四，
one, two, three, four,

431
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,360
五、六 
five, six.

432
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,852
哇 没错 
Whoa. Yeah.

433
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:44,256
大多数人越狱后
Most guys, when they escape,

434
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,693
几小时内就会被抓 
get caught in the first few hours.

435
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,522
他们只顾拼命逃得越远越快越好 
They go as far as they can as fast as they can.

436
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,177
这招从来都不管用 
And that never works.

437
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,441
诀窍在于停下来 
The trick is to stop.

438
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,227
找个没人会注意的地方 
Find a place no one will look.

439
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:26,036
有时候，最隐蔽的藏身之处反而就在众目睽睽之下 
Sometimes, the best hiding places are in plain sight.

440
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:30,693
一个人们过于忙碌而无暇顾及你的地方 
A place where people are too preoccupied to see you.

441
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,435
所以我像老鼠一样保持安静 
So I kept quiet as a mouse.

442
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,133
但夜晚除外 
But not at night.

443
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,222
夜晚属于我 
I owned the night.

444
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,877
♪ 我们究竟哪里出了错？♪
♪ Where did we go wrong?♪

445
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,706
对"天台飞贼"的追捕行动
The manhunt for the Roofman

446
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,317
已进入第三天
enters its third day.

447
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,536
人们的注意力总是转瞬即逝
People have short attention spans.

448
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,322
过了一会儿，他们觉得无聊了 
After a while, they get bored.

449
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,719
我估计我得安静上一个月左右 
I figured I had to be quiet for about a month, give or take.

450
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:55,196
警方仍未找到逃犯杰弗里·曼彻斯特
Still no leads from police on the whereabouts

451
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,330
下落的任何线索
of escaped convict Jeffrey Manchester,
 
452
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,549
随着搜捕行动进入第八天 
as the manhunt enters its eighth day.

453
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,899
有一次，我在第 82 空降师服役时
One time, when I was in the 82nd,

454
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,423
在丛林里待了整整三十天
I spent 30 days in the woods

455
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:07,165
靠雨水和蛴螬活了下来 
surviving off of rainwater and grubs.

456
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,950
你的身体并不需要太多就能维持运转 
Your body doesn't need much to keep going.

457
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,649
真正需要呵护的是你的大脑 
It's your brain that you have to take care of.

458
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,568
如果你能让大脑想象出更美好的境地，
If you can make your brain imagine a better place,

459
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,653
它就能带你渡过任何难关 
it can get you through anything.

460
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:20,743
随便选个地方，只要不是你现在待的地方就行 
Just pick any place but where you are.

461
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,528
比如海边的沙滩 
Like a beach on an ocean.

462
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,443
一个在你被世人遗忘后
A place where your kids can visit

463
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,401
孩子们还能去探望的地方 
after everyone else forgets you.

464
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:27,837
将近两周
Nearly two weeks

465
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,317
自从杰弗里·曼彻斯特
since Jeffrey Manchester escaped

466
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,884
从布朗克里克监狱越狱以来
from Brown Creek Penitentiary.

467
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,582
警方已设置路障
Police have set up roadblocks,

468
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,542
担心曼彻斯特可能仍在附近 
concerned Manchester may still be in the area.

469
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,065
警官，我是第六频道的记者 
Sergeant, I'm with Channel 6 News.

470
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,849
杰弗里·曼彻斯特仍然下落不明 
Jeffrey Manchester's still missing.

471
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,503
你认为他可能在夏洛特吗？
Do you think he could be in Charlotte?

472
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,157
他本可以继续流窜，
He might've kept moving,

473
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,858
但我们不会放弃
but we're not gonna give upon the possibility

474
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,943
他可能仍藏匿在此地
that he still might be hiding out here

475
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,597
梅克伦堡县境内的可能性 
in Mecklenburg County.

476
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,209
当他试图逃跑时，我们已经准备好了 
And when he tries to run, we'll be ready.

477
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,167
祝你好运 
Good luck.

我有个小问题 
One quick question.

494
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:59,973
呃，是的 
Uh, yeah.

495
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,327
好的 我只是想跟你谈谈我的工作时间安排 
Okay. I just wanted to talk to you about my hours.

496
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,455
呃...
Um...

497
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,021
我需要每隔一个周末休息 
I need every other weekend off.

498
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,284
我不太明白 
I'm confused.

499
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,634
首先你向我要工作，
First you ask me for a job,

500
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,984
现在你又向我请假 
and now you're asking me for time off.

501
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,464
嗯，你知道，
Well, you know,

502
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:14,117
我是个注重团队合作的人...是的 
I'm a team player...Yeah.

503
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,468
...但同时，呃，我也是个母亲 
...but, um, I'm also a mom.

504
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:17,947
我知道 
I know.

505
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,862
好吧 那个...我确实如此 
Okay. Well... I do.

506
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:22,430
呃...你提醒我了 
Uh... You-you reminded me.

507
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:25,564
我半年前离婚了，所以...
I got a divorce six months ago, so...

508
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:28,044
现在真的很难兼顾所有事情
it's really hard for me to balance everything right now
509
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,786
既要工作又要照顾女儿们还要面对前妻
with work and my girls and my ex.

510
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,093
哦，拜托 监护权的情况是：
Oh, come on. The custody situation is:

511
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:36,792
他们安排的是，你知道，一个周末归他，一个周末归我 
They have, you know, one weekend him, one weekend me.

512
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:39,708
我不想用我的个人问题来烦你 
I don't want to bore you with my personal problems.

513
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:43,930
很好，很好 因为我不想被你的个人问题烦到 
Good, good. 'Cause I don't want to be bored by your personal problems.

514
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,020
如果这是玩具反斗城的问题，那我倒有兴趣 
If this is a Toys "R" Us problem, then I'm interested.

515
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:49,979
但私人问题请留在私人时间处理 
But personal problems belong on personal time.

516
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,593
谢谢你，莉 我得回去处理工资单了 
Thank you, Leigh. Got to get back to payroll.

517
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,338
工作，工作，工作，工作，工作，工作，工作 
Work, work, work, work, work, work, work.

518
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,509
很高兴见到你 
Good to see you.

519
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:58,818
真是个混蛋 谢了，米奇 
What a dick. Thanks, Mitch.

520
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,120
好的 
Okay.

521
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,604
难以置信 
Unbelievable.

522
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,645
是啊，你简直是个难以置信的混蛋 
Yeah, you're an unbelievable dick.

523
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,647
我知道你是个母亲 你之前提过 
I know you're a mom. You mentioned it before.

524
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,258
又拿母亲身份说事 真够可以的 
Mom card. Unbelievable.

525
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,306
美元符号，U，
Dollar sign, U,

526
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,134
C，C，E，
C, C, E,

527
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:17,267
美元符号，美元符号 
dollar sign, dollar sign.

528
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,313
这是我见过最蠢的密码...
That's the dumbest password I've ever...

529
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,575
我听说过 
I've ever heard of.

530
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,360
"成功 "
"$ucce$$."

531
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,102
呵 
Heh.

532
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,500
我们找到利了 
We found Leigh.

533
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,373
星期六 
Saturday.

534
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,157
再见 
Goodbye.

535
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,552
哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔，哔哔 
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

536
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:44,294
你今天休假了 
You have the day off now.

537
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,035
瞧 
Voilà.

538
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:47,867
新闻现在开始 
The news starts now.

539
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,039
预计将有超过三万人
More than 30,000 folks are expected

540
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:51,737
涌入小镇 
to crowd into town.

541
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,308
...想出了"宝贝洗车"的主意 
...came up with the idea "Babe Wash."

542
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,219
而且比基尼确实能招揽生意 
And the bikinis do bring in the business.

543
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,790
最盛大的独立日庆典
The biggest celebrations of the Fourth

544
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:00,180
就在我身后的天空上演
take place in the skies right behind me.

545
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,394
人们会觉得无聊
People get bored

546
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,618
与上周的新闻一起 
with last week's news.

547
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,969
很快，他们甚至记不起为什么认得你的脸 
Pretty soon, they can't even remember why they know your face.

548
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,147
除非你真的惹毛他们，否则连警察也会失去兴趣 
Even cops lose interest unless you really piss 'em off.

549
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,717
最终所有人都会忘记你 
Everybody forgets you eventually.

550
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,940
除了那些真正爱你的人 
Except people who really love you.

551
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,916
我无法在不伤害他们的情况下接近现在爱我的人 
I couldn't get to the people who love me now without hurting them.

552
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,442
我唯一可能再次见到他们的地方是在别处
The only place I might ever see them again was somewhere else

553
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,357
以及另一个时间 
and some other time.

554
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:50,491
第一步是离开这里...
The first step was getting out of here...

555
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,754
...去那里 
...to get there.

556
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,475
喂？
Hello?

557
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,346
你好 呃...
Hi. Um...

558
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,609
那...呃...请问，请问我能和史蒂夫通话吗？
Wh-- Is, uh-- May I, may I speak to Steve?

559
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,829
请问？抱歉，您是哪位？
Please? Sorry, who is this?

560
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,439
哦，我是朋友 
Oh, this is a friend.

561
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:27,920
那个，我是说...这是奥利弗 他，呃，他的表弟 
Well, I mean, this is...  Oliver. His, uh, his cousin.

562
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,226
我刚才...我在做这个小...
I was-- I'm doing this little...

563
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,837
一次小小的越野旅行，而且，呃，
little cross-country trip, and, uh,

564
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:33,843
他当时，他当时在等我 我本该去拜访的 
he was, he was expecting me. I was supposed to visit.

565
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,362
嗯 嗯 
Mm. Mm.

566
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,364
他没提过拜访的事 
He didn't say anything about a visit.

567
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,148
我不知道他还有个表亲 
And I didn't know he had a cousin.

568
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,324
他大概是忘了提这事吧 
He must have forgot to mention it, I guess.

569
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,630
呃...
Um... 

570
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:44,157
请问您是哪...请问您是哪位？
Who am I sp-- who am I speaking with?

571
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,372
哦，我是他女朋友 
Oh, I'm his girlfriend.

572
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,113
不过这是怎么回事？
What is this about, though?

573
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,942
因为我正忙着呢，所以，呃...
Cause I'm in the middle of something, so, uh...

574
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,857
他女朋友...好吧，太好了 
His girl-- okay, great.

575
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,728
我现在能和史蒂夫谈谈吗？
Could I talk to Steve now?

576
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,251
他不在这里 
He isn't here.

577
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:57,185
好的，那我应该...
Okay, well, should I call back in, like, a...

578
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,907
大概一小时后再打来？
like, an hour or so?

579
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:02,171
呃，他要到12月1日才会回来 
Uh, well, he's not gonna be back until December 1st.

580
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,260
有人能去哪儿待到十二月？
Where does anyone go till December?

581
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:05,958
他在阿富汗 
He's in Afghanistan.
582
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,873
他不在阿富汗 
He's not in Afghanistan.

583
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,487
我们两年前就从阿富汗回来了 
We got back two years ago from Afghanistan.

584
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,094
他签了一份六个月的合同 
Well, he took a six-month contract.

585
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:15,576
不过他让我帮他记录留言 
Um, but he asked me to take messages for him.

586
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,061
如果他来电话
Is there something that you want me

587
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:19,798
你有什么需要我转告的吗？
to tell him if he calls?

588
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,845
嗯，那个...
Yeah, uh...

589
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:26,761
告诉他，奥利弗表弟会暂时
tell him that, uh, Cousin Oliver is gonna stay

590
00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:29,024
住在附近的亲戚家，直到他12月1日回来
with relatives in the area until he's back

591
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:31,038
参加一个非常重要的会议 
on December 1st for a really important meeting.

592
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,419
好的，我会告诉他的 
Okay, I will tell him that.

593
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,682
那个，到时候我也会去见你的 
And, uh, I will see you then, too, I guess.

594
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:36,118
奥利弗表弟 
Cousin Oliver.

595
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,164
再见 
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,164
Bye.

596
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,784
喂？
Hello?

597
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,744
别挠我痒痒了 等一下 
Stop tickling me. Just a sec.

598
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,615
喂？
Hello?

599
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,748
加里疯了 
Gary is crazy.

600
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:58,706
加里！
Gary!

601
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,491
是谁？喂？
Who is it? Hello?

602
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,493
加里！
Gary!

603
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,017
喂？加里 
Hello? Gary.

604
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,410
这是谁？
Who is this?

605
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,325
杰夫，是你吗？
Jeff, is this you?

606
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:12,938
你要是再打过来，我就报警了 
If you call here again, I'm gonna call the cops.

607
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:15,027
听见没有？
Do you hear me?

608
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:17,029
我们已经翻篇了 
We've moved on.

609
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:19,858
你也该向前看了 
And you need to move on, too. 

610
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:21,599
别再往这儿打电话了 
Don't call here anymore.

611
00:44:24,313 --> 00:44:25,488
好痒啊 
That tickles.

612
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,893
哦，天哪，好痒啊 
Oh, boy, that tickles.

613
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,635
艾摩想玩 
Elmo wants to play.

614
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,251
我们玩吧 
Let's play.

615
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,949
哦，天哪，好痒啊 
Oh, boy, that tickles.

616
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,951
艾摩爱你 
Elmo love you.

617
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,432
艾摩想和你玩 你是艾摩的小甜心 
Elmo wants to play. You're Elmo's sweetheart.

618
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:58,608
好痒啊 我们一起玩吧 
That tickles. Let's play.

619
00:44:58,783 --> 00:44:59,871
艾摩爱你 
Elmo love you.

620
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,829
哦，天哪，好痒啊 
Oh, boy, that tickles.

621
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,833
我们玩吧 
Let's play.

622
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:07,226
艾摩爱你 
Elmo love you.

623
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,271
艾摩喜欢他的 ABC 字母歌……
Elmo loves his ABCs...

624
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,191
嘿，莉    奥蒂-奥蒂-奥蒂斯 
Hey, Leigh. Otee-Otee-Otis.

625
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,889
嘿 
Hey.

626
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:19,542
嘿，米奇 
Hey, Mitch.

627
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,283
你正是我想见的人 
You're just the man I want to see.

628
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:24,852
酷 
Cool.

629
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,724
你，呃...
You, uh...

630
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,682
你喜欢花生 M&M 巧克力豆，对吧？
you like Peanut M&Ms, right?

631
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:29,988
是啊 怎么了？

632
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,424
是啊 

633
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:34,561
因为我们少了很多

634
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,777
花生 M&M 巧克力豆 你知道原因吗？

635
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,692
没有 

636
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:40,626
怎么了？没什么事 

637
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,217
你看起来很紧张 我没有 

638
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,523
没有 

639
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,830
不行？不行 绝对不行 

640
00:45:46,004 --> 00:45:47,614
你不能那样跟他说话 

641
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:50,312
好吧 你知道吗，我们外面少了六箱货 

642
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:51,792
我刚才就在想...叮...

643
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:53,925
他们肯定躲在什么地方... 噗 

644
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:58,930
我真的很抱歉 

645
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:01,628
天啊，他不能这样跟你说话 

646
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,151
现在我倒成了坏人 

647
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:05,070
你得学会为自己出头 

648
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,553
明白吗？不然他会变本加厉的 

649
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,331
我不太擅长处理冲突，所以...

650
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:11,464
知道了 好吧，我们...我们会慢慢改善这个问题的 

651
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,074
酷 

652
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,174
听着，米奇，你真的伤了奥蒂斯的心，

653
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:28,089
我觉得你应该道个歉 

654
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:30,048
对不起 

655
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:31,571
嗯，这是个好的开始 

656
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,098
-好吧 -你知道的，

657
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:34,704
人们尊重领导者的仁慈 

658
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:35,967
嗯 

659
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:37,577
考虑到这一点，

660
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,840
我想邀请你来我的教堂 

661
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,450
十字路口教堂 

662
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:44,932
就在州际公路对面 

663
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,455
呃...你去过吗？

664
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,023
我不太信教 

665
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:51,116
好吧，我在那里负责玩具募捐活动，

666
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,519
这让我不禁思考，我竟然在这里，

667
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:54,812
在一家玩具店工作，

668
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:58,772
而你甚至没有为我的玩具募捐活动捐过一个玩具 

669
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:01,949
我们这里是卖玩具的，不是免费赠送的 

670
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:03,650
好的 那些退货的玩具怎么处理？

671
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,735
都是完好无损的，但我们没法再卖了 

672
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,956
我们这儿是做生意的，莉 

673
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,872
好吧 不过你还是可以来的 

674
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,700
你知道的，所有人都受欢迎 

675
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:16,181
即使他们刻薄或还没准备好 

676
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:19,140
所以你可以来，带一大袋玩具，或者不带 

677
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:20,838
你都会受到欢迎 

678
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:24,102
但带上玩具，你这次就能当回好人 

679
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,669
你难道不想当个好人吗？

680
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,324
拜托，米奇！当个好人吧！

681
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,891
好的 

682
00:48:32,605 --> 00:48:34,259
那是垃圾吗？

683
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,522
呃……

684
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:39,481
嗯？需要我帮你把这个扔进垃圾桶吗？

685
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,005
这只是些玩具...

686
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:42,745
呃，我听说这里在搞玩具募捐活动

687
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,747
好的，就在这边走

688
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,722
没...没关系，我就放这儿吧 没事的 

689
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,040
我可不想

690
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:50,449
穿着这双高跟鞋走那么远的路 

691
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,934
你人真好 

692
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,413
给你 

693
00:48:58,587 --> 00:48:59,893
谢谢 

694
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,808
哦，这对我来说太重了 

695
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,549
得把它搬进去 

696
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:04,902
来吧，我带你看看玩具该放哪儿 

697
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,121
你想让我把它们放哪儿？

698
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:07,770
你可以直接带他们进来 

699
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,990
仪式即将开始 

700
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,129
任何感到孤独的人...

701
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:16,954
...快下来吧 

702
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,695
因为你属于这里 

703
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:21,349
我们都是罪人，

704
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:23,743
所以我有时会请我妻子唱这首歌

哈利路亚 

723
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,735
哇，有人饿坏了是吧？

724
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,606
胃口真不小啊，嗯？

725
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,260
对不起 求你了 

726
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,092
我已经很久没吃过这么好吃的食物了 

727
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:50,612
不，这很棒 大块头就该吃大餐 

728
00:50:50,786 --> 00:50:51,961
是的 是的 

729
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,615
现在你可不能偷偷溜走

730
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,621
不去跟牧师和他妻子打个招呼 

731
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:56,784
不行 这违反规定

732
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:57,928
不 我绝不会 我绝不会

733
00:50:58,011 --> 00:50:59,011
我是艾琳 

734
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,971
约翰·Z……呃，佐林 约翰·佐林 

735
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:04,026
是啊，我以前没在这附近见过你 

736
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,023
我注意到你了，很明显，在……在那排座位上 

737
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,503
你从哪儿来的？是刚搬来这附近吗？

738
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,327
是啊，呃，我是——我是...

739
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:13,505
我刚来这个地方，其实...对一切都还很陌生 

740
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,855
你知道，就是，呃...

741
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,813
这一切真的只是，你知道的...

742
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:19,384
这里的一切对我来说都是全新的 

743
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,208
我是从纽约市来的 

744
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:22,601
那是个适合步行的城市，

745
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:24,342
我是说，如果我去过的话 

746
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,217
那是个适合步行的城镇 没错 

747
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,042
我猜你穿坏了不少双运动鞋吧？

748
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,569
大家都这样 对吧？你也穿坏...

749
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:32,176
是啊，是啊 天啊 你...

750
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,265
你这大高个儿脚可真小 

751
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,180
不，其实我脚挺大的 只是，

752
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:37,707
我穿错鞋了，我也不知道怎么回事，

753
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,053
我觉得这些大概是女鞋里的九码吧 

754
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:42,664
很抱歉，我绝不会穿运动鞋去教堂 

755
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,275
我——真的很抱歉 

756
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:46,529
我想介绍你认识一个人 

757
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,888
我来给你介绍一下莉·温斯科特 

758
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:50,629
她负责这里的玩具募捐活动，

759
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:53,197
听说你捐了很大一笔钱 

760
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:54,937
我知道她想为此感谢你 

761
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,335
你知道，艾琳，她那边看起来有点忙 

762
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,294
她正在和女儿进行严肃的谈话 

763
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,385
现在吗？

764
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,919
是的，我们可以 

765
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:10,261
好的 你捐了这么一大笔钱 

766
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:11,480
好的 嗯，当然 嗯 嘿，嘿 

767
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:13,652
好的，太棒了 呃，莉 嘿，莉 

768
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,175
莉 嘿，莉 

769
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:17,134
来，来跟我们的神秘人物打个招呼 

770
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:18,308
好的 快进来 

771
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,396
带了 带了 

772
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,094
这位是我们的全明星莉 

773
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:22,447
她是这间教会

774
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,184
所有善举的中流砥柱 

775
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:26,143
她负责外联，准备餐食，

776
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:27,883
组织玩具募捐活动，她...

777
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:30,321
我真不知道她是怎么兼顾这一切的，但她确实做到了 

778
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,975
这位是约翰...

779
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,413
佐林？纽约来的佐林 

780
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:37,023
哦，纽约啊 

781
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,634
离这儿很远呢 是啊，有点距离 

782
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,985
所以约翰...他捐赠了非常多的玩具 

783
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,553
哦，你真是太好了 我们...

784
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,425
来得正是时候 

785
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,819
不，我-我是说，嗯，我真的很喜欢圣诞节和-和生日，

786
00:52:50,993 --> 00:52:52,193
呃，还有各种送礼物的时刻 

787
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:53,735
我不知道该怎么说 

788
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:56,042
我只是很喜欢孩子 你有孩子吗，约翰？

789
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,393
那个...你成家了吗，还是单身？

790
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,312
我，呃，刚正式离婚，仅此而已 

791
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:02,574
哦，我很抱歉，约翰 

792
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:03,793
不是所有的婚姻都能成功，对吧？

793
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:05,617
这...这倒是真的 

794
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,511
但回答你的问题，我确实有孩子 

795
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,098
我有两个小淘气男孩，

796
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:11,275
还有一个小女孩是我最好的伙伴 

797
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:12,972
真温馨 嗯...是的 

798
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:14,717
但他们在纽约，而我在这里工作 

799
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,880
那...那那你是...你是做什么工作的？

800
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:19,413
呃，我...我我在政府部门工作，

801
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:22,111
呃，但我不能细说 

802
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,983
这个嘛，属于机密

803
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:25,941
之类的无聊规定 哦 

804
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,770
这位是来自纽约的约翰·佐林，我们纽约分部的特工 

805
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,032
不！不，不 

806
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,212
绝对不是那个 我喜欢那个 

807
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,079
好吧，好吧 

808
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:35,520
那么，我能问问，我们能指望你下周日加入我们吗？

809
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:37,003
是的 嗯，还有这周三 

810
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:38,737
哦 哇 是啊 周三是-周三是什么？

811
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:40,478
呃，我组织单身人士晚餐会，

812
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:43,176
这周会在红龙虾餐厅举办 

813
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,917
我超爱红龙虾餐厅 

814
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,444
我是说，不只是海鲜 那些奶酪饼干...

815
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,572
嗯哼 我是说，对啊 

816
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:48,751
我-我是说，你会去吗？

817
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:51,271
嗯 莉？

818
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:54,013
你觉得你会加入我们的首次单身晚餐吗？

819
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:57,059
嗯，我从未想过自己会是单身，

820
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,845
不过，当然，好，我—我会—我会去的 

821
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:01,760
好的 嗯，我—我会—我会到的 

822
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:03,370
算我一个 好的 

823
00:54:03,544 --> 00:54:05,372
很高兴见到你 非常感谢 

824
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,638
感谢您今天加入我们 真的非常感谢 

825
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:08,070
我喜欢扮演约翰

826
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,594
比当杰夫更让我开心 

827
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:11,488
周三见 周三 好的，女士 

828
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:13,772
约翰是个好人 

829
00:54:13,946 --> 00:54:15,774
人们都喜欢他 

830
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,863
莉似乎也喜欢他 

831
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:20,953
但像她这样的女孩不可能真的爱上

832
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:24,261
一个穿着女式跑鞋和蜘蛛侠 T 恤的男人 

833
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,003
而且，我真的需要去看牙医了 

834
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:30,615
靠糖果维生对牙齿不好 

835
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:39,624
下午好 你好吗？

836
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:41,103
很好，先生 您怎么样？

837
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,106
看看这些能换到什么 

838
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,587
呃，每人十个怎么样？三百块 

839
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,067
行，就三百吧 

840
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,333
好，就这么定了 成交 没问题，先生 

841
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,853
29 号订单修改 

842
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,901
14 个蛀牙 对成年人来说这蛀牙可不少 

843
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,119
是啊，我很抱歉 

844
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,556
我只是有点...

845
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,301
天生的吧，我想，有点爱吃甜食，

846
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,386
而且我总能接触到很多特别好吃的糖果 

847
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,695
只是还没能...张开嘴

848
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,214
张大点，拜托...停-停下 好了 

849
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:13,788
看看那些 

850
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,187
哦，哇 

851
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,713
你好 

852
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,890
女士们好 嗨！

853
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,196
嗨 嗨 

854
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,850
大家好吗？很好 

855
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,373
哦，好的 

856
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,027
我还以为这是单身人士早午餐，

857
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,507
不是超模早午餐 

858
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,118
哦 

859
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,686
你随时可以挤到我们这边来 

860
00:55:43,165 --> 00:55:45,559
我们想欢迎你，约翰 

861
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,126
是的，欢迎欢迎 

862
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,349
今天这里就我一个人吗？

863
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,086
是的 嗯哼 没错 你就是 

864
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,175
结果确实如此，是的 对 好的 

865
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,134
是的 希望我们没有让你感到不知所措 

866
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,227
哦，不，不，不，其实我...我-我非常喜欢这样 

867
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:59,312
好的，太好了 我很高兴有这么多新朋友，

868
00:55:59,486 --> 00:56:01,140
尤其是漂亮的朋友 呃...

869
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:03,185
哦，真贴心 

870
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,928
那么约翰，我听说你在政府部门工作 具体是做什么的呢？

871
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:10,845
我-我很想详细说说，但我在执行卧底任务，所以，呃...

872
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,891
哦，听起来很神秘呢 

873
00:56:13,065 --> 00:56:15,154
不，我保证没那么神秘 

874
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,635
其实挺无聊的 

875
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,073
我从不知道夏洛特这里还有个情报部门 

876
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,770
哦，你是执法人员吗？

877
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:24,381
现在退休了，但曾经是 

878
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,252
哇，真了不起 

879
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:28,733
我，我，呃...

880
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:30,173
我被捕了吗？这是怎么回事？

881
00:56:30,256 --> 00:56:31,736
我不想让你难过 

882
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,307
你让所有人都难堪，莎莉 

883
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,609
他不是来接受审问的 

884
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,829
不，不，不，我其实非常喜欢这样 

885
00:56:38,003 --> 00:56:39,613
有她在这里我感觉安全多了 

886
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:41,485
呃，不过——确实如此 

887
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,708
呃，基本上每个大城市都有情报人员 

888
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:45,880
我们只是不怎么宣传而已，对 

889
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:49,884
既然他是卧底，为什么会在红龙虾餐厅参加单身联谊晚宴？

890
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:52,060
这个问题问得好 

891
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:53,410
这个嘛...

892
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:55,673
这是个合理的问题 我-我可以...

893
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,635
也就是说，这是个非机密问题 

894
00:56:57,718 --> 00:57:00,808
我在这里或许是在寻找下一位约翰·佐林女士 

895
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:05,204
拜托了 拜托了 

896
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,641
你看，但这里有个问题 

897
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:11,428
我遇到的问题是这里漂亮的选择实在太多了

898
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,081
让人难以抉择 

899
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:14,957
不，我...我很抱歉 我不该说这个的 

900
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,880
我妈妈总说不要随便夸女人

901
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:20,306
因为这会让她感到不自在 

902
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,572
嗯，总是从她们的鞋子开始观察 

903
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:24,223
说到这个，稍等一下 

904
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:26,355
让我钻到这张桌子下面 

905
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,792
打扰一下 

906
00:57:27,966 --> 00:57:30,403
下面有双高筒靴 

907
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:33,145
早午餐穿细高跟 可以啊，姑娘 

908
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,713
好吧，好吧 

909
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:37,410
这里越来越热了 

910
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,499
不，不，不，不 

911
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:41,196
刚才真有意思 

912
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,028
你看，我平时很少出门，所以这对我来说很有趣 

913
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:44,678
我也是 

914
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:46,375
你肯定让他们很开心 

915
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,855
说真的，他们让我很开心 

916
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,165
这是我的车 我是说，我从来没...

917
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:50,118
这是你吗？哦，是辆斯巴鲁 没错 

918
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:51,380
是啊 

919
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,252
我喜欢这样 

920
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,559
好吧，我...我正在鼓起勇气 

921
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,038
呃...

922
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,693
我有两个问题要问你 

923
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,565
两个？就两个？

924
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,001
好的 说吧 

925
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:05,220
快说 告诉我第一个 快说 

926
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,788
呃，你是同性恋，对吧？

927
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:09,834
什么？我是什么？你才是同性恋 

928
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,009
同性恋？不 是的 

929
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:12,314
什么？

930
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,055
你是在开玩笑吗？不，我...

931
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:15,974
不，我是说，听着，我对同性恋没有任何意见 

932
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,059
我喜欢同性恋，但是，就像，我...不，绝对不是 

933
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:19,887
你刚才... 你怎么会觉得我是同性恋？

934
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:21,541
你看起来就像我们女生中的一员 

935
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:24,065
或者说，你好像特别钟爱女鞋 

936
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,680
不，完全不是那么回事 

937
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,025
好的 呃，不行 

938
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,334
好吧，既然...既然这是拒绝，

939
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:29,727
我们可以直接进入第二个问题 

940
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,596
好的 呃，可以 来吧，我准备好了 

941
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,901
呃...

942
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:36,643
呃，你愿意和我约会吗？

943
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:38,602
约会？

944
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,431
好的 

945
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:45,304
哇，你真是个很直接的人 

946
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:49,438
我，呃...

947
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:54,792
呃，愿意，我非常愿意...真的，非常愿意...

948
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:56,489
我想和你约会 

949
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:58,186
我不知道，好吧 

950
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,971
答案是肯定的 

951
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:01,320
好的 没问题 

952
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:04,192
我周六上午有空，嗯，下周六上午？

953
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:05,585
完美 

954
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,456
我来接你 你住在哪里？

955
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:11,417
我住在一个特别无聊的，呃，

956
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,942
不对外公开的政府大楼里 

957
00:59:16,248 --> 00:59:17,292
这样如何？

958
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:20,295
呃，我们在自由公园见面吧 

959
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:23,081
周六早上八点 

960
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:26,432
听起来像，像是...呃，好吧，听起来像约会 

961
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:27,655
那就说定了 就这么定了 

962
00:59:27,738 --> 00:59:29,217
好的 再见 好的 再见 

963
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,350
好吧 好吧 抱歉 嘿 

964
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,134
你在发抖，而我正要...

965
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:34,966
但别...有辆车 哦，糟了 

966
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:36,355
好的 没事 嗯 

967
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:38,183
好吧，刚才真尴尬 行吧 

968
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:39,488
再见 拜拜！

969
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,374
天气真热 

970
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,202
天气真热 

971
00:59:58,464 --> 00:59:59,857
哇 

972
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:01,772
你身材真棒 

973
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:02,946
谢啦，姑娘 

974
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:07,168
我的前男友杰弗里，他...怎么了？

975
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:09,562
什么？你刚才说杰弗里 

976
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:12,391
是的，那是我前男友的名字...杰弗里 

977
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:13,827
明白了，对 是的 

978
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,001
他叫杰弗里？

979
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:16,525
是的 他当时...天啊 

980
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,918
...状况很糟糕 

981
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:21,226
就像，我们毫无...

982
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,836
没有...？只是好久不见了 

983
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,664
哦，好吧 但我们一点都不像 

984
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,666
知道了 嗯，我-我喜欢和人打交道 

985
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,276
他当时没有说话 

986
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,845
他只是在马桶上看战争历史小说 

987
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:33,019
什么？

988
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:34,282
嗯 

989
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:36,894
不，杰弗里，这太恶心了 

990
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:39,548
对吧？

991
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:43,204
他爱他的书，但一到陪女儿们的时候

992
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:46,904
或者做作业或上驾驶课的时候，他就不露面了 

993
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:48,732
压力山大 

994
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,389
我只是觉得你的生活需要多点乐趣，

995
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:52,257
说实话 

996
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:55,739
好的 

997
01:00:57,479 --> 01:01:00,613
现在想不想去我那儿找点乐子？

998
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:04,225
什么？

999
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,054
真的吗？嗯嗯 

1000
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:09,535
是的 非常喜欢，是的 

1001
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,537
我非常想... 嗯，对 

1002
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,365
好的 嗯 对 现在？

1003
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,627
对 好吧 

1004
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,466
早说过我不是同性恋 

1005
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,384
闭嘴 

1006
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:34,995
跟我说说你的女儿们 

1007
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,389
她们叫迪伊和林赛 

1008
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:39,043
迪伊 11 岁 

1009
01:01:39,217 --> 01:01:41,959
她相当敏感且富有创造力 

1010
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,091
她就像... 我也不知道怎么说 

1011
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:47,791
从她还是个婴儿起，她就一直不让我给她剪头发 

1012
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:49,357
她就是那种特别的孩子 

1013
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:50,924
而林赛已经 16 岁了 

1014
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:53,448
她门上贴着一张纸条，上面写着：

1015
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:55,320
"情感隔离中"

1016
01:01:55,494 --> 01:01:58,279
她刚拿到学车许可证

1017
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:00,978
却拒绝开车，尽管她渴望自由

1018
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:03,371
我们目前的情况就是这样 哦，是这样吗？

1019
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:05,025
我可是个开车好手 

1020
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,814
如果你想让我教她，我——我很乐意效劳 

1021
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:09,116
我们才刚认识 

1022
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,466
说得有道理 那是...

1023
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
是啊，我知道 

1024
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,643
呃，我就是特别喜欢孩子，所以...

1025
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,256
好吧，也许... 也许改天你可以见见他们 

1026
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:22,564
你知道，也许你可以找个周末来...

1027
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,610
一起吃披萨？

1028
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,743
就像披萨派对？我们能办个披萨派对吗？

1029
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,527
比如周六披萨日？

1030
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,398
我很久没出过门了，

1031
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,270
更别说约会了，好吗？好的 

1032
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:34,489
已经很久很久了 嗯哼 

1033
01:02:34,663 --> 01:02:37,884
呃，我...我不知道我的姑娘们是否准备好，你知道的，

1034
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,060
我还没准备好开始约会 

1035
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,583
我理解 

1036
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,502
我们仍然可以办个披萨派对，让它

1037
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:46,153
完全保持平常的样子 

1038
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:49,069
我只是个教堂认识的朋友，你知道的，

1039
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,767
碰巧是个政府间谍 

1040
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,290
而且不是同性恋的那种 

1041
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:53,784
你懂的，一个非同性恋的政府间谍

1042
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,514
就是那种会过来，想要，你知道，

1043
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:58,165
和你还有你女儿一起吃披萨的人 

1044
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:00,298
你知道，就是让一切显得正常 好吧 

1045
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:01,995
你-你并不正常，约翰，

1046
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:03,169
但是...

1047
01:03:03,257 --> 01:03:05,825
我喜欢你 

1048
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:08,306
你知道什么不正常吗？嗯？

1049
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,743
你一直都这样吗？

1050
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:13,833
看起来很诱人 

1051
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,246
哦 

1052
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,205
他来了 好吗？

1053
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:23,947
你好 

1054
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,949
请进 

1055
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,776
哇，这么多吃的 

1056
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,779
姑娘们，这是我朋友约翰 

1057
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,347
约翰，这是我的女儿们 

1058
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:34,958
嘿，姑娘们 

1059
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:37,264
呃，你们好 我是约翰·佐林 

1060
01:04:37,438 --> 01:04:40,354
我是你们妈妈在教堂认识的好朋友 

1061
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:43,575
你一定是迪伊 

1062
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:45,055
是迪莉娅的简称吗？

1063
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,708
对 是的 

1064
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,233
你一定是林赛，那是...的简称

1065
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,889
这其实不是什么简称 

1066
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:54,934
听着，我对你们早有耳闻 

1067
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:57,937
呃，我听说的事情之一，

1068
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:03,029
就是你，迪，和我一样是塞尔达的超级粉丝 

1069
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:04,203
是真的吗？

1070
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:05,814
是的 对吗？

1071
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,385
很好，因为我给你买了这个林克玩偶 

1072
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,819
还有一个问题：

1073
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,605
你玩过四支剑吗？

1074
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:14,998
没有 它太棒了，

1075
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,394
还附带这个特殊控制器

1076
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:17,304
我稍后会教你如何使用

1077
01:05:17,478 --> 01:05:18,958
直到你能打败我为止，

1078
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:20,964
你大概很快就能做到了

1079
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:22,270
因为我听说你是个塞尔达大师 

1080
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:25,747
谢谢 是的 塞尔达确实有效 

1081
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:26,922
一个搞定 

1082
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:29,229
林赛，这是给你的，

1083
01:05:29,403 --> 01:05:32,450
我收集了一批充满青春期焦虑的音乐

1084
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:35,192
供你欣赏 

1085
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:37,672
谢谢？

1086
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:39,718
不，谢谢你 

1087
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,896
很高兴认识你，约翰·佐林，

1088
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,812
妈妈在教堂认识的朋友 

1089
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:52,905
你要去哪儿？我还有作业要做 

1090
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,603
没事的 

1091
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:57,170
也许下次吧 

1092
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:58,432
好吗？

1093
01:05:58,606 --> 01:06:00,565
没事吧？别担心 

1094
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:03,568
我，呃，正好也给你带了点东西，

1095
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:05,048
利小姐 哦 

1096
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,702
这一切真是太贴心了 

1097
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:09,356
我为林赛感到难过 

1098
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,358
我...我本以为这对她来说会很难接受 

1099
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,882
是的 不，而且，你看，我理解这一点 

1100
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,406
这个必须放在最上面 

1101
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,408
对，最上面那部分 

1102
01:06:19,236 --> 01:06:21,238
这个必须得拿掉……

1103
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,972
等等，灯在哪儿……

1104
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:25,807
等等，你得接上 

1105
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:26,987
哦，这咔嗒声 

1106
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,375
我爱死这咔嗒声了 

1107
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:29,641
这个必须装在那个上面 迪伊？

1108
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:30,856
是啊 

1109
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,684
11 点了 已经过 11 点了 

1110
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,255
拜托了，让我们完成这个吧 求你了？

1111
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,734
求你了？她可是最棒的建筑师呢 

1112
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:37,171
我们只差 20 块就完成了 

1113
01:06:37,254 --> 01:06:38,472
是啊，求你了，妈妈 

1114
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:40,387
就差一点 下次吧，好吗？

1115
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:41,562
好的 

1116
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,043
和你在一起我真的很开心 

1117
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:45,218
好吗？嗯 

1118
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,222
我能再见到你吗？

1119
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:50,571
我很乐意 

1120
01:06:50,745 --> 01:06:52,747
是吗？是的 

1121
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:55,881
那如果太晚了，我就直接过来敲你窗户？

1122
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:57,709
哦 

1123
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:59,058
我不确定自己是不是...

1124
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:00,886
那种会"敲窗户"的女生，约翰 

1125
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,801
不怕？

1126
01:07:02,975 --> 01:07:06,022
好吧，那我直接敲前门怎么样？

1127
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:07,545
好的

01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:23,119
别碰那个灯 我不会的 

1157
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,422
是啊，也许明年我们该买个充气版的奥蒂斯 

1158
01:09:27,032 --> 01:09:29,774
嘿 这-这次我可不会插手 

1159
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:31,776
好的？你必须这么做 你必须这么做 

1160
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:35,040
你得给那个恶霸鼻子来一拳，明白吗？

1161
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,306
好样的，奥蒂斯 没错 

1162
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,570
是的 米奇，我有件事要告诉你 

1163
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:45,050
哇，好吧 嗯 

1164
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:46,791
我是说...好吧 什么？

1165
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,749
呃...

1166
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,013
什么？

1167
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:54,364
呃……

1168
01:09:54,538 --> 01:09:56,496
请说吧 

1169
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,368
不，抱歉 呃，我只是...什么，什么？

1170
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:01,022
呃，我，我是，嗯... 说吧 

1171
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:01,980
奥蒂斯，快点 我...

1172
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:03,373
直说吧

1173
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:05,201
我想告诉你我... 什么？

1174
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,015
我按你说的把储藏室打扫干净了 

1175
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:08,465
就这样了吗？是的 

1176
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,423
不 不 

1177
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:16,429
我妈妈以前常告诉我，要小心你触碰的东西 

1178
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:21,652
她说，移动一粒沙子就会改变

1179
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:24,394
整个宇宙的一切 

1180
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:27,484
我想人们称之为蝴蝶效应 

1181
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:30,313
一只蝴蝶扇动翅膀就能

1182
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:33,185
在地球另一端引发飓风 

1183
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:37,363
不知不觉间，我们的人生轨迹就产生了交集

1184
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:39,365
并改变即将发生的事 

1185
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,237
你确定要剪刘海吗？

1186
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:42,586
当然 

1187
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,630
这可是个大改变 

1188
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,110
关于刘海的问题是，

1189
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:46,724
大约只有千分之一的人

1190
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,331
留刘海会好看，

1191
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:51,116
但好消息是，我觉得你可能是其中之一 

1192
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,293
天啊 

1193
01:10:54,467 --> 01:10:57,209
没有人注意到蝴蝶在扇动翅膀

1194
01:10:57,383 --> 01:11:00,604
直到所有人都感受到这场风暴 

1195
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:03,781
我知道风暴即将来临 

1196
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:07,045
我知道如果我在一个地方停留太久，

1197
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:09,265
最终会有人认出我 

1198
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:11,832
我知道我必须离开 

1199
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,053
我只是不想独自一人离开 

1200
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:17,886
你觉得你能就这样搬到别的地方去吗？

1201
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:20,711
像海滩那样的地方吗？换个地方重新开始？

1202
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:22,016
我不知道，约翰 

1203
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,544
我-我得回到这里，你明白吗？

1204
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:25,368
我们可以带上女儿们 

1205
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:26,847
收拾行李走人吧 

1206
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:29,676
嗯 这...

1207
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,896
不，我不能那么做 

1208
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,941
我做不到 

1209
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:38,381

搞什么鬼？

1230
01:13:02,116 --> 01:13:03,683
什么？哦，天哪！

1231
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:06,033
天啊！

1232
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:09,449
天啊，你们人真多 

1233
01:14:09,532 --> 01:14:11,316
他——他块头好大 他光着身子！

1234
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:12,665
他冲我来了 

1235
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:13,888
先生，他还在这里吗？

1236
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:15,320
我不知道 

1237
01:14:15,494 --> 01:14:17,370
我听到外面的...警报门响了 

1238
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,933
所以他可能出去了？

1239
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:20,826
-呃，是的 -夏洛特警察！

1240
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,241
-夏洛特警察！-夏洛特警察！

1241
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:25,199
警察局！警察局！

1242
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:28,072
警察局！

1243
01:14:28,246 --> 01:14:30,553
警察局！警察局！

1244
01:14:34,774 --> 01:14:36,384
警报器响了 

1245
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,126
我们回来的时候，门是虚掩着的，

1246
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,651
所以我们确信他是从这儿出去的 

1247
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:43,745
警官，我们可以查看整个监控过程，

1248
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,438
因为我知道怎么...按这个播放键，所以...

1249
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:47,918
米奇？怎么了？

1250
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:49,706
好消息是你店里装满了监控摄像头

1251
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:51,487
是的 没错

1252
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:53,314
坏消息是...

1253
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,621
他们都没在录像 

1254
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,668
你得解决这个问题 

1255
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:04,456
除了那个裸男，你们有没有注意到

1256
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,546
这附近有什么奇怪的事情发生？

1257
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:11,768
呃，呃……

1258
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,948
呃，我们丢失了大量游戏库存 

1259
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:22,343
具体是多少？

1260
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,738
相当庞大的数量 

1261
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:30,917
米奇，你得在这里安排真正的安保措施了 

1262
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:32,832
这家玩具反斗城的员工们

1263
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:34,834
正在为假日购物潮做准备，

1264
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:36,923
但店长米奇·哈金表示

1265
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:40,361
他今早目睹的景象完全出乎意料：

1266
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,800
一个强壮、身材高大、赤身裸体的男人 

1267
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:46,542
呃，一个裸男朝我冲了过来 

1268
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:48,516
我觉得他是想杀我，我就逃跑了，

1269
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:50,023
把自己锁在了办公室里 

1270
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:51,464
当我问那个裸男

1271
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,070
会不会吓跑假日购物者时，

1272
01:15:53,244 --> 01:15:56,508
哈金先生说他正在雇佣全天候保安 

1273
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,250
我们现在确实有一套非常完善的安保系统 

1274
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:00,686
家庭可以安心了 

1275
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,562
这里是过圣诞节的安心之所 

1276
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:04,041
我觉得看起来很棒 

1277
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:05,125
嗨 嗨 

1278
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:06,736
你好 

1279
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,651
我们差不多准备好了 

1280
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:10,478
主啊，我们感谢您

1281
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:12,568
赐予这丰盛的食物，

1282
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:15,571
也感谢您赐予我们家庭的恩典 阿门 

1283
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,485
阿门 

1284
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,749
感恩节快乐 感恩节快乐 

1285
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,011
感恩节快乐 

1286
01:16:21,185 --> 01:16:22,545
感恩节快乐 

1287
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,362
那么，莉 什么事？

1288
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:28,845
不如你给我们讲讲那个裸体男人的故事吧 

1289
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:30,977
哦，没-没什么事，大家别担心 

1290
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:32,762
外面...外面太冷了，

1291
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,068
有个流浪汉需要冲个澡 

1292
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:37,636
可万一他也是个杀人犯呢？

1293
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,551
他...别那么夸张 

1294
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:40,900
他不是杀人犯 

1295
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:42,210
你妈说得完全正确 

1296
01:16:42,293 --> 01:16:43,773
他绝对不是杀人犯 

1297
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,557
你不知道的，约翰 

1298
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:47,650
如果他真是杀手，早就动手了，对吧？

1299
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:50,867
呃，报纸上说被盗的游戏光盘价值一万美元 

1300
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:52,651
嗯 

1301
01:16:52,825 --> 01:16:54,004
我不知道这是不是巧合 

1302
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:55,310
那可是一大笔钱 

1303
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:56,398
呃，我不知道，妈妈 

1304
01:16:56,481 --> 01:16:57,613
也许你该辞职了 

1305
01:16:57,787 --> 01:16:59,136
你拥有硕士学位，

1306
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,052
而我认为这不值得冒险 

1307
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:04,141
那边看起来挺吓人的 

1308
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:06,752
我想，这主意倒也不算最糟 

1309
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:08,580
我喜欢我的工作 等等 等一下 

1310
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,891
刚才你表现得好像这工作不危险似的 

1311
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:16,762
既然不危险，那她为什么突然要辞职？

1312
01:17:16,936 --> 01:17:18,634
是啊 我不知道 抱歉 

1313
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:21,027
呃，我，我说过她必须辞职吗？

1314
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:22,638
实际上我觉得我没说过 

1315
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:24,382
我只是在附和琳赛的观点 

1316
01:17:24,465 --> 01:17:26,250
我只是说琳赛

1317
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,730
其实有个好主意 

1318
01:17:27,904 --> 01:17:29,819
如果她想辞职，

1319
01:17:29,993 --> 01:17:31,908
就能有更多时间陪女儿们 

1320
01:17:32,082 --> 01:17:33,402
是啊 现在，各位，

1321
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:36,042
我们别太较真了，因为，呃...

1322
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:39,437
我只是觉得有点好笑 

1323
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,788
我想象那家伙，他正要去上班，

1324
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:45,269
就一个平常的日子，然后他看见一个裸男

1325
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:47,445
在他的玩具店里跑来跑去 

1326
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:49,320
说实话，这让我想去那里找份工作 

1327
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:53,016
哦，神啊，保佑你 

1328
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:55,366
是啊，我只是觉得这真的很有趣，仅此而已 

1329
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,107
我可不觉得好笑，罗恩 

1330
01:17:57,281 --> 01:17:58,586
我...我觉得这很可悲 

1331
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:00,284
我是说，有人竟然落魄到

1332
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:03,113
不得不在玩具店的洗手池里洗澡，

1333
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:05,376
我们边吃边笑谈这事？

1334
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:09,641
我是说，也许我们算不上什么好撒玛利亚人 

1335
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,382
嗯 

1336
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:14,080
也许你做的决定并非最佳选择 

1337
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:15,865
打扰一下，女士？

1338
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:18,606
选择在我们俩独自在家时去那里工作，

1339
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:20,656
等着别人来接我们出门？

1340
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:22,567
就像，我们... 哇哦，哇哦 

1341
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,061
老实说，你已经到了可以自己开车的年纪了 

1342
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:26,444
我没有驾照 

1343
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:28,486
我说过我会教你的 好吗？

1344
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,054
我甚至不能和你一起坐在车里 

1345
01:18:31,228 --> 01:18:33,508
现在爸爸不在了，你就带这个怪人过来，

1346
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,972
难道我们就该这么接受吗？

1347
01:18:37,016 --> 01:18:38,757
我-我希望这值得你付出肉体 

1348
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,455
喂，喂，喂 

1349
01:18:42,456 --> 01:18:43,893
林...

1350
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:52,292
抱歉 

1351
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:57,388
我们的教堂 是的 

1352
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,086
哇 

1353
01:19:10,223 --> 01:19:11,921
喂？呃，你好 

1354
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,535
呃，我是奥利弗表弟 

1355
01:19:13,618 --> 01:19:14,778
我刚刚打电话找史蒂夫 

1356
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,142
现在是早上 7 点 

1357
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:17,883
呃，今天也是 12 月 1 日，

1358
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:19,885
我们几个月前有过一次谈话

1359
01:19:20,059 --> 01:19:21,669
约定我应该在 12 月 1 日回电 

1360
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:23,404
好的，你稍后再打来吧 他正在睡觉 

1361
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:25,673
好吧，那你能帮我叫醒他吗？

1362
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:27,201
嗯，就告诉他我是奥利弗表弟 

1363
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:28,284
好吗？有急事 

1364
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:29,982
宝贝 嗯 嗯 

1365
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:31,509
是你表弟 是奥利弗表弟 

1366
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:33,856
告诉他我睡着了 

1367
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,380
王八蛋 该死的 

1368
01:19:36,554 --> 01:19:37,794
他说...我们可以周日做 

1369
01:19:37,947 --> 01:19:39,426
...他睡着了，而且

1370
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,211
你应该下周日来看他 

1371
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,953
下周日 好的，太好了 他还在费耶特维尔吗？

1372
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,086
不 不 是双松汽车旅馆 

1373
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:48,435
双松旅馆 好的 

1374
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:49,959
204 号房 

1375
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:51,612
204 记住了 还有别

1376
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,266
别他妈犯傻，去坐公交 

1377
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,098
他说别他妈犯傻，去坐公交 

1378
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:56,792
他想知道你是否有车 

1379
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:59,490
好的 告诉警官，呃，我来处理这事

1380
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:02,188
我会按计划在周日见他 

1381
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,236
早...早上好 

1382
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:10,457
你没告诉我你要出差 

1383
01:20:12,155 --> 01:20:14,722
你本不该听到这些的 

1384
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:16,899
好的 

1385
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:18,422
听着，没什么大不了的 

1386
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:20,119
我只是得去报个到 

1387
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:21,904
就这样 好吧 

1388
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:25,342
亲亲 

1389
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:27,126
早上好，林赛 

1390
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,826
早上好，利 早上好，迪 

1391
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:34,090
大家都想说"早上好"吗？

1392
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:36,701
早上好，约翰 

1393
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:45,710
好吧，谁想先道歉呢，嗯？

1394
01:20:48,017 --> 01:20:49,279
没有？你呢？

1395
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:51,020
拜托，各位 

1396
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:53,370
大家都没什么可说的吗？

1397
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:55,372
听着，家人之间难免争吵 

1398
01:20:55,546 --> 01:20:57,940
这很正常，但他们也会和好 

1399
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:00,638
加油 

1400
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:04,772
林赛，我为我的行为方式感到抱歉 

1401
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,818
干得漂亮 

1402
01:21:12,171 --> 01:21:15,044
我不该在迪伊面前提那档子事 

1403
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:17,742
嗯 是啊 

1404
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,091
而且...

1405
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:21,441
然后呢？你搞定了 

1406
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:24,444
我需要搭车去道格家 

1407
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:25,881
不，那不是...

1408
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:27,708
你哪儿都别想搭车去 

1409
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,711
你知道昨晚你让我有多难堪吗？

1410
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,452
我让你难堪了？

1411
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,150
约翰，你能开车送我吗？

1412
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:38,023
你不能既虐待他又要他帮忙 

1413
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,724
没关系 我...我不介意开车送她 

1414
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:41,809
不，约翰，你别插手 看吧，他并不介意 

1415
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:44,943
如果她想去哪儿，可以学着自己开车 

1416
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:48,555
我绝不会再坐那辆手动挡的车让你开了 

1417
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:51,036
那我看你以后哪儿也别想去了！

1418
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,908
好的，暂停 永远暂停！

1419
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:55,258
抱歉，我能让我妈妈开车送我吗

1420
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:57,192
因为她是我妈妈？好了，别说了 

1421
01:21:57,347 --> 01:21:58,783
我有个主意，好吗？

1422
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:01,003
我有个主意 听我说完，这主意很棒 

1423
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:03,005
我们需要一辆破车 

1424
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:06,530
约翰，到底什么是破车？

1425
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:13,972
♪ 来吧，他们告诉我 ♪

1426
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,152
♪ 啪，咚，啪，咚，咚... ♪

1427
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:18,237
这辆车真不错，对吧？

1428
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:21,719
经典的 1999 年款，行驶里程极低 

1429
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:23,464
-是吗？ -颜色也很棒 

1430
01:22:23,547 --> 01:22:24,722
很棒的家庭用车 

1431
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,115
它是自动挡的 

1432
01:22:26,289 --> 01:22:28,552
自动挡 价格很实惠 

1433
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:30,858
你们想试试吗？好啊 

1434
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:34,210
钥匙就在这儿 看这个 

1435
01:22:34,384 --> 01:22:36,255
座椅很不错吧？

1436
01:22:36,429 --> 01:22:38,649
现在的车都没这种手感了 

1437
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:40,433
这简直像是黄金时代 

1438
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,914
90 年代 

1439
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:46,744
你知道，就是...现在的车再也造不出这种感觉了，懂吗？

1440
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:48,398
是啊 这些——这些车就像沙发一样舒服 

1441
01:22:48,572 --> 01:22:50,356
你们系好安全带了吗？系了，系了 

1442
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:52,358
这附近有警察吗？哦，没有没有 

1443
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:53,925
这里没人会拦你 

1444
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:55,235
就稍微推一下 

1445
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:59,409
好的 

1446
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:02,586
好的 

1447
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,805
哦，哦，哦，哦 

1448
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,633
这车马力不错 好的 

1449
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:08,592
好吧，好吧 

1450
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:09,989
配备了一台不错的 V6 发动机...

1451
01:23:10,072 --> 01:23:12,161

1452

妈的！有事？

1465
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:40,928
好的，没问题 

1466
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:42,539
你怎么回事，老兄？

1467
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,110
冷静点 不，不，快出去 

1468
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,589
冷静下来 不，不，不 快出去 快出去！

1469
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:47,392
我来开车带我们回去 琳赛，琳赛 快停下 

1470
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:48,853
冷静点 琳赛，到前面来 你来开车 你到后座去 

1471
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:50,290
不行，也许不该让她开车，约翰 

1472
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:52,070
不，不行，她还是个孩子！她不会开车！

1473
01:23:52,244 --> 01:23:53,510
这里车流很忙，路况复杂 不，她会开的 你听我说 

1474
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:54,598
不行，现在就把钥匙给我 不，不可以 

1475
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:56,292
停下，快停下 冷静点，好吗？

1476
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:57,775
怎么教小孩游泳？直接把他们扔进水里 

1477
01:23:57,858 --> 01:23:59,730
对吧？如果你想让她开车，

1478
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:01,866
就得让她亲自开 没错，加油，琳赛 

1479
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:03,346
她真的有驾照吗？

1480
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:04,913
她有驾照 不行 

1481
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,393
不行，有驾照也不能试驾 

1482
01:24:06,476 --> 01:24:08,047
听着，只要这位小姐同意

1483
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:10,828
我就买下这辆车，而且付现金 

1484
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:12,047
你觉得怎么样？

1485
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:13,657
让你来保管它 

1486
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:15,702
加油 

1487
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:16,921
是的 

1488
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:18,401
上来吧 你来开车 

1489
01:24:19,445 --> 01:24:20,707
好的 

1490
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:27,018
好的 

1491
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:29,890
系好安全带 安全第一 

1492
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,722
好的，这不是手动挡 

1493
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:33,550
这是自动挡，所以简单多了 

1494
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,943
你完全不用管左脚 

1495
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:36,375
只管右脚就行 

1496
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:38,033
把你的右脚放在那个刹车上，

1497
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:39,857
就是那个大踏板 

1498
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,555
对，用力踩到底 完全踩到底 要非常用力 

1499
01:24:42,729 --> 01:24:44,601
好，现在伸出你的右手，

1500
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:47,082
你要把它朝自己方向拉，然后向下拉到“D”档 

1501
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:48,518
完美 现在松开吧 

1502
01:24:48,692 --> 01:24:50,128
两点回来 

1503
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:52,217
好了 我们不用担心汽油了 

1504
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,049
你只要轻轻松开刹车

1505
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:56,134
我们继续前进，就这样 

1506
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:57,701
好吗？深呼吸 

1507
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,442
你能行的 

1508
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:01,879
你能行的 来吧 

1509
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:03,881
你能行的 快，快，快，快，快 

1510
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:06,013
对对对对 这很好 

1511
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:09,713
-不错 -挺好的 

1512
01:25:11,976 --> 01:25:13,586
好了，各位家人 

1513
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,546
我向来喜欢为满意的顾客拍照留念，

1514
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,982
如果你们不介意的话 

1515
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:19,636
好的 

1516
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:21,377
灿烂一笑 

1517
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:23,118
再来一次，再来一次 

1518
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,294
现在，假设你爸爸差点撞车了 

1519
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:28,384
好的 

1520
01:25:28,558 --> 01:25:30,172
嘿，太棒了，伙计们，干得漂亮 

1521
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:31,648
非常感谢 

1522
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:34,129
你开车技术比他好多了 

1523
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:37,262
这倒是实话 坐在你车上我感觉特别特别安心，开得真不错 

1524
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:40,613
噢，我很高兴听你这么说 

1525
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:42,398
谢谢你，约翰 恭喜你，兄弟 

1526
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:44,447
姑娘们，你们能先在车里等一下吗？我想和约翰谈谈

1527
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,923
就一分钟左右 给 

1528
01:25:46,097 --> 01:25:47,097
好的 

1529
01:25:47,229 --> 01:25:48,230
好的 

1530
01:25:48,404 --> 01:25:50,014
我们搞到一辆破车 

1531
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:52,364
是的，我们搞到一辆破车 没错 

1532
01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:56,890
我必须说出来 

1533
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:59,632
我不喜欢那样开车 好吧 

1534
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:02,853
对不起 我知道 

1535
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,289
我不该那么做的 

1536
01:26:04,463 --> 01:26:05,986
是啊 

1537
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,254
但林赛真的是个非常非常棒的新手司机 

1538
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:10,339
对吧？她开得太好了 

1539
01:26:10,513 --> 01:26:11,818
是啊 她表现得真棒 

1540
01:26:11,992 --> 01:26:14,081
而且...而且...我不知道...

1541
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:16,040
我觉得她开始喜欢我了 

1542
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:17,607
她们俩都喜欢你 

1543
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:20,044
她们真的很喜欢你，好吗？

1544
01:26:20,218 --> 01:26:22,525
我喜欢你 

1545
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:26,703
只是...只是需要稍微放慢一点节奏，好吗？

1546
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:28,183
好的 

1547
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:30,446
我们不需要那么多东西，约翰 

1548
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,578
我们只要你 

1549
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:34,450
做你自己就好 像平常那样就好 

1550
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:36,626
我保证 最正常不过了 好的 

1551
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,325
你去旅行，等你回来，

1552
01:26:40,499 --> 01:26:44,068
我们过几个正常的夜晚，好吗？

1553
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:46,113
不再飙车特技了，我保证 

1554
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:47,637
好的 

1555
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:54,426
哦，天哪 

1556
01:26:57,473 --> 01:26:58,909
我爱约翰 哦，我的天 

1557
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:01,433
这辆车 我爱这辆车 

1558
01:27:01,607 --> 01:27:03,566
这辆车太完美了 回头家里见 

1559
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,263
好的 

1560
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:20,278
嗨 嗨 

1561
01:27:20,452 --> 01:27:21,932
呃，奥利弗表弟 

1562
01:27:22,106 --> 01:27:24,500
来找史蒂夫的 哦 嗯，来得有点早啊 

1563
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,199
喂，史蒂夫？怎么了？

1564
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:30,070
奥利弗表弟来了 

1565
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,684
你好，蠢狗 

1566
01:27:34,858 --> 01:27:36,646
我就知道你会天一亮就出现

1567
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:37,991
如果我不给你定个时间的话 

1568
01:27:38,165 --> 01:27:40,429
欢迎回家，警官 

1569
01:27:40,603 --> 01:27:42,213
好吧，你... 天啊 

1570
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,128
是啊，够了 没错 

1571
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:46,308
见鬼，你看起来真干净，不像个在逃犯 

1572
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:47,566
我在努力 我在努力 

1573
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,264
你之前躲在哪里，教堂吗？

1574
01:27:49,438 --> 01:27:50,678
你知道我不能告诉你 

1575
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,484
说真的，你躲在哪里？

1576
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:54,577
不，我不能告诉你 你不想知道的 

1577
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,940
你没有联系人，对吧？

1578
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:57,794
你没跟任何人联系吧？没有，绝对没有 

1579
01:27:57,968 --> 01:27:59,539
那就好，因为你知道要是你有联系，我就帮不了你了 

1580
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:01,580
当然没有，我怎么会那么做？

1581
01:28:01,754 --> 01:28:03,147
你还好吗？我没事 我很好 

1582
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,401
那就看着我吧 

1583
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,019
你为什么总是东张西望？

1584
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:07,460
我没有东张西望 我正看着你呢 

1585
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:08,678
你确定你没事吗？你看 

1586
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:10,023
好的 

1587
01:28:12,939 --> 01:28:14,593
我们得换个发型

1588
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:16,029
才能拍照 

1589
01:28:16,203 --> 01:28:17,727
呃，宝贝，你觉得呢？假发？染发？

1590
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:19,381
为了他的头发 

1591
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,208
我想我们可以用假发 

1592
01:28:21,383 --> 01:28:23,689
是的 别担心，杰夫 你还是你 

1593
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:26,170
只是更帅了 像布拉德·皮特那样 

1594
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,086
丑爆了的布拉德·皮特 

1595
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:33,873
哦，我的天啊 

1596
01:28:34,047 --> 01:28:35,270
宝贝，你是认真的吗？

1597
01:28:35,353 --> 01:28:36,353
我...我...

1598
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:37,486
这招能让女人主动投怀送抱 

1599
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:40,358
天啊 宝贝，快过来 

1600
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,056
好的 

1601
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:44,536
哦 

1602
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:46,277
你他妈的一定是在跟我开玩笑，宝贝 

1603
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:47,670
打个招呼，宝贝 

1604
01:28:47,844 --> 01:28:49,193
哇 

1605
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:50,416
宝贝，那-那真是...真是个好主意 

1606
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:51,543
这很好，对吧？是的 

1607
01:28:51,717 --> 01:28:53,153
这个感觉好吗？嗯 

1608
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,938
嗯？感觉你可以

1609
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:56,635
当这个人一段时间？嗯 

1610
01:28:56,809 --> 01:28:58,245
准备好了吗？嗯 

1611
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,947
等等，等等，等等，别他妈笑了 

1612
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:01,161
你他妈在干嘛？

1613
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,856
就...正常表情 对，严肃点 

1614
01:29:02,946 --> 01:29:04,125
这就像是...你的护照照片，懂吧 

1615
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:06,036
不许笑 

1616
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,821
一、二、三 

1617
01:29:13,522 --> 01:29:15,567
读这破玩意儿 好好研究 

1618
01:29:15,741 --> 01:29:17,047
全部内容 

1619
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,179
明白吗？这就是全新的你 

1620
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,181
你是肯尼斯·欧文·格里芬 

1621
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:25,360
1974 年 7 月 7 日出生于北卡罗来纳州伦伯顿 

1622
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:27,318
现在我要拿走你所有的文件 

1623
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:28,972
别他妈担心 

1624
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:31,888
过户手续、记录文件...我会全部搞定，从头到尾 

1625
01:29:32,062 --> 01:29:34,847
好吧 你...你觉得要多少，五千块？

1626
01:29:35,021 --> 01:29:37,633
哦不，老兄，远不止这个数 

1627
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:40,331
不止？那...那要多少？

1628
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:46,990
你以为我不知道你在搞什么鬼吗？

1629
01:29:47,164 --> 01:29:48,764
你八成有女朋友了吧？

1630
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:49,906
什么？不行 

1631
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,603
没错，你肯定有 没错，你肯定有 

1632
01:29:51,777 --> 01:29:53,692
得了吧，你压根不擅长这套把戏 

1633
01:29:53,866 --> 01:29:56,086
擅长什么狗屁？当罪犯吗，黑鬼 

1634
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:57,348
让我告诉你一件事 

1635
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:59,219
优秀的罪犯都是冷酷无情的谋略家 

1636
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,438
明白了吗？

1637
01:30:00,612 --> 01:30:02,353
现在你谋略倒是学会了，

1638
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:05,269
但是，老兄，你真是...傻乎乎的 

1639
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:08,403
价格...要五万块 

1640
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:11,230
好吗？

1641
01:30:11,884 --> 01:30:13,364
五十？五十？没错 

1642
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:16,628
嘿，你冒的风险可不小 能搞定吗？

1643
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:21,546
好的 嗯 

1644
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,330
你打算怎么做？

1645
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:25,985
我来搞定 我来搞定 

1646
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,511
如果你打算用枪的话，帮我个忙 

1647
01:30:29,685 --> 01:30:32,122
别他妈上电视 

1648
01:30:32,296 --> 01:30:34,124
屋顶侠，你明白我的意思吗？

1649
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:38,302
别做蠢事 

1650
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:37,143
哎哟 

1651
01:31:39,668 --> 01:31:41,191
好的 

1652
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:45,848
妈的 

1653
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:49,504
搞什么...？

1654
01:32:07,217 --> 01:32:08,523
妈的！

1655
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:11,177
妈的！

1656
01:32:13,049 --> 01:32:14,659
妈的！

1657
01:32:15,747 --> 01:32:17,009
蠢货！

1658
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:08,251
我们全年 90%的销售额都来自接下来这两周 

1659
01:34:09,948 --> 01:34:11,384
好好想想 

1660
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,431
将会有大笔资金涌入，

1661
01:34:14,605 --> 01:34:16,433
我们必须为此做好准备 

1662
01:34:18,609 --> 01:34:19,889
考虑到我们最近的挫折，

1663
01:34:20,045 --> 01:34:21,830
我觉得我们干得挺不错的 

1664
01:34:22,004 --> 01:34:23,483
你应该感到骄傲 来吧 

1665
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,269
加油，伙计们 快跟上 快跟上 

1666
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:30,229
但真正的较量现在才开始 

1667
01:34:32,405 --> 01:34:35,234
我们正在加强安保，确保商店安全

1668
01:34:35,408 --> 01:34:37,149
让顾客在店内购物时感到安心 

1669
01:34:37,323 --> 01:34:38,803
完全按计划进行 

1670
01:34:38,977 --> 01:34:41,066
因为只要顾客能过个愉快的圣诞节，

1671
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,981
我们也是如此 

1672
01:34:43,155 --> 01:34:45,984
你真是太准时了，我的朋友 我很喜欢这一点 

1673
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:48,900
你的工作是销售玩具 

1674
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:50,732
这次会稍微重一些 

1675
01:34:50,815 --> 01:34:52,691

这对你的手臂肌肉有好处 

1677

今年圣诞季我们会提早开门

1678
01:34:55,646 --> 01:34:59,041
并且每天营业到很晚，

1679
01:34:59,215 --> 01:35:01,391
这包括平安夜 

1680
01:35:02,914 --> 01:35:04,960
我发布了新的排班表 

1681
01:35:05,134 --> 01:35:08,311
我知道你们当中有些人

1682
01:35:08,485 --> 01:35:10,182
会被安排到不想值的班次，

1683
01:35:10,356 --> 01:35:13,795
但没有任何例外或变动 

1684
01:35:13,969 --> 01:35:16,058
排班表上有你的名字你就得来 

1685

1863
01:44:25,171 --> 01:44:26,782
或是其他衣物？

1864
01:44:26,956 --> 01:44:30,176
嗯，我能看出他是个白人，是的 

1865
01:44:31,613 --> 01:44:33,397
你看到他的眼神了吗？

1866
01:44:38,097 --> 01:44:39,795
嗯哼 

1867
01:45:07,736 --> 01:45:10,304
这简直太棒了，杰夫 

1868
01:45:10,478 --> 01:45:12,001
你真是个疯子，知道吗？

1869
01:45:12,175 --> 01:45:13,528
这他妈太棒了 宝贝，你看到了吗？

1870
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:14,611
是啊 

1871
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:16,571
好的，让我看看 

1872
01:45:16,745 --> 01:45:19,704
这是你北卡罗来纳州签发的驾照，对吧？

1873
01:45:19,878 --> 01:45:23,055
那是你的护照 经过公证的出生证明 

1874
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:25,928
你拿到了上一份工作的工资单存根 

1875
01:45:26,102 --> 01:45:27,538
哦，还有你的机票 

1876
01:45:27,712 --> 01:45:29,714
你晚上 11 点从夏洛特出发 

1877
01:45:29,888 --> 01:45:32,238
接下来你要在迈阿密转机，

1878
01:45:32,413 --> 01:45:34,027
然后你要飞往巴兰基亚 

1879
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,851
从那里，你会坐一小段巴士

1880
01:45:36,025 --> 01:45:37,596
周末前就能抵达委内瑞拉 

1881
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,245
看来我需要的东西都齐了

1882
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:40,769
万一我决定明天去呢 

1883
01:45:40,943 --> 01:45:42,379
"决定"？

1884
01:45:43,511 --> 01:45:44,603
你早就做好决定了，老兄 

1885
01:45:44,686 --> 01:45:46,252
你在说什么呢？

1886
01:45:46,427 --> 01:45:48,951
我是说，你总不能指望我圣诞节去吧？

1887
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:51,301
我能不能多待会儿？我会低调行事的 

1888
01:45:51,475 --> 01:45:53,042
杰夫，这由不得你选择 

1889
01:45:53,216 --> 01:45:54,304
你明天必须离开 

1890
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:56,437
我这边还有人等着你呢，老兄 

1891
01:45:56,611 --> 01:45:58,047
我在迈阿密有个安保人员 

1892
01:45:58,221 --> 01:45:59,875
他会在三号线等你 

1893
01:46:00,049 --> 01:46:02,443
你只有一次机会，老兄 明晚 11 点整 

1894
01:46:02,617 --> 01:46:04,140
别错过这个镜头 好吗？

1895
01:46:04,314 --> 01:46:05,794
宝贝，咱们给他戴上这个假发吧 

1896
01:46:05,968 --> 01:46:07,709
没问题 

1897
01:46:09,145 --> 01:46:10,755
我还在想一件事 

1898
01:46:10,929 --> 01:46:13,671
电视上看到有持枪抢劫的破事 

1899
01:46:13,845 --> 01:46:15,804
我对此一无所知 

1900
01:46:16,805 --> 01:46:18,241
我需要你的大拇指 

1901
01:46:19,895 --> 01:46:21,723
你得掩盖好行踪，杰夫 

1902
01:46:21,897 --> 01:46:23,420
没错 你接触过的所有痕迹 

1903
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:26,684
我要你仔细回想和谁说过话，

1904
01:46:26,858 --> 01:46:29,252
谁和你说过话，谁熟悉你的声音 

1905
01:46:29,426 --> 01:46:31,907
我为你赴汤蹈火在所不辞 明白吗？

1906
01:46:32,081 --> 01:46:33,561
是啊 

1907
01:46:33,735 --> 01:46:35,084
所以 什么都没有？

1908
01:46:35,258 --> 01:46:36,781
没去看过医生？

1909
01:46:36,955 --> 01:46:39,567
呃 我去看了牙医 补了几颗蛀牙

1910
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:40,741
但就这样了 

1911
01:46:40,872 --> 01:46:42,744
好吧 你没拍 X 光片吗？

1912
01:46:42,918 --> 01:46:44,746
不，我拍了 X 光片，但我用了假名字 

1913
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,574
好吧 其实这也没什么关系

1914
01:46:46,748 --> 01:46:49,446
如果你用了假名，但他们有你的牙齿，杰夫 

1915
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,100
好吧 是的 

1916
01:46:51,274 --> 01:46:53,102
听着，我来处理 

1917
01:46:53,276 --> 01:46:56,497
你搞出来的烂摊子，你自己收拾干净 

1918
01:46:56,671 --> 01:46:58,412
然后你直接去机场

1919
01:46:58,586 --> 01:46:59,717
等待你的航班 

1920
01:46:59,891 --> 01:47:01,066
不要上新闻 

1921
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,329
不要向任何你打过招呼的人道别 

1922
01:47:03,504 --> 01:47:06,550
这意味着不能寄明信片，不能打电话 什么都不行 

1923
01:47:09,466 --> 01:47:11,686
该死，我们曾经相处得很愉快 

1924
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,688
你懂吧？

1925
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:16,212
你知道，等这一切平息下来之后，

1926
01:47:16,386 --> 01:47:17,909
我在那边安顿下来，

1927
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:19,437
你能告诉一些人我在哪吗

1928
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,610
他们或许能……有空来看看我？

1929
01:47:22,784 --> 01:47:23,784
不，不，不要 

1930
01:47:23,915 --> 01:47:25,526
不是那么回事，老兄

1931
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:27,571
没人会来看你的，杰夫

1932
01:47:30,052 --> 01:47:31,706
你重新开始了 

1933
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:36,319
现在你只能靠自己了 

1934
01:47:41,585 --> 01:47:42,847
是啊 

1935
01:48:25,281 --> 01:48:26,543
哎呀 

1936
01:49:31,608 --> 01:49:32,696
喂？

1937
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:33,958
约翰 

1938
01:49:34,132 --> 01:49:35,569
我正要给你打电话 

1939
01:49:35,743 --> 01:49:37,266
一切都还好吗？

1940
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,268
我一直在给你打电话 

1941
01:49:39,442 --> 01:49:40,443
你在哪里？

1942
01:49:40,617 --> 01:49:41,836
我正在开车 

1943
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:43,620
其实我刚把车停到路边 

1944
01:49:43,794 --> 01:49:47,058
你来参加圣诞晚宴吗？

1945
01:49:47,232 --> 01:49:50,192
女孩们一直在找你 

1946
01:49:50,366 --> 01:49:52,237
好的 好的，当然 

1947
01:49:53,848 --> 01:49:55,632
嗯，我不会错过的 

1948
01:49:56,938 --> 01:49:59,288
想五点见我们吗？

1949
01:49:59,462 --> 01:50:01,246
在家吗？

1950
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,292
五点吗？好啊，听起来不错 

1951
01:50:03,466 --> 01:50:05,076
嗯，我会到的 

1952
01:50:08,297 --> 01:50:09,515
你在吗？你还好吗？

1953
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,692
我能听见你，我能听见你的呼吸声 

1954
01:50:13,998 --> 01:50:15,609
我爱你，约翰 

1955
01:50:22,093 --> 01:50:23,791
我也爱你，莉 

1956
01:50:25,401 --> 01:50:27,446
五点见 

1957
01:52:14,466 --> 01:52:15,598
莉？

1958
01:52:24,259 --> 01:52:25,390
圣诞快乐...

1959
01:52:28,045 --> 01:52:29,398
警察！趴下！

1960
01:52:29,481 --> 01:52:30,656
趴到地上！蹲下！

1961
01:52:30,831 --> 01:52:32,397
趴下！趴下！

1962
01:52:32,571 --> 01:52:34,138
趴下！快趴下 快趴下 

1963
01:52:34,312 --> 01:52:35,312
不许动 

1964
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,400
不许动 不准动 

1965
01:52:36,532 --> 01:52:38,186
干得不错 别动 

1966
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,623
照我们说的做，你就不会受伤 明白吗？

1967
01:52:40,797 --> 01:52:41,972
我抓住他了 想都别想 

1968
01:52:42,146 --> 01:52:43,800
别动，蠢货 

1969
01:52:43,974 --> 01:52:45,802
别他妈动 戏演完了 

1970
01:52:46,847 --> 01:52:48,152
你叫什么名字？

1971
01:52:48,326 --> 01:52:49,806
你叫什么名字？

1972
01:52:49,893 --> 01:52:51,029
我想你知道我的名字 

1973
01:52:51,112 --> 01:52:52,192
你叫什么名字？

1974
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,810
杰弗里·曼彻斯特 

1975
01:52:53,984 --> 01:52:56,421
-个人身份识别 目标 -我们抓住他了 

1976
01:52:56,595 --> 01:52:57,858
我们抓到屋顶男了 

1977
01:53:00,034 --> 01:53:01,731
他差点就成功了 

1978
01:53:05,474 --> 01:53:07,084
我们走 

1979
01:53:09,173 --> 01:53:10,522
加油 

1980
01:53:10,696 --> 01:53:12,093
搜他身 这狡猾的混蛋 

1981
01:53:12,176 --> 01:53:14,004
这边 过来 

1982
01:53:14,178 --> 01:53:15,745
把他仔细搜一遍 

1983
01:53:54,131 --> 01:53:57,265
我大概是故意让自己被抓的 

1984
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:01,138
又或者我只是不能不告而别 

1985
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,750
他们给我判了最重的刑 

1986
01:54:04,925 --> 01:54:07,275
又判了我 384 个月 

1987
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:10,278
这意味着等我从这里出去时，

1988
01:54:10,452 --> 01:54:11,714
我已经是个老头子了 

1989
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:16,240
这让我有很多时间思考我的人生 

1990
01:54:16,414 --> 01:54:17,763
所有事情 

1991
01:54:18,939 --> 01:54:20,984
当我身处外面的世界时，

1992
01:54:21,158 --> 01:54:22,899
我从未考虑过那些

1993
01:54:23,073 --> 01:54:25,336
可能因我而陷入危险的事物或人们 

1994
01:54:26,337 --> 01:54:28,339
如今这却成了我唯一思考的事 

1995
01:54:30,646 --> 01:54:32,822
我们都喜欢回到过去想象

1996
01:54:32,996 --> 01:54:34,476
事情本可以如何不同

1997
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:36,652
如果我们做了不同的选择 

1998
01:54:36,826 --> 01:54:38,306
就像现在这样 
Like right now.

1999
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,833
我一直在想象
I was imagining what it would've been like

2000
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:41,831
如果我没有犯下那些罪行会是什么样子
if I never committed all those crimes

2001
01:54:42,005 --> 01:54:43,311
我失去了家人 
and lost my family.

2002
01:54:43,485 --> 01:54:44,878
或者如果我能继续活下去
Or if I got to keep on living

2003
01:54:45,052 --> 01:54:47,619
和莉以及她的女儿们永远在一起 
with Leigh and her girls forever.

2004
01:54:47,793 --> 01:54:50,013
当然，她们会对我指手画脚
Sure, they'd boss me around a little

2005
01:54:50,187 --> 01:54:52,320
还让我去教堂做礼拜 
and make me go to church.

2006
01:54:52,494 --> 01:54:55,497
但他们会因我的冷笑话而发笑，也会原谅我
But they'd laugh at my dumb jokes and forgive me

2007
01:54:55,671 --> 01:54:58,065
当我表现得过于冷漠和精于算计的时候 
when I was on the wrong part of cold and calculating.

2008
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,284
大概就是这样吧 
Or something.

2009
01:55:01,503 --> 01:55:05,028
我开始意识到，所有我爱的人
I started to realize that all those people I loved

2010
01:55:05,202 --> 01:55:08,205
并不需要我给予他们那么多物质
didn't need me to give them so many things.

2011
01:55:08,379 --> 01:55:10,033
他们需要的只是我这个人
They just needed me.

2012
01:55:10,207 --> 01:55:11,687
以及我的时间
My time.

2013
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:14,298
现在这就是我的全部了 
And now that's all I have.

2014
01:55:14,472 --> 01:55:16,170
时间 我得了四个 A 
Time. I got four A's.

2015
01:55:16,344 --> 01:55:17,911
你全得了 A？
You got all A's?

2016
01:55:18,085 --> 01:55:19,608
是啊 
Yeah.

2017
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:21,001
连数学也是？是的 
Even in math? Yeah.

2018
01:55:21,175 --> 01:55:23,090
贝琪，我真为你感到骄傲 
Becky, I'm so proud of you.

2019
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:26,745
事情本可能走向完全不同的结局，这是肯定的 
It all could've gone a different way, for sure.

2020
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,705
但事实并非如此，它最终变成了这样 
But it didn't. It went this way.

2021
01:55:29,879 --> 01:55:30,924
嘿，老兄 
Hey, buddy.

2022
01:55:31,098 --> 01:55:33,970
而这样的结果，我完全可以接受 
And that was okay with me.

2023
01:55:34,971 --> 01:55:37,408
因为在这里，我...
Cause in here, I...

2024
01:55:38,757 --> 01:55:40,759
我再也不会伤害任何人了 
I can't hurt anybody anymore.

2025
01:55:43,632 --> 01:55:45,199
是的 我...
Yeah. I'm...

2026
01:55:45,373 --> 01:55:48,028
我正身处我该在的地方 
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

2027
01:55:48,202 --> 01:55:50,508
你想过这事吗？
You ever think about it?

2028
01:55:50,682 --> 01:55:52,075
什么？
What?

2029
01:55:52,249 --> 01:55:54,904
你知道的，逃离这个地方 
You know, breaking out of this place.

2030
01:55:57,733 --> 01:55:59,213
没有 没有 嗯 
No. No. Mm.

2031
01:55:59,387 --> 01:56:01,041
我...
I'm...

2032
01:56:01,215 --> 01:56:02,912
这里现在就是我的家了 
This is my home now.

2033
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:08,309
兄弟，我得承认，
You know, I have to admit, brother, like,

2034
01:56:08,483 --> 01:56:10,746
那段爱情故事确实很精彩 
that love story part was really good.

2035
01:56:12,356 --> 01:56:15,533
我很好奇，你后来还见过莉吗？
I am curious. You ever see Leigh again?

2036
01:56:55,660 --> 01:56:57,793
嘿 你好 
Hey. Hi.

2037
01:57:01,579 --> 01:57:03,407
我该叫你杰弗里吗？
Should I call you Jeffrey?

2038
01:57:06,106 --> 01:57:09,848
大概又是你生命中另一个叫杰弗里的混蛋吧 没错 
Just another jerk Jeffrey in your life, I guess. Yeah.

2039
01:57:10,675 --> 01:57:12,547
林赛和迪怎么样了？
How's Lindsay and Dee?

2040
01:57:13,287 --> 01:57:14,505
他们没事 
They're okay.

2041
01:57:16,507 --> 01:57:17,726
是啊 
Yeah.

2042
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,121
迪伊留刘海了吗？
Did Dee keep her bangs?

2043
01:57:22,557 --> 01:57:23,862
她允许的 
She did.

2044
01:57:26,996 --> 01:57:28,128
是啊 
Yeah.

2045
01:57:34,221 --> 01:57:35,526
对不起 
I'm sorry.

2046
01:57:37,876 --> 01:57:40,096
很抱歉我伤害了你 
I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

2047
01:57:41,924 --> 01:57:44,144
对不起，我没能保护好你 
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

2048
01:57:46,885 --> 01:57:49,540
你没什么好抱歉的，莉 
You don't have anything to be sorry about, Leigh.

2049
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:52,891
你没有 
You don't.

2050
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:55,764
你没有伤害任何人 
You didn't hurt anybody.

2051
01:57:55,938 --> 01:57:58,245
你只是说出了真相 
You just told the truth.

2052
01:57:58,723 --> 01:58:00,073
是啊 
Yeah.

2053
01:58:02,466 --> 01:58:04,990
我当时真的很生你的气 
I was really angry at you.

2054
01:58:05,165 --> 01:58:08,472
我最生气的是你伤害了那些女孩 
I was most angry at how you hurt the girls.

2055
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:16,698
但我现在不这么想了 
But that's not the way I think about it now.

2056
01:58:18,047 --> 01:58:19,179
好吗？
Okay?

2057
01:58:20,615 --> 01:58:22,660
我觉得这更像是一场冒险 
I think about it as an adventure.

2058
01:58:27,187 --> 01:58:29,189
我们玩得很开心 
We had a lot of fun.

2059
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:33,193
我们心怀感激 
We're thankful.

2060
01:58:37,022 --> 01:58:38,937
这个嘛...
Well...

2061
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,157
也许改天我会来看你 
maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

2062
01:58:45,901 --> 01:58:47,685
要敲我的窗户吗？
Gonna tap on my window?

2063
01:58:52,516 --> 01:58:54,779
也许我就直接敲门了 
Maybe I'll just knock on the door.

2064
02:00:33,878 --> 02:00:36,925
屋顶大盗又回来抢劫了，
The Roofman has returned to rob again,

2065
02:00:37,099 --> 02:00:40,058
他连夜破门进入了这家麦当劳，
overnight cutting his way into this McDonald's

2066
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:42,060
就在威尔金森大街和主街的交叉口 
on the intersection of Wilkinson and Main.

2067
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:43,588
单看他所做的事，
Just to look at what he's done,

2068
02:00:43,671 --> 02:00:45,150
他显得非常聪明 
it appears he's very intelligent.

2069
02:00:45,325 --> 02:00:48,197
只是他还喜欢犯罪 
Um, it's just that he also likes to commit crime.

2070
02:00:48,371 --> 02:00:50,460
在屋顶上凿洞，
Holes cut into the roofs,

2071
02:00:50,634 --> 02:00:52,288
工人们被告知躲进冷藏室，
workers told to get into the coolers,

2072
02:00:52,462 --> 02:00:53,724
但没有人受伤 
but no one was hurt.

2073
02:00:53,898 --> 02:00:56,901
事实上，嫌疑人态度很好 
In fact, the suspect was nice.

2074
02:00:57,075 --> 02:00:58,468
是个非常有礼貌的人 
Very polite person.

2075
02:00:58,642 --> 02:01:00,383
他总是确保员工们，
He always makes sure that the employees,

2076
02:01:00,557 --> 02:01:02,994
在带他们走进冷藏库之前，
before he walked them into the refrigerator,

2077
02:01:03,168 --> 02:01:04,822
让他们穿上外套
that he has them put on their coats

2078
02:01:04,996 --> 02:01:06,737
这样他们就能保持温暖 
so that they'll stay warm.

2079
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:09,392
这是屋顶人早期的合成画像，
This was an earlier  composite drawing of Roofman,

2080
02:01:09,566 --> 02:01:11,351
他总是戴着面具 
always wearing a mask.

2081
02:01:11,525 --> 02:01:12,961
这里的店主拒绝就
The owner here refused to comment

2082
02:01:13,135 --> 02:01:15,006
抢劫案的所有细节发表评论
on all details of the robbery,

2083
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:17,922
将电话转接至麦当劳公司 
referring calls to the McDonald's corporation.

2084
02:01:18,096 --> 02:01:20,185
但他还抢劫了汉堡王和百视达...
But he's also robbed Burger King and Blockbuster...

2085
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:23,493
警方当场从他身上搜出 9000 美元现金，
Police caught him  with $9,000 in cash,

2086
02:01:23,667 --> 02:01:26,540
据称是从两家麦当劳餐厅盗窃所得 
allegedly stolen from two McDonald's restaurants,

2087
02:01:26,714 --> 02:01:29,369
第一起发生在加斯托尼亚，第二起在贝尔蒙特 
the first in Gastonia, the second in Belmont.

2088
02:01:29,543 --> 02:01:31,284
嫌疑人差点逃脱，
The suspect almost got away,

2089
02:01:31,458 --> 02:01:33,503
直到贝尔蒙特这家麦当劳的一名员工
until a worker at this Belmont McDonald's

2090
02:01:33,677 --> 02:01:35,940
看到他逃跑的方向并报警 
saw which way he ran and then called police.

2091
02:01:36,114 --> 02:01:41,903
我和杰弗里讨论了发生在贝尔蒙特麦当劳的那起抢劫案 
I interacted with Jeffrey on the robbery that happened in the McDonald's in Belmont.

2092
02:01:42,077 --> 02:01:43,600
他一直在说，
The whole time, he was saying,

2093
02:01:43,774 --> 02:01:45,994
"我很抱歉 你们是好人 
"I'm so sorry. You guys are the good people.

2094
02:01:46,168 --> 02:01:47,691
我是坏人 "
I'm the bad person."

2095
02:01:47,865 --> 02:01:49,214
他是个好人 
He was a nice fella.

2096
02:01:49,389 --> 02:01:50,912
他，呃，他真的很友善 
He, uh, he was real nice.

2097
02:01:51,086 --> 02:01:54,350
他并没有，呃... 他没有给人那种，呃...
He didn't, uh... he didn't come across as, uh...

2098
02:01:54,524 --> 02:01:56,787
你知道，就是那种上前来胡说八道的感觉 
you know, come up, talk junk, you know.

2099
02:01:56,961 --> 02:01:59,312
或者，"我为什么会在这里？" 完全没有那种想法 
Or, "Why am I here?" Nothing like that.

2100
02:01:59,486 --> 02:02:01,401
你知道，他... 他是个好人 
You know, he... he was a nice fella.

2101
02:02:01,575 --> 02:02:03,403
他是个撒谎精
He's an incredible liar,

2102
02:02:03,577 --> 02:02:06,057
几乎什么事都撒谎
um, pretty much about everything.

2103
02:02:06,231 --> 02:02:08,495
大家都觉得"他真是个英雄"
Everybody thinks, "Oh, he's such a hero

2104
02:02:08,669 --> 02:02:10,932
"因为他把玩具送给了孩子们"
"because he-he gave the toys to the children."

2105
02:02:11,106 --> 02:02:13,630
玩具被偷了 
Well, the toys are stolen.

2106
02:02:13,804 --> 02:02:16,590
至于是否有所察觉，
As far as, like, having an inkling

2107
02:02:16,764 --> 02:02:19,593
觉得可能有点不对劲，
to maybe there's something there,

2108
02:02:19,767 --> 02:02:21,377
不，我完全没有察觉到任何迹象 
no, I didn't have any kind of inkling.

2109
02:02:21,551 --> 02:02:24,554
他是个好人 他加入了我们的教会 
He was a nice fella. He got involved in our church.

2110
02:02:24,728 --> 02:02:26,469
但现在牧师知道了
But now that the pastor knows

2111
02:02:26,643 --> 02:02:28,471
约翰其实是杰弗里·曼彻斯特
John is really Jeffrey Manchester,

2112
02:02:28,645 --> 02:02:31,648
那个被指控抢劫玩具反斗城的越狱逃犯
the escaped convict accused of sticking up Toys "R" Us

2113
02:02:31,822 --> 02:02:33,955
他放火烧了牙医诊所，他感觉如何？
and torching a dentist's office, how does he feel?

2114
02:02:34,129 --> 02:02:36,392
我的信念是，嗯，
My belief is that, um,

2115
02:02:36,566 --> 02:02:39,047
作为一个教会，你必须支持某人 
as a church, you got to stand with somebody.

2116
02:02:39,221 --> 02:02:41,441
这并不意味着你同意他们的所作所为 
Doesn't mean that you agree with what they did.

2117
02:02:41,615 --> 02:02:43,530
屋顶侠，或天台劫匪，
The Roofman, or the Rooftop Robber,

2118
02:02:43,704 --> 02:02:46,184
我-我从未听说过那件事 
I-I never heard anything about that.

2119
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:49,013
那是...我对一切都浑然不觉
It was-- I was oblivious to anything

2120
02:02:49,187 --> 02:02:52,103
直到我与杰弗里的关系结束后，
until after my relationship with Jeffrey,

2121
02:02:52,277 --> 02:02:53,670
然后他就被抓了 
and then he was captured.

2122
02:02:53,844 --> 02:02:55,324
接着这事似乎就到处传开了 
Then it just seemed to be everywhere.

2123
02:02:55,498 --> 02:02:57,618
从没想过这种事会发生在我的办公室，
Never thought that would happen to my office,

2124
02:02:57,761 --> 02:03:00,068
他试图纵火烧毁办公室来掩盖他的记录 
him trying to burn it down to-to hide his record.

2125
02:03:00,242 --> 02:03:02,462
整个前部区域都消失了 
The whole front area was gone.

2126
02:03:02,636 --> 02:03:04,116
起初在我看来
In the beginning, it just seemed to me

2127
02:03:04,246 --> 02:03:05,726
他掌控着一切
he had everything together.

2128
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:11,296
这完美诠释了贪婪和金钱
And it's a perfect example of how greed and money

2129
02:03:11,471 --> 02:03:16,301
你生命中的不良影响可能会改变你的结局 
and bad influences in your life could change your outcome.

2130
02:03:16,476 --> 02:03:17,912
史密斯牧师说
Pastor Smith says

2131
02:03:18,086 --> 02:03:19,646
他已经去监狱探望过曼彻斯特了 
he's already visited Manchester in jail.

2132
02:03:19,783 --> 02:03:22,917
他简直不敢相信我会去看望他，
He could not believe that I came to see him,

2133
02:03:23,091 --> 02:03:27,182
我们不会只是对他非常生气
that, um, that we would not just be really mad at him

2134
02:03:27,356 --> 02:03:28,879
然后对他置之不理 
and turn our back on him.

2135
02:03:29,053 --> 02:03:30,232
虽然是教会里的一位成员
Although it was a church member

2136
02:03:30,315 --> 02:03:31,491
举报了曼彻斯特

2137
02:03:31,665 --> 02:03:33,057
警察逮捕了他
Police captured him

2138
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:34,842
当时他正离开利·温斯科特的公寓
leaving the apartment of Leigh Wainscott,

2139
02:03:35,016 --> 02:03:36,978
这位他在教堂单身活动中结识的新女友
the new girlfriend he met at a church singles event.

2140
02:03:37,061 --> 02:03:41,501
我和大女儿谈过这事
I talked to my oldest daughter, you know, about this,

2141
02:03:41,675 --> 02:03:44,025
嗯，最近，呃，我问她
um, recently, and, uh, I asked her

2142
02:03:44,199 --> 02:03:47,681
和我分享她记得的任何事情，
to share with me anything that she remembered,

2143
02:03:47,855 --> 02:03:51,119
嗯，她能分享的，然后她只是说，
um, that she could share, and she just said,

2144
02:03:51,293 --> 02:03:53,208
"哦，是的，我记得很清楚 "

"他啊，他可真是棒极了 "
"He was, he was awesome, you know.

2146
02:03:54,992 --> 02:03:56,080
"我们玩得特别开心 "
"We had so much fun."

2147
02:03:56,254 --> 02:03:58,866
然后，嗯...
And, um...

2148
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,999
他们对他没有任何负面评价 
They didn't have anything bad to say about him.

2149
02:04:02,173 --> 02:04:03,827
一点都没有 
Nothing at all.
