You were supposed

about a girl who came
into my nice, quiet life...

533

screwed it all up.

534
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,561
Everything she touched broke...

535
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,535
and every move she made
turned into a catastrophe.

536
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,834
OK. Sorry.

537
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:44,609
