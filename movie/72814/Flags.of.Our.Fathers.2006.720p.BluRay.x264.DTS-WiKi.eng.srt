2
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,934
Corpsman!

3
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,244
Corpsman!

4
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:21,314
Corpsman!

5
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,224
For God sakes! Corpsman!

6
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:33,404
Corpsman!

7
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,914
Corpsman!

8
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:54,584
Honey, what's wrong?

9
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:14,274
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.

10
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,914
Especially those who've never been in one.

11
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:21,484
We like things nice and simple,

12
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:25,884
good and evil, heroes and villains.

13
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,784
There's always plenty of both.

14
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:34,124
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.

15
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,444
Where is he?

16
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,644
Where is he?

17
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,324
Where... Where is he? Where is he?

18
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,484
Mr. Bradley?

19
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,234
Mr. B? You okay?

20
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,794
Where is he? Where is who?

21
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:17,534
Where is he? Where did he go? Where... Where is he?

22
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,844
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

23
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:22,774
I'm gonna call an ambulance. It'll be okay.

24
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,144
Where is he?

25
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,844
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.

26
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,294
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.

27
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,694
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.

28
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:47,334
They died without glory.

29
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,104
Nobody has taken their pictures.

30
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:53,234
Only their buddies knew what they did.

31
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,244
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.

32
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,484
I'm not sure that was it.

33
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,984
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day,

34
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,684
but none anybody wanted to see.

35
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,054
What we see and do in war,

36
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,714
the cruelty, is unbelievable.

37
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:16,034
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.

38
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,694
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth

39
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,934
and damn few words.

40
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,804
Film's ruined.

41
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:29,244
I don't know. This one looks all right.

42
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,054
And if you can get a picture...

43
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:44,424
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.

44
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,964
You're gonna want to see this.

45
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,434
Look at Vietnam.

46
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,864
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer

47
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:56,134
blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!

48
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,664
That was it.

49
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:00,944
The war was lost.

50
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,114
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.

51
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:11,384
Took a lot of other pictures that day. None of them made a difference.

52
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:15,954
Thanks. Appreciate it.

53
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,464
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.

54
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,074
Country was bankrupt.

55
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:35,844
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.

56
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,224
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!

57
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,354
Where?

58
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:57,394
Right there. Planting that flag, that's your brother.

59
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,764
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

60
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,744
And that's his. I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.

61
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,634
That's him. Go get your father.

62
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,944
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.

63
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,674
You watch your mouth, young man.

64
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,024
Thank you.

65
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:35,104
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.

66
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:38,704
It's on the front page of every major paper.

67
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,944
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.

68
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,814
I think we might have found it.

69
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:38,764
Corpsman!

70
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:41,234
Corpsman!

71
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,974
Corpsman!

72
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,074
I gotta go get him. Oh, no, you don't.

73
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,514
Iggy, I gotta go.

74
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,704
I have a whole different theory.

75
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:54,654
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.

76
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,984
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!

77
00:07:58,524 --> 00:07:59,994
As soon as that flare goes out.

78
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,614
Crap. Okay, well, I'll go with you. No.

79
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:03,994
You're actually gonna leave me here?

80
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:07,424
I'll be right back, just shoot some people. I gotta go.

81
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:21,844
Oh, God.

82
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,074
Okay, it's okay.

83
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,414
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.

84
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,474
Get your hands out of there. Let me do that. I'll do it, okay?

85
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,044
Don't look. Keep your head back. Keep your eyes on me.

86
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:33,924
All right, look at me. I'll get it. I'll take care of it.

87
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,124
We'll get this bandage on you. We'll get you taken care of.

88
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:39,354
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?

89
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,554
Look, you're gonna be fine.

90
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,064
It's okay.

91
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,664
I'll do that. I'll do that.

92
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:48,964
Here, put some pressure on that.

93
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:51,034
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.

94
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,074
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

95
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,574
Keep looking at me, all right? Just keep looking at...

96
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,374
Doc.

97
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,084
Help me.

98
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,824
Help me.

99
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,774
All right. Okay.

100
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,884
How's that feel?

101
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:40,624
It feels good. It does? All right.

102
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,424
Good. All right.

103
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:46,054
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach. I'll be right back.

104
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,564
I'm all right.

105
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,724
Go and help someone who's hurt.

106
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,664
All right. Hold on there.

107
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,714
Where'd he go? Who?

108
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,084
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski. Where did he go?

109
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,814
I think you jumped in the wrong hole. I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

110
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,654
He was right here, now where the hell is he?

111
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,624
Iggy!

112
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,754
Iggy!

113
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,134
You shut up. You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?

114
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,634
Iggy!

115
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:42,754


116
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,554
Holy shit.

117
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,454
They expect us to climb this?

118
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:56,354
Or something just like it.

119
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,204
So, where you think they're sending us?

120
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:08,904
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

121
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,644
Well, that makes no sense at all.

122
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,704
Well, it's just military psychology.

123
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:16,614
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.

124
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,724
Now you're just having fun with me.

125
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,894
Harlon, take your men right.

126
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,554
Watch for Bedouins. Yes, sir.

127
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,624
What's a Bedouin? It's a guy with a camel.

128
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,834
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.

129
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:39,004
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?

130
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:43,374
Bullets don't come from the left. You know any left-handed Japs?

131
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,144
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.

132
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,384
You don't even know why you do it, do you?

133
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,684
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?

134
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,814
You do it 'cause Mike does it.

135
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,814
I'll ask him.

136
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,354
So you cut hair back home?

137
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,524
Some.

138
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,364
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

139
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,764
No, I just studied it a little.

140
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,474
But not in barber school?

141
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,064
Nope.

142
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,604
Gosh. Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

143
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,044
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death,

144
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,044


145
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:19,674
so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.

146
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,514
Different tribe. The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.

147
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,514


148
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,074
See, now that's smart. That is smart.

149
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,284
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

150
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,984
Good luck, fellas.

151
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,964
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

152
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,934
Dead bodies. He cuts hair on dead bodies.

153
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,824
What? Even I knew that.

154
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,174
Who's in? Oh, I'm in. I'm in.

155
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:48,404
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.

156
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,074
There's that. Yeah.

157
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,544
You know what I been thinking?

158
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:55,554
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up

159
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,184
and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.

160
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,814
And how do you figure that?

161
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:02,884
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.

162
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,094
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?

163
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,694
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

164
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:14,304
You tell a lot of people that?

165
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,134
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?

166
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,304
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.

167
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,674
£Ê Jacks.

168
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:28,544
£Ñ Queens.

169
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:29,884
Shit.

170
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,084
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?

171
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:37,564
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!

172
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,724
We practice going over the side tomorrow

173
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,284
which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.

174
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,834
All right!

175
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:47,304
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order

176
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:49,704
better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.

177
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,864
I got mine already. Oh, yeah. I'm square.

178
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,464
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

179
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:57,204
That's horseshit, Franklin. I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.

180
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,474
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.

181
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:02,524
Heard they were running short.

182
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:06,584
You know, nobody tells me nothing. That's real nice, guys.

183
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,784
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.

184
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,694
Maybe he got some more left.

185
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,264
Leave your smokes. I'll play for you. Thanks, Mike.

186
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:17,594
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?

187
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,634
Just do not leave without signing them.

188
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:22,134
I appreciate it, Sergeant. You got it.

189
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,904
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?

190
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,544
Look like a goddamn corpse.

191
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,554
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.

192
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,724
Next four. Over the side.

193
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,524
Let's go. Keep moving.

194
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:50,254
Next four, over the side.

195
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,234
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.

196
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,634
That's all you gotta look at.

197
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,764
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

198
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:59,474
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.

199
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,974
You see? No big thing.

200
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:07,814
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.

201
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:10,324
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.

202
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:13,384
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.

203
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,584
I got him!

204
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:16,354
All right, get that man out of the water.

205
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,894
Give me a hand.

206
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,124
Grab his pack.

207
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,294
Don't worry about him, Doc.

208
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,524
All right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving!

209
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:24,934
He'll be fine.

210
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,764
Our target, Island X,

211
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:33,174
is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.

212
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,174
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.

213
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,484
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.

214
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,154
After 20 straight days of bombing

215
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,584
you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.

216
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,184
It wasn't that pretty to start with.

217
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,424
Captain?

218
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:54,094
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.

219
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:57,294
There's a lump down at the bottom. That's Mount Suribachi.

220
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,464
On the maps in front of you the island is white.

221
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,094
Not much of it.

222
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,674
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.

223
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,104
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns,

224
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,664
covered artillery emplacements.

225
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,944
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns

226
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:14,884
machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.

227
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,784
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.

228
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,324
That's right.

229
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,254
And we still don't know why.

230
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,124
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

231
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:28,524
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.

232
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,764
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

233
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,034
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.

234
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,594
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

235
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,764
It's up to us to convince them.

236
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:43,114
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

237
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:46,204
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.

238
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,254
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.

239
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,014
They can hit any point on the island.

240
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,454
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.

241
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:54,084
That's our job.

242
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:58,154
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.

243
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,784
And we take that mountain.

244
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,524
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.

245
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,324
We take their eyes.

246
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,574
Okay, I'm heading in. Follow me.

247
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,274
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.

248
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,514
Close it up. Take it right down to the deck.

249
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,174
Yeah, boys!

250
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,474
Man overboard portside!

251
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:57,684
See him?

252
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,624
Throw me a line!

253
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,324
He's right there.

254
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,654
Where is he? Watch out, watch out, watch out.

255
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,724
Hawaii's that way!

256
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:15,724
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!

257
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,864
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

258
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,634
They're not gonna stop.

259
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:22,804
What?

260
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:26,284
None of them are. They can't.

261
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,594
So much for "No man left behind."

262
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,594
Sir. Come on in.

263
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:46,994
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.

264
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,974
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.

265
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,304
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. You bet.

266
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:58,214
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.

267
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,444
That your James Cagney impersonation?

268
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,384
'Cause I've heard better.

269
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:05,084
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

270
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:07,924
Look, this isn't your first time through this.

271
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,924
You don't need to prove anything. No, sir.

272
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,164
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had,

273
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,224
you're just the best one that's still walking.

274
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:18,094
Block's a good man. Yes, sir, he is.

275
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:20,334
The men know him, he can step right in.

276
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,434
You know, I have actually thought this through.

277
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,504
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.

278
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,044
I already gave them my word, sir.

279
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:33,014
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers

280
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,014
which means I already lied to half of them. Can't lie to the rest.

281
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,244
How are your men? They'll do fine.

282
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,224
Except maybe Gagnon.

283
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,394
Our own Tyrone Power?

284
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:53,204
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.

285
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,034
I'll use him as a runner.

286
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,774
All right. Thank you, sir.

287
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:01,504
Now get out of here.

288
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:11,254
Hear the good news, Doc? We're going in with the first waves.

289
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:14,384
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!

290
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,154
Fucking dominoes.

291
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:20,724
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?

292
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,424
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

293
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,594
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.

294
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,434
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.

295
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,734
Oh, shit, that is good news.

296
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:32,704
You see? What'd I tell you?

297
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,844
What's going on?

298
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,174
Look at that.

299
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:11,144
We're killing them!

300
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,044
We're killing them, Doc.

301
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:42,374
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

302
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:45,614
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?

303
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:48,884
I don't give a shit! My men hit that beach with less than 10

304
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,714
and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!

305
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,014
Yeah, I know exactly why.

306
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,894
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest

307
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,954
wants to offload us here and sail to Japan

308
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,334
so they can be there for the big finish,

309
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:08,504
tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.

310
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:12,604
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!

311
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,174
These little pricks are dug in!

312
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:22,914
Okay, appreciate that, Jim. Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

313
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,154
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

314
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:32,994
I'm okay.

315
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:35,664
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

316
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,604
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?

317
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,564
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet? Kick in the ass?

318
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:46,004
How about you, Doc? Sharpen your knife?

319
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,804
You sharpened it three times already.

320
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,674
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.

321
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,614
Good man, Doc.

322
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:00,684
Hey, Doc. Yeah.

323
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:06,214
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.

324
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,394
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.

325
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,494
And they know that if they take out a corpsman

326
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,034
another dozen Marines will die unattended. All right?

327
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:14,434
Okay, Mike.

328
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:22,634
Yeah, right there.

329
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,904
Close the damn door. For God's sake.

330
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,104
Yeah, like that's gonna help.

331
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:06,254
That your girlfriend, Chief?

332
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:10,854
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.

333
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:14,454
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.

334
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:26,874
Welcome, all Marines off lwo Jima.

335
00:24:27,544 --> 00:24:29,474
We have a long-time wait...

336
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:31,844
It's what they do to prisoners,

337
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,024
at least the lucky ones. Jesus.

338
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:43,894
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.

339
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:48,484
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.

340
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:53,294
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.

341
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:56,364
But a girl cannot stay home every night.

342
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,604
So who do you think they're with tonight?

343
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:05,344
And will she let him kiss her? And will he comfort her at your funeral?

344
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:10,184
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home

345
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,344
who are missing you.

346
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:15,324
This is all for now. I'll see you tomorrow night.

347
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,184
Gunners!

348
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:43,034
Move, let's go! Let's go, get up on the berm!

349
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:51,704
Gunners!

350
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,524
We're clear!

351
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:09,194
Get up the berm!

352
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:13,694
Baker Company, move out!

353
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:15,394
Seen Second Platoon? I don't see them.

354
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,994
First Squad, move it out!

355
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,734
God, this place reeks.

356
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:34,754
Go, go, go! Move out!

357
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:39,784
Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Go, go! Drop your packs! Go!

358
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:42,294
All clear!

359
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:48,434
Jesus, you needed some exercise? He got lost.

360
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:51,274
A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.

361
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,364
Now I'm glad we did. Jesus, what a mess.

362
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:56,514
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

363
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,744
It's getting on my nerves.

364
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,874
Maybe they're all dead.

365
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:05,374
What do you think, Doc? You think they're all dead?

366
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:31,844
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.

367
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:35,244
Second Platoon, let's move out! Stay down. Come on.

368
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,514
Move! Move!

369
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,094
Get down! Take cover!

370
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:19,724
Move out!

371
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,574
Cover fire! Pour it on!

372
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:51,554
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!

373
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,164
Corpsman!

374
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:07,474
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!

375
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,774
Move, move! Off the beach!

376
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:12,504
Take cover!

377
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,424
You got a girl back home, Marine?

378
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:34,164
We're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?

379
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:36,724
I need pressure on this wound!

380
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,944
Where's the fire coming from?

381
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:58,454
Where are they?

382
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,524
Look for a flash, shoot at it!

383
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,034
Let's go, let...

384
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:24,154
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!

385
00:32:25,354 --> 00:32:26,654
You're over!

386
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:39,294
Third Squad, forward! Move!

387
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,644
Where are they, sir?

388
00:32:52,714 --> 00:32:55,844
We got ten o'clock! Ten o'clock, pillbox! Sergeant!

389
00:32:57,424 --> 00:33:00,044
Sergeant! I think I can clear that out. What?

390
00:33:00,124 --> 00:33:01,754
All right, you go. Here.

391
00:33:01,824 --> 00:33:04,554
Take these. Check your weapon.

392
00:33:04,624 --> 00:33:06,524
Yeah? Go! Cover!

393
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:07,994
Cover him!

394
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,504
Cover, cover!

395
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:22,564
Son-of-a-bitch.

396
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:29,274
Let's go! Go!

397
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:30,714
Move it out!

398
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,584
Go, go, go!

399
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:40,254
Down, down, down!

400
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:00,344
It's clear.

401
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,814
Good work.

402
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,854
I thought you said it was clear!

403
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,294
It was!

404
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:22,334
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.

405
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:25,144
Lindberg!

406
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:26,334
Yeah!

407
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:27,904
Light it up!

408
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,314
I'll cover you, Ice!

409
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:36,284
Don't cover shit! There's already enough people shooting!

410
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:39,444
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!

411
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,584
Go! Shift fire!

412
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:42,924
Shift your fire!

413
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:45,354
Go, go! Shift your fire!

414
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:47,894
Shift your fire!

415
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:55,304
Go! Move it out!

416
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:25,194
Hit the deck! Stay down! Wait for support!

417
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,734
Is this a bad battle or what?

418
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:30,864
It's a fucking slaughter.

419
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:43,514
Christ Jesus!

420
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,324
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!

421
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:00,134
Thank God! Tanks!

422
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:03,134
Runner! Get those tanks up here!

423
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,234
Oh, shit.

424
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:08,144
Get down!

425
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,014
Corporal, watch your left flank!

426
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:14,344
Let's go without them! Move out! Move out!

427
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,874
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.

428
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,384
Got it, Doc!

429
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:49,884
Incoming!

430
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,784
Move, move, move, move!

431
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,214
Keep moving!

432
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,954
Get that LVT up on the beach!

433
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:32,654
Keep moving!

434
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:40,924
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.

435
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,774
Move it!

436
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,024
Great news.

437
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:08,364
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.

438
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,264
Not you and me.

439
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,864
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture,

440
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:15,704
and Christ if I could remember,

441
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,864
but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen

442
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:21,674
but I just remembered, you were there, too.

443
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,244
I wasn't there.

444
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:29,844
'Course you were.

445
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,384
Neither was Hank. He raised the first flag.

446
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:34,254
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.

447
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:37,154
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

448
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:40,694
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?

449
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:43,464
You tell them it was me? No. Like I said, I just remembered.

450
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,524
Good, keep your mouth shut.

451
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:48,264
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.

452
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,434
Then pick someone dead.

453
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,304
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin,

454
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,774
they want to ship us back to the States.

455
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,004
What did I tell you?

456
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,004
I wasn't there.

457
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,574
You hear? All right.

458
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,014
Just settle down.

459
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:08,384
I'm not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere.

460
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,954


461
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,154
Who the hell says?

462
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,064
This is horseshit.

463
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,294
You wounded, son?

464
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:58,864
No, sir.

465
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:02,604
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?

466
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:05,734
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero

467
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,684
he better have a good goddamn story to tell.

468
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,114
No, sir.

469
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:12,814
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.

470
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:41,144
The sixth man, you got a name?

471
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:43,274
Sorry, still don't remember.

472
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,984
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.

473
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:49,184
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you

474
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:51,524
being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

475
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:54,424
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land

476
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,364
they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa

477
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,124
in time to meet your buddies on the beach.

478
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:02,834
So, why don't you stop screwing with me? Give me a damn name.

479
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:23,544
Gangway! Gangway! Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

480
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:27,224
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch? Hayes! Hayes?

481
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,494
Hayes, get your red ass over here!

482
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,434
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing

483
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,664
with a flag the size of my mother's house?

484
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,674
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.

485
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,034
You made me look like a complete asshole.

486
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,904
We're gonna miss you around here. Good luck.

487
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:49,984
Now your name's in the paper, too.

488
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:57,484
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.

489
00:41:57,564 --> 00:41:59,654
You're being shipped back to the mainland.

490
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:03,664
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.

491
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:07,464
That's all they wanted to know. Victory.

492
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:12,734
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.

493
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:16,644
Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen! Did you know Hank was a hero?

494
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,844
Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen? What was he like as a boy?

495
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,004
Look this way, please, ma'am.

496
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,314
What do you have to say about your son?

497
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:26,914
But somehow being a part of it meant something.

498
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:32,424
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.

499
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,864
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.

500
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,094
It is.

501
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:46,044
Belle, their names are right here. It's not him.

502
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:51,744
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.

503
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:56,074
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.

504
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:06,074
And I need to rush home and change

505
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,004
because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.

506
00:44:10,074 --> 00:44:13,304
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.

507
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,214
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...

508
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:17,514
Are you going to change? We interrupt this program to bring you

509
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:19,104
a special news bulletin from CBS World News.

510
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:23,214
A press association has just announced that President Roosevelt is dead.

511
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,854
The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

512
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:30,294
All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.

513
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:33,894
Further updates every hour.

514
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:36,264
Temperatures will remain the same today,

515
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:39,204
in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.

516
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:40,574
Hello?

517
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,404
Yes. Of course.

518
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:47,304
No, we understand. It wouldn't be right.

519
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:50,684
Thank you.

520
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:57,684
Here he is, gentlemen. Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.

521
00:44:57,754 --> 00:45:01,454
Senator Haddigan. I'd like you to meet Private First Class Ira Hayes.

522
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:03,464
Damn good to meet you.

523
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,894
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.

524
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:11,864
Sorry?

525
00:45:13,774 --> 00:45:16,504
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?

526
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:19,204
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.

527
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:22,804
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.

528
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:30,054
Doc. Ira.

529
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:33,094
And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!

530
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:36,424
That's you. Go, go, go, go. Go.

531
00:45:36,494 --> 00:45:38,194
Please welcome

532
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:42,524
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,

533
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,224
Private First Class Ira Hayes,

534
00:45:48,604 --> 00:45:52,564
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!

535
00:46:22,174 --> 00:46:25,004
Holy shit.

536
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:28,584
Come in, come in, come in. Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

537
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:30,274
Rene Gagnon. Bud Gurber.

538
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:33,014
You showing the boys the sights? We saw a hell of a ball game.

539
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:35,384
That's great. The bar's there, help yourself.

540
00:46:35,454 --> 00:46:37,424
I got some briefing sheets for you here,

541
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,324
just some simple things we want you to say.

542
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:42,884
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.

543
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,124
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.

544
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:47,684
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

545
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:51,134
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them,

546
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:54,434
notes written in lipstick. We won't mention that to the press, am I right?

547
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:56,974
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.

548
00:46:57,044 --> 00:46:59,414
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.

549
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:01,174
I've been watching the newsreels.

550
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:03,874
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

551
00:47:04,884 --> 00:47:08,844
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.

552
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:10,984
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over

553
00:47:11,054 --> 00:47:12,614
to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen

554
00:47:12,694 --> 00:47:14,214
who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.

555
00:47:14,294 --> 00:47:15,554
Politicians and actors.

556
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,724
You put them in a restaurant together,

557
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:18,694
they'd die of old age before picking up the check.

558
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:21,704
Then New York City, Times Square,

559
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:24,764
dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...

560
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,734
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

561
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:30,034
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.

562
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,974
You present each mother with a flag,

563
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:34,574
they say a few words, people will shit money.

564
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,174
It'll be so moving.

565
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,944
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.

566
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:41,484
Lovely woman. She knows how close you and her son were.

567
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:42,954
He wrote home about you.

568
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:45,584
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.

569
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,754
Hank wasn't in the picture.

570
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,024
Sorry?

571
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:53,024
Hank didn't raise that flag.

572
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:55,694
He raised the other one, the real flag.

573
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:59,294
The what? The real... The real flag? There's a real flag?

574
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:00,934
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.

575
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,374
We put it up when they took the other one down.

576
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:06,204
Am I the only one getting a headache here? You know about this?

577
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,304
It was after it was already in the papers.

578
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,814
The mothers had already been told, but...

579
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:13,014
That's it, that's beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful.

580
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:14,244
Yeah, why tell me?

581
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,984
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.

582
00:48:17,054 --> 00:48:18,784
Who is in the goddamn picture?

583
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,824
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?

584
00:48:20,894 --> 00:48:22,794
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

585
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:25,954
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima. Victory is ours.

586
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,434
You're three of them, right?

587
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,594
This was the fifth day, sir. The battle went on for 35 more.

588
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,904
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?

589
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:35,564
Can I hit this guy?

590
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:38,074
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture,

591
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:40,704
you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.

592
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:44,474
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture. Harlon is in the picture.

593
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,244
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

594
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:50,554
Harlon Block. That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.

595
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:54,894
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.

596
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,844
You know what they're calling this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

597
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:17,944
They might've called it the

598
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:19,784
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets

599
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:21,484
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive,

600
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:24,384
but it didn't have quite the ring. They could've called it that, though,

601
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:26,444
because the last four bond drives came up so short

602
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:28,614
we just printed money instead.

603
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:30,854
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you

604
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,094
our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.

605
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:37,004
And nobody is lending any more. Ships aren't being built.

606
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,874
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

607
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,034
You think this is a farce? You want to go back to your buddies?

608
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,574
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane

609
00:49:46,644 --> 00:49:48,944
because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.

610
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:51,444
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway

611
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:53,244
because the fuel dumps are empty.

612
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,054
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.

613
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:58,454
If we don't raise $14 billion,

614
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:02,224
and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.

615
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,784
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want

616
00:50:04,864 --> 00:50:06,764
and we come home, because you've seen them fight,

617
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,194
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

618
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:10,964
$14 billion.

619
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:14,234
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.

620
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:18,044
People on the street corners,

621
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:21,344
they looked at this picture and they took hope.

622
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:23,504
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.

623
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,054
You can't even see your faces.

624
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:29,954
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war,

625
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:32,324
we just need you to dig a little deeper.

626
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:34,054
They want to give us that money.

627
00:50:34,124 --> 00:50:36,114
No, they want to give it to you.

628
00:50:36,194 --> 00:50:38,994
But you, you don't want to ask for it. You don't want to give them hope.

629
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:42,394
You want to explain about this person and that flag.

630
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:45,124
Well, that's your choice.

631
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:49,704
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about

632
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:51,674
and that will be that.

633
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:02,544
Gentlemen.

634
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,294
Mr. President, here they are.

635
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,354
Well, hello. Good to see you. Mr. President.

636
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:10,914
Darn good to see you, boys.

637
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:13,934
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

638
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,124
Yes, sir.

639
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:18,724
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?

640
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,604
Yes, Mr. President.

641
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:24,234
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.

642
00:51:24,774 --> 00:51:27,114
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.

643
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,574
Very proud, sir.

644
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:30,204
They should be.

645
00:51:30,284 --> 00:51:33,984
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.

646
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:35,884
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific

647
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,924
now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.

648
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,654
And I don't expect you'll let us down. No, sir.

649
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,594
Good. Go get it.

650
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:45,884
That's the end of this ceremony.

651
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:50,404
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.

652
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,874
My gosh. There you are.

653
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:06,344
Boys. Boys, this one's on me. To those who can't be with us.

654
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:08,314
Yes, sir.

655
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:14,794
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon. May we have your autograph?

656
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,694
I suppose.

657
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,694
And your name is?

658
00:52:21,234 --> 00:52:22,894
I don't know about you, but I get the impression

659
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:24,734
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.

660
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:28,794
You're such a hero. I feel honored to be in your presence.

661
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:30,864
That's just not true.

662
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:37,014
That's professional work. Here, to professionals.

663
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:50,224
Here they are. You're the guys in the photograph, right?

664
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:51,884
I heard you were on the train.

665
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,864
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.

666
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,664
John Bradley.

667
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:58,534
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.

668
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:00,334
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.

669
00:53:00,404 --> 00:53:02,844
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.

670
00:53:02,904 --> 00:53:04,604
Excuse me for one moment.

671
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:06,734
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.

672
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,744
That's right. Drinks for these men all the way around.

673
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:12,414
And you're the other one, aren't you? John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

674
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:14,544
Rene Gagnon. Pleased to meet you.

675
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,314
Have a drink, come on. And here's my card.

676
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,254
Listen to me, Rene,

677
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,054
when you get finished being famous you come see me

678
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,964
because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.

679
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:28,294
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

680
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,164
You heard of prefab homes? No, sir.

681
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:34,224
Well, you will. And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?

682
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:36,104
All right? Certainly will.

683
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:45,314
All right.

684
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:55,724
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

685
00:53:57,264 --> 00:54:00,134
If Mike and the guys could see us.

686
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,894
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?

687
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:07,774
Harlon!

688
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:12,374
Franklin!

689
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,444
Can you imagine Franklin

690
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,554
on this train

691
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:27,714
eating at the dining car with all the silver?

692
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:34,254
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

693
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:13,534
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day

694
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:17,444
When the boys have all come home to stay

695
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,414
And a million bands begin to play

696
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,004
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

697
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:29,024
And when we've lit the torch of liberty

698
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:31,574
In each blacked-out land across the sea

699
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:35,054
Ira! Hey, Ira! We heard the picture was posed!

700
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,154
What?

701
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:38,454
We heard you posed the picture!

702
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:39,794
Hey, Doc!

703
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:50,204
We're bigger than life, Doc!

704
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,864
And we'll heave a mighty sigh

705
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:55,714
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye

706
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:59,474
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue

707
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:03,754
The United Nations in review

708
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:07,524
When this lovely dream has all come true

709
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:13,654
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

710
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,334
Good job.

711
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:20,564
Thank you.

712
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:31,104
Thank you, girls!

713
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:32,584
And now,

714
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:37,074
here are the men you've been waiting to meet,

715
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:39,024
the men in white.

716
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:43,114
Right behind me here, the heroes of lwo Jima,

717
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:46,634
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,

718
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,134
Private First Class Ira Hayes,

719
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:52,534
and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!

720
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:06,384
Thank you.

721
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:14,084
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.

722
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,784
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.

723
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:19,524
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.

724
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:23,224
As far as us being the heroes of lwo Jima,

725
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,964
that's just not the case.

726
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:28,574
We really didn't do much at all.

727
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:30,234
Especially him.

728
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:32,464
Especially me.

729
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:35,874
I was just a runner. That's it.

730
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,914
We put up a flag.

731
00:57:38,984 --> 00:57:42,814
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.

732
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,184
We had our picture taken doing it.

733
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:49,994
The real heroes are dead on that island.

734
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:54,094
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them. Thank you.

735
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,574
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

736
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,344
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?

737
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:19,894
At least I fired my weapon.

738
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,294
All right, knock it off.

739
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,294
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?

740
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:24,454
What?

741
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:27,194
Guys! Come on!

742
00:58:27,264 --> 00:58:29,594
Stop it. Knock it off.

743
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:54,184
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way

744
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,424
Get your savings out when you hear him shout

745
00:58:57,494 --> 00:58:59,964
"Any bonds today?"

746
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,964
Any bonds today?

747
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:05,524
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling

748
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:06,934
Any bonds today?

749
00:59:07,004 --> 00:59:10,374
Rene, right here. Sit between these two boys.

750
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,774
Here comes the freedom man

751
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:18,904
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today

752
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:24,214
...for us and they need our help.

753
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,684
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize

754
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:33,694
that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do

755
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:35,864
but the only thing to do.

756
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:40,524
Yes, this war has gone on too long.

757
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,674
We have given too many lives. And its cost...

758
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:48,074
Chocolate or strawberry, sir? Strawberry.

759
00:59:48,144 --> 00:59:50,514
...has been far too high.

760
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,484
But if we waver now,

761
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:57,314
if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can

762
00:59:57,394 --> 01:00:00,454
then those sacrifices would be wasted...

763
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:01,924
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?

764
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:04,554
...and those lives lost in vain.

765
01:01:43,294 --> 01:01:46,324
Let's move! Go, go!

766
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,054
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over. Where the hell are our tanks?

767
01:02:11,124 --> 01:02:13,684
Stuck in the sand. Captain says you're to go without them.

768
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:15,054
Christ.

769
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:18,494
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.

770
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,254
All right, prepare to move out. Pass the word.

771
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:25,094
Second Platoon! Move! Move! Move!

772
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,534
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet! Let's move out!

773
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:29,934
Jackass.

774
01:02:30,004 --> 01:02:31,604
Let's move out!

775
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,174
Go, go! Move, move, move!

776
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,484
Corpsman!

777
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:53,954
Corpsman!

778
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:58,334
Second Platoon, move out!

779
01:03:03,204 --> 01:03:04,364
Doc!

780
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:07,514
Doc, get out of there!

781
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:17,614
Corpsman!

782
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:19,814
Doc!

783
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,964
Doc, get the hell out of there!

784
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:39,174
May I have your attention, please.

785
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:44,914
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,

786
01:03:44,984 --> 01:03:48,854
Rochester, New York,

787
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:53,294
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana is now arriving on Track 7.

788
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:57,354
Train number 48 now arriving on Track number 7.

789
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,454
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

790
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,994
Come on, boys. Let's go.

791
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,834
Watch your step, ma'am. Thank you very much.

792
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:32,664
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of lwo Jima.

793
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,964
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.

794
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:43,004
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

795
01:04:44,174 --> 01:04:46,904
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.

796
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,214
Rene! That's my boyfriend!

797
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,884
Who the hell is that?

798
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:55,314
I don't know.

799
01:04:55,384 --> 01:04:57,374
Rene, is that your girl? Hey, what do they call you?

800
01:04:57,454 --> 01:05:00,014
How about a photo? Hey, look at that!

801
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:04,854
What's your name, doll? What's your name?

802
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:06,694
Hey, she's a beauty.

803
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:15,174
Let's go find a saloon.

804
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:28,444
Smile, boys. Give them their money's worth.

805
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:32,414
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?

806
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:35,214
Thank you.

807
01:05:35,294 --> 01:05:36,884
Where exactly are you staying?

808
01:05:36,964 --> 01:05:39,364
I'm not sure yet. Just forget about that.

809
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:53,874
Senator, I'd like you to meet Corpsman John Bradley.

810
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:55,674
Doc, right? Yes, sir. Nice to meet you, Senator.

811
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,214
Good to meet you, young man.

812
01:05:57,284 --> 01:06:00,114
Now, we appreciate everything you've done and everything you're doing.

813
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:01,944
Thank you, sir. Quite all right.

814
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:03,644
This is Captain White.

815
01:06:04,624 --> 01:06:06,854
Colonel Johns. We're proud of you, Corpsman.

816
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:08,484
And then Colonel McCourtney.

817
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,964
Major General Green. Nice to meet you.

818
01:06:14,064 --> 01:06:16,034
Senator, this is Private First Class Ira Hayes.

819
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:17,464
Of course!

820
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:21,564
Now I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs. Is that true, Chief?

821
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,104
No, sir.

822
01:06:23,174 --> 01:06:26,234
Well, tell them you did, makes a better story, huh?

823
01:06:27,814 --> 01:06:29,904
Attaboy. This is Captain Green.

824
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:32,944
John?

825
01:06:33,414 --> 01:06:37,414
Madeline Evelley. I recognize you from all the photographs. I'm Hank's mom.

826
01:06:38,754 --> 01:06:42,384
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am. Hank was always talking about you.

827
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:44,924
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.

828
01:06:44,994 --> 01:06:47,794
Pleasure to meet you, son. Thanks for everything.

829
01:06:47,864 --> 01:06:49,694
My pleasure. Not at all.

830
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:54,064
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.

831
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,044
It's all right.

832
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:13,384
When I got the telegram, I...

833
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:17,324
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.

834
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:23,594
Knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph,

835
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:27,494
I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.

836
01:07:28,074 --> 01:07:30,904
It's so silly, isn't it? No, it's not.

837
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,334
How are you, son? Thank you very much.

838
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:38,574
We're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.

839
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,444
Thank you. Excuse me.

840
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:44,054
I'll make sure he calls. Well, thank you. Thank you.

841
01:07:45,424 --> 01:07:46,854
Are you Rene?

842
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:48,894
Yes, ma'am.

843
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:55,424
I'm Franklin's mother.

844
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:01,564
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

845
01:08:03,504 --> 01:08:05,774
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.

846
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,674
Would you mind?

847
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,454
Paper said that's Hank,

848
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:22,484
and I honestly can't tell.

849
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:26,964
It's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?

850
01:08:27,034 --> 01:08:28,824
But that's him, isn't it?

851
01:08:31,034 --> 01:08:33,434
Well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick,

852
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:34,974
and with everything that was going on

853
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,834
it's kind of hard to remember who was where.

854
01:08:39,774 --> 01:08:40,974
But...

855
01:08:43,414 --> 01:08:45,744
Yeah, I think... I think that's where he was.

856
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:47,344
That's Hank.

857
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,784
Thank you.

858
01:08:49,384 --> 01:08:50,754
Excuse me.

859
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:54,814
I'm so sorry for your loss.

860
01:08:59,134 --> 01:09:00,464
Excuse us.

861
01:09:16,014 --> 01:09:17,674
Take him outside.

862
01:09:19,684 --> 01:09:20,944
I'm Pauline.

863
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:24,014
Very nice to meet you. Hi, nice to meet you.

864
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:28,284
He was the best Marine I ever knew.

865
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:30,824
Thank you.

866
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:43,504
You okay, Chief? Oh, Christ!

867
01:09:43,574 --> 01:09:45,094
I'm okay.

868
01:09:45,174 --> 01:09:48,874
Yeah, you look it. You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?

869
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:51,314
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.

870
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:53,714
I've got him.

871
01:09:53,784 --> 01:09:55,654
Get some sleep, Ira.

872
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:23,674
Mike? Yeah?

873
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:25,704
You see this? What?

874
01:11:25,774 --> 01:11:28,114
Mike! Oh, shit, go!

875
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:36,214
He's killing me!

876
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,994
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?

877
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,224
What?

878
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,724
Well, they're not shooting at us. Maybe we killed them all.

879
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:24,204
Or they ran off in the night or something.

880
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:26,204
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.

881
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:29,034
Third Platoon! Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.

882
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:31,164
Just us? Yeah, just us, lgg.

883
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:33,804
All right, Third Platoon, move!

884
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:35,544
I tag along?

885
01:12:35,614 --> 01:12:38,814
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want. Get a good shot of my face.

886
01:12:38,884 --> 01:12:41,284
It's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.

887
01:12:41,354 --> 01:12:43,614
Hey, that'll work for me, too.

888
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:47,414
Lieutenant,

889
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,964
if you make it to the top, put this up.

890
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:52,294
Yes, sir.

891
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,394
Don't worry, Iggy. They never shoot at the first patrol.

892
01:13:01,474 --> 01:13:03,064
They don't? No.

893
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:06,664
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay,

894
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:08,734
then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.

895
01:13:08,814 --> 01:13:10,714
Really? Yeah.

896
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:12,804
Unless of course they want to make an example of us

897
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:14,474
and discourage all the others.

898
01:13:14,554 --> 01:13:17,074
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?

899
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:18,384
Really?

900
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,684
Jesus.

901
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:24,254
Thank God that ain't us.

902
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:38,004
Told you.

903
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:42,774
Boots, spread them out and put them on a line.

904
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:45,614
Set up a perimeter! First Squad!

905
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:53,194
Hank? Find me a pole. Yeah.

906
01:13:56,994 --> 01:13:58,724
Let's put this flag up.

907
01:14:05,534 --> 01:14:06,794
Watch it.

908
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:08,934
Right over here.

909
01:14:14,374 --> 01:14:16,814
Right here. That's good. That's good. Right here, right here.

910
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:19,074
Got that end? Hold that steady.

911
01:14:20,314 --> 01:14:21,654
Lindberg.

912
01:14:23,984 --> 01:14:26,114
Hey, who's got rope? Right here.

913
01:14:30,194 --> 01:14:32,024
Give me something. Yeah, good.

914
01:14:32,094 --> 01:14:33,324
That work?

915
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:39,694
Do it, fellas.

916
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,974
Keep it coming.

917
01:14:49,544 --> 01:14:52,814
USMC! USMC!

918
01:14:49,544 --> 01:14:52,814


919
01:14:53,914 --> 01:14:55,114
Shit, look at that!

920
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:31,244
Jeez, look at that.

921
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,364
Get down! Take cover!

922
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,364
Cover with that.30!

923
01:15:43,434 --> 01:15:46,524
Watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank! You see them?

924
01:15:47,404 --> 01:15:51,104
I got about 20 yards, left side. Lindberg, get the flamethrower!

925
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:55,004
Boots, you see them? Cover right!

926
01:15:55,544 --> 01:15:58,344
About 20 yards down! Duck one! You see them?

927
01:15:58,414 --> 01:16:00,404
Keep the cover on!

928
01:16:00,484 --> 01:16:02,474
Second Squad, you see them?

929
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:04,874
Get me some grenades!

930
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:06,384
I see them!

931
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:18,794
You see them?

932
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,064
Right flank, over to the right!

933
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:26,374
Cover me, I'm going down!

934
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:28,004
Careful, Iggy.

935
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,064
Easy.

936
01:16:30,114 --> 01:16:31,104
All clear!

937
01:16:40,354 --> 01:16:43,794
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?

938
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,064
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

939
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:50,864
God damn it. Strank! Sir?

940
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:53,334
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.

941
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:55,234
Let me guess, they picked us.

942
01:16:55,304 --> 01:16:58,204
Second Platoon, let's go. Get some exercise.

943
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:06,384
Let's go! Get off your ass.

944
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:12,084
Oh, shit!

945
01:17:12,454 --> 01:17:15,754
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!

946
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:18,724
Get Forrestal! All right, then.

947
01:17:22,564 --> 01:17:24,894
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.

948
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:29,164
Well, it was goddamn brilliant. I want that flag, Holland.

949
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:29,164


950
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,504
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch

951
01:17:31,574 --> 01:17:34,734
means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.

952
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:37,584
I want that flag.

953
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:41,344
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.

954
01:17:41,414 --> 01:17:43,254
You can count on me.

955
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:47,854
Fuck that. That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.

956
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:50,554
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground

957
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,654
so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?

958
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,894
He's out of his goddamn mind!

959
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:59,264
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.

960
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:01,564
You've gotta be shitting me.

961
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:02,904
Gagnon!

962
01:18:04,274 --> 01:18:06,004
Get your ass over here.

963
01:18:11,814 --> 01:18:14,654
Hey. Hi, fellas. How's it going?

964
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:20,354
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.

965
01:18:21,294 --> 01:18:23,154
It's that kind of day.

966
01:18:44,644 --> 01:18:47,084
Hey, Mike. Hell of a view, Lieutenant.

967
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:49,454
Lieutenant!

968
01:18:55,594 --> 01:18:57,754
Captain says he wants that flag.

969
01:18:58,964 --> 01:19:00,364
He wants this flag?

970
01:19:00,434 --> 01:19:01,594
Yes, sir.

971
01:19:02,964 --> 01:19:05,494
We just put the damn thing up. Yes, sir.

972
01:19:06,104 --> 01:19:08,194
Some kind of flag shortage?

973
01:19:08,274 --> 01:19:10,674
He wants you to put this one up instead.

974
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:18,474
Hey, Mike.

975
01:19:20,284 --> 01:19:22,214
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?

976
01:19:22,284 --> 01:19:23,754
Yes, sir.

977
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:25,724
All right, let's find a pole.

978
01:19:28,124 --> 01:19:30,094
Take the flag down, boys.

979
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:32,654
Captain's orders.

980
01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:36,224
You heard him, let's do it.

981
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,064
There you go.

982
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:42,124
Lordy, she's a heavy one.

983
01:19:46,644 --> 01:19:49,374
All right, hang on. Put this on.

984
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:56,514
One hell of a view, huh?

985
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:59,584
Good view from up here. Yes, I'd say so myself.

986
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:09,824
All right.

987
01:20:13,674 --> 01:20:16,904
Not in your way here, am I, Joe? Nah, I'm fine, thanks.

988
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:19,344
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?

989
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,074
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.

990
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,584
Ready? Ready?

991
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:28,914
Let's go.

992
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:33,014
You get it?

993
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:39,824
I don't know. I wish I could've seen their faces.

994
01:20:42,164 --> 01:20:44,724
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.

995
01:20:47,834 --> 01:20:51,934
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.

996
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:55,134
But your dad and the others knew what they had done

997
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:57,304
and what they had not done.

998
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,284
All your friends dying,

999
01:21:01,954 --> 01:21:05,684
it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.

1000
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:09,124
But for putting up a pole?

1001
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:15,324
You gotta be kidding.

1002
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:19,774
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.

1003
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:22,334
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly

1004
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:24,394
and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.

1005
01:21:24,474 --> 01:21:25,464
It's gonna look a lot better.

1006
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:27,944
So, stadium lights come down,

1007
01:21:28,014 --> 01:21:29,484
spotlight comes up and you get your cue.

1008
01:21:29,544 --> 01:21:32,034
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.

1009
01:21:32,114 --> 01:21:34,814
You smile, you wave. You know the drill.

1010
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:38,084
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.

1011
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:40,284
Hey, that's show biz.

1012
01:21:41,124 --> 01:21:43,724
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.

1013
01:21:43,794 --> 01:21:46,624
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.

1014
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:47,924
The dead guys.

1015
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:51,264
Yeah. Yeah.

1016
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:54,824
Okay, not a problem.

1017
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:56,394
Good.

1018
01:21:57,104 --> 01:21:59,504
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?

1019
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:01,304
Sorry?

1020
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,744
Well, seeing that he wasn't there,

1021
01:22:02,814 --> 01:22:05,844
it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.

1022
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:10,314
I think you know exactly where he was. You pointed him out to his mother.

1023
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:14,954
This is bullshit.

1024
01:22:16,494 --> 01:22:19,824
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.

1025
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,304
Hayes! Oh, for Christ's sake.

1026
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:28,494
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.

1027
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:29,564
Hayes!

1028
01:22:31,074 --> 01:22:33,044
You wanna do your damn job?

1029
01:22:37,814 --> 01:22:41,184
Let go of me! Let go of me!

1030
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:42,714
Come on!

1031
01:22:46,354 --> 01:22:48,014
He's with me!

1032
01:22:48,094 --> 01:22:49,954
Hey, he's with me!

1033
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:53,824
Back off! Sir, he's with me. Okay? He's with me.

1034
01:22:53,894 --> 01:22:56,234
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!

1035
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,704
Put the chair down, son! Put the chair down, Ira!

1036
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:01,704
Tell them drop their sticks!

1037
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:04,264
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.

1038
01:23:04,344 --> 01:23:06,534
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.

1039
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,134
Calm down, son. Sir, turn around, please.

1040
01:23:09,214 --> 01:23:11,474
That poster right there? The one on the end, that's him.

1041
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:14,044
That's him? Yes, sir. You read the papers?

1042
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,314
Christ.

1043
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,384
We got another fucking hero. Get him out of here.

1044
01:23:18,454 --> 01:23:20,254
Can you do that? Yes, sir.

1045
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:25,654
Put the goddamn chair down. And let's go.

1046
01:23:33,034 --> 01:23:34,764
Did you start this?

1047
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,264
He didn't serve me!

1048
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:40,304
I don't make the rules. We don't serve Indians.

1049
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,974
He needs to go sleep it off.

1050
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,224
Soldier Field.

1051
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:06,464
You hear that?

1052
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:08,634
What the hell is that?

1053
01:24:08,704 --> 01:24:10,834
I can't figure it out.

1054
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:12,574
Keep an eye out.

1055
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:15,444
It sounds like it's coming from up there.

1056
01:25:24,444 --> 01:25:26,314
They're using grenades.

1057
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:29,644
They're killing themselves.

1058
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:39,884
Ira, let's go.

1059
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:41,864
Come on.

1060
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:48,064
Let's go, Ira. Come on.

1061
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:12,554
Thank God. Jesus. Look at you, Chief.

1062
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:17,034
You found him.

1063
01:26:17,804 --> 01:26:20,894
Holy shit. You would have to pick today.

1064
01:26:20,974 --> 01:26:23,464
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.

1065
01:26:23,544 --> 01:26:26,134
Come on, let's go. Can you walk?

1066
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,334
Yes, sir. By yourself?

1067
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:30,544
All right, look. I don't care if you have to carry him

1068
01:26:30,614 --> 01:26:34,014
get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.

1069
01:26:34,084 --> 01:26:38,714
Get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys for as long as I can. Hurry up.

1070
01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:40,954
Jesus Christ.

1071
01:26:41,024 --> 01:26:45,294
And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!

1072
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,494
Cover!

1073
01:26:54,974 --> 01:26:56,304
Harlon!

1074
01:26:59,744 --> 01:27:02,674
Harlon! Get your fire team up in that position!

1075
01:27:02,744 --> 01:27:04,144
O'Hare!

1076
01:27:04,584 --> 01:27:05,914
First Fire Team!

1077
01:27:07,654 --> 01:27:09,344
Work around!

1078
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:11,684
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!

1079
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:18,664
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!

1080
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,464
Jackson, work your team around to the left!

1081
01:27:21,534 --> 01:27:23,154
Cover!

1082
01:27:32,004 --> 01:27:33,804
Left flank! Left flank!

1083
01:27:38,784 --> 01:27:41,014
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!

1084
01:27:44,784 --> 01:27:46,384
Hustle up, boys!

1085
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:53,124
We got them!

1086
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:55,024
Clear!

1087
01:28:11,214 --> 01:28:13,244
One hell of an experience.

1088
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:21,694
Move out!

1089
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:31,624
Cease fire! They're my men! You're targeting our men!

1090
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:38,104
You're targeting our...

1091
01:28:39,244 --> 01:28:41,184
Get me another radio!

1092
01:28:45,714 --> 01:28:48,244
Sergeant? Sergeant!

1093
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:49,514
Mike!

1094
01:28:49,594 --> 01:28:51,454
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1095
01:28:54,064 --> 01:28:56,254
Mike? Mike.

1096
01:29:04,004 --> 01:29:05,994
Hey, where's Doc?

1097
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,134
Corpsman!

1098
01:29:10,414 --> 01:29:11,814
Oh, shit.

1099
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:17,104
How's his breathing? Harlon, move, buddy.

1100
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:20,874
Hey, Mike. Mike, Mike, can you hear us?

1101
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:22,914
It's okay.

1102
01:29:24,524 --> 01:29:25,584
It's okay.

1103
01:29:27,064 --> 01:29:28,394
Come on, Mike.

1104
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:32,434
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?

1105
01:29:44,174 --> 01:29:45,904
All right, let's go!

1106
01:29:46,684 --> 01:29:48,074
Move out!

1107
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,704
I'm gonna get a stretcher.

1108
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:54,314
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.

1109
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:10,534
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of lwo Jima!

1110
01:30:12,304 --> 01:30:13,674
Corpsman!

1111
01:30:21,244 --> 01:30:22,544
Hank!

1112
01:30:23,154 --> 01:30:24,614
Hank!

1113
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:46,374
Doc, they killed me.

1114
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:56,104
Harlon!

1115
01:30:58,554 --> 01:30:59,644
Doc,

1116
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:03,444
they killed me.

1117
01:31:04,754 --> 01:31:07,384
Come on, Harlon. Harlon, stay with me.

1118
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,634
Franklin!

1119
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:28,674
I'm fine, Ira.

1120
01:32:15,264 --> 01:32:16,884
Corpsman!

1121
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:19,754
Corpsman!

1122
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,634
Where'd he go? Who?

1123
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:24,104
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski. Where did he go?

1124
01:32:24,174 --> 01:32:26,864
I think you jumped in the wrong hole. I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

1125
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:29,504
He was right here, now where the hell is he?

1126
01:32:30,374 --> 01:32:31,464
Iggy!

1127
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:33,634
Iggy!

1128
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,704
You shut up. You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?

1129
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:37,844
Iggy!

1130
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:53,924
Does it open?

1131
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:56,564
Iggy!

1132
01:32:58,104 --> 01:32:59,504
Iggy!

1133
01:33:01,244 --> 01:33:03,234
Iggy, are you down there?

1134
01:33:04,844 --> 01:33:06,434
Iggy!

1135
01:33:07,444 --> 01:33:10,414
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.

1136
01:33:11,184 --> 01:33:13,344
I had to go outside to throw up.

1137
01:33:14,984 --> 01:33:17,614
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.

1138
01:34:32,134 --> 01:34:33,494
You okay, Chief?

1139
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:35,554
Just let it go.

1140
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:39,094
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.

1141
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:49,574
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.

1142
01:34:54,184 --> 01:34:55,784
Goddamn Indians.

1143
01:35:06,964 --> 01:35:09,094
Come on, Chief. Let's get you home.

1144
01:35:14,494 --> 01:35:17,794


1145
01:35:19,044 --> 01:35:22,574
That's not what I hear. I called around, I'm not stupid.

1146
01:35:22,644 --> 01:35:24,644
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour,

1147
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:26,444
making a spectacle of himself.

1148
01:35:26,524 --> 01:35:29,814
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.

1149
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:32,554
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.

1150
01:35:32,624 --> 01:35:33,684
Yes, sir.

1151
01:35:33,764 --> 01:35:35,954
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.

1152
01:35:36,024 --> 01:35:37,054
Well, with all due respect, sir,

1153
01:35:37,134 --> 01:35:39,154
he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.

1154
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,634
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.

1155
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:43,694
He wants to be with his unit.

1156
01:35:43,774 --> 01:35:46,464
What unit? They're all fucking dead.

1157
01:35:47,104 --> 01:35:50,774
This is how he honors those men? By drinking and throwing up, and...

1158
01:35:50,844 --> 01:35:53,504
You know what? He wants it, great, we'll send him back.

1159
01:35:53,584 --> 01:35:57,534
Get him packed and on a train today. He's an embarrassment to the uniform.

1160
01:35:58,914 --> 01:36:00,254
Yes, sir.

1161
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:08,694
I'll do it.

1162
01:36:28,184 --> 01:36:31,614
Yeah, no, that's... That's good. That's what I want.

1163
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,684
I know it's a good thing,

1164
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,784
raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.

1165
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:43,254
But,

1166
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:46,894
I can't take them calling me a hero.

1167
01:36:48,964 --> 01:36:51,804
All I did was try not to get shot.

1168
01:36:57,174 --> 01:37:00,144
Some of the things I saw done,

1169
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:02,044
things I did,

1170
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:07,184
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?

1171
01:37:17,194 --> 01:37:18,254
Mike...

1172
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:24,824
Mike was a hero.

1173
01:37:28,174 --> 01:37:29,834
You ever meet him?

1174
01:37:31,974 --> 01:37:33,004
No.

1175
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:41,084
Best Marine I ever met.

1176
01:37:46,124 --> 01:37:50,084
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you

1177
01:37:51,564 --> 01:37:54,094
he'd be saying the same thing about himself,

1178
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:57,894
not being a hero.

1179
01:38:05,114 --> 01:38:06,304
Maybe.

1180
01:38:08,144 --> 01:38:11,044
He was a good guy.

1181
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:14,884
But I think that he would be ashamed of me,

1182
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:18,784
seeing me the way I am.

1183
01:38:37,944 --> 01:38:41,884
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?

1184
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,804
Think they'd do that? See my ma?

1185
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:52,344
I'm sorry, Ira.

1186
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:07,504
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.

1187
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,334
Keep your head down.

1188
01:39:18,984 --> 01:39:20,544
All aboard.

1189
01:39:20,624 --> 01:39:22,014
Good luck, Chief.

1190
01:39:54,324 --> 01:39:56,784
I think I saw him once after that.

1191
01:39:56,854 --> 01:39:59,844
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.

1192
01:39:59,924 --> 01:40:02,984
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.

1193
01:40:03,064 --> 01:40:04,894
I was driving west across Texas.

1194
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:07,864
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.

1195
01:40:07,934 --> 01:40:10,694
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.

1196
01:40:10,774 --> 01:40:14,104
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.

1197
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:22,104
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.

1198
01:40:23,214 --> 01:40:25,204
And he was an Indian.

1199
01:40:25,284 --> 01:40:27,844
We always told the press that Ira insisted

1200
01:40:27,924 --> 01:40:30,284
that he was going back to fight with his unit

1201
01:40:30,354 --> 01:40:33,724
which was at least partially true, but

1202
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:38,224
that isn't what got the headlines.

1203
01:40:38,934 --> 01:40:40,594
We're engaged.

1204
01:40:44,904 --> 01:40:46,604
Excuse me a minute, darling.

1205
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:48,804
Hey, Doc? Yeah?

1206
01:40:48,874 --> 01:40:50,964
Got a minute? Yeah.

1207
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:53,014
I'll see you at the car.

1208
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:57,814
You hear I'm getting married? I did, Rene. That's great.

1209
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:03,424
Yeah, it's something she wants. She waited for me all this time.

1210
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:07,584
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.

1211
01:41:07,664 --> 01:41:09,724
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1212
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:13,164
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.

1213
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:14,294
Me?

1214
01:41:16,364 --> 01:41:21,234
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?

1215
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,764
Well, I didn't really make many.

1216
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:27,974
The ones who didn't go, it's... Well, it's hard to even talk to them.

1217
01:41:28,044 --> 01:41:29,274
You know?

1218
01:41:29,344 --> 01:41:30,744
Yeah, I know.

1219
01:41:33,984 --> 01:41:35,754
I'd be proud to.

1220
01:41:36,654 --> 01:41:37,984
Thank you.

1221
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,994
I better go drag her away from them before she announces

1222
01:41:42,064 --> 01:41:45,524
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.

1223
01:41:46,134 --> 01:41:47,364
All right.

1224
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,694
Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you.

1225
01:41:50,774 --> 01:41:52,364
Rene, you're a lucky man.

1226
01:42:02,584 --> 01:42:04,744
Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon! Say cheese!

1227
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:08,684
I couldn't complain because the press loved them,

1228
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:12,284
so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.

1229
01:42:15,464 --> 01:42:18,924
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.

1230
01:42:23,474 --> 01:42:27,424
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima,

1231
01:42:28,044 --> 01:42:31,404
the men who died at lwo Jima and in other campaigns.

1232
01:42:32,274 --> 01:42:35,144
We ask that you honor the memory of those men

1233
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:37,744
by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.

1234
01:42:38,954 --> 01:42:40,314
Thank you.

1235
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:47,764
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.

1236
01:42:48,664 --> 01:42:52,864
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.

1237
01:42:55,064 --> 01:42:56,394
I remember your dad telling them

1238
01:42:56,464 --> 01:42:58,404
that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken

1239
01:42:58,474 --> 01:43:00,934
because he would've ducked the hell out of it.

1240
01:43:01,004 --> 01:43:03,704
Whose idea was it? Who wanted to stage the thing?

1241
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:05,264
Come on, it was you?

1242
01:43:05,344 --> 01:43:08,474
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?

1243
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,014
Come on! Doc? Can you answer that?

1244
01:43:13,154 --> 01:43:17,484
I remember when your dad got shot. All hell was busting loose.

1245
01:43:17,554 --> 01:43:19,584
People back home saw that picture

1246
01:43:19,654 --> 01:43:23,394
and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.

1247
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:26,564
We wished.

1248
01:43:27,304 --> 01:43:29,894
Anyways, we're pinned down.

1249
01:43:29,964 --> 01:43:32,764
Mortars, shells, machine guns.

1250
01:43:33,844 --> 01:43:36,634
Fire coming from every which direction, right?

1251
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:41,244
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."

1252
01:43:42,714 --> 01:43:44,374
Corpsman down!

1253
01:43:51,154 --> 01:43:55,254
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.

1254
01:43:57,534 --> 01:43:59,654
And the Corpsman looks up at him

1255
01:44:01,104 --> 01:44:04,464
and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.

1256
01:44:05,474 --> 01:44:08,104
He knows he's dying, you can see that.

1257
01:44:08,604 --> 01:44:09,904
But still

1258
01:44:11,374 --> 01:44:15,504
in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.

1259
01:44:21,824 --> 01:44:23,344
And Doc can't.

1260
01:45:01,264 --> 01:45:03,854
You okay, Doc? Yeah, I'm fine.

1261
01:45:05,134 --> 01:45:08,294
Yeah, you look fine. I'm okay.

1262
01:45:08,364 --> 01:45:11,734
Keep down, all right? I'm gonna go get a stretcher.

1263
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:12,894
Okay.

1264
01:45:20,244 --> 01:45:22,544
Corpsman. Corpsman!

1265
01:45:23,514 --> 01:45:25,714
For God sake, Corpsman!

1266
01:45:45,474 --> 01:45:46,734
Corpsman?

1267
01:45:49,174 --> 01:45:50,164
Corpsman.

1268
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:53,804
Incoming!

1269
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,114
Let me see.

1270
01:46:02,254 --> 01:46:05,314
It's not that bad. You're gonna be okay. All right?

1271
01:46:05,394 --> 01:46:07,414
Just stay with me. Look at me.

1272
01:46:08,224 --> 01:46:12,184
Took us a half-hour to find your dad. He could've bled to death.

1273
01:46:12,264 --> 01:46:13,594
Coming down.

1274
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:21,764
Thanks.

1275
01:46:26,214 --> 01:46:30,614
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.

1276
01:46:31,414 --> 01:46:33,044
Usually, they're lying.

1277
01:46:33,754 --> 01:46:36,584
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.

1278
01:46:37,654 --> 01:46:39,184
But it happens.

1279
01:46:41,394 --> 01:46:44,324
You get the feeling you're letting them down.

1280
01:46:45,634 --> 01:46:48,154
I could see that in your dad's face.

1281
01:46:49,634 --> 01:46:53,124
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.

1282
01:46:54,844 --> 01:46:56,834
But he didn't want to leave us.

1283
01:46:58,974 --> 01:47:01,464
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.

1284
01:47:04,954 --> 01:47:06,044
Yeah.

1285
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:10,584
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.

1286
01:47:10,654 --> 01:47:12,124
And we looked up.

1287
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:21,354
That was the first of thousands of landings on lwo.

1288
01:47:21,434 --> 01:47:23,234
Look at that. Yeah.

1289
01:47:23,874 --> 01:47:25,424
How about that.

1290
01:47:31,644 --> 01:47:33,164
I'm gonna head back, all right?

1291
01:47:33,244 --> 01:47:34,404
Good luck.

1292
01:47:37,554 --> 01:47:40,144
That island saved a lot of lives.

1293
01:47:43,794 --> 01:47:45,554
A lot of lives.

1294
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:51,924
I don't know what else to tell you.

1295
01:48:00,804 --> 01:48:04,434
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.

1296
01:48:15,884 --> 01:48:18,914
By the time he got home the war was over.

1297
01:48:22,994 --> 01:48:25,824
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.

1298
01:48:30,234 --> 01:48:33,004
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.

1299
01:48:30,234 --> 01:48:33,004


1300
01:48:34,744 --> 01:48:37,144
Thank you for having me here today.

1301
01:48:38,174 --> 01:48:43,044
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.

1302
01:48:46,614 --> 01:48:48,284
Because of the war

1303
01:48:49,884 --> 01:48:53,254
white men will understand Indians a lot better.

1304
01:48:56,764 --> 01:48:59,284
And it's going to be a better world.

1305
01:49:19,414 --> 01:49:21,784
But life had other plans for him.

1306
01:49:35,334 --> 01:49:38,034
You're... You're him, aren't you?

1307
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:39,764
You're the hero, right?

1308
01:49:43,714 --> 01:49:46,874
Great. All right, kids, go get your picture taken.

1309
01:49:49,414 --> 01:49:51,474
Oh, that's great. That's great.

1310
01:49:51,554 --> 01:49:53,174
All right, now say cheese.

1311
01:49:53,254 --> 01:49:54,514
Cheese!

1312
01:49:55,054 --> 01:49:58,954
That's great! Okay. Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.

1313
01:49:59,394 --> 01:50:01,624
Come on. That's a hero, kids.

1314
01:50:12,974 --> 01:50:16,934
Hero, lift this basket, will you? It's too heavy for me.

1315
01:50:42,404 --> 01:50:45,804
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.

1316
01:50:45,874 --> 01:50:49,704
Yes. G-A-G-N-O-N.

1317
01:50:50,874 --> 01:50:54,274
Right. Pronounced Rene. Rene, yes.

1318
01:50:55,314 --> 01:50:59,644
Okay, I actually called last week. Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.

1319
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:04,284
I gave Mr. Tennack your message. I'm sure he'll call you.

1320
01:51:04,924 --> 01:51:07,054
Okay. All right.

1321
01:51:08,194 --> 01:51:09,284
Thank you.

1322
01:51:09,864 --> 01:51:12,054
But he was yesterday's hero.

1323
01:51:12,134 --> 01:51:15,394
He even applied for a job at the local police station.

1324
01:51:17,574 --> 01:51:19,934
They said he wasn't qualified.

1325
01:51:20,004 --> 01:51:22,974
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things

1326
01:51:23,044 --> 01:51:25,704
but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.

1327
01:51:28,244 --> 01:51:29,304
But Ira...

1328
01:51:29,384 --> 01:51:31,814
Ira! You got a visitor.

1329
01:51:35,184 --> 01:51:37,154
Ira always made the news.

1330
01:51:37,894 --> 01:51:40,884


1331
01:51:43,694 --> 01:51:47,864
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.

1332
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:34,504
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles

1333
01:52:34,584 --> 01:52:36,484
from Arizona to Texas.

1334
01:52:40,114 --> 01:52:43,414
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.

1335
01:52:43,484 --> 01:52:47,754
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.

1336
01:52:48,594 --> 01:52:52,124
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.

1337
01:53:10,214 --> 01:53:12,244
And Ira told him the truth,

1338
01:53:13,484 --> 01:53:16,684
that it had been his son who raised the flag with them,

1339
01:53:17,454 --> 01:53:19,484
his son in the photograph.

1340
01:53:22,264 --> 01:53:24,954
And then he just turned and walked away.

1341
01:53:26,294 --> 01:53:29,164
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him,

1342
01:53:29,734 --> 01:53:32,894
he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.

1343
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:50,814
Thanks for calling.

1344
01:53:54,924 --> 01:53:57,124
Just as Belle knew all along.

1345
01:54:06,604 --> 01:54:08,404
The press soon found out

1346
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:12,434
and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.

1347
01:54:25,694 --> 01:54:27,354
The last time they all saw each other

1348
01:54:27,424 --> 01:54:30,824
was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.

1349
01:54:32,364 --> 01:54:35,894
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,

1350
01:54:35,964 --> 01:54:38,364
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.

1351
01:55:15,744 --> 01:55:16,794
Ira.

1352
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:31,314
It's good to see you, Ira.

1353
01:55:39,894 --> 01:55:41,734
Hell of a statue.

1354
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:57,904
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.

1355
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:02,484
The papers said he died of exposure. There was no autopsy.

1356
01:56:17,264 --> 01:56:18,894
It was about that same time

1357
01:56:18,974 --> 01:56:21,494
when my father got in his car early one morning

1358
01:56:21,574 --> 01:56:24,004
telling my mom he had something to do.

1359
01:56:30,784 --> 01:56:35,184
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.

1360
01:56:45,234 --> 01:56:47,424
Ever since she heard the news about her son

1361
01:56:47,504 --> 01:56:51,524
she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.

1362
01:56:53,804 --> 01:56:56,334
I never found out what he told her,

1363
01:56:56,404 --> 01:56:59,634
but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.

1364
01:57:01,184 --> 01:57:03,614
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.

1365
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:05,274
He would never say.

1366
01:57:13,124 --> 01:57:16,094
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day,

1367
01:57:16,164 --> 01:57:19,994
the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.

1368
01:57:21,104 --> 01:57:23,764
No, I'm sorry. He's fishing in Canada.

1369
01:57:24,634 --> 01:57:27,034
We were always instructed to say the same thing.

1370
01:57:27,104 --> 01:57:29,044
Okay. Thanks.

1371
01:57:32,374 --> 01:57:34,404
When Mr. McCandless retired,

1372
01:57:34,484 --> 01:57:38,144
my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.

1373
01:57:38,214 --> 01:57:42,244
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.

1374
01:58:30,364 --> 01:58:33,604
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising,

1375
01:58:34,304 --> 01:58:36,294
never told us anything.

1376
01:58:36,644 --> 01:58:40,474
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.

1377
01:58:57,464 --> 01:59:00,434
Where is he? Oh, God.

1378
01:59:02,634 --> 01:59:04,124
He's not here, Dad.

1379
01:59:05,204 --> 01:59:06,294
He died.

1380
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,264
Who? Who died?

1381
01:59:11,674 --> 01:59:12,764
Iggy.

1382
01:59:14,844 --> 01:59:15,934
Iggy.

1383
01:59:17,414 --> 01:59:20,904
Christ, poor Iggy.

1384
01:59:21,924 --> 01:59:24,384
I hadn't thought of him for years.

1385
01:59:26,354 --> 01:59:28,724
How do you know about Iggy?

1386
01:59:29,264 --> 01:59:32,754
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.

1387
01:59:37,834 --> 01:59:40,034
I wasn't looking for Iggy.

1388
01:59:42,144 --> 01:59:44,004
I was looking for you.

1389
01:59:46,274 --> 01:59:47,764
I wanted to...

1390
01:59:50,584 --> 01:59:54,714
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.

1391
01:59:56,184 --> 01:59:57,914
Talked to you more.

1392
01:59:59,394 --> 02:00:00,654
I just...

1393
02:00:04,734 --> 02:00:06,064
I'm sorry.

1394
02:00:08,164 --> 02:00:09,324
Sorry?

1395
02:00:11,474 --> 02:00:14,264
You were the best father a man could have.

1396
02:00:24,144 --> 02:00:28,014
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?

1397
02:00:32,454 --> 02:00:33,944
No, Dad.

1398
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:40,124
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain

1399
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:43,034
and they let us swim.

1400
02:00:44,534 --> 02:00:47,064
It was the funniest thing.

1401
02:00:47,974 --> 02:00:49,704
All this fighting

1402
02:00:50,674 --> 02:00:54,614
and we were jumping around in the water like kids.

1403
02:00:57,854 --> 02:01:01,014
That's the way I remember Iggy now.

1404
02:01:37,584 --> 02:01:41,324
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.

1405
02:01:41,394 --> 02:01:44,624
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.

1406
02:01:44,694 --> 02:01:47,294
Maybe there are just people like my dad.

1407
02:01:48,504 --> 02:01:49,994
I finally came to understand

1408
02:01:50,064 --> 02:01:53,504
why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.

1409
02:01:54,274 --> 02:01:58,074
Heroes are something we create, something we need.

1410
02:02:02,414 --> 02:02:06,714
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible,

1411
02:02:06,784 --> 02:02:10,014
how people could sacrifice so much for us.

1412
02:02:10,654 --> 02:02:12,924
But for my dad and these men,

1413
02:02:12,994 --> 02:02:16,224
the risks they took, the wounds they suffered,

1414
02:02:16,294 --> 02:02:18,494
they did that for their buddies.

1415
02:02:18,994 --> 02:02:22,794
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.

1416
02:02:22,864 --> 02:02:25,634
For the man in front, for the man beside them.

1417
02:02:26,934 --> 02:02:29,994
And if we wish to truly honor these men,

1418
02:02:30,074 --> 02:02:33,044
we should remember them the way they really were,

1419
02:02:33,114 --> 02:02:35,444
the way my dad remembered them.

1420
02:03:15,424 --> 02:03:16,854
Come on, Doc!

1421
02:04:33,414 --> 02:04:36,844


1422
02:04:38,214 --> 02:04:41,844


1423
02:04:43,414 --> 02:04:46,844


1424
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:51,844


1425
02:04:58,714 --> 02:05:02,144


1426
02:05:03,414 --> 02:05:06,844


1427
02:05:08,714 --> 02:05:12,144


1428
02:11:19,414 --> 02:11:26,844
