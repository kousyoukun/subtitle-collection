1
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,788
Corpsman!

2
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,091
Corpsman!

3
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,168
Corpsman!

4
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,078
For God sakes! Corpsman!

5
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:28,253
Corpsman!

6
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,760
Corpsman!

7
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,435
Honey, what's wrong?

8
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:09,120
Every jackass thinks he knows
what war is.

9
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,766
Especially those
who've never been in one.

10
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,332
We like things nice and simple,

11
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,737
good and evil, heroes and villains.

12
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,633
There's always plenty of both.

13
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,976
Most of the time,
they are not who we think they are.

14
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,296
Where is he?

15
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,495
Where is he?

16
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,175
Where... Where is he? Where is he?

17
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,338
Mr. Bradley?

18
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,084
Mr. B? You okay?

19
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,644
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

20
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:12,388
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where... Where is he?

21
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,690
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

22
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,629
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.

23
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,991
Where is he?

24
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:28,699
Most guys I knew would never talk
about what happened over there.

25
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:32,140
Probably 'cause they're
still trying to forget about it.

26
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,547
They certainly didn't
think of themselves as heroes.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,182
They died without glory.

28
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,955
Nobody has taken their pictures.

29
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:48,087
Only their buddies knew what they did.

30
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,097
I'd tell their folks
they died for their country.

31
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,333
I'm not sure that was it.

32
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,836
Now, there were plenty other photos
taken that day,

33
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,532
but none anybody wanted to see.

34
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,905
What we see and do in war,

35
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,569
the cruelty, is unbelievable.

36
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,882
But somehow
we gotta make some sense of it.

37
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:14,544
To do that,
we need a easy to understand truth

38
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,783
and damn few words.

39
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,651
Film's ruined.

40
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,095
I don't know. This one looks all right.

41
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,900
And if you can get a picture...

42
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:39,276
Now, the right picture
can win or lose a war.

43
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,810
You're gonna want to see this.

44
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,282
Look at Vietnam.

45
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,717
The picture of that
South Vietnamese officer

46
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,985
blowing that fella's brains
out of the side of his head, whammo!

47
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,517
That was it.

48
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,792
The war was lost.

49
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,962
We just hung around
trying to pretend it wasrt.

50
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,235
Took a lot of other pictures that day.
None of them made a difference.

51
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,806
Thanks. Appreciate it.

52
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,316
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.

53
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,925
Country was bankrupt.

54
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,691
People were becoming
cynical and tired of war.

55
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,070
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!

56
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,206
Where?

57
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,241
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.

58
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,617
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

59
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,590
And that's his. I powdered
and diapered it, I know my son.

60
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,484
That's him. Go get your father.

61
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,792
Daddy, Ma's got a picture
of Harlors keister in the paper.

62
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,527
You watch your mouth, young man.

63
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,872
Thank you.

64
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:29,956
One photo, almost all on its own,
turned that around.

65
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,558
It's on the front page
of every major paper.

66
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:37,791
Over 200 dailies and they're
all flooded with requests for prints.

67
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,666
I think we might have found it.

68
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,618
Corpsman!

69
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,082
Corpsman!

70
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,828
Corpsman!

71
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,920
- I gotta go get him.
- Oh, no, you don't.

72
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,363
Iggy, I gotta go.

73
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,558
I have a whole different theory.

74
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,501
He wants medical attention bad enough,
he'll come to us.

75
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,835
Shut up and crawl over here,
you lazy son-of-a-bitch!

76
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,841
As soon as that flare goes out.

77
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,468
- Crap. Okay, well, I'll go with you.
- No.

78
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,841
You're actually gonna leave me here?

79
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,279
I'll be right back,
just shoot some people. I gotta go.

80
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,690
Oh, God.

81
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,921
Okay, it's okay.

82
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,261
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.

83
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,325
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that. I'll do it, okay?

84
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,894
Don't look. Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.

85
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,772
All right, look at me.
I'll get it. I'll take care of it.

86
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,970
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.

87
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:34,207
And we'll get you down to the bottom,
all right?

88
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,408
Look, you're gonna be fine.

89
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,915
It's okay.

90
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,516
I'll do that. I'll do that.

91
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,817
Here, put some pressure on that.

92
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,882
Put your hands on top
and put some pressure on it.

93
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,927
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

94
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,429
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...

95
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,228
Doc.

96
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,935
Help me.

97
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,671
Help me.

98
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,628
All right. Okay.

99
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,731
How's that feel?

100
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,470
- It feels good.
- It does? All right.

101
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,271
- Good.
- All right.

102
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,906
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get
you down to the beach. I'll be right back.

103
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,414
I'm all right.

104
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,574
Go and help someone who's hurt.

105
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,517
All right. Hold on there.

106
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,566
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

107
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,934
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?

108
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,667
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

109
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,505
He was right here,
now where the hell is he?

110
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,471
Lggy!

111
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,608
Lggy!

112
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,980
You shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?

113
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,484
Lggy!

114
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,402
Holy shit.

115
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,305
They expect us to climb this?

116
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,208
Or something just like it.

117
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,052
So, where you think they're sending us?

118
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,756
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

119
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,495
Well, that makes no sense at all.

120
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,558
Well, it's just military psychology.

121
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,468
They always train you for the desert
on a volcano.

122
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,575
Now you're just having fun with me.

123
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,741
Harlon, take your men right.

124
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,404
- Watch for Bedouins.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:23,473
- What's a Bedouin?
- It's a guy with a camel.

126
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,686
Well, Jeez Louise,
maybe we are going to the desert.

127
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:33,857
Now, you tilt that to the right, but
what if the bullet comes from the left?

128
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:38,221
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?

129
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,992
That makes about as much sense
as you showering with your shoes on.

130
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,230
You don't even know why you do it,
do you?

131
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,534
'Cause I don't tell you
mean I don't know?

132
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,666
You do it 'cause Mike does it.

133
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,666
I'll ask him.

134
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,202
So you cut hair back home?

135
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,372
Some.

136
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,214
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

137
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,616
No, I just studied it a little.

138
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,320
But not in barber school?

139
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,916
Nope.

140
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,458
- Gosh.
- Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

141
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,896
Chief, I had very little to do
with Sitting Bull's death,

142
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,525
so maybe you could stop
taking it out on me.

143
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:18,367
Different tribe. The Pimas fought
on the side of the white man.

144
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,929
- See, now that's smart.
- That is smart.

145
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:24,136
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

146
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,838
Good luck, fellas.

147
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,813
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

148
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,783
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.

149
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,677
What? Even I knew that.

150
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:39,023
- Who's in?
- Oh, I'm in. I'm in.

151
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,251
It must be a lot easier with them
not moving around and all.

152
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,922
- There's that.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,391
You know what I been thinking?

154
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,402
Well, they been telling us
we need to buddy up

155
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,030
and I think we'd make
pretty good buddies.

156
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,664
And how do you figure that?

157
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,733
Well, you know,
in that we have a lot in common.

158
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,943
So, why do you cut dead people's hair,
anyway?

159
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,540
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

160
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,153
You tell a lot of people that?

161
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,988
You actually chose the Marines
because they got the best uniform?

162
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,156
No sense being a hero
if you don't look like one.

163
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,527
Jacks.

164
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,395
Queens.

165
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,732
Shit.

166
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,931
Do anything on that reservation
but play cards, Chief?

167
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,410
All right, listen up,
you sorry bunch of leathernecks!

168
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,571
We practice going
over the side tomorrow

169
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,139
which means we ain't long
for this piece of rock.

170
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,684
All right!

171
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,155
One more thing, any man who doesn't
have his masturbation papers in order

172
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,554
better get them signed by tomorrow
night or he ain't going overseas.

173
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,718
- I got mine already.
- Oh, yeah. I'm square.

174
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:49,318
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

175
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,058
That's horseshit, Franklin. I don't have
to repeat everything twice for you.

176
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,329
No, I didn't hear nothing
about no masturbating papers.

177
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,370
Heard they were running short.

178
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,431
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.

179
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,635
All right, get your ass over
to the officer in charge of records.

180
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,541
Maybe he got some more left.

181
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,113
- Leave your smokes. I'll play for you.
- Thanks, Mike.

182
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,447
Listen, he calls you an idiot,
you take it like a man, okay?

183
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,487
Just do not leave without signing them.

184
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,988
- I appreciate it, Sergeant.
- You got it.

185
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,756
What the hell happened to your hair,
Rene?

186
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,392
Look like a goddamn corpse.

187
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,401
Three points of contact on that rope
at all times.

188
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,571
Next four. Over the side.

189
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,378
Let's go. Keep moving.

190
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,108
Next four, over the side.

191
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,085
Just keep your eye
on the guy below you.

192
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,485
That's all you gotta look at.

193
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,614
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

194
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:54,320
Keep three points of contact
on the rope at all times.

195
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,828
You see? No big thing.

196
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,666
Just one step at a time and keep
your hands on the vertical rope.

197
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,170
Remember, once you're in the boat
move away from the rope.

198
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,230
Just make sure you keep three points
of contact on the rope.

199
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,434
I got him!

200
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,204
All right, get that man out of the water.

201
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,745
Give me a hand.

202
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:14,974
Grab his pack.

203
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,140
Don't worry about him, Doc.

204
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,377
All right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving!

205
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,783
He'll be fine.

206
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,617
Our target, Island X,

207
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,024
is an ugly, smelly,
dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.

208
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,025
It means "Sulfur Island,"
which accounts for the smell.

209
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,335
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop,
you ask me.

210
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,001
After 20 straight days of bombing

211
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,438
you won't find a blade of grass
or a twig on it.

212
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,033
It wasrt that pretty to start with.

213
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,271
Captain?

214
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,940
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long,
two-and-a-half wide.

215
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,143
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.

216
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,312
On the maps in front of you
the island is white.

217
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,945
Not much of it.

218
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,524
The black dots represent
known enemy emplacements.

219
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,959
Coastal defense guns,
dual-mount dual-purpose guns,

220
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,518
covered artillery emplacements.

221
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,792
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns

222
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,734
machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes,
and earth-covered structures.

223
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,636
I don't see any barracks
or any other structures.

224
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,173
That's right.

225
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,106
And we still don't know why.

226
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,974
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

227
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:23,379
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian,
or Saipan.

228
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,611
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

229
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,884
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders
in eight square miles.

230
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,447
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

231
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:34,619
It's up to us to convince them.

232
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,960
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

233
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,057
The 8th Ammo Company
will land here to re-supply.

234
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,102
The Suribachi's guns
are the biggest problem.

235
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,865
They can hit any point on the island.

236
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,304
We're sitting ducks
until we take them out.

237
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,932
That's our job.

238
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,002
We cut across the island, right at the
base, slit its throat, lop off its head.

239
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,637
And we take that mountain.

240
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,376
We take that mountain,
we take their big guns.

241
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,179
We take their eyes.

242
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,423
Okay, I'm heading in. Follow me.

243
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,129
Let's put a good show on
for the Marines.

244
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,365
Close it up.
Take it right down to the deck.

245
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,021
Yeah, boys!

246
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,321
Man overboard portside!

247
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,532
See him?

248
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,470
Throw me a line!

249
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,170
He's right there.

250
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,505
- Where is he?
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.

251
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,575
Hawaii's that way!

252
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,578
Just keep paddling, Mac,
we'll catch you on the way back!

253
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,715
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

254
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,485
They're not gonna stop.

255
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,655
What?

256
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,133
None of them are. They can't.

257
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,442
So much for "No man left behind."

258
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,443
- Sir.
- Come on in.

259
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,844
Look, I've had to make
a few other changes.

260
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,823
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.

261
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,155
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You bet.

262
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:53,064
Trouble is, I already told my men
I'd see them through this.

263
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,294
That your
James Cagney impersonation?

264
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,233
'Cause I've heard better.

265
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,932
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

266
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,771
Look, this isn't
your first time through this.

267
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:05,777
- You don't need to prove anything.
- No, sir.

268
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,012
You're not the best sergeant
I've ever had,

269
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,073
you're just the best one
that's still walking.

270
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,948
- Block's a good man.
- Yes, sir, he is.

271
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,180
The men know him, he can step right in.

272
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,282
You know,
I have actually thought this through.

273
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,352
Platoon sergeant puts you further away
from the bullets.

274
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,898
I already gave them my word, sir.

275
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,866
I told them I'd bring them all home
to their mothers

276
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,869
which means I already lied to half
of them. Can't lie to the rest.

277
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,099
- How are your men?
- They'll do fine.

278
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,075
Except maybe Gagnon.

279
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,244
Our own Tyrone Power?

280
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:48,052
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be
better use further back from the lines.

281
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,880
I'll use him as a runner.

282
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,622
All right. Thank you, sir.

283
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,355
Now get out of here.

284
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,104
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.

285
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,232
Hey, you do that again
I'll take your head off!

286
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,004
Fucking dominoes.

287
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:15,579
Iggy, have you ever heard news
you considered to be bad?

288
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,275
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

289
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,444
Means we don't go over
the side of the ship.

290
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,284
We hop on a tractor,
they drive us right there.

291
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,586
Oh, shit, that is good news.

292
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,558
You see? What'd I tell you?

293
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,693
What's going on?

294
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,020
Look at that.

295
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:05,990
We're killing them!

296
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,897
We're killing them, Doc.

297
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,222
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

298
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,460
You're giving me three
and saying that's the best you can do?

299
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,730
I don't give a shit! My men hit
that beach with less than 10

300
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,567
and I'll be taking them home
to their mamas in buckets!

301
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,867
Yeah, I know exactly why.

302
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,742
Because every Navy man with
a scrambled egg on his chest

303
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,805
wants to offload us here
and sail to Japan

304
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,181
so they can be there for the big finish,

305
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,355
tell their kids they captured
the Emperor all by themselves.

306
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:07,450
Well, you aren't going to Japan
unless we take this piece of shit island!

307
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,020
These little pricks are dug in!

308
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:17,761
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

309
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,002
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

310
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,841
I'm okay.

311
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,513
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

312
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,450
Jesus, lggy, just leave me alone,
all right?

313
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,411
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?

314
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,858
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?

315
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,652
You sharpened it three times already.

316
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,528
Well, then I better make sure
I didn't nick it.

317
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,467
Good man, Doc.

318
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,534
- Hey, Doc.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:01,069
When we land, try not to wave
this kit around too much.

320
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,240
They got sharpshooters
that are trained to look for them.

321
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,341
And they know that
if they take out a corpsman

322
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,886
another dozen Marines
will die unattended. All right?

323
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,285
Okay, Mike.

324
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,485
Yeah, right there.

325
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,758
Close the damn door. For God's sake.

326
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,957
Yeah, like that's gonna help.

327
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,103
That your girlfriend, Chief?

328
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,703
Bet she's a pretty
damn good-looking squaw.

329
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,305
Bet you're missing her,
and that little wigwam of yours.

330
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,727
Welcome, all Marines off lwo Jima.

331
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,329
We have a long-time wait...

332
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,695
It's what they do to prisoners,

333
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,871
- at least the lucky ones.
- Jesus.

334
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,743
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think
about waving a white bandanna.

335
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,339
Poor Marines, so far from home
for no good reason.

336
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,143
Think of your girls back home,
waiting for you.

337
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:51,213
But a girl cannot stay home every night.

338
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,454
So who do you think
they're with tonight?

339
00:24:55,295 --> 00:25:00,198
And will she let him kiss her?
And will he comfort her at your funeral?

340
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:05,036
This sweet music is to make you think
of your girls back home

341
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,197
who are missing you.

342
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:10,174
This is all for now.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

343
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,039
Gunners!

344
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,889
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!

345
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,555
Gunners!

346
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,372
We're clear!

347
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,040
Get up the berm!

348
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,545
Baker Company, move out!

349
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,248
- Seen Second Platoon?
- I don't see them.

350
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,847
First Squad, move it out!

351
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,585
God, this place reeks.

352
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,604
- Go, go, go!
- Move out!

353
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:34,635
Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Go, go!
Drop your packs! Go!

354
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,146
All clear!

355
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,285
- Jesus, you needed some exercise?
- He got lost.

356
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:46,120
A hundred landing craft heading
for one beach and this guy gets lost.

357
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,217
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.

358
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,362
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

359
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,591
It's getting on my nerves.

360
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,726
Maybe they're all dead.

361
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,229
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?

362
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:26,691
Mike, take six men
and bring that gun onto the beach.

363
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,099
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down. Come on.

364
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,366
Move! Move!

365
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,944
- Get down!
- Take cover!

366
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,576
Move out!

367
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,429
Cover fire! Pour it on!

368
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:46,405
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!

369
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,015
Corpsman!

370
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:02,323
I'm gonna sling your arm
and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!

371
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,627
Move, move! Off the beach!

372
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,359
Take cover!

373
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,277
You got a girl back home, Marine?

374
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:29,014
We're gonna make sure
she sees you, all right?

375
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,579
I need pressure on this wound!

376
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,796
Where's the fire coming from?

377
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,306
Where are they?

378
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,376
Look for a flash, shoot at it!

379
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,881
Let's go, let...

380
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,000
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!

381
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,503
You're over!

382
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:34,148
Third Squad, forward! Move!

383
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,496
Where are they, sir?

384
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,694
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox! Sergeant!

385
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,899
- Sergeant! I think I can clear that out.
- What?

386
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,601
All right, you go. Here.

387
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,405
Take these. Check your weapon.

388
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,378
Yeah? Go! Cover!

389
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,846
Cover him!

390
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,355
Cover, cover!

391
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,419
Son-of-a-bitch.

392
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,127
Let's go! Go!

393
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,568
Move it out!

394
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,435
Go, go, go!

395
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,106
Down, down, down!

396
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,196
It's clear.

397
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,666
Good work.

398
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,702
I thought you said it was clear!

399
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,144
It was!

400
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:17,184
Shit, I guess they're not in there
firing at us then.

401
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:19,991
Lindberg!

402
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,185
Yeah!

403
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,750
Light it up!

404
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,160
I'll cover you, Ice!

405
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:31,135
Don't cover shit! There's already
enough people shooting!

406
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:34,297
One bullet and this thing goes up
like a Roman candle!

407
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,432
Go! Shift fire!

408
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,770
Shift your fire!

409
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,209
Go, go! Shift your fire!

410
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,742
Shift your fire!

411
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,152
Go! Move it out!

412
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,045
Hit the deck!
Stay down! Wait for support!

413
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,584
Is this a bad battle or what?

414
00:35:23,656 --> 00:35:25,715
It's a fucking slaughter.

415
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:38,364
Christ Jesus!

416
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:48,179
Get a machine gun team
set up over here, now!

417
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,986
Thank God! Tanks!

418
00:35:55,054 --> 00:35:57,989
Runner! Get those tanks up here!

419
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,087
Oh, shit.

420
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:02,991
Get down!

421
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,860
Corporal, watch your left flank!

422
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:09,196
Let's go without them!
Move out! Move out!

423
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,728
Lggy, you gotta lift your side,
he's gonna roll off.

424
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,230
Got it, Doc!

425
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,732
Incoming!

426
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,635
Move, move, move, move!

427
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,062
Keep moving!

428
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:24,803
Get that LVT up on the beach!

429
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:27,509
Keep moving!

430
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:35,779
You're next, pal,
we're getting you out of here.

431
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:41,622
Move it!

432
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,873
Great news.

433
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:03,213
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa,
'cause that's where we're headed.

434
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:06,114
Not you and me.

435
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,710
Captain Severance asked me
who else was in that picture,

436
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,550
and Christ if I could remember,

437
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,716
but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin
and me and Hank Hansen

438
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,522
but I just remembered,
you were there, too.

439
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,090
I wasrt there.

440
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,692
'Course you were.

441
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,238
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.

442
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,103
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.

443
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:32,007
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

444
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,541
You werert there, Mr. Smart Ass,
how'd you know it was Harlon?

445
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,310
- You tell them it was me?
- No. Like I said, I just remembered.

446
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,374
Good, keep your mouth shut.

447
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,117
They know there was somebody else,
you can see it in the picture.

448
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,280
Then pick someone dead.

449
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,153
They don't want somebody dead,
you dumb redskin,

450
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,625
they want to ship us back to the States.

451
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,857
What did I tell you?

452
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,856
I wasrt there.

453
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,423
- You hear?
- All right.

454
00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:58,863
Just settle down.

455
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:03,235
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.

456
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:41,007
Who the hell says?

457
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,914
This is horseshit.

458
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,149
You wounded, son?

459
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,718
No, sir.

460
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:57,455
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs
butt-naked with your bare hands?

461
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,589
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat
to a hero

462
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,531
he better have
a good goddamn story to tell.

463
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:03,966
No, sir.

464
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,665
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you
before Christmas.

465
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,990
The sixth man, you got a name?

466
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:38,127
Sorry, still don't remember.

467
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:41,832
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised
the Major you'd know who it was.

468
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:44,034
Fact, you not knowing
throws a doubt on you

469
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,373
being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

470
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,278
Since no one wants to be embarrassed,
the moment you land

471
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,213
they'll turn you around,
ship you off to Okinawa

472
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,979
in time to meet your buddies
on the beach.

473
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,681
So, why don't you stop screwing
with me? Give me a damn name.

474
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,398
Gangway! Gangway!
Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

475
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:22,072
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes! Hayes?

476
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,344
Hayes, get your red ass over here!

477
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,281
Make me look like I don't know
what my own men are doing

478
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,512
with a flag the size
of my mother's house?

479
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,521
God damn it, Ira,
you shouldn't have lied to me.

480
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,887
You made me look like
a complete asshole.

481
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,756
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.

482
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,833
Now your name's in the paper, too.

483
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,335
Just heard your doctor say
we're postponing your operation.

484
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,504
You're being shipped back
to the mainland.

485
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,515
Everybody who saw that picture
thought planting the flag meant victory.

486
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:02,314
That's all they wanted to know. Victory.

487
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:07,588
Within a few weeks of that picture being
taken, half the men in it were dead.

488
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:11,493
Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?

489
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,690
- Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
- What was he like as a boy?

490
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,857
Look this way, please, ma'am.

491
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,161
What do you have to say
about your son?

492
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,764
But somehow being a part of it
meant something.

493
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:27,273
Looking at it, you could believe
their sacrifice was not a waste.

494
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,718
Yeah, I might have thought
that was Harlon, too.

495
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:35,946
It is.

496
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,890
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.

497
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,590
And he would be alive
and sitting right here if it wasrt for you.

498
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:50,927
You think about that
when you look at his picture, Ed.

499
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,736
And I need to rush home and change

500
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:04,674
because there's the Governor's banquet
and then there's the parade.

501
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,974
Imagine, the Governor is coming here
to meet us.

502
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:09,877
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...

503
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:12,178
- Are you going to change?
- We interrupt this program to bring you

504
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,774
a special news bulletin
from CBS World News.

505
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:17,879
A press association has just announced
that President Roosevelt is dead.

506
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,516
The President died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

507
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:24,961
All we know so far is that the President
died at Warm Springs in Georgia.

508
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,562
Further updates every hour.

509
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,928
Temperatures will remain
the same today,

510
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,869
in the mid-30s to low 40s
with clear skies.

511
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,236
Hello?

512
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,067
Yes. Of course.

513
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:41,972
No, we understand. It wouldn't be right.

514
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,346
Thank you.

515
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,350
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.

516
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:56,121
Senator Haddigan. I'd like you to meet
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

517
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:58,128
Damn good to meet you.

518
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,562
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.

519
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,530
Sorry?

520
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,170
That's Pima Indian talk, boy,
don't you know your own language?

521
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,871
Took forever to memorize
the damn gibberish.

522
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:17,472
Sorry, I've been away from
the reservation too long, Senator.

523
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,719
- Doc.
- Ira.

524
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,758
And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!

525
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:31,091
- That's you.
- Go, go, go, go. Go.

526
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,857
Please welcome

527
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:37,194
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,

528
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:41,894
Private First Class Ira Hayes,

529
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:47,234
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!

530
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:19,674
Holy shit.

531
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,247
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

532
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:24,942
- Rene Gagnon.
- Bud Gurber.

533
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,678
- You showing the boys the sights?
- We saw a hell of a ball game.

534
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:30,050
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.

535
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,089
I got some briefing sheets for you here,

536
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:33,988
just some simple things
we want you to say.

537
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:37,551
Mostly, "Buy bonds,"
can't say that too often.

538
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,790
Itineraries, those are changing
every couple minutes.

539
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,355
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

540
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:45,801
I got women sending up envelopes
with stockings in them,

541
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,101
notes written in lipstick. We won't
mention that to the press, am I right?

542
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,642
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.

543
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,076
My God, what you boys
must have seen over there.

544
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,840
I've been watching the newsreels.

545
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:58,542
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

546
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:03,510
So, we got a hell of a lot of money
to raise, not a lot of time.

547
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,647
White House tomorrow,
then we trot you over

548
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:07,282
to shake hands with
a couple of hundred Congressmen

549
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,883
who won't pull a penny
out of their pockets.

550
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,222
Politicians and actors.

551
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:11,387
You put them in a restaurant together,

552
00:47:11,463 --> 00:47:13,363
they'd die of old age
before picking up the check.

553
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,366
Then New York City, Times Square,

554
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,426
dinners with various hoi polloi,
then Chicago...

555
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,404
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

556
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:24,704
That's what we're calling the mothers
of the dead flag-raisers.

557
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,641
You present each mother with a flag,

558
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:29,236
they say a few words,
people will shit money.

559
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:30,838
It'll be so moving.

560
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:33,611
But this says Hank Hansers mom.

561
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:36,153
Lovely woman. She knows how close
you and her son were.

562
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,620
He wrote home about you.

563
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,249
She is very, very much
looking forward to meeting you.

564
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:42,418
Hank wasrt in the picture.

565
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:44,689
Sorry?

566
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,690
Hank didn't raise that flag.

567
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,363
He raised the other one, the real flag.

568
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,962
The what? The real...
The real flag? There's a real flag?

569
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,597
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.

570
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:58,040
We put it up when they took
the other one down.

571
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:00,873
Am I the only one getting a headache
here? You know about this?

572
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:02,970
It was after it was already in the papers.

573
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,481
The mothers had already
been told, but...

574
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,677
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.

575
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:08,912
Yeah, why tell me?

576
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,649
I'm only the guy that has to explain it
to 150 million Americans.

577
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,452
Who is in the goddamn picture?

578
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:15,493
Are any of you guys
in the goddamn picture?

579
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,460
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

580
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:20,623
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.

581
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,098
You're three of them, right?

582
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:25,261
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.

583
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:28,567
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn
flag every time you stopped for lunch?

584
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,232
Can I hit this guy?

585
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,742
You know what, I don't give a shit,
you're in the picture,

586
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:35,371
you raised the flag,
that's the story we're selling, boys.

587
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:39,144
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.

588
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,912
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

589
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:45,217
Harlon Block. That's whose mother
should be here if anyone's should be.

590
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:49,559
You know, I think this whole damn thing
is a farce, you ask me.

591
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:11,507
You know what they're calling
this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

592
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,607
They might've called it the

593
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,447
"We're Flat Fucking Broke
And Can't Even Afford Bullets

594
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:16,146
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies"
bond drive,

595
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,054
but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though,

596
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,115
because the last four bond drives
came up so short

597
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,285
we just printed money instead.

598
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,522
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street,
he'll tell you

599
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:28,760
our dollar is next to won'thless,
we borrowed so much.

600
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,666
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.

601
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:35,536
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns,
bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

602
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:38,701
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?

603
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:41,245
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets
before you get on the plane

604
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,610
because that's all we got left
to throw at the Japanese.

605
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,115
And don't be surprised if your plane
doesn't make it off the runway

606
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,913
because the fuel dumps are empty.

607
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:50,716
And our good friends, the Arabs,
are only taking bullion.

608
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:53,121
If we don't raise $14 billion,

609
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:56,888
and that's million with a "B,"
this war is over by the end of the month.

610
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,452
We make a deal with the Japanese,
we give whatever they want

611
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:01,431
and we come home,
because you've seen them fight,

612
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,865
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

613
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:05,630
$14 billion.

614
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,900
The last three drives
didn't make that much all together.

615
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:12,706
People on the street corners,

616
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:16,008
they looked at this picture
and they took hope.

617
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,173
Don't ask me why,
I think it's a crappy picture myself.

618
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,717
You can't even see your faces.

619
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:24,619
But it said we can win this war,
are winning this war,

620
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,987
we just need you to dig a little deeper.

621
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,719
They want to give us that money.

622
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,784
No, they want to give it to you.

623
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,660
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.

624
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:37,064
You want to explain about
this person and that flag.

625
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,794
Well, that's your choice.

626
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,372
Because if we admit we made a
mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about

627
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,342
and that will be that.

628
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,214
Gentlemen.

629
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,957
Mr. President, here they are.

630
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:04,017
- Well, hello. Good to see you.
- Mr. President.

631
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,585
Darn good to see you, boys.

632
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,598
Heard you had a hell of a fight
on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

633
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,792
Yes, sir.

634
00:51:09,868 --> 00:51:13,395
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation
in Arizona, am I right?

635
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,268
Yes, Mr. President.

636
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,901
Being an Indian,
you are a truer American than any of us.

637
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:21,776
Bet your people are proud to see you
wear that uniform.

638
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,245
Very proud, sir.

639
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:24,874
They should be.

640
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,646
Well, I want to thank you for coming all
this way to Washington to help us out.

641
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,551
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific

642
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:33,591
now we need you to fight
for a mountain of cash.

643
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:36,320
- And I don't expect you'll let us down.
- No, sir.

644
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,259
Good. Go get it.

645
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,554
That's the end of this ceremony.

646
00:51:40,632 --> 00:51:45,069
Let's take a look at this famous photo
over here, see if I can pick you out.

647
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,536
My gosh. There you are.

648
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:01,008
Boys. Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.

649
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:02,981
Yes, sir.

650
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:09,457
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?

651
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:12,357
I suppose.

652
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,361
And your name is?

653
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,561
I don't know about you,
but I get the impression

654
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,398
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.

655
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,463
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.

656
00:52:23,942 --> 00:52:25,534
That's just not true.

657
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:31,680
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.

658
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,890
Here they are. You're the guys
in the photograph, right?

659
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:46,555
I heard you were on the train.

660
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,531
Let me shake your hands,
John Tennack.

661
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,328
John Bradley.

662
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:53,199
These boys are with me, Harvard
and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.

663
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,000
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.

664
00:52:55,073 --> 00:52:57,507
Boys, shake hands
with some real war heroes.

665
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,270
Excuse me for one moment.

666
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,404
You can buy them a drink
while you're at it.

667
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,414
That's right. Drinks for these men
all the way around.

668
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:07,076
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

669
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,210
- Rene Gagnon.
- Pleased to meet you.

670
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,983
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.

671
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,921
Listen to me, Rene,

672
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:16,722
when you get finished
being famous you come see me

673
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:19,627
because if you can sell bonds,
you can sell homes.

674
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,962
Now, they're not gonna build homes
anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

675
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,831
- You heard of prefab homes?
- No, sir.

676
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:28,895
Well, you will. And you hang on to that
card and you come see me, you hear?

677
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,770
- All right?
- Certainly will.

678
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,980
All right.

679
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,387
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

680
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:54,796
If Mike and the guys could see us.

681
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it,
would they?

682
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,438
Harlon!

683
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:07,042
Franklin!

684
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,115
Can you imagine Franklin

685
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,216
on this train

686
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:22,382
eating at the dining car
with all the silver?

687
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:28,925
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

688
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:08,200
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day

689
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:12,106
When the boys
have all come home to stay

690
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:16,078
And a million bands begin to play

691
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:19,674
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

692
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:23,686
And when we've lit the torch of liberty

693
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,245
In each blacked-out land across the sea

694
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,725
Ira! Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!

695
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:30,818
What?

696
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,125
We heard you posed the picture!

697
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,459
Hey, Doc!

698
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,870
We're bigger than life, Doc!

699
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,534
And we'll heave a mighty sigh

700
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:50,377
When each gal can kiss the boy
she kissed goodbye

701
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:54,145
And they'll come marching down
Fifth Avenue

702
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:58,416
The United Nations in review

703
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:02,186
When this lovely dream
has all come true

704
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:08,324
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

705
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:13,996
Good job.

706
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,231
Thank you.

707
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,773
Thank you, girls!

708
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,249
And now,

709
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:31,744
here are the men
you've been waiting to meet,

710
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,687
the men in white.

711
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:37,785
Right behind me here,
the heroes of lwo Jima,

712
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:41,298
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,

713
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,799
Private First Class Ira Hayes,

714
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:47,201
and Navy Corpsman
John "Doc" Bradley!

715
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,049
Thank you.

716
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:08,748
It's good of you people to come out
tonight in support of the war effort.

717
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:11,454
We really need you to buy bonds,
that's for sure.

718
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,191
'Cause we can't win the war
without your help.

719
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:17,894
As far as us being the heroes
of lwo Jima,

720
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,631
that's just not the case.

721
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,239
We really didn't do much at all.

722
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:24,899
Especially him.

723
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,133
Especially me.

724
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:30,537
I was just a runner. That's it.

725
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,579
We put up a flag.

726
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:37,485
The pole we attached it to was heavy,
so it took a number of us.

727
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,853
We had our picture taken doing it.

728
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:44,656
The real heroes are dead on that island.

729
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:48,757
And we'd appreciate it if you bought
bonds in honor of them. Thank you.

730
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,242
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

731
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:12,014
Take out any machine gun nests
I missed?

732
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:14,557
At least I fired my weapon.

733
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:15,956
All right, knock it off.

734
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:17,961
You hit anything
or were you too drunk then, too?

735
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:19,121
What?

736
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,857
Guys! Come on!

737
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,264
Stop it. Knock it off.

738
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:48,855
The tall man with the high hat
will be coming down your way

739
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:52,089
Get your savings out
when you hear him shout

740
00:58:52,163 --> 00:58:54,631
"Any bonds today?"

741
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,634
Any bonds today?

742
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:00,193
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling

743
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:01,602
Any bonds today?

744
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:05,039
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.

745
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:08,440
Here comes the freedom man

746
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:13,575
Asking you to buy
a share of freedom today

747
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,884
...for us and they need our help.

748
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:23,350
And, if you think about it,
I think you'll realize

749
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:28,364
that buying more bonds
is not just the right thing to do

750
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,532
but the only thing to do.

751
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:35,195
Yes, this war has gone on too long.

752
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,343
We have given too many lives.
And its cost...

753
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,743
- Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
- Strawberry.

754
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,179
...has been far too high.

755
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,149
But if we waver now,

756
00:59:47,218 --> 00:59:51,985
if we don't dig deep and give more
than we think we can

757
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:55,116
then those sacrifices would be wasted...

758
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:56,591
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?

759
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,220
...and those lives lost in vain.

760
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:40,988
Let's move! Go, go!

761
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:05,720
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?

762
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,349
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.

763
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:09,722
Christ.

764
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:13,161
That's real good work
you're doing there, Rene.

765
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,925
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.

766
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:19,765
Second Platoon! Move! Move! Move!

767
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:23,204
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!

768
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:24,605
Jackass.

769
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:26,267
Let's move out!

770
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:30,843
Go, go! Move, move, move!

771
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,150
Corpsman!

772
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,624
Corpsman!

773
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:53,002
Second Platoon, move out!

774
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,035
Doc!

775
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,177
Doc, get out of there!

776
01:03:10,688 --> 01:03:12,280
Corpsman!

777
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,485
Doc!

778
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:24,631
Doc, get the hell out of there!

779
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,842
May I have your attention, please.

780
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:39,577
Train number 48 with service
from New York City, Boston,

781
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,518
Rochester, New York,

782
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:47,956
Toledo, Ohio, and South Bend, Indiana
is now arriving on Track 7.

783
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:52,018
Train number 48 now arriving
on Track number 7.

784
01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:54,121
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

785
01:03:57,635 --> 01:03:59,660
- Come on, boys.
- Let's go.

786
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:02,503
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.

787
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:27,327
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present the heroes of lwo Jima.

788
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,631
Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.

789
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,672
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

790
01:04:38,842 --> 01:04:41,572
And Private First Class Rene Gagnon.

791
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:44,877
Rene! That's my boyfriend!

792
01:04:46,618 --> 01:04:48,552
Who the hell is that?

793
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:49,985
I don't know.

794
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:52,046
- Rene, is that your girl?
- Hey, what do they call you?

795
01:04:52,123 --> 01:04:54,683
How about a photo? Hey, look at that!

796
01:04:57,262 --> 01:04:59,526
What's your name, doll?
What's your name?

797
01:04:59,597 --> 01:05:01,360
Hey, she's a beauty.

798
01:05:07,906 --> 01:05:09,840
Let's go find a saloon.

799
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:23,115
Smile, boys.
Give them their money's won'th.

800
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:27,085
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?

801
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:29,885
Thank you.

802
01:05:29,961 --> 01:05:31,553
Where exactly are you staying?

803
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:34,029
- I'm not sure yet.
- Just forget about that.

804
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:48,539
Senator, I'd like you to meet
Corpsman John Bradley.

805
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:50,342
- Doc, right?
- Yes, sir. Nice to meet you, Senator.

806
01:05:50,415 --> 01:05:51,882
Good to meet you, young man.

807
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,783
Now, we appreciate everything you've
done and everything you're doing.

808
01:05:54,853 --> 01:05:56,616
- Thank you, sir.
- Quite all right.

809
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:58,315
This is Captain White.

810
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,520
- Colonel Johns.
- We're proud of you, Corpsman.

811
01:06:01,593 --> 01:06:03,151
And then Colonel McCourtney.

812
01:06:03,228 --> 01:06:05,628
- Major General Green.
- Nice to meet you.

813
01:06:08,733 --> 01:06:10,701
Senator, this is
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

814
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,134
Of course!

815
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:16,233
Now I hear you used a tomahawk
on those Japs. Is that true, Chief?

816
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:17,774
No, sir.

817
01:06:17,842 --> 01:06:20,902
Well, tell them you did,
makes a better story, huh?

818
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,573
- Attaboy.
- This is Captain Green.

819
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,611
John?

820
01:06:28,086 --> 01:06:32,079
Madeline Evelley. I recognize you from
all the photographs. I'm Hank's mom.

821
01:06:33,424 --> 01:06:37,053
It's so nice to meet you, ma'am.
Hank was always talking about you.

822
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:39,596
This is PFC Rene Gagnon.

823
01:06:39,664 --> 01:06:42,462
Pleasure to meet you, son.
Thanks for everything.

824
01:06:42,534 --> 01:06:44,365
- My pleasure.
- Not at all.

825
01:06:44,736 --> 01:06:48,729
Ira, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank,
Mike's mom.

826
01:07:03,188 --> 01:07:04,712
It's all right.

827
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:08,048
When I got the telegram, I...

828
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,988
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.

829
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:18,259
Knowing he was with you that day
and seeing him in that photograph,

830
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:22,166
I don't know why it makes me
feel better, but it does.

831
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,573
- It's so silly, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

832
01:07:26,477 --> 01:07:29,002
How are you, son?
Thank you very much.

833
01:07:29,614 --> 01:07:33,243
We're the largest furniture wholesaler
in Illinois.

834
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,115
Thank you. Excuse me.

835
01:07:35,753 --> 01:07:38,722
- I'll make sure he calls.
- Well, thank you. Thank you.

836
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:41,524
Are you Rene?

837
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,557
Yes, ma'am.

838
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,096
I'm Franklirs mother.

839
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:56,236
It's an honor to meet you, ma'am.

840
01:07:58,176 --> 01:08:00,440
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.

841
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:04,339
Would you mind?

842
01:08:12,257 --> 01:08:14,122
Paper said that's Hank,

843
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:17,152
and I honestly can't tell.

844
01:08:17,862 --> 01:08:21,628
It's horrible of a mother
not to know her own son, isn't it?

845
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:23,496
But that's him, isn't it?

846
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:28,103
Well, to be honest, ma'am,
it happened so quick,

847
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:29,639
and with everything that was going on

848
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:32,505
it's kind of hard to remember
who was where.

849
01:08:34,445 --> 01:08:35,639
But...

850
01:08:38,082 --> 01:08:40,414
Yeah, I think...
I think that's where he was.

851
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:42,009
That's Hank.

852
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:43,451
Thank you.

853
01:08:44,055 --> 01:08:45,420
Excuse me.

854
01:08:47,392 --> 01:08:49,485
I'm so sorry for your loss.

855
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:55,129
Excuse us.

856
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:12,343
Take him outside.

857
01:09:14,352 --> 01:09:15,614
I'm Pauline.

858
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:18,679
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

859
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,953
He was the best Marine I ever knew.

860
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:25,493
Thank you.

861
01:09:35,206 --> 01:09:38,175
- You okay, Chief?
- Oh, Christ!

862
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,766
I'm okay.

863
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:43,541
Yeah, you look it.
You're gonna screw this up, aren't you?

864
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:45,980
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.

865
01:09:47,051 --> 01:09:48,382
I've got him.

866
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:50,318
Get some sleep, Ira.

867
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,340
- Mike?
- Yeah?

868
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:20,374
- You see this?
- What?

869
01:11:20,445 --> 01:11:22,777
- Mike!
- Oh, shit, go!

870
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,883
He's killing me!

871
01:12:10,795 --> 01:12:12,660
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?

872
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:13,890
What?

873
01:12:14,398 --> 01:12:17,390
Well, they're not shooting at us.
Maybe we killed them all.

874
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:18,867
Or they ran off in the night
or something.

875
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:20,870
Or they're waiting for us
to start climbing.

876
01:12:20,938 --> 01:12:23,702
Third Platoon!
Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.

877
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:25,833
- Just us?
- Yeah, just us, lgg.

878
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:28,470
All right, Third Platoon, move!

879
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:30,207
I tag along?

880
01:12:30,281 --> 01:12:33,478
Yeah, you can lead the way if you want.
Get a good shot of my face.

881
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,951
It's your ass
I'm gonna make famous, Hank.

882
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,284
Hey, that'll work for me, too.

883
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:42,081
Lieutenant,

884
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:45,628
if you make it to the top, put this up.

885
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:46,958
Yes, sir.

886
01:12:53,471 --> 01:12:56,065
Don't worry, lggy.
They never shoot at the first patrol.

887
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,732
- They don't?
- No.

888
01:12:58,242 --> 01:13:01,336
They want us to go up to the top,
signal to the others that it's okay,

889
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:03,403
then shoot everybody else
as they come up the mountain.

890
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:05,381
- Really?
- Yeah.

891
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:07,474
Unless of course they want to
make an example of us

892
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:09,144
and discourage all the others.

893
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,745
I think you're full of crap,
you know that, Hank?

894
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:13,050
Really?

895
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:15,348
Jesus.

896
01:13:17,094 --> 01:13:18,925
Thank God that ain't us.

897
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:32,671
Told you.

898
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:37,437
Boots, spread them out
and put them on a line.

899
01:13:37,515 --> 01:13:40,279
Set up a perimeter! First Squad!

900
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:47,857
- Hank? Find me a pole.
- Yeah.

901
01:13:51,662 --> 01:13:53,391
Let's put this flag up.

902
01:14:00,204 --> 01:14:01,466
Watch it.

903
01:14:02,273 --> 01:14:03,604
Right over here.

904
01:14:09,046 --> 01:14:11,480
Right here. That's good. That's good.
Right here, right here.

905
01:14:11,549 --> 01:14:13,744
Got that end? Hold that steady.

906
01:14:14,986 --> 01:14:16,317
Lindberg.

907
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:20,783
- Hey, who's got rope?
- Right here.

908
01:14:24,862 --> 01:14:26,693
Give me something. Yeah, good.

909
01:14:26,764 --> 01:14:27,992
That work?

910
01:14:32,837 --> 01:14:34,361
Do it, fellas.

911
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:37,638
Keep it coming.

912
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:47,480
USMC! USMC!

913
01:14:48,586 --> 01:14:49,780
Shit, look at that!

914
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:25,916
Jeez, look at that.

915
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:36,028
Get down! Take cover!

916
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:38,029
Cover with that.30!

917
01:15:38,102 --> 01:15:41,196
- Watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank!
- You see them?

918
01:15:42,073 --> 01:15:45,770
- I got about 20 yards, left side.
- Lindberg, get the flamethrower!

919
01:15:47,011 --> 01:15:49,673
- Boots, you see them?
- Cover right!

920
01:15:50,214 --> 01:15:53,012
- About 20 yards down! Duck one!
- You see them?

921
01:15:53,084 --> 01:15:55,075
Keep the cover on!

922
01:15:55,152 --> 01:15:57,143
Second Squad, you see them?

923
01:15:57,555 --> 01:15:59,546
Get me some grenades!

924
01:15:59,623 --> 01:16:01,056
I see them!

925
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,462
You see them?

926
01:16:13,537 --> 01:16:15,732
Right flank, over to the right!

927
01:16:19,176 --> 01:16:21,041
Cover me, I'm going down!

928
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:22,673
Careful, lggy.

929
01:16:22,747 --> 01:16:23,736
Easy.

930
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:25,771
All clear!

931
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:38,461
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?

932
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:42,732
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

933
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,530
- God damn it. Strank!
- Sir?

934
01:16:45,603 --> 01:16:48,003
They want a phone line run up
to the top of the mountain.

935
01:16:48,072 --> 01:16:49,903
Let me guess, they picked us.

936
01:16:49,974 --> 01:16:52,875
Second Platoon, let's go.
Get some exercise.

937
01:16:58,582 --> 01:17:01,050
Let's go! Get off your ass.

938
01:17:05,156 --> 01:17:06,748
Oh, shit!

939
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:10,423
Hope it still works,
'cause you're not getting mine!

940
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:13,394
- Get Forrestal!
- All right, then.

941
01:17:17,234 --> 01:17:19,566
I don't know whose idea it was,
Mr. Secretary.

942
01:17:19,637 --> 01:17:23,835
Well, it was goddamn brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland.

943
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:26,172
Mark my words,
raising that son-of-a-bitch

944
01:17:26,243 --> 01:17:29,406
means a Marine Corps
for the next 500 years.

945
01:17:30,314 --> 01:17:32,248
I want that flag.

946
01:17:33,217 --> 01:17:36,015
Yes, sir.
I'll make sure no one touches it.

947
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:37,917
You can count on me.

948
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:42,518
Fuck that. That flag belongs
to the men in this battalion.

949
01:17:42,593 --> 01:17:45,221
That son-of-a-bitch thinks
that our men died taking this ground

950
01:17:45,296 --> 01:17:48,322
so we could hand over our flag
to some politician to pin to his wall?

951
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,560
He's out of his goddamn mind!

952
01:17:51,635 --> 01:17:53,933
Get me that flag,
and find another one to replace it.

953
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:56,234
You've gotta be shitting me.

954
01:17:56,307 --> 01:17:57,569
Gagnon!

955
01:17:58,943 --> 01:18:00,672
Get your ass over here.

956
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:09,317
Hey. Hi, fellas. How's it going?

957
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:15,020
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.

958
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,825
It's that kind of day.

959
01:18:39,316 --> 01:18:41,750
- Hey, Mike.
- Hell of a view, Lieutenant.

960
01:18:42,753 --> 01:18:44,118
Lieutenant!

961
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:52,422
Captain says he wants that flag.

962
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:55,030
He wants this flag?

963
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:56,259
Yes, sir.

964
01:18:57,635 --> 01:19:00,160
- We just put the damn thing up.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:02,864
Some kind of flag shortage?

966
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:05,340
He wants you to put this one up instead.

967
01:19:11,882 --> 01:19:13,144
Hey, Mike.

968
01:19:14,952 --> 01:19:16,886
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?

969
01:19:16,954 --> 01:19:18,421
Yes, sir.

970
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:20,389
All right, let's find a pole.

971
01:19:22,793 --> 01:19:24,761
Take the flag down, boys.

972
01:19:25,763 --> 01:19:27,321
Captairs orders.

973
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:30,896
You heard him, let's do it.

974
01:19:33,537 --> 01:19:34,731
There you go.

975
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:36,796
Lordy, she's a heavy one.

976
01:19:41,312 --> 01:19:44,042
All right, hang on. Put this on.

977
01:19:49,987 --> 01:19:51,181
One hell of a view, huh?

978
01:19:51,255 --> 01:19:54,247
Good view from up here.
Yes, I'd say so myself.

979
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,492
All right.

980
01:20:08,339 --> 01:20:11,570
- Not in your way here, am I, Joe?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.

981
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:14,008
Hey, Doc,
you wanna give us a hand here?

982
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:20,743
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.

983
01:20:20,818 --> 01:20:22,251
Ready? Ready?

984
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:23,581
Let's go.

985
01:20:26,523 --> 01:20:27,683
You get it?

986
01:20:31,428 --> 01:20:34,488
I don't know.
I wish I could've seen their faces.

987
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:39,394
Nobody even noticed
that second flag going up.

988
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:46,602
Everybody saw that damn picture
and made up their own story about it.

989
01:20:47,144 --> 01:20:49,806
But your dad and the others
knew what they had done

990
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,973
and what they had not done.

991
01:20:54,018 --> 01:20:55,952
All your friends dying,

992
01:20:56,620 --> 01:21:00,351
it's hard not to be called a hero
for saving somebody's life.

993
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:03,792
But for putting up a pole?

994
01:21:08,465 --> 01:21:09,989
You gotta be kidding.

995
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:14,437
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks
a long time to make that thing.

996
01:21:15,139 --> 01:21:17,004
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly

997
01:21:17,074 --> 01:21:19,065
and there's thousands
of cheering people in the stands.

998
01:21:19,143 --> 01:21:20,132
It's gonna look a lot better.

999
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:22,610
So, stadium lights come down,

1000
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,147
spotlight comes up
and you get your cue.

1001
01:21:24,214 --> 01:21:26,705
You charge up this thing with the flag,
you plant it at the top.

1002
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,480
You smile, you wave. You know the drill.

1003
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:32,750
You want us to plant the flag
on a pile of papier-mache.

1004
01:21:32,823 --> 01:21:34,950
Hey, that's show biz.

1005
01:21:35,793 --> 01:21:38,387
And try and stand how you stood
the first time you planted it.

1006
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:41,295
Just, you know, pretend
the other three guys are with you.

1007
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:42,593
The dead guys.

1008
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:45,932
Yeah. Yeah.

1009
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:49,495
Okay, not a problem.

1010
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,064
Good.

1011
01:21:51,775 --> 01:21:54,175
But where do we imagine
Hank is standing?

1012
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:55,976
Sorry?

1013
01:21:56,046 --> 01:21:57,411
Well, seeing that he wasrt there,

1014
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:00,507
it'll be kind of hard for us
to leave a space for him.

1015
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:04,981
I think you know exactly where he was.
You pointed him out to his mother.

1016
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:09,620
This is bullshit.

1017
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:14,494
I planted that damn thing once,
and I'm not doing it again.

1018
01:22:17,067 --> 01:22:18,967
- Hayes!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

1019
01:22:19,036 --> 01:22:23,166
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here
or you're going on report.

1020
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,229
Hayes!

1021
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:27,711
You wanna do your damn job?

1022
01:22:32,483 --> 01:22:35,850
Let go of me! Let go of me!

1023
01:22:35,919 --> 01:22:37,386
Come on!

1024
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,685
He's with me!

1025
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,625
Hey, he's with me!

1026
01:22:45,896 --> 01:22:48,490
- Back off!
- Sir, he's with me. Okay? He's with me.

1027
01:22:48,565 --> 01:22:50,897
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!

1028
01:22:50,968 --> 01:22:53,368
- Put the chair down, son!
- Put the chair down, Ira!

1029
01:22:53,437 --> 01:22:56,372
Tell them drop their sticks!

1030
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,931
Ira, they're cops,
they're supposed to have nightsticks.

1031
01:22:59,009 --> 01:23:01,204
You're not supposed to be in the street
swinging a chair.

1032
01:23:01,278 --> 01:23:03,803
- Calm down, son.
- Sir, turn around, please.

1033
01:23:03,881 --> 01:23:06,145
That poster right there?
The one on the end, that's him.

1034
01:23:06,216 --> 01:23:08,707
- That's him?
- Yes, sir. You read the papers?

1035
01:23:08,786 --> 01:23:09,980
Christ.

1036
01:23:10,888 --> 01:23:13,049
We got another fucking hero.
Get him out of here.

1037
01:23:13,123 --> 01:23:14,920
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir.

1038
01:23:16,126 --> 01:23:20,324
Put the goddamn chair down.
And let's go.

1039
01:23:27,704 --> 01:23:29,433
Did you start this?

1040
01:23:29,907 --> 01:23:31,932
He didn't serve me!

1041
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:34,972
I don't make the rules.
We don't serve Indians.

1042
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:42,642
He needs to go sleep it off.

1043
01:23:53,297 --> 01:23:54,889
Soldier Field.

1044
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,132
You hear that?

1045
01:24:01,638 --> 01:24:03,299
What the hell is that?

1046
01:24:03,373 --> 01:24:05,500
I can't figure it out.

1047
01:24:05,576 --> 01:24:07,237
Keep an eye out.

1048
01:24:07,311 --> 01:24:10,109
It sounds like it's coming from up there.

1049
01:25:19,116 --> 01:25:20,981
They're using grenades.

1050
01:25:22,519 --> 01:25:24,316
They're killing themselves.

1051
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:34,553
Ira, let's go.

1052
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:36,527
Come on.

1053
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:42,728
Let's go, Ira. Come on.

1054
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:07,221
Thank God. Jesus. Look at you, Chief.

1055
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:11,698
You found him.

1056
01:26:12,469 --> 01:26:15,563
Holy shit. You would have to pick today.

1057
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:18,130
Vandegrift is here with enough brass
to start a fucking band.

1058
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,802
Come on, let's go. Can you walk?

1059
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:23,004
- Yes, sir.
- By yourself?

1060
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,207
All right, look.
I don't care if you have to carry him

1061
01:26:25,282 --> 01:26:28,683
get him to the top, plant that flag,
and don't fucking fall off.

1062
01:26:28,752 --> 01:26:33,382
Get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys
for as long as I can. Hurry up.

1063
01:26:34,224 --> 01:26:35,623
Jesus Christ.

1064
01:26:35,692 --> 01:26:39,958
And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!

1065
01:26:44,568 --> 01:26:46,160
Cover!

1066
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:50,970
Harlon!

1067
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:57,346
Harlon! Get your fire team
up in that position!

1068
01:26:57,414 --> 01:26:58,813
O'Hare!

1069
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:00,580
First Fire Team!

1070
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,014
Work around!

1071
01:27:04,087 --> 01:27:06,351
BAR, you, on the side of the ridge!

1072
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:13,329
Covering fire, boys, go, go, go!

1073
01:27:13,397 --> 01:27:16,127
Jackson, work your team
around to the left!

1074
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:17,826
Cover!

1075
01:27:26,676 --> 01:27:28,473
Left flank! Left flank!

1076
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,680
Franklin, Gust, go check it out!

1077
01:27:39,456 --> 01:27:41,048
Hustle up, boys!

1078
01:27:46,396 --> 01:27:47,795
We got them!

1079
01:27:48,532 --> 01:27:49,692
Clear!

1080
01:28:05,882 --> 01:28:07,907
One hell of an experience.

1081
01:28:15,092 --> 01:28:16,354
Move out!

1082
01:28:22,732 --> 01:28:26,293
Cease fire! They're my men!
You're targeting our men!

1083
01:28:30,507 --> 01:28:32,771
You're targeting our...

1084
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,844
Get me another radio!

1085
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:42,908
Sergeant? Sergeant!

1086
01:28:42,986 --> 01:28:44,180
Mike!

1087
01:28:44,254 --> 01:28:46,119
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1088
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:50,920
Mike? Mike.

1089
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:00,659
Hey, where's Doc?

1090
01:29:01,138 --> 01:29:02,799
Corpsman!

1091
01:29:05,075 --> 01:29:06,474
Oh, shit.

1092
01:29:09,246 --> 01:29:11,771
How's his breathing?
Harlon, move, buddy.

1093
01:29:12,449 --> 01:29:15,543
Hey, Mike. Mike, Mike, can you hear us?

1094
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:17,578
It's okay.

1095
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:20,247
It's okay.

1096
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:23,056
Come on, Mike.

1097
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:27,094
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?

1098
01:29:38,842 --> 01:29:40,571
All right, let's go!

1099
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:42,743
Move out!

1100
01:29:44,848 --> 01:29:46,372
I'm gonna get a stretcher.

1101
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:48,974
Let's take him down,
move him off the beach.

1102
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:05,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
the heroes of lwo Jima!

1103
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,335
Corpsman!

1104
01:30:15,912 --> 01:30:17,209
Hank!

1105
01:30:17,814 --> 01:30:19,281
Hank!

1106
01:30:38,168 --> 01:30:41,035
Doc, they killed me.

1107
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:50,773
Harlon!

1108
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:54,308
Doc,

1109
01:30:56,586 --> 01:30:58,110
they killed me.

1110
01:30:59,422 --> 01:31:02,050
Come on, Harlon. Harlon, stay with me.

1111
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:15,299
Franklin!

1112
01:31:21,745 --> 01:31:23,337
I'm fine, Ira.

1113
01:32:09,926 --> 01:32:11,553
Corpsman!

1114
01:32:12,929 --> 01:32:14,419
Corpsman!

1115
01:32:14,497 --> 01:32:16,294
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

1116
01:32:16,366 --> 01:32:18,766
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?

1117
01:32:18,835 --> 01:32:21,531
- I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
- I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

1118
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:24,164
He was right here,
now where the hell is he?

1119
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:26,133
Lggy!

1120
01:32:27,177 --> 01:32:28,303
Lggy!

1121
01:32:28,378 --> 01:32:31,370
You shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?

1122
01:32:31,448 --> 01:32:32,506
Lggy!

1123
01:32:47,097 --> 01:32:48,587
Does it open?

1124
01:32:50,133 --> 01:32:51,225
Lggy!

1125
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:54,168
Lggy!

1126
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:57,896
Lggy, are you down there?

1127
01:32:59,509 --> 01:33:01,101
Lggy!

1128
01:33:02,112 --> 01:33:05,081
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.

1129
01:33:05,849 --> 01:33:08,010
I had to go outside to throw up.

1130
01:33:09,652 --> 01:33:12,280
Look what they did
to the poor son-of-a-bitch.

1131
01:34:26,796 --> 01:34:28,161
You okay, Chief?

1132
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:30,221
Just let it go.

1133
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:33,759
If that doesn't pry open their wallets,
nothing will.

1134
01:34:42,245 --> 01:34:44,236
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.

1135
01:34:48,852 --> 01:34:50,444
Goddamn Indians.

1136
01:35:01,631 --> 01:35:03,758
Come on, Chief. Let's get you home.

1137
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:17,237
That's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.

1138
01:35:17,313 --> 01:35:19,304
He's been drunk
since he started this damn tour,

1139
01:35:19,382 --> 01:35:21,111
making a spectacle of himself.

1140
01:35:21,184 --> 01:35:24,483
Just about choked that poor woman
at the reception, blubbering.

1141
01:35:24,554 --> 01:35:27,216
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be
watching these men.

1142
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,348
Yes, sir.

1143
01:35:28,424 --> 01:35:30,619
Well, he's making us
look like regular asses.

1144
01:35:30,693 --> 01:35:31,717
Well, with all due respect, sir,

1145
01:35:31,794 --> 01:35:33,819
he never wanted to come on this trip
in the first place.

1146
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:36,297
We had to pull him,
kicking and screaming, off that boat.

1147
01:35:36,366 --> 01:35:38,357
He wants to be with his unit.

1148
01:35:38,434 --> 01:35:41,130
What unit? They're all fucking dead.

1149
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:45,434
This is how he honors those men?
By drinking and throwing up, and...

1150
01:35:45,508 --> 01:35:48,170
You know what?
He wants it, great, we'll send him back.

1151
01:35:48,244 --> 01:35:52,203
Get him packed and on a train today.
He's an embarrassment to the uniform.

1152
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:54,914
Yes, sir.

1153
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:03,357
I'll do it.

1154
01:36:22,845 --> 01:36:26,281
Yeah, no, that's...
That's good. That's what I want.

1155
01:36:28,618 --> 01:36:30,347
I know it's a good thing,

1156
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:34,451
raising the money and that,
'cause we need it.

1157
01:36:36,859 --> 01:36:37,917
But,

1158
01:36:38,728 --> 01:36:41,561
I can't take them calling me a hero.

1159
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:46,466
All I did was try not to get shot.

1160
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:54,810
Some of the things I saw done,

1161
01:36:54,877 --> 01:36:56,708
things I did,

1162
01:36:58,514 --> 01:37:01,847
they werert things to be proud of,
you know?

1163
01:37:11,861 --> 01:37:12,919
Mike...

1164
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,493
Mike was a hero.

1165
01:37:22,839 --> 01:37:24,500
You ever meet him?

1166
01:37:26,643 --> 01:37:27,667
No.

1167
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,750
Best Marine I ever met.

1168
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:44,749
You know, Chief, I think
if Mike was sitting here instead of you

1169
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:48,754
he'd be saying the same thing
about himself,

1170
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,563
not being a hero.

1171
01:37:59,776 --> 01:38:00,970
Maybe.

1172
01:38:02,812 --> 01:38:05,713
He was a good guy.

1173
01:38:06,716 --> 01:38:09,549
But I think that
he would be ashamed of me,

1174
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,447
seeing me the way I am.

1175
01:38:32,608 --> 01:38:36,544
Think I could see my ma
before they ship me off?

1176
01:38:37,947 --> 01:38:40,472
Think they'd do that? See my ma?

1177
01:38:45,488 --> 01:38:47,012
I'm sorry, Ira.

1178
01:38:58,968 --> 01:39:02,165
We got stories now to tell our kids,
I guess.

1179
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:04,001
Keep your head down.

1180
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:15,207
All aboard.

1181
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:16,683
Good luck, Chief.

1182
01:39:48,985 --> 01:39:51,453
I think I saw him once after that.

1183
01:39:51,521 --> 01:39:54,513
It was maybe six or seven years
after the war.

1184
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:57,650
I was working as a salesman,
doing a lot of driving.

1185
01:39:57,727 --> 01:39:59,558
I was driving west across Texas.

1186
01:39:59,629 --> 01:40:02,530
I was just trying to get where
I was going so I could get home.

1187
01:40:02,598 --> 01:40:05,362
And I saw this guy
hitchhiking on the side of the road.

1188
01:40:05,434 --> 01:40:08,767
And, for a second,
I thought it might've been him.

1189
01:40:13,176 --> 01:40:16,771
I always regret that I didn't stop,
but I was in a hurry.

1190
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,871
And he was an Indian.

1191
01:40:19,949 --> 01:40:22,509
We always told the press
that Ira insisted

1192
01:40:22,585 --> 01:40:24,951
that he was going back to fight
with his unit

1193
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:28,388
which was at least partially true, but

1194
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,890
that isn't what got the headlines.

1195
01:40:33,596 --> 01:40:35,257
We're engaged.

1196
01:40:39,569 --> 01:40:41,264
Excuse me a minute, darling.

1197
01:40:41,337 --> 01:40:43,464
- Hey, Doc?
- Yeah?

1198
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:45,632
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.

1199
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:47,676
I'll see you at the car.

1200
01:40:49,078 --> 01:40:52,479
- You hear I'm getting married?
- I did, Rene. That's great.

1201
01:40:54,217 --> 01:40:58,085
Yeah, it's something she wants.
She waited for me all this time.

1202
01:40:59,188 --> 01:41:02,248
She's not used to all this,
but she's a good girl.

1203
01:41:02,325 --> 01:41:04,384
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1204
01:41:04,927 --> 01:41:07,828
So, I was wondering
if you'd be my best man.

1205
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:08,954
Me?

1206
01:41:11,033 --> 01:41:15,902
Don't you have somebody at home,
a buddy, you'd rather ask?

1207
01:41:16,339 --> 01:41:18,432
Well, I didn't really make many.

1208
01:41:18,507 --> 01:41:22,637
The ones who didn't go, it's...
Well, it's hard to even talk to them.

1209
01:41:22,712 --> 01:41:23,940
You know?

1210
01:41:24,013 --> 01:41:25,412
Yeah, I know.

1211
01:41:28,651 --> 01:41:30,414
I'd be proud to.

1212
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,651
Thank you.

1213
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:36,654
I better go drag her away from them
before she announces

1214
01:41:36,726 --> 01:41:40,184
I'm gonna be president
of General Motors or something.

1215
01:41:40,796 --> 01:41:42,024
All right.

1216
01:41:42,098 --> 01:41:45,363
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

1217
01:41:45,434 --> 01:41:47,026
Rene, you're a lucky man.

1218
01:41:57,246 --> 01:41:59,407
- Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon!
- Say cheese!

1219
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:03,344
I couldn't complain
because the press loved them,

1220
01:42:03,419 --> 01:42:06,946
so they wrote more articles
and people bought more bonds.

1221
01:42:10,126 --> 01:42:13,584
The tour went on
with just Rene and your dad.

1222
01:42:18,134 --> 01:42:22,093
And the true heroes are the men
who didn't make it home from lwo Jima,

1223
01:42:22,705 --> 01:42:26,072
the men who died at lwo Jima
and in other campaigns.

1224
01:42:26,943 --> 01:42:29,810
We ask that you honor
the memory of those men

1225
01:42:29,879 --> 01:42:32,404
by buying the war bonds
and helping us to win this war.

1226
01:42:33,616 --> 01:42:34,981
Thank you.

1227
01:42:38,988 --> 01:42:42,424
City after city,
I thought the damn thing'd never end.

1228
01:42:43,326 --> 01:42:47,524
And this rumor kept going around
that the photograph had been staged.

1229
01:42:49,732 --> 01:42:51,063
I remember your dad telling them

1230
01:42:51,133 --> 01:42:53,067
that he wished he'd known
he was having his picture taken

1231
01:42:53,135 --> 01:42:55,603
because he would've ducked
the hell out of it.

1232
01:42:55,671 --> 01:42:58,367
Whose idea was it?
Who wanted to stage the thing?

1233
01:42:58,441 --> 01:42:59,931
Come on, it was you?

1234
01:43:00,009 --> 01:43:03,137
Was there truth to the rumor
that that picture was staged, Doc?

1235
01:43:03,212 --> 01:43:05,680
- Come on! Doc?
- Can you answer that?

1236
01:43:07,817 --> 01:43:12,151
I remember when your dad got shot.
All hell was busting loose.

1237
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:14,246
People back home saw that picture

1238
01:43:14,323 --> 01:43:18,054
and thought it was over
when we took Suribachi.

1239
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:21,228
We wished.

1240
01:43:21,964 --> 01:43:24,558
Anyways, we're pinned down.

1241
01:43:24,633 --> 01:43:27,431
Mortars, shells, machine guns.

1242
01:43:28,504 --> 01:43:31,302
Fire coming from
every which direction, right?

1243
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:35,905
And we hear somebody call,
"Corpsman down."

1244
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,041
Corpsman down!

1245
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:49,917
Blood was spurting out of his throat,
and Doc was doing everything he could.

1246
01:43:52,194 --> 01:43:54,321
And the Corpsman looks up at him

1247
01:43:55,765 --> 01:43:59,132
and he knows what this means,
to be shot in the neck.

1248
01:44:00,136 --> 01:44:02,764
He knows he's dying, you can see that.

1249
01:44:03,272 --> 01:44:04,569
But still

1250
01:44:06,042 --> 01:44:10,172
in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc
to save his life.

1251
01:44:16,485 --> 01:44:18,009
And Doc can't.

1252
01:44:55,925 --> 01:44:58,519
- You okay, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1253
01:44:59,795 --> 01:45:02,958
- Yeah, you look fine.
- I'm okay.

1254
01:45:03,032 --> 01:45:06,399
Keep down, all right?
I'm gonna go get a stretcher.

1255
01:45:06,469 --> 01:45:07,561
Okay.

1256
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:17,208
Corpsman. Corpsman!

1257
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:20,375
For God sake, Corpsman!

1258
01:45:40,136 --> 01:45:41,398
Corpsman?

1259
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:44,828
Corpsman.

1260
01:45:46,675 --> 01:45:48,472
Incoming!

1261
01:45:52,448 --> 01:45:53,779
Let me see.

1262
01:45:56,919 --> 01:45:59,979
It's not that bad.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

1263
01:46:00,055 --> 01:46:02,080
Just stay with me. Look at me.

1264
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:06,851
Took us a half-hour to find your dad.
He could've bled to death.

1265
01:46:06,929 --> 01:46:08,260
Coming down.

1266
01:46:15,237 --> 01:46:16,431
Thanks.

1267
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:25,279
Vets'll tell you about being hit
but not wanting to leave their buddies.

1268
01:46:26,081 --> 01:46:27,708
Usually, they're lying.

1269
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:31,250
You'll take any excuse
to get out of there.

1270
01:46:32,321 --> 01:46:33,845
But it happens.

1271
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:38,993
You get the feeling
you're letting them down.

1272
01:46:40,296 --> 01:46:42,821
I could see that in your dad's face.

1273
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,792
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.

1274
01:46:49,505 --> 01:46:51,496
But he didn't want to leave us.

1275
01:46:53,642 --> 01:46:56,133
Now, he was a hell of a good man,
your dad.

1276
01:46:59,615 --> 01:47:00,707
Yeah.

1277
01:47:01,217 --> 01:47:05,244
While we were sitting there
on the beach, we heard this great roar.

1278
01:47:05,321 --> 01:47:06,788
And we looked up.

1279
01:47:12,428 --> 01:47:16,023
That was the first
of thousands of landings on lwo.

1280
01:47:16,098 --> 01:47:17,895
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

1281
01:47:18,534 --> 01:47:20,092
How about that.

1282
01:47:26,308 --> 01:47:27,832
I'm gonna head back, all right?

1283
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,070
Good luck.

1284
01:47:32,214 --> 01:47:34,808
That island saved a lot of lives.

1285
01:47:38,454 --> 01:47:40,217
A lot of lives.

1286
01:47:44,426 --> 01:47:46,587
I don't know what else to tell you.

1287
01:47:55,471 --> 01:47:59,100
After the bond tour
my dad finally got his operation.

1288
01:48:10,552 --> 01:48:13,578
By the time he got home
the war was over.

1289
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,493
First thing he did
was ask my mom to marry him.

1290
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,664
Ira tried to get on with his life
and put it all behind him.

1291
01:48:29,405 --> 01:48:31,805
Thank you for having me here today.

1292
01:48:32,841 --> 01:48:37,710
It's an honor to be in front of
such a strong people.

1293
01:48:41,283 --> 01:48:42,944
Because of the war

1294
01:48:44,553 --> 01:48:47,920
white men will understand Indians
a lot better.

1295
01:48:51,427 --> 01:48:53,952
And it's going to be a better world.

1296
01:49:14,083 --> 01:49:16,449
But life had other plans for him.

1297
01:49:29,998 --> 01:49:32,694
You're... You're him, aren't you?

1298
01:49:32,768 --> 01:49:34,429
You're the hero, right?

1299
01:49:38,374 --> 01:49:41,537
Great. All right, kids,
go get your picture taken.

1300
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:46,138
Oh, that's great. That's great.

1301
01:49:46,215 --> 01:49:47,842
All right, now say cheese.

1302
01:49:47,916 --> 01:49:49,178
Cheese!

1303
01:49:49,718 --> 01:49:53,620
That's great! Okay.
Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.

1304
01:49:54,056 --> 01:49:56,286
- Come on.
- That's a hero, kids.

1305
01:50:07,636 --> 01:50:11,595
Hero, lift this basket, will you?
It's too heavy for me.

1306
01:50:37,065 --> 01:50:40,466
Rene tried to take advantage of those
offers he'd received on the bond tour.

1307
01:50:40,536 --> 01:50:44,370
Yes. G-A-G-N-O-N.

1308
01:50:45,541 --> 01:50:48,942
Right. Pronounced Rene. Rene, yes.

1309
01:50:49,978 --> 01:50:54,312
- Okay, I actually called last week.
- Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.

1310
01:50:55,017 --> 01:50:58,953
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.

1311
01:50:59,588 --> 01:51:01,715
Okay. All right.

1312
01:51:02,858 --> 01:51:03,950
Thank you.

1313
01:51:04,526 --> 01:51:06,721
But he was yesterday's hero.

1314
01:51:06,795 --> 01:51:10,060
He even applied for a job
at the local police station.

1315
01:51:12,234 --> 01:51:14,600
They said he wasrt qualified.

1316
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,639
After working the factory with Pauline
he tried a few things

1317
01:51:17,706 --> 01:51:20,368
but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.

1318
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:23,969
But Ira...

1319
01:51:24,046 --> 01:51:26,480
Ira! You got a visitor.

1320
01:51:29,852 --> 01:51:31,820
Ira always made the news.

1321
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,524
I could never find out why he did it,
but one day Ira just took off.

1322
01:52:25,707 --> 01:52:29,165
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles

1323
01:52:29,244 --> 01:52:31,144
from Arizona to Texas.

1324
01:52:34,783 --> 01:52:38,082
He found Harlon Block's father
working his field.

1325
01:52:38,153 --> 01:52:42,419
His wife, Belle, had left him
soon after they discovered Harlon died.

1326
01:52:43,258 --> 01:52:46,785
She never forgave him
for letting her son go off to war.

1327
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,905
And Ira told him the truth,

1328
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,347
that it had been his son
who raised the flag with them,

1329
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,145
his son in the photograph.

1330
01:53:16,925 --> 01:53:19,621
And then
he just turned and walked away.

1331
01:53:20,963 --> 01:53:23,830
Though the flag-raising
meant nothing to him,

1332
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:27,562
he somehow knew
it would mean everything to them.

1333
01:53:43,752 --> 01:53:45,481
Thanks for calling.

1334
01:53:49,591 --> 01:53:51,786
Just as Belle knew all along.

1335
01:54:01,269 --> 01:54:03,066
The press soon found out

1336
01:54:03,138 --> 01:54:07,097
and called Hank's mom with the news
that it wasrt her son after all.

1337
01:54:20,355 --> 01:54:22,016
The last time they all saw each other

1338
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:25,491
was at the unveiling
of the Marine Corps War Memorial.

1339
01:54:27,029 --> 01:54:30,556
And even though he planted
the first flag above lwo Jima,

1340
01:54:30,632 --> 01:54:33,032
Hank's mother and father
werert invited.

1341
01:55:10,405 --> 01:55:11,463
Ira.

1342
01:55:24,252 --> 01:55:25,981
It's good to see you, Ira.

1343
01:55:34,563 --> 01:55:36,394
Hell of a statue.

1344
01:55:49,578 --> 01:55:52,570
It wasrt long after that
that they found Ira.

1345
01:55:53,048 --> 01:55:57,144
The papers said he died of exposure.
There was no autopsy.

1346
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:13,560
It was about that same time

1347
01:56:13,635 --> 01:56:16,160
when my father got in his car
early one morning

1348
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:18,672
telling my mom he had something to do.

1349
01:56:25,447 --> 01:56:29,850
He drove to a town on the other side
of Wisconsin where lggy's mom lived.

1350
01:56:39,895 --> 01:56:42,090
Ever since
she heard the news about her son

1351
01:56:42,164 --> 01:56:46,191
she'd been trying to find out
how he died, and no one would tell her.

1352
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:50,995
I never found out what he told her,

1353
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:54,303
but I can pretty much guarantee
it wasrt the truth.

1354
01:56:55,844 --> 01:56:58,278
My mother would ask him
what was troubling him.

1355
01:56:58,346 --> 01:56:59,938
He would never say.

1356
01:57:07,789 --> 01:57:10,758
And every year,
as it got close to Memorial Day,

1357
01:57:10,826 --> 01:57:14,660
the reporters would start calling
asking to interview my father.

1358
01:57:15,764 --> 01:57:18,426
No, I'm sorry. He's fishing in Canada.

1359
01:57:19,301 --> 01:57:21,701
We were always instructed
to say the same thing.

1360
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:23,704
Okay. Thanks.

1361
01:57:27,042 --> 01:57:29,067
When Mr. McCandless retired,

1362
01:57:29,144 --> 01:57:32,807
my father bought the funeral home
where he'd worked since coming home.

1363
01:57:32,881 --> 01:57:36,908
He spent the rest of his life running
the business and raising his family.

1364
01:58:25,033 --> 01:58:28,264
He never spoke about the war
or about the flag-raising,

1365
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:30,961
never told us anything.

1366
01:58:31,306 --> 01:58:35,140
The first time I heard any
of these stories was after he died.

1367
01:58:52,127 --> 01:58:55,096
Where is he? Oh, God.

1368
01:58:57,299 --> 01:58:58,789
He's not here, Dad.

1369
01:58:59,868 --> 01:59:00,960
He died.

1370
01:59:03,204 --> 01:59:04,933
Who? Who died?

1371
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:07,433
Lggy.

1372
01:59:09,511 --> 01:59:10,603
Iggy.

1373
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:15,572
Christ, poor lggy.

1374
01:59:16,584 --> 01:59:19,052
I hadrt thought of him for years.

1375
01:59:21,022 --> 01:59:23,388
How do you know about lggy?

1376
01:59:23,925 --> 01:59:27,417
You were calling for him,
when you collapsed.

1377
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,695
I wasrt looking for lggy.

1378
01:59:36,805 --> 01:59:38,670
I was looking for you.

1379
01:59:40,942 --> 01:59:42,432
I wanted to...

1380
01:59:45,246 --> 01:59:49,376
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry I wasrt a better father.

1381
01:59:50,852 --> 01:59:52,581
Talked to you more.

1382
01:59:54,055 --> 01:59:55,317
I just...

1383
01:59:59,394 --> 02:00:00,725
I'm sorry.

1384
02:00:02,831 --> 02:00:03,991
Sorry?

1385
02:00:06,134 --> 02:00:08,932
You were the best father
a man could have.

1386
02:00:18,813 --> 02:00:22,681
Did I ever tell you
they took us swimming?

1387
02:00:27,122 --> 02:00:28,612
No, Dad.

1388
02:00:30,191 --> 02:00:34,787
After we planted the flag,
we came down off the mountain

1389
02:00:35,897 --> 02:00:37,694
and they let us swim.

1390
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:41,725
It was the funniest thing.

1391
02:00:42,637 --> 02:00:44,366
All this fighting

1392
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:49,276
and we were jumping around
in the water like kids.

1393
02:00:52,514 --> 02:00:55,677
That's the way I remember lggy now.

1394
02:01:32,253 --> 02:01:35,984
I finally came to the conclusion
that maybe he was right.

1395
02:01:36,057 --> 02:01:39,288
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.

1396
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,954
Maybe there are just people
like my dad.

1397
02:01:43,164 --> 02:01:44,654
I finally came to understand

1398
02:01:44,732 --> 02:01:48,168
why they were so uncomfortable
being called heroes.

1399
02:01:48,937 --> 02:01:52,737
Heroes are something we create,
something we need.

1400
02:01:57,078 --> 02:02:01,378
It's a way for us to understand
what is almost incomprehensible,

1401
02:02:01,449 --> 02:02:04,680
how people could sacrifice
so much for us.

1402
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,584
But for my dad and these men,

1403
02:02:07,655 --> 02:02:10,886
the risks they took,
the wounds they suffered,

1404
02:02:10,959 --> 02:02:13,154
they did that for their buddies.

1405
02:02:13,661 --> 02:02:17,461
They may have fought for their country,
but they died for their friends.

1406
02:02:17,532 --> 02:02:20,296
For the man in front,
for the man beside them.

1407
02:02:21,603 --> 02:02:24,663
And if we wish to truly honor these men,

1408
02:02:24,739 --> 02:02:27,708
we should remember them
the way they really were,

1409
02:02:27,775 --> 02:02:30,107
the way my dad remembered them.

1410
02:03:10,084 --> 02:03:11,517
Come on, Doc!
