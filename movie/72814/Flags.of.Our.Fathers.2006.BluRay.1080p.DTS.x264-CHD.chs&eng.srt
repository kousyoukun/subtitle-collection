1
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:57,454
片名：父辈的旗帜

2
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,934
医务兵！
Corpsman!

3
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,244
医务兵！
Corpsman!

4
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:21,314
医务兵！
Corpsman!

5
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,224
看在上帝份上！医务兵！
For God sakes! Corpsman!

6
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:33,404
医务兵！
Corpsman!

7
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,914
医务兵！
Corpsman!

8
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:54,584
亲爱的  怎么了？
Honey, what's wrong?

9
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:14,274
每个傻蛋都自以为明白战争 是怎么回事
Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.

10
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:17,914
尤其是那些没亲身体验过的
Especially those who've never been in one.

11
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:21,484
我们喜欢美好而简单的事物
We like things nice and simple,

12
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:25,884
善良和邪恶  英雄和恶棍
good and evil, heroes and villains.

13
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,784
很多人两者兼具
There's always plenty of both.

14
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:34,124
大多时候 他们不同我们所想象
Most of the time, they are not who we think they are.

15
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,444
他在哪？
Where is he?

16
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,644
他在哪？
Where is he?

17
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,324
在哪… 他在哪？他在哪？
Where... Where is he? Where is he?

18
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,484
布莱德利先生？
Mr. Bradley?

19
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,234
布莱德利先生？你还好么?
Mr. B? You okay?

20
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,794
他在哪？谁在哪？
Where is he? Where is who?

21
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:17,534
他在哪？他去哪里了？ 在哪…他在哪？
Where is he? Where did he go? Where... Where is he?

22
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,844
好 就呆在这儿 好么
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

23
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:22,774
我去叫救护车 会没事的
I'm gonna call an ambulance. It'll be okay.

24
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,144
他在哪？
Where is he?

25
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:33,844
很多我认识的人不愿说 过去的事情
Most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.

26
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,294
可能是因为他们正在试图忘掉 那些事
Probably 'cause they're still trying to forget about it.

27
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,694
他们确实不认为自己是英雄
They certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.

28
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:47,334
他们死去  没有鲜花和掌声
They died without glory.

29
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:50,104
也没能留下照片
Nobody has taken their pictures.

30
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:53,234
只有他们的战友知道 他们做了些什么
Only their buddies knew what they did.

31
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,244
我告诉大家说他们是为国捐躯的
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.

32
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,484
其实是不是我也不确定
I'm not sure that was it.

33
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,984
那天照了很多照片
Now, there were plenty other photos taken that day,

34
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,684
但没人想再多看一眼
but none anybody wanted to see.

35
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,054
我们在战争中的所见所闻 所作所为
What we see and do in war,

36
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,714
之残酷  是不可思议的
the cruelty, is unbelievable.

37
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:16,034
但我们总得找出点意义来
But somehow we gotta make some sense of it.

38
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,694
这样 我们就需要一个浅显的事实
To do that, we need a easy to understand truth

39
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,934
还有一些文字
and damn few words.

40
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,804
胶片毁了
Film's ruined.

41
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:29,244
我不知道 这一卷看起来是完好的
I don't know. This one looks all right.

42
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,054
如果你能照下一张相片
And if you can get a picture...

43
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:44,424
这年头 一张照片就能影响战争结局
Now, the right picture can win or lose a war.

44
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,964
你肯定想看看这个
You're gonna want to see this.

45
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,434
看看越南吧
Look at Vietnam.

46
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:51,864
那张南越军官
The picture of that South Vietnamese officer

47
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:56,134
一枪把那家伙打了个脑浆迸裂 嘣！
blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head, whammo!

48
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,664
完了
That was it.

49
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:00,944
战争就输了
The war was lost.

50
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,114
我们当时只是死撑着 装作还没输罢了
We just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.

51
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:11,384
那天还照了很多其他的照片 大多数都没什么新意
Took a lot of other pictures that day. None of them made a difference.

52
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:15,954
谢谢
Thanks. Appreciate it.

53
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,464
听上去很荒诞  不过还就是发生了
Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.

54
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,074
当时国家快破产了
Country was bankrupt.

55
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:35,844
人们冷嘲热讽  厌倦战争
People were becoming cynical and tired of war.

56
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,224
老天啊 那是哈伦
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!

57
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,354
在哪?
Where?

58
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:57,394
就在这 正在插旗子这个就是你哥哥
Right there. Planting that flag, that's your brother.

59
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,764
妈 你不就看见了个后背吗
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

60
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,744
那是他的背 我一点点把他喂大的 我知道我儿子
And that's his. I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.

61
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,634
就是他  叫你爸来
That's him. Go get your father.

62
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,944
爸  妈说她在报纸上看见 哈伦的屁股啦
Daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.

63
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,674
管好你的嘴巴  小年轻
You watch your mouth, young man.

64
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,024
谢谢
Thank you.

65
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:35,104
仅仅一张照片  让形势出现逆转
One photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.

66
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:38,704
它上了各大报纸的头条
It's on the front page of every major paper.

67
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,944
超过200家报社要求 刊登这张照片
Over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.

68
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:46,814
我们可能得把他们找出来
I think we might have found it.

69
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:38,764
医务兵！
Corpsman!

70
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:41,234
医务兵！
Corpsman!

71
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,974
医务兵！
Corpsman!

72
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:49,074
我去把他弄过来 不行 你不能去
I gotta go get him. Oh, no, you don't.

73
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,514
伊基  我必须去
Iggy, I gotta go.

74
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,704
我的看法正好相反
I have a whole different theory.

75
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:54,654
他那么需要救护 他会来找我们的
He wants medical attention bad enough, he'll come to us.

76
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,984
闭上嘴乖乖趴那儿别动 你个婊子养的大懒蛋
Shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!

77
00:07:58,524 --> 00:07:59,994
照明弹一灭我就去
As soon as that flare goes out.

78
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,614
废话 那好 我跟你去 不
Crap. Okay, well, I'll go with you. No.

79
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:03,994
你想把我丢在这里么
You're actually gonna leave me here?

80
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:07,424
我马上回来 你继续射击  我得马上走
I'll be right back, just shoot some people. I gotta go.

81
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:21,844
老天
Oh, God.

82
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,074
没事 没事的
Okay, it's okay.

83
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,414
别碰伤口 别碰伤口
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.

84
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,474
把手放那边 我来 我做
Get your hands out of there. Let me do that. I'll do it, okay?

85
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,044
别看 头扭过去 眼睛看着我
Don't look. Keep your head back. Keep your eyes on me.

86
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:33,924
好的 看着我 我会解决的 我会治好你的
All right, look at me. I'll get it. I'll take care of it.

87
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,124
我们现在给你缠绷带 我们来照顾你
We'll get this bandage on you. We'll get you taken care of.

88
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:39,354
我们把你运到后方去 好么
And we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?

89
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,554
你会没事的
Look, you're gonna be fine.

90
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,064
没事了
It's okay.

91
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,664
我来 我来
I'll do that. I'll do that.

92
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:48,964
好 用力压住
Here, put some pressure on that.

93
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:51,034
手放上面 用力加压
Put your hands on top and put some pressure on it.

94
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:53,074
头扭过去  保持呼吸
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

95
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,574
看着我 好么 只要你看着…
Keep looking at me, all right? Just keep looking at...

96
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,374
医生
Doc.

97
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,084
救我
Help me.

98
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,824
救我
Help me.

99
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,774
好的  没事
All right. Okay.

100
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,884
（注射吗啡）感觉怎么样
How's that feel?

101
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:40,624
感觉不错 是么？好的
It feels good. It does? All right.

102
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,424
好 好的
Good. All right.

103
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:46,054
我去找担架把你抬下去 我马上回来
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get you down to the beach. I'll be right back.

104
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,564
我没事
I'm all right.

105
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,724
去帮其他伤员吧
Go and help someone who's hurt.

106
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:53,664
好的 坚持住
All right. Hold on there.

107
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,714
他去哪了？ 谁？
Where'd he go? Who?

108
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,084
刚才在这里的那个 伊基 他去哪了？
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski. Where did he go?

109
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,814
你跳错坑了吧 我才没有跳错坑
I think you jumped in the wrong hole. I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

110
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:15,654
刚刚他还在这里 现在他哪去了？
He was right here, now where the hell is he?

111
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,624
伊基！
Iggy!

112
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:20,754
伊基！
Iggy!

113
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:23,134
你闭嘴吧  你想让全岛的日本人 都朝我们开火么
You shut up. You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?

114
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,634
伊基！
Iggy!

115
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:42,754
塔拉瓦营地  1944年12月


116
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,554
我靠
Holy shit.

117
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,454
他们指望我们来爬这个？
They expect us to climb this?

118
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:56,354
应该差不多吧
Or something just like it.

119
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,204
那 你觉得 他们想把我们 送到什么地方去？
So, where you think they're sending us?

120
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:08,904
好像是沙漠吧  富兰克林
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

121
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:11,644
这可说不通啊
Well, that makes no sense at all.

122
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,704
这就叫军事心理学
Well, it's just military psychology.

123
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:16,614
你要去沙漠执行任务的话 他们就在火山上训练你
They always train you for the desert on a volcano.

124
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,724
你这是开玩笑的吧
Now you're just having fun with me.

125
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,894
哈伦 带你的人到右边去
Harlon, take your men right.

126
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,554
注意搜索贝都因人 是 长官
Watch for Bedouins. Yes, sir.

127
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,624
什么叫贝都因人？ 就是骑骆驼的人
What's a Bedouin? It's a guy with a camel.

128
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,834
老天爷 原来我们还真有可能到沙漠去
Well, Jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.

129
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:39,004
你看  你把头盔向右歪着戴 那要是子弹从左边来呢？
Now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?

130
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:43,374
子弹才不会从左边来 你认识左撇子日本人么？
Bullets don't come from the left. You know any left-handed Japs?

131
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,144
你这么干就跟穿着鞋去 洗澡一样蠢
That makes about as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.

132
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,384
你连自己为什么这么做 都不知道 是不是？
You don't even know why you do it, do you?

133
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,684
我不告诉你就代表我不知道么？
'Cause I don't tell you mean I don't know?

134
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,814
你不就是模仿麦克么
You do it 'cause Mike does it.

135
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,814
我问他去
I'll ask him.

136
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,354
你在家也理发么？
So you cut hair back home?

137
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,524
有时候吧
Some.

138
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,364
医生 你是专业理发师 对吧？
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

139
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,764
不是 就学了一点儿
No, I just studied it a little.

140
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,474
不是正规学校学的？
But not in barber school?

141
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,064
不是啊
Nope.

142
00:12:11,274 --> 00:12:13,604
糟糕 让我猜猜 海因斯要赢
Gosh. Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

143
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,044
酋长西亭布尔可不是我害死的啊
Chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death,


144
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:17,044
酋长 - 艾拉 海因斯的昵称 西亭布尔 - 北美苏人印弟安人首领

145
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:19,674
所以你就别拿我出气了
so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.

146
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,514
哪儿跟哪儿的事啊 皮马人当时可是站在白人一边的
Different tribe. The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.


147
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,514
皮马人 - 北美印第安人的一个部族

148
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:26,074
现在看来真有远见 就是有远见
See, now that's smart. That is smart.

149
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,284
是啊 所以现在我们族人 比较好过
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

150
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,984
大家好运
Good luck, fellas.

151
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,964
嘿 晚安 林勃
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

152
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,934
死人 他给死人理发
Dead bodies. He cuts hair on dead bodies.

153
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,824
这算什么？连我都知道
What? Even I knew that.

154
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,174
谁还玩牌？ 我来 我也来
Who's in? Oh, I'm in. I'm in.

155
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:48,404
老老实实坐着不动 你就能省很多劲了
It must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.

156
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,074
确实 是啊
There's that. Yeah.

157
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,544
知道我一直在想什么么?
You know what I been thinking?

158
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:55,554
他们总说 让我们大家成为好兄弟
Well, they been telling us we need to buddy up

159
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,184
我觉得我们就可以 做个兄弟
and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.

160
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,814
你怎么知道我们会是好兄弟
And how do you figure that?

161
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:02,884
嗯 因为 我们共同点很多
Well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.

162
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:07,094
那你到底为什么给死人剪头呢？
So, why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?

163
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,694
我在一家殡仪馆当学徒
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

164
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:14,304
你把这个告诉过很多人么？
You tell a lot of people that?

165
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,134
你进陆战队 就是因为它的制服最帅？
You actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?

166
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,304
想成英雄的话 起码得先看起来像个英雄吧
No sense being a hero if you don't look like one.

167
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,674
Ｊ
Ｊ Jacks.

168
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:28,544
Ｑ
Ｑ Queens.

169
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:29,884
靠
Shit.

170
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,084
你服役期间就是玩玩牌么 酋长？
Do anything on that reservation but play cards, Chief?

171
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:37,564
都给我听好了 可怜的陆战队员们！
All right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!

172
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,724
明天我们练习登陆
We practice going over the side tomorrow

173
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,284
也就是说我们不用在这小地方 再呆下去了
which means we ain't long for this piece of rock.

174
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,834
好
All right!

175
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:47,304
还有个事 自慰专用纸没配齐的人
One more thing, any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order

176
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:49,704
明天晚上之前最好去申请 否则他就不能出任务
better get them signed by tomorrow night or he ain't going overseas.

177
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,864
我已经有了 我也有了
I got mine already. Oh, yeah. I'm square.

178
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,464
等等 为什么我现在才知道？
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

179
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:57,204
那你活该倒霉  富兰克林 我好话不说第二遍
That's horseshit, Franklin. I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.

180
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,474
不对啊 我怎么没听说过 自慰专用纸的事呢？
No, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.

181
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:02,524
听说最近正闹短缺呢
Heard they were running short.

182
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:06,584
好啊 大家都不告诉我是吧 行啊你们
You know, nobody tells me nothing. That's real nice, guys.

183
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,784
这样 你赶紧到记录员那去一趟
All right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records.

184
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,694
可能他还有发剩下的
Maybe he got some more left.

185
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,264
烟留下  牌我替你接着打 谢谢啊 麦克
Leave your smokes. I'll play for you. Thanks, Mike.

186
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:17,594
听好 到时候他肯定会说你白痴 你就表现的男人一点 明白？
Listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?

187
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,634
牢牢记住  一定得签了字再走
Just do not leave without signing them.

188
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:22,134
非常感谢 中士. 去吧
I appreciate it, Sergeant. You got it.

189
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,904
你头发怎么搞的 瑞尼？
What the hell happened to your hair, Rene?

190
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,544
跟他妈尸体一样
Look like a goddamn corpse.

191
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,554
随时保持三个地方和绳索 连在一块儿
Three points of contact on that rope at all times.

192
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,724
再来四个 爬下去
Next four. Over the side.

193
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,524
走 别停下
Let's go. Keep moving.

194
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:50,254
再来四个 爬下去
Next four, over the side.

195
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,234
眼睛看着 自己下面那个人
Just keep your eye on the guy below you.

196
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,634
那就够了
That's all you gotta look at.

197
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,764
看着我 医生 看着我
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

198
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:59,474
随时保持三个地方和绳索 连在一块儿
Keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.

199
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,974
看 没什么大不了的
You see? No big thing.

200
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:07,814
一步一步下 手抓紧绳子
Just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.

201
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:10,324
记住 下到船上以后就松手
Remember, once you're in the boat move away from the rope.

202
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:13,384
随时保持三个地方和绳索 连在一块儿就行
Just make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.

203
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,584
交给我！
I got him!

204
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:16,354
好 把那人捞上来
All right, get that man out of the water.

205
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,894
帮个忙
Give me a hand.

206
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,124
抓住他背包
Grab his pack.

207
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,294
别担心他 医生
Don't worry about him, Doc.

208
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,524
好了 多可笑 大家继续
All right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving!

209
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:24,934
他会没事的
He'll be fine.

210
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,764
我们的目标 就是某小岛
Our target, Island X,

211
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:33,174
是个又臭又丑又脏的小岛 叫硫磺岛
is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.

212
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,174
就是“硫磺之岛”的意思 因为硫磺味儿才得的名
It means "Sulfur Island," which accounts for the smell.

213
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,484
我觉得 看起来就像是块 烧焦了的猪排
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.

214
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,154
狂轰滥炸20天之后
After 20 straight days of bombing

215
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,584
岛上已经寸草不生了
you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it.

216
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,184
可不怎么好看
It wasn't that pretty to start with.

217
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,424
上校？
Captain?

218
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:54,094
硫磺岛只有5.5英里长 2.5英里宽
Lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long, two-and-a-half wide.

219
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:57,294
在这里有个突起 叫做折钵山
There's a lump down at the bottom. That's Mount Suribachi.

220
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,464
在你们面前的这份地图里 这个岛是白色的
On the maps in front of you the island is white.

221
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,094
实际情况不是这样
Not much of it.

222
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,674
黑点代表 已知的敌人炮位
The black dots represent known enemy emplacements.

223
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,104
岸防炮 高平两用炮
Coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual-purpose guns,

224
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,664
构成了火炮防线
covered artillery emplacements.

225
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,944
有散兵壕 散兵坑 反坦克炮
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns

226
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:14,884
机枪 碉堡 暗堡 还有伪装好的其他建筑
machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.

227
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,784
我看不到兵营或者是其他建筑
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.

228
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,324
对
That's right.

229
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,254
我们还不知道原因
And we still don't know why.

230
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,124
这可不是一个寻常的小岛
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

231
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:28,524
这可不是塔拉瓦岛 关岛 提尼安岛 或者塞班岛
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.

232
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,764
这里是日本人的地盘 是他们的神圣领土
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

233
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,034
一万两千名日本守军 防守8平方英里
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.

234
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,594
他们可不会礼貌地离开 先生们
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

235
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,764
说服他们离开得靠我们
It's up to us to convince them.

236
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:43,114
28连会在绿滩登陆
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

237
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:46,204
8连会在这里登陆支援
The 8th Ammo Company will land here to re-supply.

238
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,254
折钵山上的炮位是最大的麻烦
The Suribachi's guns are the biggest problem.

239
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,014
它的射程可以覆盖全岛
They can hit any point on the island.

240
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,454
拿不下那里我们就全完
We're sitting ducks until we take them out.

241
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:54,084
那是我们的份内事
That's our job.

242
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:58,154
我们奔袭小岛 直取敌巢 一击致命
We cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.

243
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,784
我们拿下那座山
And we take that mountain.

244
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,524
我们拿下那座山 就拿掉了他们的大炮
We take that mountain, we take their big guns.

245
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,324
就拿掉了他们的眼珠
We take their eyes.

246
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,574
好 进入航路 跟着我
Okay, I'm heading in. Follow me.

247
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:22,274
咱们给陆战队好好演一场
Let's put a good show on for the Marines.

248
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,514
拉近 拉近甲板
Close it up. Take it right down to the deck.

249
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,174
好样的！
Yeah, boys!

250
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,474
左舷有人落水！
Man overboard portside!

251
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:57,684
看到他没有？
See him?

252
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,624
扔根绳子过来！
Throw me a line!

253
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,324
他在那
He's right there.

254
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,654
他在哪？ 往远处看 远处
Where is he? Watch out, watch out, watch out.

255
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,724
夏威夷在那边呢！
Hawaii's that way!

256
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:15,724
接着踩水 马克 等我们回来的时候接你！
Just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!

257
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,864
坚持一会儿 他们会放救生艇 下去的
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

258
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,634
他们不会停的
They're not gonna stop.

259
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:22,804
什么？
What?

260
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:26,284
谁都不会停的  停不下来了
None of them are. They can't.

261
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,594
“不抛弃每个人”这口号算完了
So much for "No man left behind."

262
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:44,594
长官 进来
Sir. Come on in.

263
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:46,994
我想做点人事变动
Look, I've had to make a few other changes.

264
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,974
我准备提你当排长
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.

265
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,304
谢谢 长官 我很感激 不必
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. You bet.

266
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:58,214
问题是  我已经告诉他们 我会一直陪在他们身边的
Trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.

267
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,444
你这是在演詹姆斯・卡格尼那出戏是吧？
That your James Cagney impersonation?

268
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,384
我听过更好的
'Cause I've heard better.

269
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:05,084
我会多加练习的
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

270
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:07,924
听着 你又不是新手
Look, this isn't your first time through this.

271
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,924
你不必证明什么 是的 长官
You don't need to prove anything. No, sir.

272
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,164
你不是最好的
You're not the best sergeant I've ever had,

273
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,224
只是活着的人里面最好的
you're just the best one that's still walking.

274
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:18,094
布劳克人不错 是 长官 确实如此
Block's a good man. Yes, sir, he is.

275
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:20,334
大家都知道他 他进房间都不用打招呼
The men know him, he can step right in.

276
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:25,434
这件事前前后后我都想过了
You know, I have actually thought this through.

277
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,504
做排长可以让你更安全
Platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.

278
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,044
但是我已经承诺过了 长官
I already gave them my word, sir.

279
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:33,014
我还承诺过我会把他们 全都带回家见妈妈
I told them I'd bring them all home to their mothers

280
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:36,014
也就是说 我对他们中间的一半人都撒谎了 我不能再对另一半人撒谎
which means I already lied to half of them. Can't lie to the rest.

281
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,244
那他们怎么样？ 他们会没事的
How are your men? They'll do fine.

282
00:19:43,424 --> 00:19:45,224
盖格南可能是个例外
Except maybe Gagnon.

283
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,394
就是那个像蒂龙・鲍尔的家伙？
Our own Tyrone Power?

284
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:53,204
是 长官 他人不坏 但是确实上不了前线
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.

285
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,034
那我就让他当通信兵吧
I'll use him as a runner.

286
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,774
好的 谢谢 长官
All right. Thank you, sir.

287
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:01,504
那你出去吧
Now get out of here.

288
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:11,254
听到好消息了么 医生？ 我们会第一波登陆的
Hear the good news, Doc? We're going in with the first waves.

289
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:14,384
嘿 你敢再干一次 我就把你脑袋拧下来
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!

290
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,154
你个方脑袋
Fucking dominoes.

291
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:20,724
伊基 你听到过坏消息么？
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?

292
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,424
医生 第一批下船作战
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

293
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,594
就是说我们不用再爬下船去了
Means we don't go over the side of the ship.

294
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,434
我们只要跳上车 他们就把我们送过去了
We hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.

295
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,734
我靠 那不是好消息么
Oh, shit, that is good news.

296
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:32,704
你才明白啊？我就说嘛
You see? What'd I tell you?

297
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,844
怎么回事？
What's going on?

298
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,174
快看
Look at that.

299
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:11,144
我们正痛宰他们呢
We're killing them!

300
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,044
我们正痛宰他们呢  医生
We're killing them, Doc.

301
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:42,374
说好是10天的炮火准备
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

302
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:45,614
现在你只给我3天 还说你已经尽力了？
You're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?

303
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:48,884
我不管！ 炮火准备少于 10天的话
I don't give a shit! My men hit that beach with less than 10

304
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,714
就等着我用棺材把他们送回家吧
and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!

305
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,014
好啊  我算是明白了
Yeah, I know exactly why.

306
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,894
原来是海军里那些家里有 点坛坛罐罐的人
Because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest

307
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,954
想把我们扔在这儿 自己去日本
wants to offload us here and sail to Japan

308
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,334
去看大结局  对吧？
so they can be there for the big finish,

309
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:08,504
然后跟他们的孩子们说 他们自己就把天皇活捉了 是吧？
tell their kids they captured the Emperor all by themselves.

310
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:12,604
我们不拿下这个小破岛 你们就永远去不了日本！
Well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece of shit island!

311
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,174
这些小岛就是我们眼里的刺！
These little pricks are dug in!

312
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:22,914
很好 万分感谢 吉姆 三天的时间真是太他妈好了
Okay, appreciate that, Jim. Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

313
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,154
磨刀么？
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

314
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:32,994
我的没问题
I'm okay.

315
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:35,664
磨刀么？
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

316
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,604
老天 伊基 让我自己呆会儿行不？
Jesus, Iggy, just leave me alone, all right?

317
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,564
你们呢? 匕首? 刺刀? 磨一下？
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet? Kick in the ass?

318
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:46,004
你的呢 医生？ 磨磨刀？
How about you, Doc? Sharpen your knife?

319
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,804
我都磨了三遍了
You sharpened it three times already.

320
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,674
那就再让我给你磨磨
Well, then I better make sure I didn't nick it.

321
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,614
好人啊 医生
Good man, Doc.

322
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:00,684
嘿 医生 嗯
Hey, Doc. Yeah.

323
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:06,214
登陆以后 别太张扬你身上 这些急救包
When we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.

324
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,394
那边有些神枪手 专门打这样的人
They got sharpshooters that are trained to look for them.

325
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,494
他们知道 如果他们干掉一个医务兵
And they know that if they take out a corpsman

326
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,034
好多士兵就会缺乏救助而死 明白么？
another dozen Marines will die unattended. All right?

327
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:14,434
好的 麦克
Okay, Mike.

328
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:22,634
好 就停在这儿
Yeah, right there.

329
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,904
把门关上  看在上帝份上
Close the damn door. For God's sake.

330
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:58,104
哈 说得好像那样就没事了一样
Yeah, like that's gonna help.

331
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:06,254
那是你女朋友么 酋长？
That your girlfriend, Chief?

332
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:10,854
肯定是个超级印第安美女
Bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.

333
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:14,454
你肯定想你女朋友 还有你们温暖的小窝棚了
Bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.

看看他们对犯人都做了些什么
It's what they do to prisoners,

337
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,024
这还算是好的 老天
at least the lucky ones. Jesus.

338
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:43,894
牛仔 我要是你 才不会举白旗呢
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.

339
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:48,484
（日方广播）可怜的陆战队员们 无缘无故  离家千里
Poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.

340
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:53,294
想想家中苦苦期盼的女友…
Think of your girls back home, waiting for you.

341
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:56,364
但女孩孤身一人  怎能熬过 漫漫长夜
But a girl cannot stay home every night.

342
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,604
想一想 她们今晚会和谁同床共枕？
So who do you think they're with tonight?

343
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:05,344
她会让他吻她么？ 他会在你的葬礼上去安慰她么？
And will she let him kiss her? And will he comfort her at your funeral?

344
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:10,184
这段甜美的音乐可以让你们 想起家中的女友
This sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home

345
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,344
苦苦思念你们的女友
who are missing you.

346
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:15,324
本日节目到此结束 明晚再会
This is all for now. I'll see you tomorrow night.

00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:48,434
天 你忙活什么呢? 他走丢了
Jesus, you needed some exercise? He got lost.

A hundred landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.

Now I'm glad we did. Jesus, what a mess.

362
00:28:54,074 --> 00:28:56,514
他们为什么不开火？
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

363
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,744
我都快变神经质了
It's getting on my nerves.

364
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,874
可能他们全死了吧
Maybe they're all dead.

365
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:05,374
你怎么看 医生？ 你认为他们全死了么？
What do you think, Doc? You think they're all dead?

366
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:31,844
麦克 叫上六个人 把那门炮运到海滩上

压住这个伤口！
I need pressure on this wound!

380
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,944
都是从哪里打来的？
Where's the fire coming from?

381
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:58,454

399
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:40,254
卧倒 卧倒 卧倒！
Down, down, down!

400
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:00,344
清除
It's clear.

401
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,814
干得好
Good work.

402
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,854
你不是说清除了么？
I thought you said it was clear!

403
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,294
刚才是这样！
It was!

404
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:22,334
靠 估计是又换人了
Shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.

405
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:25,144
林勃！
Lindberg!

406
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:26,334
到！
Yeah!

407
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:27,904
烧了它！
Light it up!

408
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,314
艾斯 我掩护你！
I'll cover you, Ice!

409
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:36,284
掩护个屁！ 已经有这么多人在开枪了！
Don't cover shit! There's already enough people shooting!

410
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:39,444
中一枪我就变成火人了
One bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle!

411
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,584
上！ 停火！
Go! Shift fire!

412
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:42,924
大家停火！
Shift your fire!

413
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:45,354
上 上！ 大家停火！
Go, go! Shift your fire!

414
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:47,894
大家停火！
Shift your fire!

415
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:55,304
上！ 行动！
Go! Move it out!

416
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:25,194
目标清除！ 保持低姿！ 等待支援！
Hit the deck! Stay down! Wait for support!

417
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,734
真是一场恶战
Is this a bad battle or what?

418
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:30,864
是他妈一场屠杀
It's a fucking slaughter.

419
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:43,514
老天
Christ Jesus!

420
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,324
马上叫一个机枪小组过来！
Get a machine gun team set up over here, now!

421
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:00,134
谢天谢地！ 坦克！
Thank God! Tanks!

422
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:03,134
通信兵！把坦克叫过来！
Runner! Get those tanks up here!

423
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,234
我靠
Oh, shit.

424
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:08,144
卧倒！
Get down!

425
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,014
下士 注意左翼！
Corporal, watch your left flank!

426
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:14,344
没坦克我们也得上！ 行动！ 行动！
Let's go without them! Move out! Move out!

427
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:43,874
伊基 你那边抬起来一点 他快掉下来了
Iggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.

428
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,384
知道了 医生！
Got it, Doc!

429
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:49,884
炮弹来袭！
Incoming!

430
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,784
上 上 上 上！
Move, move, move, move!

431
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,214
不要停！
Keep moving!

432
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,954
把那辆履带式登陆车弄上岸！
Get that LVT up on the beach!

433
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:32,654
不要停！
Keep moving!

434
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:40,924
老弟 下一个就轮到你了 我们会带你离开这里的
You're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.

435
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,774
行动！
Move it!

436
00:38:01,694 --> 00:38:03,024
有好消息
Great news.

437
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:08,364
你在塔拉瓦营地先过好才有可能 因为我们就要去那儿
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa, 'cause that's where we're headed.

438
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,264
不是关于你和我的
Not you and me.

439
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,864
赛佛伦斯上尉问我 还有谁在那张照片上
Captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture,

440
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:15,704
我就说 老天 我怎么想得起来
and Christ if I could remember,

441
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,864
但是当时有麦克 医生 富兰克林 我 还有汉克・汉森
but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen

442
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:21,674
而且我对他说你当时也在那儿
but I just remembered, you were there, too.

443
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,244
我不在那儿
I wasn't there.

444
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:29,844
但你在那之前在
'Course you were.

445
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:32,384
汉克也不在 他升的是第一面旗
Neither was Hank. He raised the first flag.

446
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:34,254
那面旗子是哈伦・布劳克升起来的
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.

447
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:37,154
靠 我都跟他们说那是汉克了
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

448
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:40,694
你当时又不在那儿 聪明蛋 你怎么知道是哈伦？
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass, how'd you know it was Harlon?

449
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:43,464
你跟他们说了有我么？ 没有 我就跟他们说我记得有你
You tell them it was me? No. Like I said, I just remembered.

450
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,524
很好 闭嘴吧
Good, keep your mouth shut.

451
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:48,264
他们知道照片上还有别人的 一眼便知
They know there was somebody else, you can see it in the picture.

452
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:49,434
那你找个死人顶上吧
Then pick someone dead.

453
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,304
他们可不想要死人 你个蠢红番
They don't want somebody dead, you dumb redskin,

454
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,774
他们想把我们运回国
they want to ship us back to the States.

455
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,004
我跟你说什么了？
What did I tell you?

456
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,004
我说我不在那儿！
I wasn't there.

457
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,574
听见没？ 好吧
You hear? All right.

458
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,014
冷静点
Just settle down.

459
00:39:05,224 --> 00:39:08,384
我哪儿也不去 你哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere. You're not going anywhere.

460
00:39:25,954 --> 00:39:28,954
埃尼威托克（美国托管地）1945年4月


461
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,154
谁说的？
Who the hell says?

462
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,064
净胡扯
This is horseshit.

463
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,294
你受伤了？
You wounded, son?

464
00:39:57,674 --> 00:39:58,864
没有 长官
No, sir.

465
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:02,604
那你赤手空拳杀过日本鬼子么？
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?

466
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:05,734
你要是那么干过 我就把这个座位让给你坐
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat to a hero

467
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,684
你最好能有点传奇故事可讲的
he better have a good goddamn story to tell.

468
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:09,114
没有 长官
No, sir.

469
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:12,814
那你好自为之 因为圣诞节之前 你就会被遗忘的
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you before Christmas.

470
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:41,144
第六人（指升旗队列中） 你知道其余人的名字么？
The sixth man, you got a name?

471
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:43,274
抱歉 还是记不起来
Sorry, still don't remember.

472
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,984
那还真是丢脸了 我跟上面保证过你知道他是谁的
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised the Major you'd know who it was.

473
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:49,184
你要是再说不出来
Fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you

474
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:51,524
你就很难让人相信你自己 也是升旗手之一了
being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

475
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:54,424
干脆大家都别尴尬 你一着陆
Since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land

476
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,364
他们就把你送回冲绳岛去
they'll turn you around, ship you off to Okinawa

477
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,124
在海滩上跟你的兄弟们见面
in time to meet your buddies on the beach.

478
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:02,834
所以 你还跟我兜什么圈子 名字告诉我
So, why don't you stop screwing with me? Give me a damn name.

479
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:23,544
让路！ 让路！ 走开 走开！ 让路！
Gangway! Gangway! Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

480
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:27,224
那婊子养的跑哪去了? 海因斯！ 海因斯?
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch? Hayes! Hayes?

481
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,494
海因斯你个红鬼 赶紧给我过来！
Hayes, get your red ass over here!

482
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,434
搞得我好像在自己眼皮底下
Make me look like I don't know what my own men are doing

483
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,664
都不知道自己手下的人里有个 升旗手似的
with a flag the size of my mother's house?

484
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,674
他妈的 艾拉 你不该对我撒谎
God damn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.

485
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,034
你让我看起来像个白痴
You made me look like a complete asshole.

486
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,904
我们在这儿会想你的 好运
We're gonna miss you around here. Good luck.

487
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:49,984
现在你的名字也上报纸了
Now your name's in the paper, too.

488
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:57,484
你的医生刚才说 我们要推迟你的手术
Just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.

489
00:41:57,564 --> 00:41:59,654
你会被运回国的
You're being shipped back to the mainland.

490
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:03,664
每个看过照片的人都以为 插旗就意味着胜利
Everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.

491
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:07,464
他们只想知道那个 胜利
That's all they wanted to know. Victory.

492
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:12,734
那张照片照了几个星期以后 照片里面一半的人就都死了
Within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.

493
00:42:12,804 --> 00:42:16,644
汉森太太！ 汉森太太！ 您知道汉克是个英雄么?
Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen! Did you know Hank was a hero?

494
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,844
您为他自豪么 汉森太太? 他年少时品行如何?
Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen? What was he like as a boy?

495
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,004
请看这里 太太
Look this way, please, ma'am.

496
00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,314
对您的儿子您有何评价?
What do you have to say about your son?

497
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:26,914
但成为照片中的一员颇有意义
But somehow being a part of it meant something.

498
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:32,424
看着它 你就会相信 所有的牺牲并非白费
Looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.

499
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:39,864
是啊 我也可以想象那就是哈伦
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon, too.

500
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,094
本来就是
It is.

501
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:46,044
贝尔 他们的名字就列在这儿 那不是他
Belle, their names are right here. It's not him.

502
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:51,744
要不是你 他现在就会好好地活着 坐在这里
And he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.

503
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:56,074
看照片的时候你自己多想想吧 埃德
You think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.

504
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:06,074
我得赶紧回家换衣服
And I need to rush home and change

505
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,004
因为一会儿有一个州长的宴会 然后还有一个游行
because there's the Governor's banquet and then there's the parade.

506
00:44:10,074 --> 00:44:13,304
想想看 州长亲自来这里见我们
Imagine, the Governor is coming here to meet us.

507
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,214
现在我穿的是蓝色 那么如果…
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...

508
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:17,514
你也要去换衣服么? 现在我们打断正在播出的节目
Are you going to change? We interrupt this program to bring you

512
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:30,294

All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia.

in the mid-30s to low 40s with clear skies.

516
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:40,574
喂?
Hello?

517
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,404
好的 当然
Yes. Of course.

518
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:47,304
不 我们能理解 那确实不太合适
No, we understand. It wouldn't be right.

519
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:50,684
谢谢
Thank you.

520
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:57,684

你说什么?
Sorry?

525
00:45:13,774 --> 00:45:16,504
那是皮马族印第安语啊 你难道听不懂自己的母语么？
That's Pima Indian talk, boy, don't you know your own language?

526
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:19,204
费了好大劲才学会这一句
Took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.

527
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:22,804
抱歉 参议员先生 我离开 皮马族保留地已经很久了
Sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, Senator.

一等兵瑞尼・盖格南
Private First Class Rene Gagnon!

535
00:46:22,174 --> 00:46:25,004
真他妈壮观
Holy shit.

536
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:28,584
请进 请进 请进 我是巴德・葛博 财政部的
Come in, come in, come in. Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

537
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:30,274
瑞尼・盖格南 巴德・葛博
Rene Gagnon. Bud Gurber.

538
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:33,014
带他们四处转过了么? 刚看了场精彩球赛
You showing the boys the sights? We saw a hell of a ball game.

539
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:35,384
很好 酒在那儿 自己倒吧
That's great. The bar's there, help yourself.

540
00:46:35,454 --> 00:46:37,424
我给你们准备了几张简易的表格
I got some briefing sheets for you here,

541
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,324
上面有一些我们想让你们说的话
just some simple things we want you to say.

542
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:42,884
概括起来就是“买债券吧” 不过别说太频繁了
Mostly, "Buy bonds," can't say that too often.

543
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,124
你们的日程表一直在改
Itineraries, those are changing every couple minutes.

544
00:46:45,194 --> 00:46:47,684
人人都想见你们
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

545
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:51,134
不少女人寄来装着长袜的信封
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them,

546
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:54,434
还有用口红写的小纸条 这事可别外传了 对吧？
notes written in lipstick. We won't mention that to the press, am I right?

547
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:56,974
看在上帝份上 喝一杯
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.

548
00:46:57,044 --> 00:46:59,414
老天 你们刚才也都看到了吧
My God, what you boys must have seen over there.

549
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:01,174
我一直在关注着新闻
I've been watching the newsreels.

550
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:03,874
老天 我们有的忙了
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

551
00:47:04,884 --> 00:47:08,844
我们要筹到大笔的钱 时间却不充裕
So, we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not a lot of time.

552
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:10,984
明天先去白宫 然后领你们到处转转
White House tomorrow, then we trot you over

553
00:47:11,054 --> 00:47:12,614
去跟一大堆国会议员握手
to shake hands with a couple of hundred Congressmen

554
00:47:12,694 --> 00:47:14,214
全是些一毛不拔的铁公鸡
who won't pull a penny out of their pockets.

555
00:47:14,294 --> 00:47:15,554
政客都是好演员
Politicians and actors.

556
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,724
你把他们放到一个饭馆里
You put them in a restaurant together,

557
00:47:16,794 --> 00:47:18,694
他们等到自己老死 都不会有人付账
they'd die of old age before picking up the check.

558
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:21,704
下一站是纽约 时代广场
Then New York City, Times Square,

559
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:24,764
与社会名流共进晚餐 然后就是芝加哥…
dinners with various hoi polloi, then Chicago...

560
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,734
这些“金星母亲”是什么人？
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

561
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:30,034
那是我们对那些已死的升旗手 母亲们的称呼
That's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.

562
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:31,974
你们递给每个母亲一面旗子
You present each mother with a flag,

563
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:34,574
然后说几句话 人们就会慷慨解囊
they say a few words, people will shit money.

564
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,174
多感人啊
It'll be so moving.

565
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,944
但这里有汉克・汉森的妈妈
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.

566
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:41,484
可爱的女人 她知道你和她儿子 关系有多好
Lovely woman. She knows how close you and her son were.

567
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:42,954
他在家信中常提起你
He wrote home about you.

568
00:47:43,024 --> 00:47:45,584
她是如此如此地想见到你
She is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.

569
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,754
汉克不在照片里
Hank wasn't in the picture.

570
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,024
什么？
Sorry?

571
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:53,024
汉克没有升那面旗
Hank didn't raise that flag.

572
00:47:53,434 --> 00:47:55,694
他升的是另一面 真正的那面
He raised the other one, the real flag.

573
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:59,294
什么？ 真正的… 真正的那面？还有这个说法？
The what? The real... The real flag? There's a real flag?

574
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:00,934
是的 我们升的那面不过是 一面替补旗
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.

575
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,374
第一面降下去以后我们就 把它升起来了
We put it up when they took the other one down.

576
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:06,204
你们还有谁觉得头大的？ 你知道这个么？
Am I the only one getting a headache here? You know about this?

577
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,304
登报以后我才知道的
It was after it was already in the papers.

578
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,814
母亲们都已经接到通知了 不过…
The mothers had already been told, but...

579
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:13,014
很好 多好啊 好 太好了
That's it, that's beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful.

580
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:14,244
那 为什么告诉我这些？
Yeah, why tell me?

581
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,984
我是不是必须向1亿5千万美国人
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.

582
00:48:17,054 --> 00:48:18,784
解释清楚谁在那该死的照片上？
Who is in the goddamn picture?

583
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,824
你们里有人在 那张该死的照片上么？
Are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?

584
00:48:20,894 --> 00:48:22,794
是的 我们在那张该死的照片上
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

585
00:48:22,864 --> 00:48:25,954
六个人在硫磺岛上升起国旗 胜利属于我们
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima. Victory is ours.

586
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:27,434
你们是其中三个 是么?
You're three of them, right?

587
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,594
那是第5天发生的事 先生 后来又打了35天
This was the fifth day, sir. The battle went on for 35 more.

588
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,904
那你们当时都做了些什么？每天 午饭前都升一遍这该死的旗么？
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn flag every time you stopped for lunch?

589
00:48:33,974 --> 00:48:35,564
我能不能打他一顿?
Can I hit this guy?

590
00:48:35,644 --> 00:48:38,074
别的我才不管呢 你们在照片里
You know what, I don't give a shit, you're in the picture,

591
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:40,704
你们把旗升起来了 我们就是想说这个故事
you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.

592
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:44,474
你耳朵聋了么? 汉克不在照片上 哈伦才在照片上
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture. Harlon is in the picture.

593
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,244
那哈伦又他妈是谁？
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

594
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:50,554
哈伦・布劳克 他妈妈才应该被邀请
Harlon Block. That's whose mother should be here if anyone's should be.

595
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:54,894
要我说 这整个事情就是一场闹剧
You know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, you ask me.

596
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,844
你知道他们怎么称呼这次巡回筹款么？ 叫做“伟大的第七届”巡回筹款
You know what they're calling this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

597
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:17,944
其实他们本来是想叫
They might've called it the

598
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:19,784
一群连子弹都买不起的穷光蛋
"We're Flat Fucking Broke And Can't Even Afford Bullets

599
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:21,484
向您讨钱巡回筹款的
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies" bond drive,

600
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:24,384
要不是这次筹款数额巨大 他们还真会那么称呼这次巡讲
but it didn't have quite the ring. They could've called it that, though,

601
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:26,444
前四届巡回筹款都失败了
because the last four bond drives came up so short

602
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:28,614
所以我们最后加印了点钞票了事
we just printed money instead.

603
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:30,854
在华尔街上随便问一个聪明人 他都会告诉你
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street, he'll tell you

604
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,094
我们的美元跟纸一样 我们的欠债堆积如山
our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.

605
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:37,004
而且没人再借给我们了 舰船停造
And nobody is lending any more. Ships aren't being built.

606
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:40,874
坦克停造 机枪 火箭筒 手榴弹 甚至拉链 统统停造
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

607
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,034
你觉得这是场闹剧？ 你想回去见你的战友们是么？
You think this is a farce? You want to go back to your buddies?

608
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:46,574
那上飞机之前 在口袋里多装点石头
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets before you get on the plane

609
00:49:46,644 --> 00:49:48,944
因为我们只有用那个去扔日本人了
because that's all we got left to throw at the Japanese.

610
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:51,444
飞机起飞不了你也别奇怪
And don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it off the runway

611
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:53,244
因为油箱早空了
because the fuel dumps are empty.

612
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,054
我们的好朋友阿拉伯人 又只肯接受黄金
And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.

613
00:49:56,124 --> 00:49:58,454
如果我们这次筹不到140亿美元
If we don't raise $14 billion,

614
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:02,224
我们就全完了 战争这个月底就会结束
and that's million with a "B," this war is over by the end of the month.

615
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,784
我们跟日本人谈判 他们要求什么我们给什么
We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want

616
00:50:04,864 --> 00:50:06,764
然后我们就回家 因为我们看到 他们战斗过了
and we come home, because you've seen them fight,

617
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,194
而且还坚定不移
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

618
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:10,964
140亿美元
$14 billion.

619
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:14,234
前三届加起来都没有这么多
The last three drives didn't make that much all together.

620
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:18,044
街头巷尾的人们
People on the street corners,

621
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:21,344
看到这张照片以后 就会重燃希望
they looked at this picture and they took hope.

622
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:23,504
别问我原因 我觉得这就是张垃圾照片
Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.

623
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,054
连个正脸都看不到
You can't even see your faces.

624
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:29,954
但它告诉我们 我们可以赢得 并且正在赢得这场战争
But it said we can win this war, are winning this war,

625
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:32,324
我们就只是需要你们 把它的意义深挖一下
we just need you to dig a little deeper.

626
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:34,054
他们是想把钱给我们么
They want to give us that money.

627
00:50:34,124 --> 00:50:36,114
不 他们想把钱给你们
No, they want to give it to you.

628
00:50:36,194 --> 00:50:38,994
但是你们 你们不愿意要他们的钱 你们不愿意给他们希望
But you, you don't want to ask for it. You don't want to give them hope.

629
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:42,394
你们只是想解释 什么这个人啦那面旗啊之类的事情
You want to explain about this person and that flag.

630
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:45,124
选择权在你们
Well, that's your choice.

631
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:49,704
如果我们承认照片出错 人们就会议论纷纷
Because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about

632
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:51,674
整个计划就全完了
and that will be that.

633
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:02,544
先生们
Gentlemen.

634
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:06,294
总统先生 他们来了
Mr. President, here they are.

635
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:09,354
嗯 你们好 真高兴见到你们 总统先生
Well, hello. Good to see you. Mr. President.

636
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:10,914
见到你们真高兴
Darn good to see you, boys.

637
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:13,934
听说你们打了不少硬仗 恶仗是么
Heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

638
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,124
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

639
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:18,724
艾拉 你是从亚利桑那州 吉拉河保留地来的 是么？
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?

640
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,604
是的 总统先生
Yes, Mr. President.

641
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:24,234
作为印第安人 你比我们都更像一个美国人
Being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.

642
00:51:24,774 --> 00:51:27,114
你的族人应该会为你身上 的制服感到自豪吧
Bet your people are proud to see you wear that uniform.

643
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,574
非常自豪 先生
Very proud, sir.

644
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:30,204
理应如此
They should be.

645
00:51:30,284 --> 00:51:33,984
谢谢你们不远千里来华盛顿帮忙
Well, I want to thank you for coming all this way to Washington to help us out.

646
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:35,884
你们曾经拿下了太平洋上的敌山
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific

647
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,924
现在我要你们去拿下钱山
now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.

648
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,654
希望你们不会让我失望 不会的 先生
And I don't expect you'll let us down. No, sir.

649
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,594
很好 去做吧
Good. Go get it.

650
00:51:43,864 --> 00:51:45,884
仪式到此结束
That's the end of this ceremony.

651
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:50,404
我们来这儿看看这张照片吧 看我能不能把你们一个个分辨出来
Let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.

652
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,874
啊呀 这不是你么
My gosh. There you are.

653
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:06,344
小伙们 小伙们 这杯算我的 敬那些死去的战友
Boys. Boys, this one's on me. To those who can't be with us.

654
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:08,314
是 长官
Yes, sir.

655
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:14,794
劳驾 盖格南先生 能拍张照么？
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon. May we have your autograph?

656
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,694
可以啊
I suppose.

657
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,694
你叫什么名字？
And your name is?

658
00:52:21,234 --> 00:52:22,894
不知你们怎么想的 我是觉得
I don't know about you, but I get the impression

659
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:24,734
我好像陪错英雄了
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.

660
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:28,794
你真是一个英雄 和你在一起真令我荣幸
You're such a hero. I feel honored to be in your presence.

661
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:30,864
哪里哪里
That's just not true.

662
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:37,014
演的多专业啊 来 敬演技派一杯
That's professional work. Here, to professionals.

663
00:52:47,494 --> 00:52:50,224
在这儿 你们就是照片上的那几个人 对吧？
Here they are. You're the guys in the photograph, right?

664
00:52:50,294 --> 00:52:51,884
我听说你们在车上
I heard you were on the train.

665
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,864
握握手 我是约翰・田纳科
Let me shake your hands, John Tennack.

666
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:55,664
我是约翰・布雷德利
John Bradley.

667
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:58,534
这几个是和我一起的 刚从哈佛和耶鲁毕业 都是乳臭未干的小字辈
These boys are with me, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.

668
00:52:58,604 --> 00:53:00,334
他们的老爸都是大富翁
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.

669
00:53:00,404 --> 00:53:02,844
跟真正的战争英雄握个手吧
Boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.

670
00:53:02,904 --> 00:53:04,604
我先失陪一会儿
Excuse me for one moment.

671
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:06,734
你不给他们买杯喝的么
You can buy them a drink while you're at it.

672
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,744
是啊 整个巡回期间的饮料费我请
That's right. Drinks for these men all the way around.

673
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:12,414
你就是另外一个 是吧？ 我是约翰・田纳科
And you're the other one, aren't you? John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

674
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:14,544
我是瑞尼・盖格南 很高兴见到你
Rene Gagnon. Pleased to meet you.

675
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,314
喝点什么吧 来吧 这是我的名片
Have a drink, come on. And here's my card.

676
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,254
听我说 瑞尼
Listen to me, Rene,

677
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,054
巡讲结束 你出了名以后 只管来找我
when you get finished being famous you come see me

678
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:24,964
因为如果你能卖债券 你就能卖房子
because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.

679
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:28,294
现在他们早就不建造房子了 改成配送房子了
Now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

680
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,164
你听说过活动房屋么？ 没有 先生
You heard of prefab homes? No, sir.

681
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:34,224
你会的 留著名片 到时候来找我 明白么？
Well, you will. And you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?

682
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:36,104
好么？肯定的
All right? Certainly will.

683
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:45,314
好的
All right.

684
00:53:53,524 --> 00:53:55,724
我这算是表态了吧 医生
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

685
00:53:57,264 --> 00:54:00,134
如果麦克他们能看见我们的话
If Mike and the guys could see us.

686
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,894
是啊 他们肯定觉得难以置信
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?

687
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:07,774
哈伦！
Harlon!

688
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:12,374
富兰克林！
Franklin!

689
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,444
你能想象富兰克林
Can you imagine Franklin

690
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,554
就在这辆火车里
on this train

691
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:27,714
用全银的餐具在餐车吃东西么
eating at the dining car with all the silver?

692
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:34,254
我们不应该在这里 医生
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

693
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:13,534
（歌词）主的节日即将来临
There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day

694
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:17,444
在外的青年回到家园
When the boys have all come home to stay

695
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,414
万千乐队一齐奏响
And a million bands begin to play

696
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,004
我们跳起胜利波尔卡
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

697
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:29,024
当我们点起自由的火炬
And when we've lit the torch of liberty

698
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:31,574
照亮远方那昏睡的大地
In each blacked-out land across the sea

699
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:35,054
艾拉！ 嘿 艾拉！ 听说那张照片是摆拍的
Ira! Hey, Ira! We heard the picture was posed!

700
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,154
什么？
What?

701
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:38,454
听说那张照片是摆拍的！
We heard you posed the picture!

702
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:39,794
嘿 医生！
Hey, Doc!

703
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:50,204
我们真了不起 医生！
We're bigger than life, Doc!

704
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,864
当女孩和男孩分手
And we'll heave a mighty sigh

705
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:55,714
我们发出沉重的叹息
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed goodbye

706
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:59,474
他们迈过第五街
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue

707
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:03,754
联合国来把他们检阅
The United Nations in review

708
00:56:03,824 --> 00:56:07,524
当梦想终于成真
When this lovely dream has all come true

709
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:13,654
我们跳起胜利波尔卡
We'll be dancing the Victory Polka

710
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,334
干得漂亮
Good job.

711
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:20,564
谢谢
Thank you.

712
00:56:29,544 --> 00:56:31,104
谢谢 女孩们
Thank you, girls!

713
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:32,584
现在
And now,

714
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:37,074
这里就有大家期待已久的人
here are the men you've been waiting to meet,

715
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:39,024
能带来好运的人
the men in white.

716
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:43,114
在我身后的人们 就是硫磺岛的英雄们！
Right behind me here, the heroes of lwo Jima,

717
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:46,634
一等兵瑞尼・盖格南
Private First Class Rene Gagnon,

718
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,134
一等兵艾拉・海因斯
Private First Class Ira Hayes,

719
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:52,534
还有海军医务兵约翰・布雷德利
and Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!

720
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:06,384
谢谢
Thank you.

721
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:14,084
很高兴大家在晚上来到这里 支持我们
It's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.

722
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,784
我们确实需要你们购买债券 这是一定的
We really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.

723
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:19,524
没有你们的帮助 我们就不能赢得战争
'Cause we can't win the war without your help.

724
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:23,224
尽管我们被人称为硫磺岛英雄
As far as us being the heroes of lwo Jima,

725
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,964
但那不是事实
that's just not the case.

726
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:28,574
我们其实没做什么
We really didn't do much at all.

727
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:30,234
尤其是他…
Especially him.

728
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:32,464
尤其是我
Especially me.

729
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:35,874
我只是个通信兵 就这么简单
I was just a runner. That's it.

730
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,914
我们升起了一面旗子
We put up a flag.

731
00:57:38,984 --> 00:57:42,814
旗杆很重 所以我们有好几个人
The pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.

732
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:45,184
我们正巧在升旗的时候 被拍了下来
We had our picture taken doing it.

733
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:49,994
真正的英雄 已经死在了那座小岛上
The real heroes are dead on that island.

734
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:54,094
如果你们踊跃购买债券来纪念他们 我们将会非常感激 谢谢
And we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them. Thank you.

735
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,574
你身边爆炸过手榴弹么 艾拉？
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

736
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,344
你像我一样端掉过碉堡么？
Take out any machine gun nests I missed?

737
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:19,894
起码我还开过枪
At least I fired my weapon.

738
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,294
你得了吧
All right, knock it off.

739
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,294
你打中过什么？ 当时你是不是喝多了？
You hit anything or were you too drunk then, too?

740
00:58:23,364 --> 00:58:24,454
你说什么？
What?

741
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:27,194
别！停手！
Guys! Come on!

742
00:58:27,264 --> 00:58:29,594
停手 别来了
Stop it. Knock it off.

743
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:54,184
（歌词）戴高帽的高个男人 站在路中央
The tall man with the high hat will be coming down your way

744
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,424
听到他的叫嚷 就赶紧把存款取出银行
Get your savings out when you hear him shout

745
00:58:57,494 --> 00:58:59,964
“买债券么?”
"Any bonds today?"

746
00:59:00,034 --> 00:59:02,964
买债券么?
Any bonds today?

747
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:05,524
我销售的是自由的债券
Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling

748
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:06,934
买债券么?
Any bonds today?

749
00:59:07,004 --> 00:59:10,374
瑞尼 这里 坐在他们两个人中间
Rene, right here. Sit between these two boys.

750
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,774
（歌词）自由之人现在降临
Here comes the freedom man

751
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:18,904
请你今天为自由买一份单
Asking you to buy a share of freedom today

752
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:24,214
他们需要我们的帮助
...for us and they need our help.

753
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,684
如果你真的去想的话 你就会发现
And, if you think about it, I think you'll realize

754
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:33,694
购买更多的债券 不只是一件正确的事
that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do

755
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:35,864
也是你唯一能做的事
but the only thing to do.

756
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:40,524
是的 战争已经持续了太久
Yes, this war has gone on too long.

757
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,674
生命已经付出了太多 它的代价…
We have given too many lives. And its cost...

758
00:59:45,744 --> 00:59:48,074
要淋巧克力还是草莓 草莓
Chocolate or strawberry, sir? Strawberry.

759
00:59:48,144 --> 00:59:50,514
…已经是那么的高昂
...has been far too high.

760
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,484
但如果我们现在动摇
But if we waver now,

761
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:57,314
如果我们不再竭尽所能 倾尽全力
if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can

762
00:59:57,394 --> 01:00:00,454
那么之前的所有牺牲 就全都白费了
then those sacrifices would be wasted...

763
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:01,924
要淋巧克力还是草莓 先生？
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?

764
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:04,554
所有那些逝去的生命 就全都只是徒劳了
...and those lives lost in vain.

765
01:01:43,294 --> 01:01:46,324
行动！ 上 上！
Let's move! Go, go!

766
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,054
六号 我是二号 完毕 坦克都到哪去了？
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over. Where the hell are our tanks?

767
01:02:11,124 --> 01:02:13,684
陷在沙子里了 上尉说没有坦克我们也得上
Stuck in the sand. Captain says you're to go without them.

768
01:02:13,754 --> 01:02:15,054
天啊
Christ.

769
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:18,494
你干得可真不错啊 瑞尼
That's real good work you're doing there, Rene.

770
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,254
好的 准备行动 传话下去
All right, prepare to move out. Pass the word.

771
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:25,094
二排！ 行动 行动 行动！

All right, Second Platoon, on your feet! Let's move out!

773
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:29,934
你个蠢驴
Jackass.

774
01:02:30,004 --> 01:02:31,604
行动！
Let's move out!

775
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,174
上 上！ 上 上 上！
Go, go! Move, move, move!

776
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,484
医务兵！
Corpsman!

777
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:53,954
医务兵！
Corpsman!

778
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:58,334
二排 行动！
Second Platoon, move out!

779
01:03:03,204 --> 01:03:04,364
医生！
Doc!

780
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:07,514
医生 离开那儿！
Doc, get out of there!

781
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:17,614
医务兵！
Corpsman!

782
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:19,814
医生！
Doc!

783
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,964
医生 赶紧给我离开那儿！
Doc, get the hell out of there!

784
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:39,174
大家请注意
May I have your attention, please.

785
01:03:39,244 --> 01:03:44,914
开往纽约城 波士顿
Train number 48 with service from New York City, Boston,

786
01:03:44,984 --> 01:03:48,854

报纸上说那就是汉克

你想把大家的事全搞砸
You're gonna screw it up for all of us.

870
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:53,714
我来跟他讲
I've got him.

871
01:09:53,784 --> 01:09:55,654
睡一觉吧  艾拉
Get some sleep, Ira.

872
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:23,674

873
01:11:24,374 --> 01:11:25,704

You see this? What?

874
01:11:25,774 --> 01:11:28,114
麦克 糟糕  快上

什么
What?

878
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,724
你看他们都不打我们了 可能被我们全歼了吧
Well, they're not shooting at us. Maybe we killed them all.

879
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:24,204
要不然就是他们连夜逃跑了吧
Or they ran off in the night or something.

880
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:26,204
再不然他们在等我们开始爬山
Or they're waiting for us to start climbing.

881
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:29,034
三排！ 拿上家伙 我们爬那座山去
Third Platoon! Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.

882
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:31,164

中尉
Lieutenant,

889
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,964

890
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:52,294
是
Yes, sir.

891
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,394
别担心 伊基 他们不打排头兵的
Don't worry, Iggy. They never shoot at the first patrol.

892
01:13:01,474 --> 01:13:03,064
是么 是啊
They don't? No.

893
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:06,664
我们肯定安全到顶 因为他们不想打草惊蛇
They want us to go up to the top, signal to the others that it's okay,

894
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:08,734
等到后续大部队上山 他们才会大开杀戒
then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.

895
01:13:08,814 --> 01:13:10,714
是么 是啊
Really? Yeah.

896
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:12,804
除非他们想来个杀鸡儆猴
Unless of course they want to make an example of us

897
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:14,474
先给山下的弟兄一个下马威
and discourage all the others.

898
01:13:14,554 --> 01:13:17,074
你废话还真是多 知道么 汉克
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?

老天
Jesus.

幸亏那不是我们
Thank God that ain't us.

01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,364
卧倒！ 找掩护！
Get down! Take cover!

922
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,364
射击
Cover with that.30!

923
01:15:43,434 --> 01:15:46,524
当心 下方20码 汉克！ 看到没有？
Watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank! You see them?

924
01:15:47,404 --> 01:15:51,104
大约20码  左侧 林勃 去拿喷火器来
I got about 20 yards, left side. Lindberg, get the flamethrower!

925
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:55,004
博茨 看到没有 掩护右翼！
Boots, you see them? Cover right!

926
01:15:55,544 --> 01:15:58,344
下方大约20码 发现一个！ 看到没有？
About 20 yards down! Duck one! You see them?

927
01:15:58,414 --> 01:16:00,404
继续掩护
Keep the cover on!

928
01:16:00,484 --> 01:16:02,474
二班 看到没有？
Second Squad, you see them?

929
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:04,874
手榴弹给我
Get me some grenades!

930
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:06,384
看到了
I see them!

931
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:18,794
你看到了？
You see them?

932
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:21,064
右翼 转向左侧！
Right flank, over to the right!

933
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:26,374
掩护我 我下去看看
Cover me, I'm going down!

934
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:28,004
小心 伊基
Careful, Iggy.

935
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,064
慢点下
Easy.

936
01:16:30,114 --> 01:16:31,104
目标清除
All clear!

937
01:16:40,354 --> 01:16:43,794
好的 小伙们 谁想出名
Okay, guys, who wants to be famous?

938
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,064
是 长官  我立即去办 长官
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

939
01:16:48,134 --> 01:16:50,864
他妈的  斯坦克 长官？
God damn it. Strank! Sir?

940
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:53,334
他们想把电话线架到山顶去
They want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.

941
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:55,234
猜就是让我们去
Let me guess, they picked us.

942
01:16:55,304 --> 01:16:58,204
二排 我们走 运动一下
Second Platoon, let's go. Get some exercise.

943
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:06,384
走啦  爬起来
Let's go! Get off your ass.

944
01:17:10,484 --> 01:17:12,084
我靠
Oh, shit!

945
01:17:12,454 --> 01:17:15,754
希望它还能用 因为我不会借给你用的
Hope it still works, 'cause you're not getting mine!

946
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:18,724
我拍到福莱斯特号了！ 好啊
Get Forrestal! All right, then.

947
01:17:22,564 --> 01:17:24,894
我不知道那是谁的主意 参谋长先生
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.

948
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:29,164
真他妈天才 我想要那面旗 霍兰
Well, it was goddamn brilliant. I want that flag, Holland.


949
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:29,164
霍兰・史密斯 第五两栖军军长 硫磺岛地面战的总指挥

950
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,504
记下我的话 升起那面旗
Mark my words, raising that son-of-a-bitch

951
01:17:31,574 --> 01:17:34,734
意味着陆战队能再存在500年
means a Marine Corps for the next 500 years.

952
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:37,584
我想要那面旗
I want that flag.

953
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:41,344
是 长官 我会确保没人动它的
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.

954
01:17:41,414 --> 01:17:43,254
相信我
You can count on me.

955
01:17:44,224 --> 01:17:47,854
操他妈的 旗子是属于全营人的
Fuck that. That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.

956
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:50,554
那婊子养的还以为 我们提着脑袋打下这里
That son-of-a-bitch thinks that our men died taking this ground

957
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,654
就是为了把我们的旗子 送给政客去挂在他墙上么
so we could hand over our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?

958
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,894
真他妈脑子烧坏了
He's out of his goddamn mind!

959
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:59,264
把那面旗给我拿下来 另找一面替上它
Get me that flag, and find another one to replace it.

960
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:01,564
你这不是耍我么
You've gotta be shitting me.

961
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:02,904
盖格南！
Gagnon!

962
01:18:04,274 --> 01:18:06,004
赶紧给我滚过来
Get your ass over here.

963
01:18:11,814 --> 01:18:14,654
嘿 伙计 怎么样
Hey. Hi, fellas. How's it going?

964
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:20,354
你错过一次绝佳拍照机会啊 乔
Missed a beautiful shot, Joe.

965
01:18:21,294 --> 01:18:23,154
这得怨天气
It's that kind of day.

966
01:18:44,644 --> 01:18:47,084
嘿 麦克 这儿的视野真不错
Hey, Mike. Hell of a view, Lieutenant.

967
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:49,454
中尉！
Lieutenant!

968
01:18:55,594 --> 01:18:57,754
上校说他想要那面旗
Captain says he wants that flag.

969
01:18:58,964 --> 01:19:00,364
他想要这面旗？
He wants this flag?

970
01:19:00,434 --> 01:19:01,594
是 长官
Yes, sir.

971
01:19:02,964 --> 01:19:05,494
我们刚把那玩意儿升上去 是 长官
We just put the damn thing up. Yes, sir.

972
01:19:06,104 --> 01:19:08,194
缺旗子用是么
Some kind of flag shortage?

973
01:19:08,274 --> 01:19:10,674
他想让你用这一面替上
He wants you to put this one up instead.

974
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:18,474
嘿  麦克
Hey, Mike.

975
01:19:20,284 --> 01:19:22,214
帮个忙把这个升上去 行不行
Do me a favor and put this up, will you?

976
01:19:22,284 --> 01:19:23,754
好的
Yes, sir.

977
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:25,724
好 先找个洞
All right, let's find a pole.

978
01:19:28,124 --> 01:19:30,094
把旗降下来
Take the flag down, boys.

979
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:32,654
上校的命令
Captain's orders.

980
01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:36,224
听到他说的了吧 咱们动手吧
You heard him, let's do it.

981
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,064
好的
There you go.

982
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:42,124
洛蒂  真沉啊
Lordy, she's a heavy one.

983
01:19:46,644 --> 01:19:49,374
好 把这个挂好
All right, hang on. Put this on.

984
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:56,514
在上面视野真不错
One hell of a view, huh?

985
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:59,584
是啊  换我也这么说
Good view from up here. Yes, I'd say so myself.

986
01:20:08,734 --> 01:20:09,824
行了
All right.

987
01:20:13,674 --> 01:20:16,904
我站这儿没挡住你吧 乔? 没 没问题 谢谢
Not in your way here, am I, Joe? Nah, I'm fine, thanks.

988
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:19,344
嘿 医生 帮个忙行么
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?

989
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,074
要开始插旗了
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.

990
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,584
准备好没？
Ready? Ready?

991
01:20:27,654 --> 01:20:28,914
开始了
Let's go.

992
01:20:31,854 --> 01:20:33,014
拍到没有
You get it?

993
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:39,824
不知道 希望能拍到脸
I don't know. I wish I could've seen their faces.

994
01:20:42,164 --> 01:20:44,724
没人知道我们升了第二面旗
Nobody even noticed that second flag going up.

995
01:20:47,834 --> 01:20:51,934
大家仅仅看了那张照片 然后就开始自己发挥想象
Everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.

996
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:55,134
但是你爸爸和其他人 知道他们都做了什么
But your dad and the others knew what they had done

997
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:57,304
以及没做什么
and what they had not done.

998
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,284
想想如果你的朋友都快死了
All your friends dying,

999
01:21:01,954 --> 01:21:05,684
救过别人一命的 确实应该被称作英雄
it's hard not to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.

1000
01:21:06,694 --> 01:21:09,124
但要是就树了根杆子呢
But for putting up a pole?

1001
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:15,324
你这是在开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding.

1002
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:19,774
嘿！这可是好多人费了好长 时间才搭起来的
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.

1003
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:22,334
等到今晚  灯光往上一打
Just wait till tonight when it's lit properly

1004
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:24,394
看台上几千观众鼓掌欢呼
and there's thousands of cheering people in the stands.

1005
01:21:24,474 --> 01:21:25,464
到时候看起来可就（比现在） 好多了
It's gonna look a lot better.

1006
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:27,944
到时候  大灯熄灭
So, stadium lights come down,

1007
01:21:28,014 --> 01:21:29,484
聚光灯亮起 你们就上场
spotlight comes up and you get your cue.

1008
01:21:29,544 --> 01:21:32,034
你们拿着旗子冲到这东西顶上 把旗插上
You charge up this thing with the flag, you plant it at the top.

1009
01:21:32,114 --> 01:21:34,814
然后你们微笑 挥手 插旗用的洞是现成的
You smile, you wave. You know the drill.

1010
01:21:34,884 --> 01:21:38,084
你想让我们把旗子插到 这坨纸浆糊上？
You want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.

1011
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:40,284
嘿  那就是个面子活儿
Hey, that's show biz.

1012
01:21:41,124 --> 01:21:43,724
尽量按着当初的队形站在上面
And try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.

1013
01:21:43,794 --> 01:21:46,624
你们就…知道吧…假装 那三个人也在身边
Just, you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.

1014
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:47,924
那些死人
The dead guys.

1015
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:51,264
是  是的
Yeah. Yeah.

1016
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:54,824
好  没问题了
Okay, not a problem.

1017
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:56,394
很好
Good.

1018
01:21:57,104 --> 01:21:59,504
但我们怎么想象汉克 站在那里
But where do we imagine Hank is standing?

1019
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:01,304
你说什么？
Sorry?

1020
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:02,744
他当时又没升旗
Well, seeing that he wasn't there,

1021
01:22:02,814 --> 01:22:05,844
给他留出个位置很难
it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.

1022
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:10,314
我想你知道他当时站在哪里 你向他母亲指出过的
I think you know exactly where he was. You pointed him out to his mother.

1023
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:14,954
什么狗屁东西
This is bullshit.

1024
01:22:16,494 --> 01:22:19,824
我升过一次那玩意了 我可不想再搞一遍
I planted that damn thing once, and I'm not doing it again.

1025
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,304
海因斯！ 看在老天面上 回来吧
Hayes! Oh, for Christ's sake.

1026
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:28,494
海因斯  海因斯  赶紧给我回来 不然我打你报告
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.

1027
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:29,564
海因斯！
Hayes!

1028
01:22:31,074 --> 01:22:33,044
你也不管管?
You wanna do your damn job?

1029
01:22:37,814 --> 01:22:41,184
放开我！放开我！
Let go of me! Let go of me!

1030
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:42,714
来吧！
Come on!

1031
01:22:46,354 --> 01:22:48,014
他和我一起的！
He's with me!

1032
01:22:48,094 --> 01:22:49,954
嘿 他是和我一起的！
Hey, he's with me!

1033
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:53,824
退后！ 先生  我们是一起的  好么? 他是和我一起的
Back off! Sir, he's with me. Okay? He's with me.

1034
01:22:53,894 --> 01:22:56,234
艾拉 把椅子放下！
Ira, put the goddamn chair down!

1035
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,704
把椅子放下 把椅子放下 艾拉！
Put the chair down, son! Put the chair down, Ira!

1036
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:01,704
让他们先把棍子放下！
Tell them drop their sticks!

1037
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:04,264
艾拉  他们是警察 他们应该带着警棍
Ira, they're cops, they're supposed to have nightsticks.

1038
01:23:04,344 --> 01:23:06,534
但是你不能在大街中间 拿着椅子乱抡
You're not supposed to be in the street swinging a chair.

1039
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,134
冷静点 先生 请回过头来看
Calm down, son. Sir, turn around, please.

1040
01:23:09,214 --> 01:23:11,474
那边那张海报看到了么？ 里面最后一个人就是他
That poster right there? The one on the end, that's him.

1041
01:23:11,544 --> 01:23:14,044
是他么？ 是的 先生 你看过报纸上的报道了么
That's him? Yes, sir. You read the papers?

1042
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,314
老天
Christ.

1043
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,384
又他妈一个发疯的英雄 赶紧带他走
We got another fucking hero. Get him out of here.

1044
01:23:18,454 --> 01:23:20,254
你去行么 行 先生
Can you do that? Yes, sir.

1045
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:25,654
把椅子给我放下 我们走
Put the goddamn chair down. And let's go.

1046
01:23:33,034 --> 01:23:34,764
是你先挑头的么？
Did you start this?

1047
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,264
他不招待我！
He didn't serve me!

1048
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:40,304
规矩又不是我定的 我们不招待印第安人
I don't make the rules. We don't serve Indians.

1049
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:47,974
他得好好睡一觉
He needs to go sleep it off.

1050
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,224
到战士体育场
Soldier Field.

1051
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:06,464
你听到没有？
You hear that?

1052
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:08,634
那是什么声音？
What the hell is that?

1053
01:24:08,704 --> 01:24:10,834
我听不清
I can't figure it out.

1054
01:24:10,904 --> 01:24:12,574
小心点
Keep an eye out.

1055
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:15,444
好像是从上面那儿传出来的
It sounds like it's coming from up there.

1056
01:25:24,444 --> 01:25:26,314
手榴弹炸的
They're using grenades.

1057
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:29,644
他们自杀了
They're killing themselves.

1058
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:39,884
艾拉  走吧
Ira, let's go.

Holy shit. You would have to pick today.

1064
01:26:20,974 --> 01:26:23,464

Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.

Yes, sir. By yourself?

1067
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:30,544
好吧  听好了 我不管你是不是扶着他
All right, look. I don't care if you have to carry him

1068
01:26:30,614 --> 01:26:34,014
反正把他弄到山顶去 把旗子插上 别他妈演砸了
get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.

1069
01:26:34,084 --> 01:26:38,714
叫他把行头换上 我尽量 给你拖时间  动作快点
Get him in his stuff. I'll stall these guys for as long as I can. Hurry up.

1070
01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:40,954
老天啊
Jesus Christ.

1084
01:27:44,784 --> 01:27:46,384
小心误伤
Hustle up, boys!

1085
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:53,124

We got them!

1086
01:27:53,864 --> 01:27:55,024
清除！
Clear!

1087
01:28:11,214 --> 01:28:13,244

One hell of an experience.

01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:21,694
出发！
Move out!

1089
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:31,624

Cease fire! They're my men! You're targeting our men!

1090
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:38,104
你瞄准的是我们的…
You're targeting our...

1091
01:28:39,244 --> 01:28:41,184

1092
01:28:45,714 --> 01:28:48,244
中士?中士！

1096
01:29:04,004 --> 01:29:05,994
医生在哪?
Hey, where's Doc?

1097
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,134
医务兵！
Corpsman!

1098
01:29:10,414 --> 01:29:11,814
糟糕
Oh, shit.

1099
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:17,104
他呼吸怎么样 哈伦 让一让
How's his breathing? Harlon, move, buddy.

It's okay.

1102
01:29:24,524 --> 01:29:25,584
我没事
It's okay.

1103
01:29:27,064 --> 01:29:28,394
挺住 麦克
Come on, Mike.

1104
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:32,434
麦克？麦克？能听到我们么？
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?

1105
01:29:44,174 --> 01:29:45,904
好了 大家出发
All right, let's go!

1106
01:29:46,684 --> 01:29:48,074
行动！这里交给后面收拾
Move out!

1107
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,704
我去找副担架
I'm gonna get a stretcher.

1108
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:54,314
把他抬走运回国去
Let's take him down, move him off the beach.

1109
01:30:06,364 --> 01:30:10,534
女士们先生们 有请硫磺岛英雄们！
Ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of lwo Jima!

1110
01:30:12,304 --> 01:30:13,674

汉克！
Hank!

1112
01:30:23,154 --> 01:30:24,614
汉克！
Hank!

1113
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:46,374
医生  他们把我杀了
Doc, they killed me.

1114
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:56,104
哈伦！
Harlon!

1115
01:30:58,554 --> 01:30:59,644
医生
Doc,

1116
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:03,444
他们把我杀了
they killed me.

1117
01:31:04,754 --> 01:31:07,384
挺住 哈伦 哈伦 坚持住
Come on, Harlon. Harlon, stay with me.

1118
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,634
富兰克林！
Franklin!

1119
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:28,674
我没事 艾拉
I'm fine, Ira.

1120
01:32:15,264 --> 01:32:16,884
医务兵！
Corpsman!

1121
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:19,754
医务兵！
Corpsman!

1122
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,634
他去哪了? 谁?
Where'd he go? Who?

1123
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:24,104
他刚才还在这儿的 伊基 他去哪了?
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski. Where did he go?

1124
01:32:24,174 --> 01:32:26,864
你找错地方了吧 我才没找错地方！
I think you jumped in the wrong hole. I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

1125
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:29,504
刚刚他还在这 现在他去哪了?
He was right here, now where the hell is he?

1126
01:32:30,374 --> 01:32:31,464
伊基！
Iggy!

1127
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:33,634
伊基！
Iggy!

1128
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,704
你闭嘴吧  你想让全岛日本人 都向我们开火么?
You shut up. You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?

1129
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:37,844
伊基！
Iggy!

1130
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:53,924
它是开着的么?
Does it open?

1131
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:56,564
伊基！
Iggy!

1132
01:32:58,104 --> 01:32:59,504
伊基！
Iggy!

1133
01:33:01,244 --> 01:33:03,234
伊基 你在下面么?
Iggy, are you down there?

1134
01:33:04,844 --> 01:33:06,434
伊基！
Iggy!

1135
01:33:07,444 --> 01:33:10,414
分不清他是谁  不过肯定是我们的人
Can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.

1136
01:33:11,184 --> 01:33:13,344
我得在外面先吐一会儿
I had to go outside to throw up.

1137
01:33:14,984 --> 01:33:17,614
瞧瞧他们都对这可怜的家伙 做了些什么
Look what they did to the poor son-of-a-bitch.

1138
01:34:32,134 --> 01:34:33,494
酋长 你没事吧?
You okay, Chief?

1139
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:35,554
别把这事放在心上
Just let it go.

1140
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:39,094
如果这样还橇不开他们的钱包 我就没招了
If that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.

1141
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:49,574
老天爷  他喝醉了
Jesus Christ, he's drunk.

1142
01:34:54,184 --> 01:34:55,784
该死的印第安人
Goddamn Indians.

1143
01:35:06,964 --> 01:35:09,094
来 酋长 我们回家
Come on, Chief. Let's get you home.

1144
01:35:14,494 --> 01:35:17,794
战士体育场：献给服役的人们


1145
01:35:19,044 --> 01:35:22,574
我听到的可不是这样 我问过一圈了 我又不蠢
That's not what I hear. I called around, I'm not stupid.

1146
01:35:22,644 --> 01:35:24,644
他从一开始就喝醉了
He's been drunk since he started this damn tour,

1147
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:26,444
纯粹哗众取宠
making a spectacle of himself.

1148
01:35:26,524 --> 01:35:29,814
居然还在接待宴会上搂着那个 可怜的女人又哭又嚎
Just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.

1149
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:32,554
老天 看看你们手下人的德性
Jesus Christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.

1150
01:35:32,624 --> 01:35:33,684
是 先生
Yes, sir.

1151
01:35:33,764 --> 01:35:35,954
他让我们看起来就像个笨蛋
Well, he's making us look like regular asses.

1152
01:35:36,024 --> 01:35:37,054
我绝无冒犯之意 长官
Well, with all due respect, sir,

1153
01:35:37,134 --> 01:35:39,154
他一开始就不想做这次巡回筹款
he never wanted to come on this trip in the first place.

1154
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,634
（当时）他又踢又打 大喊大叫 我们好不容易才把他从船上拉下来
We had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.

1155
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:43,694
他想跟他的战友在一起
He wants to be with his unit.

1156
01:35:43,774 --> 01:35:46,464
他还有什么战友？ 全他妈死了
What unit? They're all fucking dead.

1157
01:35:47,104 --> 01:35:50,774
他就是靠喝酒呕吐 来纪念他们的么？
This is how he honors those men? By drinking and throwing up, and...

1158
01:35:50,844 --> 01:35:53,504
他不是想回去么？ 好 我们就让他回去
You know what? He wants it, great, we'll send him back.

1159
01:35:53,584 --> 01:35:57,534
叫他收拾好行李 搭今天的火车走人 他不配穿上这身制服！
Get him packed and on a train today. He's an embarrassment to the uniform.

1160
01:35:58,914 --> 01:36:00,254
是 先生
Yes, sir.

1161
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:08,694
交给我做
I'll do it.

1162
01:36:28,184 --> 01:36:31,614
好啊 不 其实… 很好 我就是那么想的
Yeah, no, that's... That's good. That's what I want.

1163
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,684
我知道那是好事
I know it's a good thing,

1164
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,784
巡回筹款 因为我们需要钱
raising the money and that, 'cause we need it.

1165
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:43,254
但是
But,

1166
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:46,894
我受不了别人叫我英雄
I can't take them calling me a hero.

1167
01:36:48,964 --> 01:36:51,804
我所做的不过是努力不被打中
All I did was try not to get shot.

1168
01:36:57,174 --> 01:37:00,144
我见过的
Some of the things I saw done,

1169
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:02,044
还有做过的事
things I did,

1170
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:07,184
没什么可自豪的 你明白么？
they weren't things to be proud of, you know?

1171
01:37:17,194 --> 01:37:18,254
麦克…
Mike...

1172
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:24,824
麦克才是英雄
Mike was a hero.

1173
01:37:28,174 --> 01:37:29,834
你见过他么？
You ever meet him?

1174
01:37:31,974 --> 01:37:33,004
没有
No.

1175
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:41,084
他是我见过最好的陆战队员
Best Marine I ever met.

1176
01:37:46,124 --> 01:37:50,084
酋长 我觉得 如果是麦克 而不是你坐在这里的话
You know, Chief, I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you

1177
01:37:51,564 --> 01:37:54,094
他也会这么评价自己的
he'd be saying the same thing about himself,

1178
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:57,894
说自己不是英雄
not being a hero.

1179
01:38:05,114 --> 01:38:06,304
可能吧
Maybe.

1180
01:38:08,144 --> 01:38:11,044
他是个好人
He was a good guy.

1181
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:14,884
但我觉得 他看到我现在的样子以后
But I think that he would be ashamed of me,

1182
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:18,784
会替我感到丢人的
seeing me the way I am.

1183
01:38:37,944 --> 01:38:41,884
回去之前我能看看我妈妈么
Think I could see my ma before they ship me off?

1184
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,804
就一眼 行么 看看妈妈
Think they'd do that? See my ma?

1185
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:52,344
抱歉 艾拉
I'm sorry, Ira.

1186
01:39:04,304 --> 01:39:07,504
你跟她的孩子们就这么说
We got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.

1187
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,334
保持低调
Keep your head down.

1188
01:39:18,984 --> 01:39:20,544
发车
All aboard.

1189
01:39:20,624 --> 01:39:22,014
好运 酋长
Good luck, Chief.

1190
01:39:54,324 --> 01:39:56,784
在那之后我见过他一次
I think I saw him once after that.

1191
01:39:56,854 --> 01:39:59,844
大概是在战后六七年吧
It was maybe six or seven years after the war.

1192
01:39:59,924 --> 01:40:02,984
我当时是推销员 经常开车
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.

1193
01:40:03,064 --> 01:40:04,894
有次我向西横穿得克萨斯
I was driving west across Texas.

1194
01:40:04,964 --> 01:40:07,864
当时一心想回家 正找方向呢
I was just trying to get where I was going so I could get home.

1195
01:40:07,934 --> 01:40:10,694
然后我看到他 在路边想搭车
And I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.

1196
01:40:10,774 --> 01:40:14,104
一瞬间 我想到可能是他
And, for a second, I thought it might've been him.

1197
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:22,104
我现在经常后悔当时 为什么不停下来 但我当时很急
I always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.

1198
01:40:23,214 --> 01:40:25,204
而且他是个印第安人
And he was an Indian.

1199
01:40:25,284 --> 01:40:27,844
我们总对报纸说 当时艾拉执意
We always told the press that Ira insisted

1200
01:40:27,924 --> 01:40:30,284
要回部队继续战斗
that he was going back to fight with his unit

1201
01:40:30,354 --> 01:40:33,724
这至少算是部分真实的吧
which was at least partially true, but

1202
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:38,224
但最后报纸头条出来却不是这样
that isn't what got the headlines.

1203
01:40:38,934 --> 01:40:40,594
我们订婚了
We're engaged.

1204
01:40:44,904 --> 01:40:46,604
我失陪一会儿 亲爱的
Excuse me a minute, darling.

1205
01:40:46,674 --> 01:40:48,804
嘿 医生? 嗯?
Hey, Doc? Yeah?

1206
01:40:48,874 --> 01:40:50,964
有时间么? 嗯
Got a minute? Yeah.

1207
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:53,014
车上见
I'll see you at the car.

1208
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:57,814
你听说过我就要结婚了么？ 听说了 瑞尼 那太好了
You hear I'm getting married? I did, Rene. That's great.

1209
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:03,424
是啊 她要求的 她等了我这么久
Yeah, it's something she wants. She waited for me all this time.

1210
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:07,584
她还不习惯这一切 但她可是个好女孩
She's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.

1211
01:41:07,664 --> 01:41:09,724
我确定你会很幸福的
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

1212
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:13,164
我在考虑是不是请你当我的伴郎
So, I was wondering if you'd be my best man.

1213
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:14,294
我？
Me?

1214
01:41:16,364 --> 01:41:21,234
你在家里就没有什么人么？ 比如叫一个兄弟来当？
Don't you have somebody at home, a buddy, you'd rather ask?

1215
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:23,764
嗯  不太多
Well, I didn't really make many.

1216
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:27,974
他们不能去是因为… 嗯 我基本没怎么跟他们说过话
The ones who didn't go, it's... Well, it's hard to even talk to them.

1217
01:41:28,044 --> 01:41:29,274
知道么？
You know?

1218
01:41:29,344 --> 01:41:30,744
哦 知道了
Yeah, I know.

1219
01:41:33,984 --> 01:41:35,754
我…我很荣幸
I'd be proud to.

1220
01:41:36,654 --> 01:41:37,984
谢谢
Thank you.

1221
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,994
我得马上把她拉走 要不然她可能会说
I better go drag her away from them before she announces

1222
01:41:42,064 --> 01:41:45,524
我会成为通用汽车公司老总 什么的
I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.

1223
01:41:46,134 --> 01:41:47,364
好的
All right.

1224
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,694
祝贺你 非常感谢  谢谢
Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you.

1225
01:41:50,774 --> 01:41:52,364
瑞尼 你真幸运
Rene, you're a lucky man.

1226
01:42:02,584 --> 01:42:04,744
笑一笑 盖格南先生 说茄子
Big smile, Mrs. Gagnon! Say cheese!

1227
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:08,684
我没法抱怨 因为媒体喜欢他们
I couldn't complain because the press loved them,

1228
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:12,284
相关报道越多 军债卖得越好
so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.

1229
01:42:15,464 --> 01:42:18,924
巡回筹款还在继续 只剩下了瑞尼和你父亲
The tour went on with just Rene and your dad.

1230
01:42:23,474 --> 01:42:27,424
真正的英雄是那些 没能从硫磺岛活着回来的人们
And the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima,

1231
01:42:28,044 --> 01:42:31,404
是那些死在硫磺岛战役 和其他战役中的人们
the men who died at lwo Jima and in other campaigns.

1232
01:42:32,274 --> 01:42:35,144
购买更多的战争债券吧
We ask that you honor the memory of those men

1233
01:42:35,214 --> 01:42:37,744
我们将籍此告慰战殁者的亡灵 万众一心 赢得这场战争
by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.

1234
01:42:38,954 --> 01:42:40,314
谢谢
Thank you.

1235
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:47,764
一个城市接着一个城市 这鬼差事没完没了
City after city, I thought the damn thing'd never end.

1236
01:42:48,664 --> 01:42:52,864
“照片是当时拍的”的流言 也开始流传
And this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.

1237
01:42:55,064 --> 01:42:56,394
我记得你爸爸告诉他们
I remember your dad telling them

1238
01:42:56,464 --> 01:42:58,404
说他也很想知道 是谁拍了那张照片
that he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken

1239
01:42:58,474 --> 01:43:00,934
他说他就算挖地三尺 也要把拍照人找出来
because he would've ducked the hell out of it.

1240
01:43:01,004 --> 01:43:03,704
当时是谁的主意？ 是谁安排你们摆拍的？
Whose idea was it? Who wanted to stage the thing?

1241
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:05,264
说说嘛  那是你么
Come on, it was you?

1242
01:43:05,344 --> 01:43:08,474
照片是摆拍的事是真的么 医生？
Was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?

1243
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:11,014
说吧 医生? 你能回答那个问题么?
Come on! Doc? Can you answer that?

1244
01:43:13,154 --> 01:43:17,484
我还记得你爸爸中弹的消息传过来的情形 当时好像天都要塌下来了
I remember when your dad got shot. All hell was busting loose.

1245
01:43:17,554 --> 01:43:19,584
人们回家看到那张照片以后
People back home saw that picture

1246
01:43:19,654 --> 01:43:23,394
就认为只要我们打下折钵山 就结束了
and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.

1247
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:26,564
我们那是做梦
We wished.

1248
01:43:27,304 --> 01:43:29,894
当时我们正被压制
Anyways, we're pinned down.

1249
01:43:29,964 --> 01:43:32,764
迫击炮 榴弹炮 机枪
Mortars, shells, machine guns.

1250
01:43:33,844 --> 01:43:36,634
子弹 弹片横飞
Fire coming from every which direction, right?

1251
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:41,244
然后我们听到有人喊 “医务兵倒下了”
And we hear somebody call, "Corpsman down."

1252
01:43:42,714 --> 01:43:44,374
医务兵倒下了！
Corpsman down!

1253
01:43:51,154 --> 01:43:55,254
他的喉咙鲜血喷涌 医生用尽了一切手段
Blood was spurting out of his throat, and Doc was doing everything he could.

1254
01:43:57,534 --> 01:43:59,654
医务兵向上望着他
And the Corpsman looks up at him

1255
01:44:01,104 --> 01:44:04,464
脖子中弹 九死一生
and he knows what this means, to be shot in the neck.

1256
01:44:05,474 --> 01:44:08,104
他自己应该知道这一点
He knows he's dying, you can see that.

1257
01:44:08,604 --> 01:44:09,904
但是
But still

1258
01:44:11,374 --> 01:44:15,504
他的眼里全是祈求 祈求医生能救他一命
in his eyes, he's pleading with Doc to save his life.

1259
01:44:21,824 --> 01:44:23,344
但是医生无能为力
And Doc can't.

1260
01:45:01,264 --> 01:45:03,854
医生 你没事吧? 嗯 我没事
You okay, Doc? Yeah, I'm fine.

1261
01:45:05,134 --> 01:45:08,294
这还叫没事 没什么大事
Yeah, you look fine. I'm okay.

1262
01:45:08,364 --> 01:45:11,734
趴着别动 我去给你找担架来
Keep down, all right? I'm gonna go get a stretcher.

1263
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:12,894
好
Okay.

1264
01:45:20,244 --> 01:45:22,544
医务兵 医务兵！
Corpsman. Corpsman!

1265
01:45:23,514 --> 01:45:25,714
看在上帝面上！ 医务兵！
For God sake, Corpsman!

1266
01:45:45,474 --> 01:45:46,734
医务兵?
Corpsman?

1267
01:45:49,174 --> 01:45:50,164
医务兵
Corpsman.

1268
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:53,804
炮弹来袭！
Incoming!

1269
01:45:57,784 --> 01:45:59,114
让我看看
Let me see.

1270
01:46:02,254 --> 01:46:05,314
没那么糟糕 你会没事的
It's not that bad. You're gonna be okay. All right?

1271
01:46:05,394 --> 01:46:07,414
坚持住 看着我
Just stay with me. Look at me.

1272
01:46:08,224 --> 01:46:12,184
后来我们花了半小时才找到你爸 他差点流血过多而死
Took us a half-hour to find your dad. He could've bled to death.

1273
01:46:12,264 --> 01:46:13,594
放下
Coming down.

1274
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:21,764
谢谢
Thanks.

1275
01:46:26,214 --> 01:46:30,614
老兵可能会告诉你说他们是如何 自己中弹  但却不想抛弃战友的
Vets'll tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.

1276
01:46:31,414 --> 01:46:33,044
通常讲 他们都是在撒谎
Usually, they're lying.

1277
01:46:33,754 --> 01:46:36,584
随便找个理由你就能 拍屁股走人
You'll take any excuse to get out of there.

1278
01:46:37,654 --> 01:46:39,184
但当时确实发生了
But it happens.

1279
01:46:41,394 --> 01:46:44,324
你感觉到 自己让他们失望了
You get the feeling you're letting them down.

1280
01:46:45,634 --> 01:46:48,154
这我从你爸爸脸上就看得出来
I could see that in your dad's face.

1281
01:46:49,634 --> 01:46:53,124
他只想离开 他看够了这一切
He wanted to go, he'd seen enough.

1282
01:46:54,844 --> 01:46:56,834
但他不想扔下我们
But he didn't want to leave us.

1283
01:46:58,974 --> 01:47:01,464
你爸爸 真的是一个大好人
Now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.

1284
01:47:04,954 --> 01:47:06,044
是啊
Yeah.

1285
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:10,584
我们坐在海滩上的时候 听到了巨大的轰鸣声
While we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.

1286
01:47:10,654 --> 01:47:12,124
于是我们抬头看
And we looked up.

1287
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:21,354
那是第一架降落在硫磺岛上的 飞机 后来还有几千架次
That was the first of thousands of landings on lwo.

1288
01:47:21,434 --> 01:47:23,234
看看 嗯
Look at that. Yeah.

1289
01:47:23,874 --> 01:47:25,424
怎么样
How about that.

1290
01:47:31,644 --> 01:47:33,164
我一会在回来 好么
I'm gonna head back, all right?

1291
01:47:33,244 --> 01:47:34,404
好运
Good luck.

1292
01:47:37,554 --> 01:47:40,144
拿下那座岛 我们就可以少死很多人 （指提前结束战争）
That island saved a lot of lives.

1293
01:47:43,794 --> 01:47:45,554
很多很多人
A lot of lives.

1294
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:51,924
我没什么可说的了
I don't know what else to tell you.

1295
01:48:00,804 --> 01:48:04,434
巡回筹款结束以后 我爸终于可以做手术
After the bond tour my dad finally got his operation.

1296
01:48:15,884 --> 01:48:18,914
他回家的时候 战争已经结束了
By the time he got home the war was over.

1297
01:48:22,994 --> 01:48:25,824
他做的第一件事 就是向我妈求婚
First thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.

1298
01:48:30,234 --> 01:48:33,004
艾拉尝试着继续生活 忘掉从前的一切
Ira tried to get on with his life and put it all behind him.


1299
01:48:30,234 --> 01:48:33,004
牌子上写的是：全美印第安人大会

1300
01:48:34,744 --> 01:48:37,144
谢谢大家今天邀请我到这里
Thank you for having me here today.

1301
01:48:38,174 --> 01:48:43,044
站在这么多强大的人面前 令我感到荣耀
It's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.

1302
01:48:46,614 --> 01:48:48,284
因为战争
Because of the war

1303
01:48:49,884 --> 01:48:53,254
白人会大大加深对印第安人的了解
white men will understand Indians a lot better.

1304
01:48:56,764 --> 01:48:59,284
世界也会变得更加美好
And it's going to be a better world.

1305
01:49:19,414 --> 01:49:21,784
但生活对他另有安排
But life had other plans for him.

1306
01:49:35,334 --> 01:49:38,034
你是…你是他  对么
You're... You're him, aren't you?

1307
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:39,764
你就是那个英雄  是么
You're the hero, right?

1308
01:49:43,714 --> 01:49:46,874
太好了  好  孩子们 去合个影吧
Great. All right, kids, go get your picture taken.

1309
01:49:49,414 --> 01:49:51,474
太好了 太好了
Oh, that's great. That's great.

1310
01:49:51,554 --> 01:49:53,174
好 现在说茄子
All right, now say cheese.

1311
01:49:53,254 --> 01:49:54,514
茄子！
Cheese!

1312
01:49:55,054 --> 01:49:58,954
太好了！好的 嘿  多谢你啊 多谢
That's great! Okay. Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.

1313
01:49:59,394 --> 01:50:01,624
来吧 那可是个英雄 孩子们
Come on. That's a hero, kids.

1314
01:50:12,974 --> 01:50:16,934
英雄  搬一下这个筐吧 太重了我搬不动
Hero, lift this basket, will you? It's too heavy for me.

1315
01:50:42,404 --> 01:50:45,804
瑞尼试着兑现他在巡回筹款中 所收到的承诺
Rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.

1316
01:50:45,874 --> 01:50:49,704
是的  G-A-G-N-O-N
Yes. G-A-G-N-O-N.

1317
01:50:50,874 --> 01:50:54,274
对 读作瑞尼 瑞尼 是的
Right. Pronounced Rene. Rene, yes.

1318
01:50:55,314 --> 01:50:59,644
好的 上星期我就打过电话了 好的 那么 盖格南先生
Okay, I actually called last week. Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.

1319
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:04,284
我已经把你的信息转给了田纳科先生 他会给你打过去的
I gave Mr. Tennack your message. I'm sure he'll call you.

1320
01:51:04,924 --> 01:51:07,054
好的 好的
Okay. All right.

1321
01:51:08,194 --> 01:51:09,284
谢谢
Thank you.

1322
01:51:09,864 --> 01:51:12,054
但他只是昨日英雄了
But he was yesterday's hero.

1323
01:51:12,134 --> 01:51:15,394
他甚至向当地警察局申请工作
He even applied for a job at the local police station.

1324
01:51:17,574 --> 01:51:19,934
他们说他还不合格
They said he wasn't qualified.

1325
01:51:20,004 --> 01:51:22,974
和女友波琳在工厂干了一段之后 他跳了几次槽
After working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things

1326
01:51:23,044 --> 01:51:25,704
最后做了看门人终此一生
but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.

1327
01:51:28,244 --> 01:51:29,304
至于艾拉…
But Ira...

1328
01:51:29,384 --> 01:51:31,814
艾拉！有访客！
Ira! You got a visitor.

1329
01:51:35,184 --> 01:51:37,154
艾拉总能上新闻
Ira always made the news.

1330
01:51:37,894 --> 01:51:40,884
亚利桑那州 马里科帕县警察局


1331
01:51:43,694 --> 01:51:47,864
我也不知他何以至此 但有一天他就那么被释放了
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.

1332
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:34,504
他边走边拦车走了1300多英里
He walked and hitched over 1,300 miles

1333
01:52:34,584 --> 01:52:36,484
从亚利桑那走到得克萨斯
from Arizona to Texas.

1334
01:52:40,114 --> 01:52:43,414
最后找到了正在田里耕地的 哈伦・布劳克的父亲
He found Harlon Block's father working his field.

1335
01:52:43,484 --> 01:52:47,754
他的妻子贝尔一听到哈伦战死 的消息 就和他分居了
His wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.

1336
01:52:48,594 --> 01:52:52,124
她一直都没有原谅他 让自己的儿子上战场的决定
She never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.

1337
01:53:10,214 --> 01:53:12,244
艾拉告诉了他真相
And Ira told him the truth,

1338
01:53:13,484 --> 01:53:16,684
是他的儿子参与了当时的升旗
that it had been his son who raised the flag with them,

1339
01:53:17,454 --> 01:53:19,484
是他的儿子上了照片
his son in the photograph.

1340
01:53:22,264 --> 01:53:24,954
然后 艾拉只是转身离去
And then he just turned and walked away.

1341
01:53:26,294 --> 01:53:29,164
虽然对于参与升旗他早已看淡
Though the flag-raising meant nothing to him,

1342
01:53:29,734 --> 01:53:32,894
但他知道对于哈伦一家 这意味着什么
he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.

1343
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:50,814
谢谢你打来
Thanks for calling.

1344
01:53:54,924 --> 01:53:57,124
贝尔知道真相之后不久
Just as Belle knew all along.

1345
01:54:06,604 --> 01:54:08,404
媒体也得以知晓
The press soon found out

1346
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:12,434
打电话给汉克的母亲说照片上 没有她的孩子
and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.

1347
01:54:25,694 --> 01:54:27,354
他们最后一次见面
The last time they all saw each other

1348
01:54:27,424 --> 01:54:30,824
是在海军陆战队战争纪念碑 落成仪式上
was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.

1349
01:54:32,364 --> 01:54:35,894
尽管汉克参与了硫磺岛上第一面 美国国旗的升旗仪式
And even though he planted the first flag above lwo Jima,

1350
01:54:35,964 --> 01:54:38,364
他的父母却没有被邀请
Hank's mother and father weren't invited.

1351
01:55:15,744 --> 01:55:16,794
艾拉
Ira.

1352
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:31,314
见到你真好 艾拉
It's good to see you, Ira.

1353
01:55:39,894 --> 01:55:41,734
雕像真不错
Hell of a statue.

1354
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:57,904
在那之后不久 有人找到了艾拉
It wasn't long after that that they found Ira.

1355
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:02,484
报纸上说他死于暴晒（与曝光是同一个词） 没有人去验尸了解死因
The papers said he died of exposure. There was no autopsy.

1356
01:56:17,264 --> 01:56:18,894
当时 差不多同一时间
It was about that same time

1357
01:56:18,974 --> 01:56:21,494
一天早晨  我爸爸走进车里
when my father got in his car early one morning

1358
01:56:21,574 --> 01:56:24,004
告诉我妈妈说他有事情要做
telling my mom he had something to do.

1359
01:56:30,784 --> 01:56:35,184
他开车去了威斯康星州另一端 伊基的母亲所在的的一个镇子
He drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin where Iggy's mom lived.

1360
01:56:45,234 --> 01:56:47,424
她获知儿子的死讯以后
Ever since she heard the news about her son

1361
01:56:47,504 --> 01:56:51,524
她就一直试图找出她儿子的死因 没有人告诉她
she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.

1362
01:56:53,804 --> 01:56:56,334
我不知道当时他都对她说了些什么
I never found out what he told her,

1363
01:56:56,404 --> 01:56:59,634
但是我差不多敢保证她听到的 不是真相
but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.

1364
01:57:01,184 --> 01:57:03,614
我妈妈常常问他什么让他惦念
My mother would ask him what was troubling him.

1365
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:05,274
但他从来不说
He would never say.

1366
01:57:13,124 --> 01:57:16,094
每年快到阵亡将士纪念日的时候
And every year, as it got close to Memorial Day,

1367
01:57:16,164 --> 01:57:19,994
记者们就会打电话来 要采访我爸爸
the reporters would start calling asking to interview my father.

1368
01:57:21,104 --> 01:57:23,764
不 很抱歉 他正在加拿大钓鱼
No, I'm sorry. He's fishing in Canada.

1369
01:57:24,634 --> 01:57:27,034
我们总是统一口径
We were always instructed to say the same thing.

1370
01:57:27,104 --> 01:57:29,044
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

1371
01:57:32,374 --> 01:57:34,404
麦克坎德勒先生退休后
When Mr. McCandless retired,

1372
01:57:34,484 --> 01:57:38,144
爸爸买下了他战后工作过的 一家殡仪馆
my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.

1373
01:57:38,214 --> 01:57:42,244
从此经营生意 养活家人 终此一生
He spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.

1374
01:58:30,364 --> 01:58:33,604
他从来不向我们提战争 和升旗的事情
He never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising,

1375
01:58:34,304 --> 01:58:36,294
只字不提
never told us anything.

1376
01:58:36,644 --> 01:58:40,474
我听到任何与那有关的事情 已经是在他过世以后了
The first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.

1377
01:58:57,464 --> 01:59:00,434
伊基在哪？老天
Where is he? Oh, God.

1378
01:59:02,634 --> 01:59:04,124
他不在这里 爸爸
He's not here, Dad.

1379
01:59:05,204 --> 01:59:06,294
他死了
He died.

1380
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,264
谁？谁死了？
Who? Who died?

1381
01:59:11,674 --> 01:59:12,764
伊基
Iggy.

1382
01:59:14,844 --> 01:59:15,934
伊基
Iggy.

1383
01:59:17,414 --> 01:59:20,904
老天 可怜的伊基
Christ, poor Iggy.

1384
01:59:21,924 --> 01:59:24,384
我好多年没见他了
I hadn't thought of him for years.

1385
01:59:26,354 --> 01:59:28,724
你是怎么知道伊基的？
How do you know about Iggy?

1386
01:59:29,264 --> 01:59:32,754
你病倒的时候 喊的是他的名字
You were calling for him, when you collapsed.

1387
01:59:37,834 --> 01:59:40,034
我其实也不是在找伊奇
I wasn't looking for Iggy.

1388
01:59:42,144 --> 01:59:44,004
我是在找你
I was looking for you.

1389
01:59:46,274 --> 01:59:47,764
我想…
I wanted to...

1390
01:59:50,584 --> 01:59:54,714
我想告诉你 我很抱歉 我这个父亲做得不够好
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.

1391
01:59:56,184 --> 01:59:57,914
跟你交流不够
Talked to you more.

1392
01:59:59,394 --> 02:00:00,654
我只是…
I just...

1393
02:00:04,734 --> 02:00:06,064
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1394
02:00:08,164 --> 02:00:09,324
抱歉?
Sorry?

1395
02:00:11,474 --> 02:00:14,264
你是世界上最好的父亲
You were the best father a man could have.

1396
02:00:24,144 --> 02:00:28,014
我告诉过你我们游泳的事么
Did I ever tell you they took us swimming?

1397
02:00:32,454 --> 02:00:33,944
没有 爸爸
No, Dad.

1398
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:40,124
我们当时升完旗以后 就下山
After we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain

1399
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:43,034
他们让我们游泳
and they let us swim.

1400
02:00:44,534 --> 02:00:47,064
那是最有意思的了
It was the funniest thing.

1401
02:00:47,974 --> 02:00:49,704
所有那些战斗都暂时抛到脑后
All this fighting

1402
02:00:50,674 --> 02:00:54,614
我们就跳进水里  玩得像孩子…
and we were jumping around in the water like kids.

1403
02:00:57,854 --> 02:01:01,014
我就是这样来记住伊基的
That's the way I remember Iggy now.

1404
02:01:37,584 --> 02:01:41,324
最后我终于发现 他可能是对的
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.

1405
02:01:41,394 --> 02:01:44,624
也许本来就没有英雄
Maybe there's no such thing as heroes.

1406
02:01:44,694 --> 02:01:47,294
也许本来他们就是像我爸爸 一样的凡人
Maybe there are just people like my dad.

1407
02:01:48,504 --> 02:01:49,994
我也终于明白
I finally came to understand

1408
02:01:50,064 --> 02:01:53,504
为什么他们受不了被人称作英雄
why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.

1409
02:01:54,274 --> 02:01:58,074
英雄是我们创造出来的 我们需要英雄
Heroes are something we create, something we need.

1410
02:02:02,414 --> 02:02:06,714
这样我们就能够理解那个 以前让人感到费解的问题
It's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible,

1411
02:02:06,784 --> 02:02:10,014
就是人们为什么为我们付出 那么重大的牺牲
how people could sacrifice so much for us.

1412
02:02:10,654 --> 02:02:12,924
但是对于我的父亲和他的弟兄们
But for my dad and these men,

1413
02:02:12,994 --> 02:02:16,224
他们承担生命危险 甘冒枪林弹雨
the risks they took, the wounds they suffered,

1414
02:02:16,294 --> 02:02:18,494
为的不过是他们的战友
they did that for their buddies.

1415
02:02:18,994 --> 02:02:22,794
他们为国而战 但是为友而死
They may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.

1416
02:02:22,864 --> 02:02:25,634
为了他们那些身前身后 的普通战友们
For the man in front, for the man beside them.

1417
02:02:26,934 --> 02:02:29,994
如果我们想要真正铭记这些人
And if we wish to truly honor these men,

1418
02:02:30,074 --> 02:02:33,044
就应该还他们以本色
we should remember them the way they really were,

1419
02:02:33,114 --> 02:02:35,444
正如我父亲所做的那样
the way my dad remembered them.

1420
02:03:15,424 --> 02:03:16,854
快过来 医生
Come on, Doc!

1421
02:04:33,418 --> 02:04:36,851
约翰・布雷德利 （医生）


1422
02:04:38,218 --> 02:04:41,851
瑞尼・盖格南


1423
02:04:43,418 --> 02:04:46,851
艾拉・海耶斯


1424
02:04:48,418 --> 02:04:51,851
凯斯・伊奇


1425
02:04:58,718 --> 02:05:02,151
麦克・考特尼


1426
02:05:03,418 --> 02:05:06,851
拉尔夫・伊格纳托斯基（伊基）


1427
02:05:08,718 --> 02:05:12,151
亨利・汉森（汉克）


1428
02:11:19,418 --> 02:11:26,851
1945年2月23日，海军陆战队五师二十八团 二营的官兵在此树起星条旗
