1
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,337
Hold your end up higher.

2
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,699
- You're not holding it.
- I am too.

3
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,638
- You are not.
- Don't worry about me.

4
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,484
Mmm.

5
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,507
- Isn't that suit charcoal?
- No.

6
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:24,148
Looks charcoal gray to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

7
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,585
You'd think you could

8
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,619
find a black suit for
your own father's funeral.

9
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,485
- It's black.
- No. I'm sure it's gray.

10
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,364
- It's black. Black.
- Gray. Gray!

11
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,863
- Black!
- Fine, it's black.

12
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,429
It's the grayest black
I've ever seen.

13
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,425
- Doesn't matter
what color it is!
- Oww!

14
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,268
I'm sorry, Pop.
I'm sorry!

15
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,213
[ thunks, splashes ]

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,490
Quick!
Get him out of there!

17
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,762
He's halfway to
the harbor by now, bub.

18
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,791
Ah, well.

19
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:14,694
[ man ] "I leave you
not just a model factory,

20
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:18,792
but something
infinitely more valuable.

21
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:23,956
The future of string...
itself."

22
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,837
- [ explosion ]
- [ indistinct shouting ]

23
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,044
"And thus it is
my dying wish

24
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:41,347
that my two sons run
Smuntz String together."

25
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:44,722
Great. Let's stick a
"For Sale" sign on the lawn
and see what we can get.

26
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,952
Ernie, we're not
supposed to sell it.

27
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,787
We're supposed to
run it together.

28
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,732
Either way, this
Godforsaken museum piece

29
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,959
is not worth a dime,
now is it, Lars?

30
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,604
Some things are more
important than money, Ernie.

31
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,470
Notice it's always
the financially challenged
who say that?

32
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,501
Uh, please, please.

33
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,937
"I also bequeath to you
my personal effects,

34
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:11,314
including my ceramic egg...

35
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,521
...half box of Cuban cigars...

36
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,091
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,460
- My collection of spoons."
- [ clattering ]

38
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:29,363
[ Ernie ] My goodness, what
a treasure. What a legacy.

39
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,397
Spoons! Spoons!

40
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,473
So many spoons,
so little time.

41
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:38,772
Oh! And, of course,
something no household
should be without.

42
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,136
The ceramic egg!
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

43
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,654
Can I have the egg?
Can I? Huh? Huh? No.

44
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,818
- I want you to have it.
- Fine, I'll take it!

45
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,418
If you find any real estate
on that desk, let me know.

46
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,392
It seems there is also a house.

47
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,922
- [ together ] A house?
- Yes, 5120 Nortondale.

48
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:02,597
[ chuckles ] Your father
acquired it many years ago
as payment of a debt.

49
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,700
He never lived there,
but it's interesting.

50
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,004
It seems the previous owner

51
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,736
was found locked
in a trunk in the attic.

52
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,912
Wait a minute.
Is it worth anything?

53
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:18,081
He was able to borrow $50,000
against it to pay his workers.

54
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,481
Really? So what
is its value today?

55
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,624
$50,000.

56
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:28,191
Great. A worthless house and
a broken-down string factory.

57
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,761
Oh, well. At least the day
wasn't a total loss.

58
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,392
Thanks for the stogies, Pop.

59
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,666
Wait. You can't go. We have
to go through all these papers.

60
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:48,476
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got a date with the mayor.

61
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,949
- [ thunderclap ]
- [ reporters chattering ]

62
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:57,181
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor,
over here! Mr. Mayor!

63
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,087
Do you think your recent
triple heart bypass

64
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,019
will affect your
campaign strategy?

65
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,994
Now, Leslie,
I'm just here to eat.

66
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:09,902
Ah, Monsieur  Maire,
Madame Maire,
welcome to Chez Ernie.

67
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,900
[ French accent ]
Ah, what an honor it is to
have you in my humble bistro.

68
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,774
Suivez-moi.
Oh, you brought the little ones.

69
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:21,114
The little bicycle thieves.
Bonjour! Our very best table.

70
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,911
- Have you lost a little weight?
- Oh, I...

71
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,084
I think so!
I think you may be buff!

72
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,183
[ laughs ] Je suis enchantÃ©
pour vÃ´tre beautÃ©.

73
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,116
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, Monsieur Ernie...

74
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,962
[ chuckles ] Excusez-moi.
Au revoir, les enfants!

75
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,825
[ sighs ] The air's
not so thin at the top.

76
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,904
Just like the old man to die
before I hit it big.

77
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,070
Remember, everyone.
Attention to detail is vital!

78
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:58,707
Presentation is everything.

79
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:02,646
No, no, no, no, no!
These I must deliver myself.

80
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,553
[ roars ]

81
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,132
Duck a l'orange avec du
quack sauce...

82
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,732
And, for ze mayor,
la spÃ©cialitÃ© de la maison,

83
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:22,936
lobster loaf Ã  la Ernst
ou la bibliothÃ¨que.

84
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,040
- Oh...
- Bon appÃ©tit.

85
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,242
[ exhales ]

86
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,136
Ah, bonjour!

87
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,807
How does it feel
to be serving the mayor

88
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,675
on the eve of his
reelection?

89
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,024
Well, Leslie...

90
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,078
- May I call you Leslie?
- Ah, of course.

91
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,888
Crunchy! Hmm.
I love the almonds.

92
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,155
Leslie, cuisine,
she is a fickle mistress...

93
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,065
- Ee-yew! Look!
- [ squishing ]

94
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,999
- A cockroach!
- [ shocked whispering ]

95
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,313
That's only
half a cockroach.

96
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:03,678
- Daddy! You ate the head!
- Honey, are you OK?

97
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:19,025
[ screaming ] Not again!

98
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,929
[ reporters ] Was this an
accident, or did you murder...

99
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,802
Clear!

100
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:27,941
- I can do that better!
- [ crying, blubbering ]

101
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:40,076
[ man ] Smuntz String
is a relic of history.

102
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,723
You don't make string by twining
two strands together anymore.

103
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:49,162
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

104
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,889
But that's not string.
That's cord.

105
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,125
- Exactly.
- Twine is yesterday.

106
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,831
- Single-strand cord is today.
- Zeppco International

107
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,234
has been interested in
your factory for years,

108
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,066
but your father
refused to sell.

109
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,871
We are hopin' you'd be
a little smarter.

110
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,173
Zeppco is willin'
to buy you out,

111
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,305
and bring this museum
into the 21st century.

112
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,111
'Course, we would keep you on
as a string consultant,

113
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,784
with a huge salary
and a hefty pension.

114
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,888
So...
What do you say?

115
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,387
[ sighs ]

116
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,883
- My sons...
- [ whispers ] Ernie.

117
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:48,421
- Ernie!
- Yeah. Just a sec.

118
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,888
I want you...
to have... something.

119
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,190
My most prized possession.

120
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:59,863
[ sighs ] Oh,
it's a piece of string.

121
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:04,933
Not just any string.
The string.

122
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:09,935
I found it
my first day in America.

123
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,200
What's with the string?

124
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,238
It's been in my pocket
for 60 years.

125
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,214
Here! I want
you two to share it.

126
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,914
Maybe it'll bring you
closer together.

127
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,148
You haven't
talked much lately.

128
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,493
- Yeah. [ grunts ]
- Ah! What are you doing?

129
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,289
- I'm breaking it in half.
- No!

130
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,121
- No?
- I want you to share it.

131
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,488
- Forever.
- Sure, Pop, sure.

132
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,127
Here, you carry it the first
50 years, I'll take it the next.

133
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,204
- Sure.
- Turn up the morphine drip.

134
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,973
I heard that.

135
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:49,235
Promise me...
that you will never sell...

136
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,406
...Smuntz String...

137
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,915
...to one of those
big conglomerates.

138
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,819
Keep it between you.

139
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,962
Brothers. Family.

140
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:06,429
- Promise.
- I promise, Pop.

141
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,299
- [ Lars's voice ] I promise.
- So you were sayin'?

142
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,441
- I'll have to pass.
- What?

143
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,110
A world without string
is chaos.

144
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,354
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

145
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,550
- No, no! Don't!
- Oh!

146
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,993
You... You used to love string!

147
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,260
That was before,
when I was dating

148
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,418
the son of a wealthy
string magnate!

149
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,927
Not now, when I am married
to the half-owner

150
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,331
of a worthless deathtrap!

151
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,865
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today.

152
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,871
April, I've got
new ideas for the factory.

153
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,944
You know,
I've got big plans!

154
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:57,043
Don't you see, Lars? That's
all you've ever had are plans.

155
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:02,117
But my life is passing me by,
and I... I need more!

156
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,489
There's no air in the middle
class. I can't breathe here.

157
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,519
- Please, April, don't go.
- [ sighs ]

158
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,326
I'm not going anywhere.

159
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,335
In a few brief moments,

160
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,377
the joy of the holidays
was shattered,

161
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,082
and the world changed
for many people.

162
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,945
Mayor McKrinkle died this
afternoon at 4:30 p.m., at our
Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

163
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,887
Doctors here say the
official cause of death is

164
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,633
heart failure due to the
mayor's recent culinary
disaster.

165
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,229
And, once the hottest
restaurant on the wharf,

166
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:53,272
Chez Ernie has been condemned
and scheduled for demolition.

167
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't think I ordered my
cheese sandwich with capers.

168
00:13:56,236 --> 00:14:00,006
- Live to Leslie Reinhart
for an update.
- I'm sorry.

169
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,880
If there is a villain in this
tragedy, it is Ernie Smuntz.

170
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,450
- Once the whiz kid of the
local restaurant scene...
- You're on TV again!

171
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,579
What? Oh.

172
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,175
You know what this is?
I'll tell ya.

173
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,988
- Guilt by accusation.
- No capers.

174
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,321
No capers? But that's
just grilled cheese.
What's the point?

175
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,287
Why don't they
eat out of a trough?

176
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:23,926
Which one of you palateless
sheep sent my sandwich back?

177
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,465
- Hi, Ernie!
- Lars?

178
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,340
[ sighs ]

179
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,109
[ Ernie ] When I'm
in the kitchen, I cook.

180
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,369
I can't control every single
thing that goes on in there.

181
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,247
[ Lars ] It really isn't fair
for everybody to blame you.

182
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,948
You didn't do
anything wrong.

183
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,180
Yes, but society always
needs someone to persecute.

184
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,916
A scapegoat,
someone to demonize.

185
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,023
The same thing
happened to Galileo.

186
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,155
Really?
That's unbelievable.

187
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,630
With a cockroach
and everything?

188
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,929
No. The point is,

189
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,033
I put everything I had
into that restaurant.

190
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,425
It was my livelihood
and my home.

191
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,697
In one fatal bite, it was
all taken away from me.

192
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,305
If only we could
sell the factory.

193
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,608
I'd let you stay with me,
you know, but, uh,

194
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,711
- April threw me out.
- Oh, that's too bad.

195
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,515
Yeah, well, don't worry
about me, though, Ernie.

196
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,588
This is temporary.
April's been like this
since high school.

197
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,958
- She'll be back. I...
- Would you look at them?

198
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,529
Sleeping in the street.
Pitiful.

199
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,960
If I had a house,
I'd sleep in it!

200
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,498
Ernie, do you remember how
close we were as kids?

201
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,974
No.

202
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:38,413
Hey! Merry Christmas!

203
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,280
Yeah, I was on top once too.

204
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,049
But there's only one way
to go from there, and that's
down, baby, down!

205
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,350
- Oh, ho!
- [ coins clattering ]

206
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,393
Ernie.

207
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,619
Ernie! Ernie, there was
a quarter in there.

208
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:01,226
- * Christmas Eve will find me
- A quarter? You think so small.

209
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,201
Look at the bigger picture.

210
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,230
You have no home, you have
no wife, you have no money.

211
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,366
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

212
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,712
- * I'll be home for Christmas
- Ernie, it's Christmas.

213
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,040
Instead of dwelling on
what we don't have,

214
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,376
we should be thankful
for what we do have.

215
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:24,121
* If only in my dreams

216
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,522
[ woman ]
That was very good.

217
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,371
[ Ernie ] What a dump.

218
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,442
[ creaking ]

219
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:26,675
Wow! I can't believe Pops
never told us about this house.

220
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,448
It's huge.

221
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,223
[ Ernie ] This is just the kind
of house I'd expect him to have.

222
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,593
It's just like him.
Cold and spooky.

223
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,330
[ rustling ]

224
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,100
- Wow! Did you feel that?
- What?

225
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:48,271
I got a chill. You shouldn't
talk about Pop like that.

226
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,201
Really?
What's this do for you?

227
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,308
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

228
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,211
He didn't mean it, Pop.

229
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,786
Ernie! Ernie!

230
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,463
Only one bed.
I'll flip you for it.

231
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,096
Heads.

232
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,236
[ ringing ]

233
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,562
- [ scratching ]
- Ernie?

234
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,829
- Ernie. Ernie.
- [ groaning ]

235
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,459
You asleep?

236
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,556
- I was.
- [ scratching continues ]

237
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,568
How can you sleep
through that?

238
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,470
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh. That.

239
00:18:56,503 --> 00:19:01,273
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

240
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,238
[ scratching continues ]

241
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,907
[ creaking ]

242
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,901
Mothballs.

243
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,242
[ screaming ]

244
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,938
- Hey, stop it!
- Hey! Ow!

245
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,410
[ grunting ]

246
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,382
[ whispering ] Ernie! Ernie!

247
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,346
[ groaning ]

248
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,820
- [ exhales ]
- [ rattling ]

249
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,789
[ grunts ]

250
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:16,884
- [ thunderclap ]
- [ screaming ]

251
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,355
Wait. Wait a minute.
Stop. Stop!

252
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,562
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

253
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,725
[ panting ]

254
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,836
- [ screaming ]
- Ah, shut up!

255
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,876
[ scratching ]

256
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,377
It's coming from up there!

257
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:54,722
- One, two, three!
- [ grunting ]

258
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,488
Ooh! [ panting ]

259
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,898
- It's just a mouse.
- What?

260
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,341
It's just a mouse.
Never mind.

261
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:12,708
- [ grunting, groaning ]
- Hey, there are some
posters up here.

262
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,309
Oh! Stand still!

263
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,945
- [ smashing ]
- Ah!

264
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:27,554
- [ screaming ]
- [ spitting ]

265
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,956
- They're blueprints.
- Wow!

266
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,731
Wait a minute.
Look at this date. 1876.

267
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,802
A centennial house could
actually be worth something.

268
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,341
Look, this must be the
architect. Here, look.

269
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,509
Charles Lyle LaRue.

270
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,476
Charles Lyle LaRue.

271
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,379
Charles Lyle LaRue?

272
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,812
[ thumps ]

273
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,015
Charles Lyle LaRue.

274
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:04,357
Charles Lyle LaRue!

275
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,131
Charles Lyle LaRue!

276
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,599
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

277
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:16,402
- It's bold yet subtle.
- Classical yet nontraditional.

278
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,736
The missing LaRue.

279
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,881
The rumored design completed
shortly before his committal
is a rumor no more.

280
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,709
Before his committal?

281
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,054
[ chuckles ] Well, I'm just
glad he finished the place

282
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,879
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

283
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,146
[ guffaws ]

284
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:36,624
So, what do you think
a magnificent edifice
like this is worth?

285
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,027
Properly restored,
of course.

286
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:43,628
Well, his Parma Charnel
House went for six,

287
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,033
but that was ten years ago,

288
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,104
and it didn't have this
exquisite molding.

289
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,103
I see. I can't get enough
of good molding.

290
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,874
Did you hear that?
$600,000.

291
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,977
- [ exhales ] Ernie.
- Alexander Falko!

292
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:02,948
Back! Gentlemen,
congratulations.

293
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,122
Congratulations
on your find.

294
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:08,561
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.
Glass of rainwater, please.

295
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:11,888
Mr. Falko is the world's
leading collector of LaRues.

296
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:16,004
Sort of like collecting stamps,
but they're bigger, right?

297
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,798
I'll get to the point. LaRue.

298
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,901
I have his books.
I have his letters.

299
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,873
- You see these shoes?
- [ together ] LaRues?

300
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,773
No, but I'm sure
he would have loved them.

301
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:28,975
Vegetarian snack.
I own... [ chewing ]

302
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:33,548
...forty-two LaRue houses.
Forty-two. I want to make it 43.

303
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,920
You tell me how
I'm going to do this.

304
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,018
Tell me how I will do this.
You help me. How will I do this?

305
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,021
Well, I'm, uh,
glad you asked.

306
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,023
His, uh, Parma Charnel
House went for six,

307
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,726
but that was ten years ago,
and it didn't have this molding.

308
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,499
A find like this in today's
market is worth twice as much.

309
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,870
- He's a LaRue connoisseur.
- Guilty as charged.

310
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,940
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

311
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,909
No, no, no, no, no.
I couldn't possibly be so crass
as to allow you to do that.

312
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,110
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

313
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,982
- Auction?
- Auction?

314
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,881
It'd be grossly unfair
of us to deprive others

315
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,124
of the chance to bid
on the missing LaRue.

316
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:15,689
Um... May I have just one moment
with my brother, please?

317
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:18,462
- Sure. Of course.
- Excuse me.

318
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,192
- What is this?
- It's the first...

319
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,758
- What is this? No!
- The first I've heard of...

320
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,636
What are you doing?

321
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,638
What am I doing? I'm
answering your prayers.

322
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,540
These pigeons are ripe
for the plucking.

323
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,672
Put them in a room together.
Try and outbid each other?

324
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,737
We can make $700,000,
$800,000 easy.

325
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,176
[ sighs ]
Oh, man, smart!

326
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,910
- [ bangs ]
- Ooh!

327
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,247
- You're going to get this one.
- Don't talk to me! Shh!

328
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:46,852
So when is the, uh, earliest
we can set the auction?

329
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,816
Well, I suppose all
arrangements could be
completed within the week.

330
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,957
- A week it is.
- Great!

331
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,262
- You're smarter than you look.
- [ together ] Thank you.

But know this.

333
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:04,269
I have never paid more than ten
million for a house in my life!

334
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:24,018
- OK, see you then.
- Yeah. Thanks for stopping by.

335
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,729
Ten million linen napkins.

Five million bales of
top-grade cotton fiber.

Forty thousand hot lamps
complete with rotating
plate-warming trays.

Two thousand twine threaders,

anything she's ever wanted!

She loves china.

[ fan blades whooshing ]

344
00:25:57,624 --> 00:26:00,664
[ Ernie ] I'm gonna build an
Olympic-sized swimming pool

345
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:03,663
and fill it with piÃ±a coladas
and a college sorority.

346
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,670
[ Lars ] If only Pop were
here to see this house!

347
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,213
He did. He just wasn't
smart enough to sell it.

348
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,969
Lars, we've turned a corner.

349
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,107
Our future is
staring us in the face.

350
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:22,183
All we have to do is grab it,
baste it and scarf it down!

351
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,188
Aha! We've finally found
our friend's home.

352
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,727
Well, I bought a little
present for ya, buddy.

353
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,870
It's just
a little mouse.

354
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,970
Do we really
have to kill it?

355
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:46,812
Yes. Listen to me. A single
vermin can bring you down.

356

Hey, last night, did you
happen to hear the, uh...

- Oh, yeah. Let's see.
- Yeah.

365
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,915
Well, where'd he go?

366
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,721
I don't know.
Maybe it snapped by itself.

367
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:13,331
I don't believe it.
He snapped the trap,

368
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,199
ate the olive, and left
the pit just to mock us.

369
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:21,329
I think you're giving him
a little too much credit.

370
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,997
Mice don't mock. They don't
have a sense of humor or irony.

371
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,767
He's not sitting in his hole
in a smoking jacket

372
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:31,177
sipping cognac, and giggling
to himself, "I left the pit."

373
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,750
The trap snapped itself, the
olive flew off, and he ate it.

374
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,281
It's that simple. But now
that he knows we're here,

375
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,346
he won't come within
a mile of us.

376
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,085

- Careful, careful!
- Don't. Don't touch me.
You'll snap it.

- You're not doin' it right.
- Please, let me concentrate.

this tub fits in

Jacuzzi tub, Lars.
It's a Jacuzzi tub.

407
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,793
And this isn't just a house.
It's a LaRue.

408

Of course it fits in

- Luxury is timeless.
- How much, Ernie?

It was a steal at $1,200.

to empty a mousetrap
without getting caught.

If he snaps
one of these babies,

a chain reaction will
start snapping them all.

427

He'll panic,
and the law of averages says
one of them has to nab him.

Ask your boss at Rimpy's
for an advance.

You can pay him back
after the auction.

- Find the one you want,

500
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:29,622
and I'll spay
or neuter it myself.

501
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,115
Well, these are
all kittens.

502
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:36,257
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

503
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,064
That's a switch. Most people
like the cute little ones.

504
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,067
- Experience with what?
- Mouse hunting.

505
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,769
All cats are good mousers.

506
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:46,071
But we have huge rats,
the size of sumo wrestlers.

507
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,974
Lots of them, so we need
a ferocious feline,

508
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,677
preferably with a
history of mental illness.

509
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,050
I'm talkin'
one mean pussy.

510
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,219
Yeah! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

511
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,148
Do you have any of those
knocking around your cages?

512
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,845
Funny you should ask.

513
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:04,687
I had all but given up
on anyone wanting him.

514
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:08,193
We were about
to gas him again.

515
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,797
- Again?
- Again?

516
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,669
He's spent most of his whole
life in that box, I expect.

517
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,740
- [ growling ]
- Catzilla?

518
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,769
The guys who clean up
call him that.

519
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:22,565
But, uh, you can call him
anything you want.

520
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,978
I'd say he looks
like a Fluffy.

521
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,980
[ snarling ]

522
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,150
Ah, poor little Catzilla.

523
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,354
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

524
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,257
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

525
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,761
- [ yowling ]
- You're a stupid cat,
aren't you?

526
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,764
- [ growling ]
- [ chuckles ] Yes, you are.
And you're ugly.

527
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,767
- Extremely ugly!
- [ yowling ]

528
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,999
[ electricity crackling ]

529
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:55,339
- Oh! Oh, you little bastard.
- We'll take him.

530
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:00,383
- [ grunting ]
- [ cat screeching ]

531
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,921
- Here, boy.
- [ growling ]

532
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:13,757
- [ squeaking ]
- [ yowling ]

533
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,756
Ooh... He's got
the scent now.

534
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,325
Yeah, uh,
go get him, boy.

535
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:23,674
Oh, easy, easy,
easy, easy!

536
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,972
- [ smashing ]
- Oh!

537
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:34,706
Wow. I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

538
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:39,047
- [ together ] Almost!
- [ laughing ]

539
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,251

540
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:49,190
[ growling ]

541
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:12,121
[ roaring ]

542
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:19,222
[ meowing ]

543
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:30,171
[ notes playing ]

544
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,309
[ cat yowling ]

545
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,217
[ Ernie ] It's time to stop
worrying about that mouse,

546
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,823
and start thinking about how
we're going to locate $1,200.

547
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:53,826
[ Lars ] Don't worry, Ernie.
The workers will help us out.

548
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:56,859
[ panting ]
You see, the truth is,

549
00:44:56,895 --> 00:45:00,795
we don't actually
have any money.

550
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,302
Aww!

551
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:14,411
We may have to defer
your next paycheck or two.

552
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,815
- [ moaning, shouting ]
- So my brother and I can pay

553
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:20,118
the mortgage on the house.
It's the missing LaRue!

554
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,491
[ Lars ] I mean, there's no
need for violence, you know.

555
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,290
[ Lars ] Put that thing down.
Whoa!

556
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:40,273
[ banging ]

557
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,149
Ernie! [ panting ]

558
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:54,051
- What's the matter?
- Well, the, uh, the workers.

559
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,915
They didn't react as
positively as I had hoped.

560
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:59,855
[ shouting ]

561
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:03,261
No? Uh, what are you doing?

562
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,264
You could fit through
this window, right?

563
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:10,366
- What? Wh... I guess so.
- Come on. [ screaming ]

564
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,097
Aah!

565
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,182
Oh, but, Lars,
that was our last resort!

566
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,108
We're gonna have to find
the money someplace else.

567
00:46:38,063 --> 00:46:39,873
Gosh, it's a shame
nobody's interested

568
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:44,068
- in buying the factory.
- Yeah, yeah, it's a shame.

569
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,602
But who'd be stupid enough
to buy the factory, right?

570
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,267
[ chuckling ] Yeah.

571
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,319

Ah, you must be, Caesar.

578
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:40,145
Well, Mr. Caesar, uh, glad you
could get here so quickly...

579
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:42,145
Shh!

580
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,592

[ sniffing ]

582
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:14,418
You have mice.

He's good.

Don't forget to get
toothpaste and Saran Wrap.

586
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,527
We're in sort of a hurry.

587
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,266
I want to warn you
about this mouse.

588
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,401
[ shouting ] Yeah.
You got asbestos, all right.

589
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,212
I'll bet it's up in
the ceiling, mostly.

590
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:43,082
Shouldn't take me more than
a day or two to remove it.

591
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,224
[ mouthing words ]

592
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:51,691
[ shouting ] OK, then.
Um, so we're gonna go upstairs.

593
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,762
[ shouting ] All right,
well, we'll all go upstairs.

594
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,732
- Yeah.
- [ stomping ]

595
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:00,503
OK, then. Yeah.

596
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,673
What are you doing?

597
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:11,406
- He's not listening anymore.
- Oh.

598
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:14,652
Good. Well,
you're the expert.

599
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,379
I just hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

600
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,685
We've been trying to catch
this little menace all week.

601
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:24,458
Here's your problem.
Normal people are not

602
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:28,189
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

603
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:31,456
You have to get
inside their mind.

604
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:35,426
You have to know
what they want, need.

605
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:38,136
You have to think like a mouse.

606
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,739
If you can do that,
if you can think like a mouse,

607
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,342
you can anticipate their moves.

608
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,705
Then, boom!
Sayonara mouse.

609
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:52,276
- [ sighs ]
- Well, got some great stuff...

610
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:56,524
- Whoa! Never touch that!
- [ screaming ] Whoa!

611
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,594
- All right!
- What is it?

612
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:05,734
- [ panting ] The big one.
- It's a flea bomb!

613
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:10,273
- Works on mice too.
- Yeah? Well, it better.

614
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,771
Because we can't handle
any more intrusions.

615
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,673
Sure. That's how
you perceive it.

616
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:21,806
But, to that mouse,
you are the intruder.

617
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,523
[ shouting ]

618
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,858
If we work fast,
we can make enough string
to meet our orders.

619
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,464
That's the spirit. Just a few
cases, so we can keep the LaRue.

620
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,427
- Good luck.
- Wait! Where are you going?

621
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:43,696
- Aren't you gonna help?
- I have to run a errand.

622
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,574
All you have to do
is make $1,200 worth.

623
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,243
How long can that take?

624
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:49,672
Light a match. They're
frightened by fire.

625
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,107

With a... hmm...

634
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:38,809
What's this?
A slight calcium deficiency.

635
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,953
That's interesting.

636
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,759
Uh, hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

637
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,019
This the business representative
for Zeppco International?

00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:57,828
Vinny? Hi, Vinny. Oh, I'm
glad I can call you Vinny.

639
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:02,402
Uh, my brother and I
have decided to reconsider
your generous offer.

640
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,873
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

641
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:07,102
Oh, no, not at the office.

642
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,907
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

643
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:21,153

00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:25,648
- [ thud ]
- [ chiming ]

Uh, you must be
Mrs. Lars Smuntz?

646
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:45,671
- I'm afraid that status
is in transition.
- Oh, well, is Lars in?

647
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:50,813
- I'd like to discuss
preparations for the auction.
- The auction?

648
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,476
[ panting ]

649
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,860
Careful, Lars.
You might catch a cold.

650
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,464
April!

651
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:18,642
You look like you could
use some warming up.

652
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:28,981
[ Caesar ] 1300 hours.
I've activated the
Squeak Seeker 2000.

00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,783
I'm about to join
with the prey.

654
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:50,842
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the plasma screen.

655
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,798
Stand by.

656
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,550
Junk.

657
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,728
Nothing works.

Ah, nuts!

Twelve hundred dollars.

663
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,616
Lie still, Mr. Smuntz. You've
been hit by a bus.

664
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:52,663
- I feel fine. What time is it?
- You may have had a concussion.

665
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,130
- We're gonna do X rays.
- You don't understand, doc.

666
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,289
I have to get out.
I might still have a chance.

667
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,197
We saved your hat.

668
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,629
- I'm sorry. Are you family?
- Yes, we are sisters.

669
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:03,997
Great. There's paperwork

670
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,944
- I need for you to fill.
- He an organ donor?

671
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,910
Don't let them.
I don't know them.

672
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,068
Oh, I'm Hilde,
and this is Ingrid.

673
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,707
We are hair models
from Belgium.

674
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,383
Belgian hair models.
How exotic.

675
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:16,351
Listen to me, doc.

676
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,820
I need to find a phone before I
miss out on the deal of my life.

677
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,750
- Your brother's delirious.
- I am not their brother!

678
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:25,217
- I don't have any sisters!
- Ernie, are you OK?

679
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,855
I came as soon as I heard.

680
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:29,391
Why are you wearing
a pink overcoat?

681
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:34,355
Because April gave us
the $1,200!

682
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,108
Gave you the money? Don't think
she heard about the auction?

683
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,279
No. I didn't even tell her
about the auction until
after she took me back.

684
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:51,820
She just showed up at the
factory, took off her coat
and begged me to take her.

685
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:54,419
[ sighs ]
We made love in a way

686
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:57,091
I've only ever seen
in nature films.

687
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,421
Wow. I almost
can't believe it.

688
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:03,356
I'll be able to open up
another restaurant,
you're back with April,

689
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,163
and you'll even be able to
keep that worthless factory.

690
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:09,096
You know it's funny that you
call the factory worthless,

691
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:11,803
because, well,
there's something

692
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,196
I probably should've
mentioned before...

693
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:18,808
Yeah? Well, I guess I have
something to confess too.

694
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,377
Hey, isn't that
Caesar's truck?

695
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:37,432
- Oh, my God!
- Caesar! What happened?

696
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,961
Please, sir.
He's not well.

697
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:40,826
Try to think.
Did you kill the mouse?

698
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,795
What's that? Horse?

699
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,773
- Fiendish! I won't eat it.
- No.

700
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:53,178
[ clicking teeth,
squeaking like a mouse ]

701
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,350
How'd you find him?
Where was he?

702
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,349
- 911 call. No voice.
- [ Caesar ] Exterminate them!

703
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,422
We could hear screaming
in the background.

704
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,350
He was locked in a trunk
in the attic.

705
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,086
We'll call you
if we get any leads.

706
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:24,881
[ rewinding ]

707
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:31,854
- What's that?
- [ footsteps, door creaking ]

708
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:34,792
[ Caesar on tape recorder ]
Put that down. What is that?

709
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,849

[ muffled groaning,
crashing sound ]

711
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:40,016
That tickles!

712

[ screaming, glass breaking ]

713
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,825
I don't think we're dealing
with an ordinary mouse.

[ crashing ]

My kitchen!

716
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:13,123
Looks like Caesar decided
to make himself a sandwich.

717
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:19,402
[ Ernie] Pickles,
arugula and capers.

718
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:23,529
He toasted the side
with the cheese,

719
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:28,967
but not the other side,
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

720
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,880
How did he know that?

721
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

722
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:08,551
Aha!

723
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:24,130
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

724
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:33,068
[ grunting ] Lars, I'm stuck!

725
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,313
Get me out of here!
I can't breathe!

726
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:39,179
- I'll get a flashlight.
- Hurry!

727
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,453
- OK, Ernie, I got it!
- I can see that.

728
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:52,616
Wh... Oh!

729
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:57,486
Hang on, Ernie.
The flashlight's broken.

730
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:07,473
- OK, Ernie. I got a light.
- Great.

731
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,437
[ sniffing ]

732
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:15,976
[ Ernie ] Lars,
do you smell something?

733
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,015
Smells like gas.

734
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:23,946
[ Lars grunting, groaning ]

735
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:36,694
[ both whimpering,
muttering angrily ]

736
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,171
What are you gonna do?

737
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:49,413
I'm gonna kill that unspeakable
thing once and for all.

738
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:52,139
- Come on, Ernie, no, no...
- Stand back, Lars!

739
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,106
I'm a man on a mission!

740
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:57,584
Look, this is how accidents
happen! Come on, Ernie.

741
01:06:57,614 --> 01:06:59,384
Put the gun down.
Calm down. Come on.

742
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,186
I'm gonna blow his
furry little head off,

743
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,059
and I'm gonna splatter his
devious little mouse brain

744
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,159
from here to kingdom come!

745
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,191
No, no! You're gonna
blow a hole in the wall.

746
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,726
- Come on!
- It'll be worth it!

747
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,700
Think of the auction!
For God's sakes!

748
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,230
Think of the money, Ernie!
The money?

749
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:18,696
They're gonna cut our price
if there's holes in the walls.

750
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:21,335
- The money?
- Yeah, the money, the moola.

751
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:26,679
- [ Ernie ] There he goes.
- Shoot! Shoot!

752

Yes... You hit the piano!
You hit the piano!

- Look...
- Shh!

01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:51,435
What are you, crazy? You're
blowin' the whole house up!

755
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,738
The only thing you haven't
hit is the mouse!

756
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,810
Why don't you give somebody
else a chance with that gun?

757
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,680
- You're doing a wonderful job.
- [ rolling sound ]

[ Vinny on machine ]
Mr. Smuntz, this is
Vinny from Zeppco calling.

766
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:16,722
We waited in the square
for over an hour,
but you never showed.

767
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,793
We do not appreciate
being treated this way,

768
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:23,593
especially after your brother
already turned down our
generous offer.

769
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:27,197
Consider our
proposal withdrawn.

770
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,739
- Betrayed by my own brother!
- Betrayal?

771
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:38,642
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

772
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,475
You should have told me
about that offer!

773
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,580
- Half that factory is mine.
- And half is mi...

774
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:49,754
And half is mine, including the
half that you tried to sell.

775
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:52,586
Yes, and would've, if it hadn't
been for that stinkin' bus!

776
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,592
Bus? You can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

777
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,596
You ruin everything!

778
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:01,328
Me? You...
You blame me for this?

779
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,965
Well, look! You blew
a hole in the floor!

780
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,840
Yeah, well, I distinctly
remember somebody yelling,
"Shoot! Shoot!"

781
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,541
Yeah, well, you've never
listened to me before!

782

- And you know why?
- Why?

783
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,682
Because I have
no respect for you!

784
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,652
Spending your whole life
in that stupid factory!

785
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,853
It's tragic.

786
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,785
Think I didn't have other things
I wanted to do with my life?

787
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,321
You think I didn't have
ambitions of my own?

788
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:30,927
- Come on. You loved string.
- I didn't love string!

789
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,530
Could've fooled me. You and Pop

I slaved over that meal, making
sure everything was perfect.

795
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:53,315
Did he say, "Thanks, Ernie,
it was delicious"? No.

796

He only noticed the string
I had tied it with.

797
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,359
He was crazy!

798
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:05,362
But I still wanted his approval.

799
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:09,325
I didn't leave, Lars.
I was cast out.

Here it is!

809
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,626
Yeah, give it to me,
then. Go ahead!

810

You killed him!

811
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,770
I didn't even know
he was there!

Think of all the trouble we
could have saved ourselves,

813
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,742
if we just threw fruit at him
in the first place!

- What are you waiting for?

with a shovel.

- Why not?
- Look at him. He's pathetic.

[ Ernie ] Pathetic?
He's Hitler with a tail.

Look at him
just lying there.

It just doesn't feel
very sportsmanlike.

01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,526
Ah, I forgot to
put holes in the box.

832
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,537
[ laughing wickedly ]

833
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:14,124
Hasta la vista,
you little rat bastard!

834
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:17,189
Come on.
We got work to do.

835
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,096
Two days till payday,
my friend.

836
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,810
[ speaking Spanish ]

837
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,652
Perfect. It's the architectural
find of the decade.

838
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:18,716
Oh, let's go...
[ continues indistinct ]

839
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,455
- Shall we?
- Yes.

840
01:14:30,534 --> 01:14:34,774
Well, it wasn't easy,
but we finally made it.

841
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:39,984
Mm-hmm. Ernie, I want
you to have something.

842
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:45,049
[ exhales ]

843
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:48,479
Pop's lucky piece of string.

844
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,619
I'm glad you kept it.

845
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:54,715
He, uh, he
wanted us to share it.

846
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:56,588
I don't know why, but...

847
01:14:56,626 --> 01:15:01,156
I think, if he were here right
now, he'd be proud of you.

848
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,536
I think he'd be
proud of us.

849
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,239
[ doorbell ringing ]

850
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:15,207
Hello, ladies.
How magnificent! Welcome!

851
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:18,284
Lars, you remember
Ingrid and Hilde.

852
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,124
[ both ] Hello.

853
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,249
Ladies, your hair
looks positively biblical!

854
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:25,886
[ together ] Oh, thank you.

855
01:15:27,591 --> 01:15:31,061
Well, if you will excuse me,
I have to check on my crÃªpes.

856
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:38,303
Keep the champagne coming, boys.

857
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,344
The more they drink,
the higher they bid.

858
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,809
Hey, you boys put on
quite a shindig here, huh?

859
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,910
- Thank you so much, Mr. Falko.
- [ moaning ]

860
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:01,264
You know, it would be
very, very sad,

861
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:05,130
if you boys put on this
auction and nobody bid.

862
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,361
That'd put a crimp in our
evening, but I don't think

863
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,827
there's any danger of that.

864
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,766
I don't know.
There's a lot of Eurotrash

865
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,801
out there
scarfin' up the shrimps.

866
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:20,941
I tell you what. You
call off the auction, now,

867
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:26,047
and I will write you
a check for ten millions.

868
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:32,292
As insanely generous as that is,
I have to decline,

869
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,991
but I do appreciate
your thoughtful concern.

870
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:38,355
Enjoy the party.

871
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,674
Are you interested
in spooling?

872
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,998
Oh, sure. My father...

873
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,373
I mean, my brother and I
own a string factory.

874
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:50,043
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

875
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:54,343
I would love to see
your factory sometime.

876
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:57,147
- Really?
- [ doorbell rings ]

877
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,051
Oh, hello, April.

878
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,153
What a surprise. Just dropping
by for no reason, I suppose?

879
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,816
Does a wife need a reason?
Oh, are you entertaining?

880
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:10,156
- Don't you mean ex-wife?
- Not quite yet.

881
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:16,298
- Hakuna matata.
- This crÃªpe, c'est magnifique.

882
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:20,242
- The raisins are a nice touch.
- They are good, aren't they?

883
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:22,907
Raisins?

884
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:51,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

885
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,340
We are about to
start the auction.

886
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,809
Lars, I don't know whether
to congratulate you

887
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,082
or wish you luck.

888
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,049
- Wish us luck!
- Hello, April.

889
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,708
- Oh, hello.
- Nice to see you again.

890
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:07,048
I didn't know you
knew our lawyer.

891
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,393
It's just an expression.

892
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,018
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

893
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:16,227
for joining us for
this momentous occasion,

894
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:18,859
the auction of our
one item up for bid,

895
01:18:18,895 --> 01:18:21,895
the missing LaRue.

896
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,200
Before we start, I would
like to introduce you

897
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:29,235
to the very fortunate owner
of this architectural wonder,

898
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:32,712
Mr. Ernest Smuntz.

899
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,955
Thank you, all,
for coming.

900
01:18:47,991 --> 01:18:52,101
When my father left
this extraordinary house

901
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:54,728
to my brother Lars...

902
01:18:58,534 --> 01:19:01,774
...and myself, uh, we

903
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:05,135
had no idea what surprises
were in store for us,

904
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:08,214
or what was
going to happen next.

905
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:22,555
[ clearing throat ] Uh, when
Quincy Thorpe, of the, uh,

906
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:26,901
historical society, told us
of its value, you, uh...

907
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:33,474
You could have knocked us
over with a feather.

908
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:38,212
We didn't know what hit us.

909
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:45,448
The renovation was exhausting,
but ultimately rewarding.

910
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:50,091
- The house was in
terrible disrepair.
- [ indistinct murmuring ]

911
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:54,259
- Nothing that a few nails...
- [ banging, pounding ]

912
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:07,567
...and some old-fashioned
elbow grease couldn't fix.

913
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:10,073
I'm sure the people are eager
to get to the bidding.

914
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,836
- What? The bidding?
- The bidding!

915
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,835
- The bidding!
- All right. Thank you.

916
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:17,178
Thank you, Mr. Smuntz.

917
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,820
No matter what happens,
keep going.

918
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:34,304
Built in 1876, the last
LaRue known in existence

919
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,270
has five bedrooms...
[ indistinct ]

920
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,969
- Did you see him? I thought so.
- Yes!

921
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:42,472
- He ate the string.
- What?

922
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:45,105
The string.
Pop's lucky string!

923
01:20:45,141 --> 01:20:47,141
The son of a bitch ate it!

924
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,606
Why didn't you tell me
you saw him?

925
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,854
I didn't,
but I found this.

926
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:54,145
I told you
you should've weighed him.

927
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,453
I'm sorry.

928
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:58,422
Did you see
where it went?

929
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:00,224
No, but it can't
have gone far.

930
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:03,626
Well, shall we start
the bidding at one million?

931
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:07,959
Now, we all know we're here
to bid on the missing LaRue.

932
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:11,197
Shall we start
the bidding at $500,000?

933
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:15,914
Very good.
I have $500,000 from
the gentleman from Japan.

934
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:18,509
Can I hear a million?
Can I hear one million?

935
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,911
- A million.
- I'll give you one and a half.

936
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:25,075
I have $1.5 million.
Will someone give me two?

937
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:27,654
[ gasping ] There he is!

938
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:30,593
[man] Ladies and gentleman,
I'd like to remind you

939
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,559
that all the carpets and
tapestries were woven by hand

940
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,659
in the Honess Valley
in northern Turkey.

941
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:37,361

Can I have an advance? Can I
have an advance on two million?

947
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:58,482
Oh, you look so beautiful.

[ man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to draw your attention

949
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:06,260

of the gold and silver-leafed
copper and pewter...

Ladies and gentlemen,

Ladies and gentlemen,

966

Seventeen million. I have
17 million. Any advance
on seventeen?

997
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:50,685
Good idea.

998
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:57,457
When I tell you to,
turn it on full blast.

999
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:59,163
We'll flush him out.

1000
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,830
Now!

1001
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:12,838
- Eighteen million.
- [ man ] Eighteen million from
the lady from New York City.

1002
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,805
- Thank you.
- You don't have
that kind of money.

1003
01:25:19,248 --> 01:25:21,348
- Ernie?
- Not now.

1004
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:28,619
- Twenty millions.
- Twenty million.

1005
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:30,887
Thank you.
Can I hear 21?

1006
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:53,453
Twenty-one million from
the gentleman from Japan.

1007
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,320
Any advance?

1008
01:25:59,355 --> 01:26:01,685
Twenty-two million.
That's my last offer.

1009
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:07,931
[ man ] Twenty-two million
going once...

1010
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:15,239
- Twenty-five millions.
- Twenty-five millions.

1011
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:22,554
Thank you, sir.
Twenty-five million dollars.

1012
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:24,548
Twenty-five million dollars.

1013
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:29,550
Bidding stands at 25 million.
Do I have an advance?

1014
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:33,563
Twenty-five million
going once...

1015
01:26:35,624 --> 01:26:37,894
Twenty-five million
going twice...

1016
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,942
[ all screaming ]

1017
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,990
- Going... going...
- [ indistinct grumbling ]

1018
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,603
Hey! Don't go!

1019
01:27:13,629 --> 01:27:17,299
The water was just a...

1020
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:23,413
A demonstration of how durable
a LaRue really is.

1021
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,540
How about that?

1022
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:30,745
Now you know this house
will last forever.

1023
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,928
[ laughing ]

1024
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:43,687
- Pop's lucky string.
- I guess we got him.

1025
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:49,662
Yeah, I guess we did.

1026
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:43,613
[ snoring ]

1027
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:02,974
[ machinery starting ]

1028
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:19,522
What was that?

1029
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:34,997
Lars! Look!

1030
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,064
It's string.

1031
01:31:15,704 --> 01:31:18,014
It's cheese.

1032
01:31:44,567 --> 01:31:46,737
The entire factory
has been retrofitted

1033
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:49,709
to facilitate the manufacturing
of cheese-based products.

1034
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:51,308
I see.

1035
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,739
And over here we're developing
our new lactose-free line.

1036
01:31:54,777 --> 01:31:57,047
- What is that?
- Oh, that's quality control.

1037
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:00,049
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

1038
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:05,287
Oh. No good, huh?
Otis, more curry.

1039
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,090
OK. Try this one.

1040
01:32:07,122 --> 01:32:12,232
Huh? It's mozzarella
and herring.

1041
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,230
You can taste the herring,
right?

1042
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:17,272
I've also got a great idea
for a caviar-Brie swirl,

1043
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:19,939
and a peanut butter and jelly
provolone for the kids.

1044
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:22,908
What I want to talk to you about
is expansion and marketing.

1045
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:24,938
I think you should be
our spokesperson.

1046
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:27,583
I know some people who've used
a mouse as a spokesperson,

1047
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:29,240
and it seemed to
work out well.

1048
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,107
You see, I want to
turn this into the

1049
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:33,816
string cheese factory
of tomorrow, today...
