1
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,970
- Hold your end up higher.
- I am.

2
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,980
- You are not.
- Don't worry about me.

3
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,650
Mm.

4
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,820
- Hey, isn't that suit charcoal?
- No.

5
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,280
Looks charcoal grey to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

6
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,080
Couldn't you find a black suit
for your father's funeral?

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,990
- It's black.
- It's grey.

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,290
- It's black. Black.
- Grey. Grey!

9
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,000
Fine, it's black.

10
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,000
It's the greyest black
I've ever seen.

11
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,500
- The colour doesn't matter!
- Oww!

12
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm sorry, Pop. I'm sorry!

13
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,740
- Quick! Get him out of there!
- He's halfway to the harbour by now.

14
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,740
Ah, well.

15
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,530
(Man) "I leave you
not just a model factory...

16
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,290
"but something infinitely
more valuable.

17
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,460
"The future of string... itself."

18
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,380
(Explosion, shouting)

19
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,010
"And thus it is my dying wish...

20
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,600
"that my two sons
run Smuntz String together."

21
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,940
Great. Stick a "For Sale" sign up,
see what we can get.

22
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,980
Ernie, we're not supposed to sell it.
We're supposed to run it.

23
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,570
Either way, this godforsaken museum
piece is not worth a dime, is it?

24
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,870
Some things are more important
than money, Ernie.

25
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,000
The financially challenged
always say that.

26
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,290
Uh, please, please.

27
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,460
"I also bequeath to you
my personal effects,

28
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,170
"including my ceramic egg,

29
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,640
"half box of Cuban cigars..."

30
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

31
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,980
- "M-my collection of spoons."
- (Clattering)

32
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,480
(Ernie) My goodness,
what a treasure. What a legacy.

33
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,610
Spoons! Spoons!
So many spoons, so little time.

34
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,990
Oh! And, of course, something
no household should be without.

35
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,830
The ceramic egg! Ooh-hoo-hoo.

36
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,830
Can I have the egg?
Can I? Huh? Huh?

37
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,340
- No. I want you to have it.
- Fine, I'll take it!

38
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,300
If you find any real estate
on that desk, let me know.

39
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,510
It seems there is also a house.

40
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,510
- (Together) A house?
- Yes, 5120 Nortondale.

41
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,100
Your father acquired it
many years ago as payment of a debt.

42
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,400
H-he never lived there,
but i-i-it's interesting.

43
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,400
It seems the previous owner was found
locked in a trunk in the attic.

44
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,900
Wait a minute. Is it worth anything?

45
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,120
Well, he was able to borrow
$50,000 against it.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,910
Really? So, what is its value today?

47
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,950
$50,000.

48
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,630
Great. A worthless house
and a broken-down string factory.

49
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,630
Oh, well. At least the day
wasn't a total loss.

50
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,420
Thanks for the stogies, Pop.

51
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,680
Wait. You can't go. W-we
have to go through all these papers.

52
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,730
You'll have to excuse me.

53
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,650
- I've got a date with the mayor.
- (Thunder rolls)

54
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,070
(Reporters chattering)

55
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,150
Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor, over here!
Mr Mayor!

56
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Will your recent triple heart bypass
affect your campaign strategy?

57
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,620
Now, Leslie, I'm just here to eat.

58
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,710
(French accent) Ah, monsieur
le maire, Madame maire,

59
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,420
welcome to Chez Ernie.

60
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,960
What an honour it is
to have you in my humble bistro.

61
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,550
Suivez-moi. You brought the little
ones. The little bicycle thieves.

62
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,390
Bonjour! Our very best table.

63
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,760
- Have you lost weight?
- Oh, I...

64
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,480
- I think so! I think you may be!
- (Laughs)

65
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,230
Je suisse enchanté
pour votre beauté.

66
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,560
- You know?
- Oh, monsieur Ernie...

67
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,780
Excusez-moi. Au revoir, les enfants!

68
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,120
(Sighs)
The air's not so thin at the top.

69
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,250
Just like the old man to die
before I hit it big.

70
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,630
Remember, everyone.
Attention to detail is vital!

71
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,130
Presentation is everything.

72
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,800
No, no, no, no, no!
These I must deliver myself.

73
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,720
(Roars)

74
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,690
Duck a I'Orange
avec du quack sauce...

75
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,610
And for ze Mayor,
la specialite de la maison,

76
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,820
Lobster Loaf a la Ernest
ou la bibliotheque.

77
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,330
- Oh...
- Bon appetit.

78
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,370
(Exhales)

79
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,210
- Ah, bonjour!
- How does it feel...

80
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,880
to serve the mayor
after his re-election?

81
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,130
- Well... May I call you Leslie?
- Of course.

82
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,220
Crunchy! Hmm. I love the almonds.

83
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,430
Leslie, cuisine,
she is a fickle mistress...

84
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,560
Ee-yew! Look! (Squishing)

85
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,980
- A cockroach!
- (Shocked whispering)

86
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
That's only half a cockroach.

87
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,070
Daddy! You ate the head!

88
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,780
Honey, are you OK?

89
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,290
(Screaming)

90
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,590
(Mayor's wife) Not again!

91
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,170
Was this an accident or murder...?

92
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,930
Clear!

93
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,390
- I can do that better!
- (Crying)

94
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,280
(Man) Smuntz String
is a relic of history.

95
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,070
You don't make string by twining
two strands together any more.

96
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,410
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

97
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,620
Bu-but that's not string.
Tha-that's cord.

98
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,330
- Exactly.
- Twine is yesterday. Cord is today.

99
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,130
Zeppco was interested in your factory
but your father refused to sell.

100
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,170
We are hopin' you're smarter.

101
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,760
Zeppco is willin'
to buy you out...

102
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,970
and bring this museum
into the 21st century.

103
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,730
We'd keep you on as a consultant,
with a huge salary and hefty pension.

104
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,690
So...

105
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,860
what do you say?

106
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,820
(Sighs)

107
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,170
- My sons...
- (Whispers) Ernie.

108
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,720
- Ernie!
- Yeah. Just a sec.

109
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,140
I want you... to have... something.

110
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,560
My most prized possession.

111
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480
(Sighs) Oh, it's
a piece of st-string.

112
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,070
Not just any string. THE string.

113
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,570
I found it my first day in America.

114
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,910
- What's with the string?
- I've had it 60 years.

115
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,460
Here! I want you two to share it.

116
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,420
Maybe it'll bring you
closer together.

117
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,010
- You haven't talked much lately.
- Yeah.

118
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,760
- Ah! What are you doing?
- I'm breaking it in half.

119
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,800
- No! I want you to share it.
- No?

120
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,930
- Forever.
- Sure, Pop, sure.

121
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,100
You carry it the first 50 years,
I'll take it the next.

122
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,900
- Sure.
- And turn up the morphine drip.

123
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,110
(Father) I heard that.

124
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,110
Promise me...
that you will never sell...

125
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,490
Smuntz String...

126
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,700
to one of those big conglomerates.

127
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,290
Keep it between you.

128
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,710
Brothers. Family.

129
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,710
- Promise.
- I promise, Pop.

130
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,590
- (Lars) I promise.
- So, you were sayin'?

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,720
I'll have to pass.

132
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,760
What?

133
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,690
"A world without string is chaos."

134
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,030
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

135
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,030
- No, no! Don't!
- Oh!

136
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,370
You... You used to love string!

137
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,830
That was when I was dating
the son of a wealthy string magnate!

138
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,000
Not now, when I am married to the
owner... of a worthless death-trap!

139
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,010
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today!

140
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,170
April, I've got new ideas.

141
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,340
You know, I've got big plans!

142
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,510
Don't you see, Lars?
That's all you've ever had are plans.

143
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,440
But my life is passing me by,
and I... I need more!

144
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,400
There's no air in the middle class,
Lars. I can't breathe here.

145
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,860
Please, April, don't go.

146
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm not going anywhere.

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,290
- 'We go live to Leslie Reinhart.'
- Sorry.

157
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,460
'If this tragedy has a villain
it is Ernie Smuntz.

158
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,250
- 'Once a local... '
- Ernie, you're on TV!

159
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,920
What? Oh.

160
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,420
You know what this is? I'll tell ya.

161
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,170
- Guilt by accusation.
- No capers.

162
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,550
But that's just grilled cheese.
What's the point?

163
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,890
Why don't they eat out of a trough?

164
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,180
Which one of you palateless sheep
sent my sandwich back?

165
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,230
Hi, Ernie!

166
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,810
Lars?

167
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,440
(Ernie) When I'm in the kitchen,
I cook.

168
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,070
I can't control everything in there.

169
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,240
(Lars) You know,
it isn't fair to blame you.

170
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,160
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- But society likes to persecute.

171
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,170
A scapegoat, someone to demonise.
The same thing happened to Galileo.

172
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,170
Really? That's unbelievable.

173
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,590
With a cockroach and everything?

174
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,010
No. The point is, I put everything
into that restaurant.

175
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,510
It was my livelihood and my home.

176
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,850
In one fatal bite,
it was all taken away from me.

177
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,060
If only we could sell the factory.

178
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,690
I'd let you stay with me, you know,
but, uh, April threw me out.

179
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,400
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, well, don't worry about me.

180
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,820
April's been like this
since high school.

181
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,200
- She'll be back. I...
- Would you look at them?

182
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,250
Sleeping in the street. Pitiful.

183
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,080
If I had a house, I'd sleep in it!

184
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,670
- Remember how close we were as kids?
- No.

185
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,260
Hey! Merry Christmas!

186
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,470
Yeah, I was on top once too.

187
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,480
But there's only one way to go from
there, and that's down, baby, down!

188
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh!

189
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,110
Ernie.

190
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,320
Ernie! Ernie, there was
a quarter in there.

191
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,110
A quarter? You think so small, Lars.

192
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,080
Look at the bigger picture.
You have no home, no wife, no money.

193
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

194
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,630
Ernie, it's Christmas.

195
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,920
Instead of dwelling on what we lack,
let's be thankful for what we have.

196
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,720
# If only in my dreams #

197
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,150
(Ernie) What a dump.

198
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,780
Wow! I can't believe Pops
never told us about this house.

199
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
It's huge.

200
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,420
(Ernie) This is
the kind of house he'd have.

201
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,460
It's just like him. Cold and spooky.

202
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,010
- Wow! Did you feel that?
- What?

203
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,430
I got a chill. You shouldn't
talk about Pop like that.

204
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,310
Really? What's this do for you?

205
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,230
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

206
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,280
He didn't mean it, Pop.

207
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,990
Ernie! Ernie!

208
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,420
Only one bed.
I'll flip you for it.

209
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,840
Heads.

210
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,320
- (Scratching)
- E-Ernie?

211
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,860
- Ernie. Ernie.
- (Groans)

212
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,700
- You asleep?
- I was.

213
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,080
- (Scratching)
- How can you sleep through that?

214
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,500
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Shh-shh-shh. That.

215
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,170
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

216
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,420
(Scratching)

217
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
(Door creaks)

218
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,150
Mothballs.

219
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,450
(Screaming)

220
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,830
H-hey, stop it! Hey! Ow!

221
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,830
(Grunting)

222
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,340
(Whispering) Ernie! Ernie!

223
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,340
(Groaning)

224
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,930
(Rattling)

225
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,220
(Ernie grunts)

226
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,620
- (Thunderclap)
- (Screaming)

227
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,420
Wait. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop!

228
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,470
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

229
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,720
(Screaming)

230
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,430
Ah, shut up!

231
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,480
(Scratching)

232
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,780
It's coming from up there!

233
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,200
One, two, three!

234
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,870
(Panting) Ooh!

235
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,340
- It's just a mouse.
- What?

236
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,550
- It's just a mouse. Never mind.
- (Straining)

237
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,880
Hey, there are some posters up here.

238
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,300
Oh! Stand still!

239
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,350
(Yells)

240
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,820
(Spitting)

241
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
- They're blueprints.
- Wow!

242
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,910
Wait a minute.
Look at this date. 1876.

243
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,700
A centennial house could actually
be worth something.

244
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,500
Look, this must be the architect.
Look.

245
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,960
Charles Lyle LaRue.

246
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,590
- Charles Lyle LaRue.
- Charles Lyle LaRue?

247
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,340
(Thud)

248
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,100
Charles Lyle LaRue.

249
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,310
Charles Lyle LaRue!

250
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,650
Charles Lyle LaRue!

251
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,740
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

252
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,620
- It's bold yet subtle.
- Classical yet non-traditional.

253
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,910
The missing LaRue.

254
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,120
The rumoured design completed before
his committal isn't a rumour.

255
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,120
Before his committal?

256
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm just glad he finished it...

257
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,460
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

258
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,220
So, what do you think a magnificent
edifice like this is worth?

259
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,350
Properly restored, of course.

260
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,100
Well, his Parma Charnel House
went for six...

261
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,020
But that was 10 years ago,
and it didn't have this moulding.

262
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,190
I see. I can't get enough
of good moulding.

263
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,200
- Did you hear that? $600,000.
- Phew.

264
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,570
Alexander Falko!

265
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,490
Back!

266
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,200
Gentlemen, congratulations.

267
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,460
Congratulations on your find.
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.

268
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,130
- Glass of rainwater, please.
- The leading collector of LaRues.

269
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,220
Sort of like collecting stamps,
but bigger?

270
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,890
I'll get to the point. LaRue.
I have his books and his letters.

271
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,100
You see these shoes?

272
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
- (Together) LaRues?
- No, but he would love them.

273
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,480
Vegetarian snack. I own... (Chewing)

274
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,650
42 LaRue houses. 42.
I want to make it 43.

275
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,030
You tell me how I'm going to do this.

276
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,570
Tell me how I will do this.
Help me. How will I do this?

277
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,580
Well, I'm, uh, glad you asked.

278
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,870
His Parma Charnel House
went for six, ten years ago,

279
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,330
but it didn't have this moulding.

280
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,460
A find like this today
is worth twice as much.

281
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,050
- He's a LaRue connoisseur.
- Guilty as charged.

282
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,260
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

283
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,890
No, no, no, I couldn't be so crass
as to allow you to do that.

284
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,640
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

285
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,560
- Auction?
- Auction, yes.

286
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,350
It would be unfair of us to deprive
others of the chance to bid.

287
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,810
Um...

288
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,150
May I have one moment
with my brother, please?

289
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,400
- Sure. Of course.
- Thank you.

290
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,660
- What is this?
- It's the...

291
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,790
- What is this? No.
- It's the first I've heard...

292
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,330
- What are you doing?
- Answering your prayers.

293
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,630
These pigeons are ripe for plucking.

294
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,170
Put them in a room
to outbid each other?

295
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,170
- We'll make $700,000, $800,000 easy.
- Man, you're smart!

296
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,090
Oof!

297
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,550
- You'll get it...
- Don't talk to me!

298
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,850
So, when is the, uh,
earliest we can set the auction?

299
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,060
I suppose all arrangements
could be completed within the week.

300
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,190
- A week it is.
- Great!

301
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,530
- You're smarter than you look.
- (Together) Thank you.

302
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,450
But know this.

303
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,870
I have never paid more than $10
million for a house in my life!

304
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,430
OK, see you, then.

305
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,180
Yeah. Thanks for stopping by.

306
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,230
Ten million linen napkins.

307
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,820
Five million bales
of top-grade cotton fibre.

308
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,490
Forty thousand hot lamps complete
with rotating plate-warming trays.

309
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,320
Two thousand twine threaders,
gleaming under real lights.

310
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,410
(Ernie) My own chain of restaurants.

311
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:50,370
(Lars, echoing) April can have
anything she's ever wanted!

312
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,130
(Faintly) Cars, coats, china.
She loves china.

313
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,130
(Fan blades whooshing)

314
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,170
(Ernie) I'm gonna build
a swimming pool...

315
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,050
full of pina coladas
and a college girls.

316
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,770
(Lars) If only Pop
could've seen this house!

317
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,940
He did. He just wasn't
smart enough to sell it.

318
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,480
We've turned a corner.
Our future is staring us in the face.

319
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,860
All we have to do is grab it,
baste it, and scarf it down!

320
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,420
Aha! We've finally found
our friend's home!

321
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,170
Well, I bought
a present for ya, buddy.

322
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,340
Ernie, i-it's just a little mouse.
Do we really have to kill it?

323
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,300
Yes. Listen to me.
A single vermin can bring you down.

324
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,720
Believe me, I know. (Snap) Ah...

325
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,810
(Snoring)

326
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,050
- (Snap)
- (Gasps)

327
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,760
(Sighs)

328
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,150
- I trust you slept well.
- Oh! Like a baby.

329
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,410
Hey, last night,
did you hear the, uh...

330
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,750
Oh, yeah. Let's see.

331
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,670
- Well, where'd he go?
- Maybe it snapped by itself.

332
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,010
I don't believe it.

333
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,560
He snapped the trap, ate the olive,
and left the pit just to mock us.

334
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,610
You're giving him
a little too much credit.

335
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,320
Mice don't mock.
They don't have a sense of humour.

336
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,570
He's not sitting in his hole
in a smoking jacket,

337
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,700
sipping cognac,
giggling "I left the pit."

338
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,540
The trap snapped itself,
the olive flew off, and he ate it.

339
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,580
But now he knows we're here,
he won't come near us.

340
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,380
We won't be seeing that... Mouse!

341
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,090
(Both shrieking)

342
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,840
Aha! Ow!

343
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,220
(Screams)

344
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,970
What are you doing, ya stupid nitwit?

345
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,520
Don't let him get away!

346
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,440
(Laughs)

347
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,650
(Yelling)

348
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,490
(Bloodthirsty screaming)

349
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,540
Ow!

350
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,790
Ow!

351
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,130
Are you trying to kill me?

352
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,590
Ah, the mouse!

353
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,140
(Ernie) Let me see. Let me see!

354
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,100
(Lars) Can you see him?

355
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,310
Get me my Gouda.

356
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,860
- Careful, careful!
- Don't touch me. You'll snap it.

357
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,030
You're not doin' it right.

358
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,030
(Lars) Put it on carefully.
(Ernie) I am.

359
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,160
(Ernie) Oh, relax. It's cheese.

360
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,450
Bon appetit.

361
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,790
That takes care of that. Huh?

362
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,260
(Hammering)

363
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,970
Oh! Oh!

364
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,360
Hey!

365
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,400
Hey! What are you doin'?

366
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,990
(Squeaking)

367
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,290
(Chugging)

368
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,090
(Squeaking)

369
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,170
Lars! Gimme a hand with this.

370
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,590
(Lars) You sure this tub
fits with the house?

371
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,220
Jacuzzi tub, Lars.
It's a Jacuzzi tub.

372
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,060
And this isn't just a house.
It's a LaRue.

373
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,100
Of course it fits the decor.

374
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,350
- Luxury is timeless.
- How much, Ernie?

375
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,520
(Sighs) It was a steal at $1200.

376
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,610
(Lars) $1200?

377
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,200
You spent our last money on a tub!

378
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,110
(Ernie) A Jacuzzi tub!

379
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,870
You have to spend money
to make money.

380
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,540
They threw in the cardboard lady too.

381
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,370
(Screaming)

382
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,210
(Screaming)

383
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,840
(Yelling)

384
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,220
(Screaming)

385
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,870
- (Sighing)
- Well...

386
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,300
(Lars sighing) Don't you think
this is a little... much?

387
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,510
Never underestimate your opponent.

388
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:29,180
Say he has mastered a way to empty
a mousetrap without getting caught.

389
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,640
If he snaps one of these babies,

390
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,940
a chain reaction
will start snapping them all.

391
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,320
The law of averages
says one has to nab him.

392
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,360
(Sighs) Not bad.

393
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,200
Yes. Well, I like
to use both sides of my brain.

394
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,160
Come on, let's hit the sack.

395
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,400
(Sighing)

396
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,910
- Have you figured it out yet?
- Shut up.

397
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,370
I'm thinking. I'm thinking!

398
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,510
Ernie. Ernie!

399
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,980
Keep perfectly still. This is it.

400
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,210
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

401
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,010
That was good.

402
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,370
Shh! He's goin' for the cherries!

403
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,580
You said mice like Gouda.

404
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,840
Not in the morning!
They need fruit for energy.

405
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,930
(Screaming)

406
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,930
(Whimpering)

407
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,570
- (Screaming)
- (Ernie) Oh, no!

408
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,830
Ow! Ow.

409
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,670
(Both grunting and groaning)

410
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,130
- Aah... Ow!
- D-D-D-D-D-D-D.

411
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,930
There he goes!

412
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,690
- Juice!
- Got it!

413
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,940
(Laughing maniacally)

414
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,320
This game is over!

415
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,160
(Cheering and yelling)

416
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,330
(Laughing)

417
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,880
- I think it's working!
- Yeah.

418
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,470
- (Thump)
- Whoa! Uh! I felt something.

419
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,520
(Lars) Ooh, ooh, ooh. Keep sucking!

420
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,100
(Slurping)

421
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,900
Goddamn, that mouse stinks! (Cackles)

422
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,950
Dead animals always do.

423
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,570
- Ohh!
- (Both laughing maniacally)

424
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,840
- (Lars) Keep sucking!
- (Rumbling)

425
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,090
(Lars) Oh, yeah, this'll get him!

426
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,590
(Liquid rumbling)

427
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,840
(Squelch)

428
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,740
- What's this?
- We're foreclosing on your house.

429
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,950
You quit paying your mortgage.

430
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:43,830
Oh, wait a minute, there's some
mistake, this house is paid for.

431
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,380
It was, but you borrowed against it.

432
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,840
If you don't pay the $1200,
we repossess it.

433
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
- $1200?
- Well, how long do we have?

434
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,970
One week from, uh... five days ago.

435
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,890
(Panting) But, uh, that's two days!

436
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,690
We don't have the time
or energy for this.

437
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,900
We're in the midst
of an extensive renovation.

438
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,480
Looks like you're off
to a great start.

439
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,320
(Lars) Ask your boss for an advance.
Pay him back later.

440
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,450
(Ernie) Couldn't your workers
forfeit their salaries?

441
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,750
If you hadn't spent all our money
on that tub, we might be able to pay.

442
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,210
- It doesn't help to start crying.
- (Shrieking)

443
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,340
No, Fluffy! No!

444
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,210
No! I want my kitty!

445
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,800
No, no, no!

446
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,020
(Rings bell)

447
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,400
- (Distant meowing)
- That one's cute.

448
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:58,450
- He doesn't have a killer instinct.
- (Purring)

449
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,950
(Meows)

450
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,160
(Bell ringing, buzzing, hissing)

451
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,500
(Ringing bell)

452
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,180
Morning, gentlemen. I'm Maury.
Can I help you?

453
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,720
Uh, hi, Maury. W-we need a cat.

454
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,890
(Maury) Find the one you want
and I'll spay or neuter it myself.

455
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,770
(Lars) Well, these are all kittens.

456
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,530
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

457
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,400
Most people like cute little ones.
Experience with what?

458
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,530
- Mouse hunting.
- All cats are good mousers.

459
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,950
But we have huge rats,
the size of sumo wrestlers.

460
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,960
So, we need a ferocious feline
with a history of mental illness.

461
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,250
I'm talkin'... one mean pussy.

462
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,460
Yeah! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

463
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,420
Do you have any of those
knocking around?

464
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,640
Funny you should ask. I had all
but given up on anyone wanting him.

465
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,970
We were about to gas him again.

466
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,100
(Both) Again?

467
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,730
He's spent most of his whole life
in that box, I expect.

468
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,650
- (Growling)
- "Catzilla"?

469
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,070
The guys who clean up call him that.

470
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,860
But you can call him
anything you want.

471
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,240
I'd say he looks like a "Fluffy."

472
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,080
(Snarling)

473
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,500
Ah, poor little Catzilla.

474
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,040
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

475
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,460
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

476
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,300
- (Yowling)
- You're a stupid cat, aren't you?

477
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,760
- (Growling)
- Yes, you are. And ugly. Extremely.

478
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,600
(Yowling)

479
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,640
(Electricity crackling)

480
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,480
- Oh! Oh, you little bastard.
- We'll take him.

481
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,650
- (Cat screeching)
- Here, boy.

482
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,570
(Growling)

483
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:08,080
(Squeaking)

484
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,500
(Yowling)

485
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,830
Ooh... He's got the scent now.

486
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,840
Yeah, uh, go get 'im, boy.

487
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,010
Oh, easy, easy, easy, easy!

488
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:33,230
Wow. I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

489
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,230
(Together) Almost! (Laughs)

490
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,570
(Growling)

491
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,800
(Growling)

492
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,800
(Roaring)

493
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,650
(Meowing)

494
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,750
(Notes playing)

495
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,170
(Cat yowling)

496
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,380
(Ernie) Don't
worry about that mouse,

497
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,010
start thinking about
how to get $1200.

498
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,100
(Lars) Don't worry,
the workers will help us.

499
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,730
You see, the truth is...

500
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,270
- we don't actually have any money.
- (Muttering)

501
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,580
We may have to defer
your next paycheque or... or two.

502
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,290
- (Angry muttering)
- So we can pay the mortgage.

503
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,290
It's the missing LaRue!

504
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,040
(Lars) There's no need
for violence!

505
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,970
(Lars) Put that thing down. Whoa!

506
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,100
(Banging)

507
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,160
- Ernie!
- What's the matter?

508
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,160
Well, the, uh, workers...
didn't react very positively.

509
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,040
(Angry shouting)

510
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,620
No?

511
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,920
Uh, what are you doing?

512
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,670
- You could fit through here, right?
- What? I guess so.

513
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,840
Come on. (Screams)

514
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,470
(Yells)

515
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,310
But, Lars, that was our last resort!

516
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,180
We'll have to
find money someplace else.

517
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,370
Gosh, it's a shame nobody's
interested in buying the factory.

518
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,590
Yeah, yeah, it's a shame.
But who'd be stupid enough, right?

519
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,170
(Chuckling) Yeah.

520
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,640
(Growling)

521
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,200
- (Snap)
- (Yowling)

522
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,210
- (Snapping)
- (Yowling)

523
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,180
(Yowling)

524
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,020
(Growling)

525
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,330
(Surprised meow)

526
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,420
(Sad meow)

527
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,110
Ah, you must be... Caesar.

528
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,030
I'm glad you could get here
so quickly...

529
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,950
Shh!

530
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,930
(Tapping echoes)

531
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,900
(Sniffs)

532
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,480
You have mice.

533
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,450
He's good.

534
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,320
(Whispering) 5120 Nortondale.

535
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,450
January 4th, 0800 hours.

536
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,660
Don't forget to get
toothpaste and Saran Wrap.

537
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,750
We're in sort of a hurry. I wanted
to warn you about this mouse.
