1
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:13,423
This is the end

2
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:16,494
Beautiful friend

3
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:22,699
This is the end

4
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,361
My only friend

5
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,439
The end

6
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:31,305
Of our elaborate plans

7
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,411
The end

8
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,107
Of everything that stands

9
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,183
The end

10
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:43,187
No safety nor surprise

11
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,280
The end

12
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:51,125
I'll never look into your eyes

13
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,221
Again

14
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,233
Can you picture

15
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:02,569
What will be

16
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:07,908
So limitless and free

17
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:11,710
Desperately in need

18
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,717
Ofsome

19
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,447
Stranger's hand

20
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,455
In a

21
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,957
Desperate land

22
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:13,044
Lost in a Roman

23
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:16,637
Wilderness of pain

24
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:24,382
And all the children

25
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,221
Are insane

26
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:35,425
All the children

27
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:39,300
Are insane

28
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:47,178
Waiting for the summer rain

29
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,804
Yeah

30
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,641
Saigon.

31
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:21,470
Shit.

32
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:25,515
I'm still only in Saigon.

33
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:37,927
Every time, I think I'm gonna
wake up back in the jungle.

34
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:46,195
When I was home after
my first tour, it was worse.

35
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,038
I'd wake up,
and there'd be nothing.

36
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:09,926
I hardly said a word to my wife
until I said yes to a divorce.

37
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:15,722
When I was here,
I wanted to be there.

38
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:21,704
When I was there, all I could think
of was getting back into the jungle.

39
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,736
I'm here a week now.

40
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:32,348
Waiting for a mission...

41
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:34,851
getting softer.

42
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:43,016
Every minute I stay
in this room, I get weaker.

43
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:47,997
And every minute Charlie squats
in the bush, he gets stronger.

44
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:56,534
Each time I looked around,
the walls moved in a little tighter.

45
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:11,583
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah

46
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,560
Come on, babe, come on now
Livin ' life, yeah

47
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:21,429
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Yeah

48
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:24,934
Fuck, yeah, come on, baby

49
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:27,437
Fuck, baby, fuck, fuck

50
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,837
Oh, yeah, oh, fuck

51
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,933
Yeah, do it, yeah, come on

52
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,344
Yeah, all right

53
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,131
Yeah

54
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:02,004
Yeah, yeah

55
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,507
Yeah

56
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:08,306
Yeah, yeah

57
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:10,506
Yeah

58
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:39,132
Everyone gets everything he wants.

59
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,974
I wanted a mission...

60
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:45,914
and for my sins,
they gave me one.

61
00:07:46,018 --> 00:07:48,452
Brought it up to me
like room service.

62
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:52,216
Captain Willard?
Are you in there?

63
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,383
Yeah, I'm comin'.

64
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:57,326
It was a real choice mission.

65
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:01,729
And when it was over,
I'd never want another.

66
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,537
- What do you want?
- Are you all right, Captain?

67
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:15,579
What does it look like?

68
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,587
- Are you Willard, 505th Battalion?
- Affirmative.

69
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,592
- 173rd Airborne?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:33,188
- Assigned to SOG?
- Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?

71
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:37,894
We have orders to escort you
to the airfield.

72
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:41,404
- What are the charges?
- sir?

73
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:44,839
- What'd I do?
- There's no charges, Captain.

74
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:48,776
You have orders to report to
Com-sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.

75
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,781
- I see.
- All right?

76
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:54,875
- Nha Trang, for me?
- That's right.

77
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:58,387
Come on, Captain. You still have
a few hours to get cleaned up.

78
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,517
- I'm not feeling too good.
- Captain?

79
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,824
Dave, come here and give me a hand.
We got a dead one.

80
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:08,923
Come on, Captain.
Let's take a shower.

81
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:11,161
- Don't be an ass.
- get a hold of him good.

82
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,499
We're gonna take a shower, Captain.
In we go.

83
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:17,097
stand underneath this, Captain.

84
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,653
I was going to the worst place
in the world...

85
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,553
and I didn't even know ityet.

86
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,592
Weeks away and hundreds
of miles up a river...

87
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,891
that snaked through the war
like a main circuit cable...

88
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:41,625
plugged straight into Kurtz.

89
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,566
It was no accident that
I got to be the caretaker...

90
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,401
of Colonel
Walter E. Kurtz's memory--

91
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:54,275
any more than being back
in Saigon was an accident.

92
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:58,281
There is no way to tell his story
without telling my own.

93
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:00,977
Ifhis story
is really a confession--

94
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:03,611
- Captain Willard reporting, sir.
- then so is mine.

95
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:06,919
- Captain. good. Come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:10,961
- stand at ease.
- general.

97
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:14,623
You want a cigarette?

98
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,258
No, thankyou, sir.

99
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,806
-Have you ever seen this man before?
-No, sir.

100
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,637
- Met the general or myself?
- No, sir.

101
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:27,244
Not personally.

102
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:31,110
- You've worked a lot on your own?
- Yes, sir, I have.

103
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,683
Your report
specifies intelligence...

104
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:34,183
counter intelligence
with Com-sec, "I" Corps.

105
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:38,382
I'm not presently disposed to
discuss those operations, sir.

106
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:49,022
Did you not work for
the CIA in "I" Corps?

107
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,635
No, sir.

108
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:55,467
Did you not assassinate
a government tax collector...

109
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:58,338
Quang Tri Province,
June 1 8, 1 968?

110
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,379
Captain?

111
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:09,251
sir, I am unaware of any
such activity or operation--

112
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:14,519
nor would I be disposed to
discuss such an operation...

113
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:18,289
if it did,
in fact, exist, sir.

114
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:31,538
I thought we'd have
a bite of lunch while we talk.

115
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:35,476
I hope you brought
a good appetite, Captain.

116
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,517
I notice that you have
a bad hand there. You wounded?

117
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,951
I had a little fishing accident
on R and R, sir.

118
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:46,649
- Fishing on R and R?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:49,158
But you're feeling fit?
You're ready for duty?

120
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,729
Yes, general.
Very much so, sir.

121
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,325
Well, let's see what we have here,
roast beef, and usually it's not bad.

122
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:01,865
Try some,Jerry,
and pass it around.

123
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:06,034
To save a little time,
we might pass both ways.

124
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:11,444
Captain, I don't know how
you feel about this shrimp...

125
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,450
but if you'll eat it...

126
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:18,182
you'll never have to prove
your courage in any other way.

127
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,226
I swear, why don't I
just take a piece here?

128
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:26,627
Captain, you've heard of
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?

129
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:30,792
Yes, sir,
I've heard the name.

130
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:34,770
oh, Jesus! operations officer,
Fifth special Forces.

131
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:38,434
Luke, would you play that tape
for the captain, please?

132
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:41,045
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- Listen to this carefully, Captain.

133
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:46,541
October9, 0430 hours,
sector Peter, Victor, King.

134
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:49,848
These were monitored
out of Cambodia.

135
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:52,685
This has been verified
as Col. Kurtz's voice.

136
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,887
I watched a snail...

137
00:12:56,995 --> 00:13:01,329
crawl along the edge
ofa straight razor.

138
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,869
That's my dream.

139
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:10,100
That's my nightmare.

140
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:14,439
Crawling, slithering...

141
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,707
along the edge...

142
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:21,979
of a straight razor...

143
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,449
and surviving.

144
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,258
Transmission 1 1, received
'68, December 30, 0500 hours.

145
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:35,527
Sector King, Zulu, King.

146
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:38,068
But we must kill them.

147
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,729
We must incinerate them.

148
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:43,239
Pig after pig.

149
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,275
Cow after cow.

150
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,647
Village after village.
Army after army.

151
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,651
And they call me an assassin.

152
00:13:54,753 --> 00:14:00,214
What do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin?

153
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:05,194
They lie. They lie,
and we have to be merciful...

154
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,491
for those who lie.

155
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:10,397
Those nabobs.

156
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:13,627
I hate them.

157
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,134
I do hate them.

158
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,908
Walt Kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers...

159
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,178
this country's ever produced.

160
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:32,382
He was brilliant.
He was outstanding in every way.

161
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,156
And he was a good man, too,
a humanitarian man.

162
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:41,255
A man ofwit and humor.

163
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,359
He joined the special Forces.

164
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,201
And after that his...

165
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:52,401
ideas, methods...

166
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:56,213
became...

167
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,610
unsound.

168
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:07,123
Unsound.

169
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,922
Now he's crossed
into Cambodia with this...

170
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:18,298
Montagnard army of his
that worship...

171
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:21,099
the man like a god...

172
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:26,109
and follow every order,
however ridiculous.

173
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:30,374
Well, I have some other
shocking news to tell you.

174
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:36,078
Col. Kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder.

175
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:40,089
I don't follow, sir.
Murdered who?

176
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:44,184
Kurtz had ordered the execution of
some Vietnamese intelligence agents--

177
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:48,231
men he believed
were double agents.

178
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:53,498
so he took matters
into his own hands.

179
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,233
Well, you see, Willard...

180
00:15:56,341 --> 00:16:01,973
in this war, things
get confused out there.

181
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:05,947
Power, ideals,
the old morality...

182
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,883
and practical
military necessity.

183
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:14,382
But out there
with these natives...

184
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:19,191
it must be a temptation to...

185
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,663
be god.

186
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:28,268
Because there's a conflict
in every human heart...

187
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:31,968
between the rational
and the irrational...

188
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,375
between good and evil...

189
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:38,482
and good does not
always triumph.

190
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,520
sometimes...

191
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,782
the dark side...

192
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,691
overcomes what Lincoln called
the better angels of our nature.

193
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,598
Every man has got
a breaking point.

194
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,862
You and I have them.

195
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,871
Walt Kurtz has reached his.

196
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:06,636
And very obviously,
he has gone insane.

197
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,824
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.
obviously insane.

198
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:30,890
Your mission is to proceed up the
Nung River in a navy patrol boat--

199
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:35,996
pick up Col. Kurtz's path
at Nu Mung Ba...

200
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:39,270
follow it, learn what
you can along the way.

201
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,743
When you find the colonel,
infiltrate his team by--

202
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:47,716
whatever means available and
terminate the colonel's command.

203
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,723
Terminate the colonel?

204
00:17:56,828 --> 00:18:01,891
He's out there operating
without any decent restraint...

205
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,027
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable...

206
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,105
human conduct...

207
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:12,404
and he is still on the field,
commanding troops.

208
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:15,979
Terminate with
extreme prejudice.

209
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,910
You understand, Captain,
that this mission...

210
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:24,546
does not exist
norwill it ever exist.

211
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:23,744
How manypeople
had I already killed?

212
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:27,648
There were those six
that I knew about for sure--

213
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:32,155
close enough to blow
their last breath in my face.

214
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:36,954
But this time
it was an American...

215
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:39,086
and an officer.

216
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,701
That wasn 't supposed to make
any difference to me...

217
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:54,835
but it did.

218
00:19:56,647 --> 00:20:00,083
Shit. Charging a man
with murder in this place...

219
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:05,747
was like handing out
speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

220
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:10,260
I took the mission.
What the hell else was I gonna do?

221
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,797
But I really didn 't know
what I'd do when I found him.

222
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:25,804
- Did you check the tank?
- Y eah.

223
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:32,082
I was being ferried down
the coast in a navy PBR...

224
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:36,176
a type ofplastic patrol boat--
a pretty common sight on the rivers.

225
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:39,188
They said it was a good way to
pick up information and move...

226
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,522
without drawing a lot
of attention, and that was okay.

227
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:46,597
I needed the air and the time.

228
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,029
Only problem was
I wouldn 't be alone.

229
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,192
Mornin', Captain.

230
00:20:53,404 --> 00:20:56,567
The crew were
mostlyjust kids--

231
00:20:56,674 --> 00:21:00,633
rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves.

232
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:04,306
- How old are you?
- seventeen.

233
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:07,885
The machinist-- the one they
called Chef-- was from New Orleans.

234
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:10,920
He was wrapped too tight
for Vietnam.

235
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:13,752
Probably wrapped too tight
for New Orleans.

236
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,792
Lance, on the forward fifties...

237
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,623
was a famous surfer
from the beaches south ofL.A.

238
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:22,529
To look at him, you wouldn 't believe
he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

239
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:28,600
Clean-- Mr. Clean-- was
from some South Bronx shit-hole...

240
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,867
and I think the light
and the space of Vietnam...

241
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:34,570
really put the zap on his head.

242
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,607
Then there was Phillips,
the chief.

243
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:42,685
It might have been my mission, but
it sure as shit was the chief's boat.

244
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,721
There's about two points
where we can draw enough water...

245
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:47,222
to get into the Nung River.

246
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:51,489
They're both hot.
Belong to Charlie.

247
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:53,962
Don't worry about it.

248
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,159
Don't smoke.

249
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,431
You know, I've pulled
a few special ops in here.

250
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:03,132
About six months ago...

251
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:07,541
I took a man who was going up
past the bridge at Do Lung.

252
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:10,340
He was regular army too.

253
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:15,819
Heard he shot himself
in the head.

254
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:27,596
At first I thought
they handed me the wrong dossier.

255
00:22:27,698 --> 00:22:30,258
I couldn't believe
they wanted this man dead.

256
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:34,804
Third-generation West Point,
top ofhis class.

257
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:39,138
Korea, Airborne,
about a thousand decorations.

258
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:41,245
Et cetera, et cetera.

259
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:48,785
I'd heard his voice on the tape,
and it really put the hook in me...

260
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:53,482
but I couldn 't connect up
that voice with this man.

261
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,431
Like they said,
he had an impressive career.

262
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:08,437
Maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.

263
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:12,771
He was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation--

264
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,175
general, chief ofstaff,
anything.

265
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:21,908
In 1 964, he returned from a tour
with Advisory Command in Vietnam...

266
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:24,419
and things started to slip.

267
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:26,615
His report to
the Joint Chiefs ofStaff...

268
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,158
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

269
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:34,592
Seems they didn 't dig
what he had to tell them.

270
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,634
During the next few months, he
made three requests for transfer...

271
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:42,798
to Airborne training, Fort Benning,
Georgia, and was finally accepted.

272
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:47,976
Airborne?

273
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:52,576
He was 38 years old.

274
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,948
Why the fuck would he do that?

275
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:02,555
1 966,joins Special Forces...

276
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,685
returns to Vietnam.

277
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,930
Hey, what's that?

278
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:09,522
- Arc li ght.
- What's up?

279
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:12,194
- B-52 strike.
- Yeah?

280
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:14,203
- What's that?
- Arc light.

281
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:17,274
I hate that. Every time I hear that,
something terrible happens.

282
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,275
Charlie don't never
see 'em or hear 'em, man.

283
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,604
There they are.

284
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:23,043
Concussion will suck the air
out ofyour damn lungs.

285
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:25,138
something terrible
is gonna happen.

286
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:28,912
smoke! secondary burning.

287
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,545
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

288
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:34,557
Let's have a look, Chief.

289
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,254
It was the Air-Cav.
First ofthe Ninth--

290
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:39,192
That's them.

291
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:42,164
our escorts to the mouth
of the Nung River.

292
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:46,134
But they were supposed to be waiting
for us another 30 kilometers ahead.

293
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:51,402
Well, Air Mobile.
Those boysjust couldn't stay put.

294
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,089
Hey, kid, come on.
get down. Come on.

295
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:20,002
First ofthe Ninth was
an old cavalry division...

296
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,004
that had cashed in its horses
for choppers...

297
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:26,008
and gone tear-assing around
'Nam looking for the shit.

298
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:30,671
They'd given Charlie
a few surprises in their time here.

299
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:35,650
What they were mopping up now hadn 't
even happenedyet an hour ago.

300
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:38,051
J ust keepi ng running by.
We're for television.

301
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:40,453
Don't look at the camera.
Just keep-- go on. Keep going.

302
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,458
This is for television.
Don't look at the camera.

303
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,859
Just go by like you're fighting,
like you're fighting.

304
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:49,455
Don't look at the camera.
It's for television.Just go through.

305
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,558
Just go by. Keep on going.

306
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,796
Keep going. Don't look at the camera.
go on. Keep going.

307
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:55,769
All right, come on. go.

308
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:02,846
Right here. Yes.
over here. over here.

309
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,227
Where can I find the Co?

310
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,460
That's the colonel comin' down!

311
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,371
The Co's on that chopper.

312
00:26:56,634 --> 00:27:00,161
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line
back about 1 00 yards!

313
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:03,399
- give me some room to breathe!
- Yes, sir!

314
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,407
Body cards!

315
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,538
- sir?
- Bring my body cards!

316
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:13,582
Yes, sir!

317
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:19,418
I'm the Fourth Tank commander.
I got five tanks broken down.

318
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:22,686
We're all right with the tanks.
It's all right, Captain.

319
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:24,055
Captain Willard!

320
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:27,528
I carry priority papers from
Com-sec Intelligence, II Corps.

321
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,565
I understand Nha Trang
has briefed you...

322
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,567
on the requirements of my mission.

323
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:34,263
What mission?
I haven't heard from Nha Trang.

324
00:27:34,371 --> 00:27:37,306
sir, your unit is supposed
to escort us into the Nung!

325
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:39,569
- We'll see what we can do.
- Colonel!

326
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,477
But just stay out of my way
until this is done, Captain.

327
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:49,751
All right, let's see what we have.
Let's see what we have.

328
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:54,917
A two of spades, three of spades,
four of diamonds...

329
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,653
six of clubs, eight of spades.

330
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:00,753
There isn't one worth a jack
in the whole bunch.

331
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:03,800
Four of diamonds.

332
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,632
- Hey, Captain, what's that?
- Death cards!

333
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:11,037
- What?
- Death cards!

334
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:13,473
- Death?
- Lets Charlie know who did this.

335
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:19,914
- Cheer up, son.
- We will not hurt orharm you.

336
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:23,783
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

337
00:28:24,054 --> 00:28:27,512
This is an area
that is controlled...

338
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,025
by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.

339
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,027
Jim.

340
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:39,297
We are here to help you.

341
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:44,396
- We extend a welcome hand...
- Come on.

342
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,567
-to those who would like to return...
-Everybody in?

343
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,044
to the arms of
the South Vietnamese government.

344
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:54,549
get in. Hurry up.

345
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:57,348
Move it out.

346
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:59,979
This is an area
that is controlled...

347
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,684
by the Vietcong
and North Vietnamese.

348
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:07,924
Hey! What's this?
What is this?

349
00:29:08,032 --> 00:29:10,728
This man's hurt
pretty bad, sir.

350
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:14,270
About the only thing that's holding
his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

351
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,771
Yeah? What do you have to say?

352
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:22,744
This soldier is dirty VC. He wants
water. He can drink paddy water.

353
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,247
get outta here!
give me that canteen.

354
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,478
- He's VC!
- Any man that's brave enough to--

355
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:32,181
get outta here!
I'll kickyour fuckin' ass!

356
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,416
He killed a lot of our people!

357
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,618
Any man brave enough
to fight with his guts...

358
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:38,718
strapped on him
can drink from my canteen.

359
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,856
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those
sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

360
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,801
- Where? Here? You sure?
- Down there.

361
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,895
Yeah? Here.

362
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:51,907
Repeat. We have a body count.
We have--

363
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:56,637
What's your name, sailor?

364
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,613
-gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
-gunner's Mate Third Class--

365
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:03,813
- Lance Johnson, the surfer?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:08,051
It's an honor to meet you. I've
admired your nose riding foryears.

367
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:11,025
I like your cutback too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.

368
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:13,756
- Thankyou, sir.
- You can cut out the "sir" crap.

369
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:15,855
I'm Bill Kilgore.
I'm a goofy foot.

370
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,866
- This guy with ya?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:19,799
I want you to meet some guys.

372
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,803
- This is Mike from san Diego.
- Far out.

373
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,772
- Johnny from Malibu. solid surfers.
- John, hi. Far out.

374
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,002
None of us are anywhere
nearyour class though.

375
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:28,577
No way.

376
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,581
We do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.

377
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:35,049
Fly down to Yung Tau
for the evening glass.

378
00:30:35,152 --> 00:30:37,586
Been riding since you got here?

379
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:40,282
No way. I haven't surfed
since I been here.

380
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:42,791
Through Christ, our Lord...

381
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,986
from Whom
all good things come...

382
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,620
through Him in the unity
of the Holy spirit.

383
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:50,598
All glory and honor
is Yours, Almighty Father.

384
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:53,169
Let us bring
our iniquities to the Father...

385
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,204
in the words our savior gave us.

386
00:30:55,305 --> 00:31:00,265
our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

387
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:05,007
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

388
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:07,947
give us this day
our daily bread...

389
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:09,952
and forgive us our trespasses...

390
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:12,181
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

391
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:15,918
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

392
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:28,701
Kilgore had had a pretty
good day for himself.

393
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,933
They choppered in
the T-bones and the beer...

394
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,340
and turned the LZ
into a beach party.

395
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,447
The more they tried
to make it just like home...

396
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:40,176
the more they made
everybody miss it.

397
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:43,481
Make my meat rare--
rare but not cold.

398
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,724
Well, he wasn 't
a bad officer, I guess.

399
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:56,288
He loved his boys,
andyou felt safe with him.

400
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,699
He was one ofthose guys that
had that weird light around him.

401
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:03,569
You just knew he wasn 't gonna
get so much as a scratch here.

402
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:07,542
What happened to your mission?
Nha T rang forget all about you?

403
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:18,679
Airborne.

404
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,281
sir, two places we can
get into the river.

405
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:25,384
- Yeah.
- Here and here.

406
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:30,331
It's a pretty wide delta, but these
are the only two spots I'm sure of.

407
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:33,460
That village you're pointing at
is kind of hairy.

408
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,902
- What do you mean "hairy," sir?
- It's hairy.

409
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:37,906
got some pretty heavy ordnance.

410
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:40,374
I lost a few recon ships
in there now and again.

411
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:43,708
What's the name of
that goddamn village? Vin Drin--

412
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,213
- Dop.
- Dop or Lop?

413
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:49,945
Damn gook names
all sound the same.

414
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:53,045
Mike, you know anything about
this point at Vin Drin Dop?

415
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:55,057
That's a fantastic peak.

416
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:57,593
- Peak?
- About six foot.

417
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:01,357
It's an outstanding peak. It's got
both the long right and left slide...

418
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:03,660
with a bowl section
that's unbelievable.

419
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,167
It's just tube city.

420
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:11,407
Why didn't you tell me
that before? A good peak.

421
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,204
There aren't any good peaks
in this whole shitty country.

422
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:16,244
It's all goddamn beach break.

423
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,281
It's really hairy in there.
That's where we lost McDonald.

424
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:23,615
They shot the hell out of us there.
That's Charlie's point.

425
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,154
sir, we can go in there
tomorrow at dawn.

426
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,315
There's always a good
offshore breeze in the morning.

427
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,325
We may not be able
to get the boat in.

428
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:34,386
The draft at the mouth of
that river may be too shallow.

429
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:37,467
We'll pickyour boat up and put it
down like a baby where you want it.

430
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:40,059
This is the First of the Ninth,
Air-Cav, son.

431
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,504
Air mobile! I can take that point
and hold it as long as I like.

432
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:47,634
You can get anyplace up that river
that suits you, young Captain.

433
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,178
Hell, a six-foot peak.

434
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:53,349
Take a gunship
back to the division.

435
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,475
Lance, go with Mike and let him
pick out a board foryou.

436
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,780
Bring me my Yater spoon,
the eight-six.

437
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,788
- I don't know, sir--
- What is it, soldier?

438
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,950
It's hairy in there.
It's Charlie's point.

439
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,187
Charlie don't surf!

440
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,277
Hey,Jesus, Clean, you ain't
gonna believe this. Look.

441
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,291
Hey, man!
They're pickin' up the boat!

442
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:43,364
- How are you feeling,Jimmy?
- Like a mean motherfucker, sir!

443
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,970
All right, son, let 'er rip.

444
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,834
Let's go!

445
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:16,089
I never have got used to a light
board. I can't get used to one.

446
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:19,094
- I'm used to a heavy board.
- I know, it's a real drag.

447
00:36:19,196 --> 00:36:21,790
- You prefer a heavy or light board?
- Heavier.

448
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,798
- Really?
- Yeah!

449
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,562
I thought all the young guys
like lighter boards.

450
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,764
- You can't ride the nose on those.
- Big Duke Six.

451
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:31,534
This is Eagle Thrust seven.
We've got it spotted.

452
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,199
Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.

453
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:36,779
Put on heading two-seven-zero.
Assume attack formation.

454
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,246
That's a roger, Big Duke.
We're going in.

455
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:43,410
Hey, Lance, we'll come in
low out of the rising sun.

456
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,988
About a mile out,
we'll put on the music.

457
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:48,455
- Music?
- Yeah, I use Wagner.

458
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:52,688
scares the hell out of the slopes.
My boys love it.

459
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,094
Hey, they're gonna play music!

460
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:05,302
How come all you guys
sit on your helmet?

461
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:08,708
so we don't get
our balls blown off.

462
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:23,226
Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust.
Put on psy war op.

463
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:27,956
Make it loud. This is a Romeo
Fox Trot. shall we dance?

464
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:35,466
Yes, sir!

465
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,607
- Come on!
- All right. Fire.

466
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:09,150
We got a couple--
at that tree line.

467
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:12,194
We're taking fire from the holes.

468
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:15,590
Run, Charlie!

469
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:21,837
This should make
everything burn.

470
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:34,912
We got a couple
ofpeople ahead here.

471
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,385
-What's going down here?
-We got an automatic! Shoot to kill!

472
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:42,049
-Shoot to kill in the open!
-I spotted a large weapon down below.

473
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:44,592
We're gonna go down
and check it out.

474
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,992
All right, this is Fox Trot.
We're pullin ' in.

475
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:58,470
What a shot.

477
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,726
Six-four-one-zero,
we're over the village right now.

478
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:28,702
I see a vehicle in the courtyard.
I'm gonna check it out.

479
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:31,137
Well done, Hawks.

480
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,869
Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan
along those tree lines.

481
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,944

482
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:38,606
got a vehicle on the bridge,
50 caliber on board.

483
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:41,876
He's moving across
to resupply the weapon.

484
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:45,216
Big Duke Six, clearthe area.
I'm coming down myself.

485
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:47,119
Don't these people ever give up?

486
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:52,918
Nice shot, Bill.

487
00:41:53,029 --> 00:41:56,692
- shit!
- All right, all right!

488
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,237
-It's just a flare!
-It's a flare! gotta get outta here!

489
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,568
Un-ass that shit.

490
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:07,700
get it out. It's just a flare.
It's all right.

491
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:10,938
- Everybody all right? Lance?
- I'm fine!

492
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,894

493
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:51,618
I'm not going!
I'm not going! I'm not going.

494
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,897
Wejust got a secondary
down there in the plaza.

495
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,098
Hold on to yourposition.

496
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:14,335
Duke Six, we've got
wounded down there.

497
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:25,810
- get a stretcher over here!
- You're all ri ght.

498
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,454
- Please, god! Help me!
- give him some morphine.

499
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,897
My god! oh!

500
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:41,232
- seven-four-two!
- Where's that duster?

501
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:43,999
I want my wounded out of there
and in the hospital in 1 5 minutes.

502
00:43:44,107 --> 00:43:46,041
I want my men out.

503
00:43:46,176 --> 00:43:48,269
Somebody stay in there
tight with Big Duke.

504
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:52,643
This is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in,
throw 'em on and get out.

505
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:14,926
she's got a grenade!

506
00:44:15,038 --> 00:44:16,471
she's got a grenade!

507
00:44:19,676 --> 00:44:21,439
The whole thing blew up.

508
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,307
- She blew the shit--
- Fucking savages.

509
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:27,917
- Get a medevac.
- Holy Christ, she's a sAP.

510
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:29,746
I'm gonna get
that dink bitch.

511
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:33,118
Get overthere,Johnny. Roll
that right skid right up her ass.

512
00:44:35,892 --> 00:44:37,154
We gotta get some air
in these trees.

513
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,592
It's goddamn eat-up
with enemy down here.

514
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:41,721
I'm taking fire.
I'm taking hits all over.

515
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:44,129
Three o'clock!
I'm drawing heavy fire!

516
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,600
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin'in.

517
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:48,170
My tail rotor's out.
I got control.

518
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,049
- What do you think?
- Wow! This is really exciting, man.

519
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:03,380
- No! No! The waves! The waves!
- oh, right.

520
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:07,183
Look at that.
Breaks both ways. Watch. Watch.

521
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,191
Look! Good six-foot swells!

522
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:35,149
Come here, Lance.

523
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:40,688
Incoming!

524
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:45,385
This LZ is still pretty hot, sir.

525
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,395
Maybe you ought to surf
somewhere else.

526
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:48,896
What do you know
about surfing, Major?

527
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,694
You're from goddamn New Jersey.

528
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:56,071
Come here! Come here!

529
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:00,799
- Change!
- You mean right now, sir?

530
00:46:00,944 --> 00:46:03,777
I wanna see how rideable
that stuff is. go change.

531
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,780
It's still pretty hairy
out there.

532
00:46:05,882 --> 00:46:07,850
- Do you wanna surf, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

533
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:10,476
That's good, son,
'cause you either surf or fight.

534
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:14,318
That clear? get going.
I'll cover for 'em.

535
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:17,484
And bring a board for Lance.

536
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:19,892
We can't do shit
until the boat gets here.

537
00:46:19,996 --> 00:46:23,329
Lance, I'll bet you can't
wait to get out there.

538
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:25,401
- What?
- see how they break both ways?

539
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:29,460
one guy can break right, one left,
simultaneous. What do you think?

540
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:31,597
We ought to wait
for the tide to come up.

541
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:34,700
- Come here. Look.
- Incoming!

542
00:46:37,246 --> 00:46:41,706
The tide doesn't come in
for six hours!

543
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:44,945
You wanna wait here
for six hours?

544
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:50,892
Yo! Chief! Chief!

545
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,095
Okay, fellas, quit hiding.
Come on! Let's go!

546
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:03,934
- Dick-heads, take off!
- goddamn it!

547
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,531
Don't you think it's
a little risky for R and R?

548
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:10,703
If I say it's safe to surf this
beach, it's safe to surf this beach!

549
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,111
I'm not afraid
to surf this place!

550
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:16,117
I'll surf this fuckin' place.

551
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:20,589
give me that R-T, soldier.

552
00:47:21,858 --> 00:47:24,952
Dove Four, this is Big Duke six.
goddamn it!

553
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,154
I want that tree line bombed!

554
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:29,731
Big Duke Six, roger.
Dove One-Three, stand by.

555
00:47:29,832 --> 00:47:31,766
Blow them into the Stone Age, son!

556
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:34,936
- out!
- No, back, no!

557
00:47:35,038 --> 00:47:38,735
Let me take care of this.
get that out of here!

558
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:42,333
- I'm sorry.
- Come here now. All right.

559
00:47:42,478 --> 00:47:44,537
- No, ma'am. sorry!
-Jimmy!

560
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,649
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.

561
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:50,185
They need some napalm in the tree
line. Can you put it down there?

562
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,288
Right, One-Three. We're fixin '
to fuck with 'em. What's the target?

563
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:56,620
We're trying to suppress some mortar
fire offthe tree line down there.

564
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:58,887
- Roger. Here we come.
- Good. Give it allyou got.

565
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,486
Bring in allyour ships.

566
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:05,363
Put him in my chopper.
get him back to the hospital.

567
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:07,698
No, no, no,
you got to go with him.

568
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,671
Come on! go! go!
get it outta here!

569
00:48:10,773 --> 00:48:12,673
Tell my guys I want my board!

570
00:48:12,775 --> 00:48:14,675
Big Duke Six,
this is Dove One-Three.

571
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:18,178
Thejets are inbound now. You got
about 30 seconds to bomb station.

572
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:21,341
Get yourpeople back and heads down.
This is gonna be a big one.

573
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,844
Don't worry.

574
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:29,118
We'll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.

575
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:32,661
give me those shorts.

576
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:36,459
These are from the Air-Cav,
a present from me and the boys.

577
00:48:36,566 --> 00:48:39,865
I want to see you do your stuff
in 'em out there.

578
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,486
You smell that?

579
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:08,155
- Do you smell that?
- What?

580
00:49:08,264 --> 00:49:13,395
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

581
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:17,269
Come on. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

582
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:20,240
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

583
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,970
You know, one time we had
a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.

584
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:26,445
When it was all over,
I walked up.

585
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:31,851
We didn't find one of them,
not one stinking dink body.

586
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:35,014
But the smell--
You know, that gasoline smell.

587
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:39,390
The whole hill smelled like...

588
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:44,595
victory.

589
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:51,773
someday this war's gonna end.

590
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:08,315
- Lance! The wind!
- Huh?

591
00:50:08,424 --> 00:50:10,358
- The wind!
- What?

592
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:13,485
It's blowin' onshore!
It's gonna blow this place out.

593
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:16,724
- It's gonna ruin it!
- Not cool! It's gonna blow out!

594
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,802
It's the goddamn napalm!
That's what's doin' it!

595
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:22,803
I know. I'm really sorry, Colonel.
I'm afraid that does it.

596
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:24,133
The kid's got a reputation.

597
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,606
You can't expect him
to surf those sloppy waves.

598
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:28,937
- I understand.
- I'm an artist, Bill.

599
00:50:29,078 --> 00:50:34,072
- I couldn't surf that stuff.
- I apologize. It's not my fault.

600
00:50:34,217 --> 00:50:35,684
The waves are gettin'
blown out by the napalm.

601
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:36,876
Don't get me wrong--

602
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:38,977
It was the bombs causing
a vortex with the wind.

603
00:50:39,088 --> 00:50:40,988
I accept your apology.

604
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,786
But ifyou could hang
around 20 minutes--

605
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:46,191
- some other time, Bill.
-Just 20 minutes!

606
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:49,526
- I'm an artist.
- Keep walking.

607
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:53,625
Okay, give it a try, guys.
One goes left and one goes right.

608
00:50:53,736 --> 00:50:55,636
Look, Lance.

609
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:57,638
- You through surfing?
- Yeah!

610
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,674
- Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
- No.

611
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,675
- You sure?
- Yeah!

612
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:04,143
- get the fuck outta here.
- It's the napalm.

613
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:06,511
Just wait 20 minutes!

614
00:51:06,616 --> 00:51:08,777
Damn! Fuck!

615
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:11,718
They've been lookin' for ya.

616
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:16,024
- Don't leave without me!
- Where the fuck you goin'?

617
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:18,821
Here!

618
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:23,158
Incoming!

619
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:25,234
That's the colonel's surfboard!

620
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,666
Hey, get the fuck off me!
It's mine!

621
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:38,503
You fucking Airborne!

622
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:12,073
- Lance.
- Chef, light up, man.

623
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,738
Come on. Let's get high.

624
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,851
- Wanna smoke?
- Let's do it, man. Light up.

625
00:52:15,952 --> 00:52:19,388
Someday this war's gonna end.

626
00:52:19,488 --> 00:52:22,389
That would bejust fine
with the boys on the boat.

627
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:24,823
They weren't looking for
anything more than a way home.

628
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:29,864
- Captain?
- Trouble is, I'd been back there...

629
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:33,026
and I knew that it just
didn 't exist anymore.

630
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:38,497
Buddha time. Here.

631
00:52:38,607 --> 00:52:42,737
All ri ght, that's great,
you motherfuckers. Yeah.

632
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:49,979
Ifthat's how Kilgore
fought the war...

633
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:53,954
I began to wonder what
they really had against Kurtz.

634
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,957
It wasn 't just
insanity and murder.

635
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,085
There was enough ofthat
to go around for everyone.

636
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,967
I mean, he never
was hurtin' for pussy.

637
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:19,044
I'm not here. I'm walking through
the jungle gathering mangos.

638
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:22,049
I meet Raquel Welch.

639
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:28,847
I make a nice
mango cream pudding.

640
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:32,189
You know, kind of
spread it around on us.

641
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:35,991
she's into mangos too.

642
00:53:36,098 --> 00:53:38,589
she's like one limb above me.

643
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:42,137
-We're both in the jungle here nude.
-Hey, Chief.

644
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:45,435
- Yeah?
- Here comes that colonel guy again.

645
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,344
You know how hard it is
to find a boardyou like.

646
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,881
I will not hurt or harm you.

647
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:56,178
I will not hurt
or harm you.

648
00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:59,186
Just give me back
the board, Lance.

649
00:53:59,288 --> 00:54:02,587
It was a good board,
and I like it.

650
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:06,127
You know how hard it is
to find a boardyou like.

651
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:10,062
- He's a determined motherfucker!
- I will not hurt or harm you.

652
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,566
I will not hurt or harm you.

653
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:15,466
Just give me back
the board, Lance.

654
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:17,869
It was a good board,
and I like it.

655
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:22,637
You know how hard it is
to find a boardyou like.

656
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:25,747
- I will not hurt or harm you.
- Jesus Christ.

657
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:28,408
That guy's too
fuckin' much, man.

658
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:30,519
Do you think
he would have shot us?

659
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:32,883
He wouldn't have shot us
on the beach...

660
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:35,786
but he would have shot us
if he saw me taking his board.

661
00:54:35,891 --> 00:54:38,086
Let's go surfin'now
Everybody's learnin'how

662
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:40,526
Let's get this board
out of my turret.

663
00:54:40,629 --> 00:54:41,857
sucker.

664
00:54:41,964 --> 00:54:44,432
How am I going to shoot him
the next time he comes around?

665
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:48,936
Hey, Chef, make some room
back there for the board.

666
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,374
sock it to me, Lance.

667
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:00,045
I wonder if that's
the same chopper.

668
00:55:00,149 --> 00:55:03,346
He's probably got them all over
the river with that recording.

669
00:55:03,452 --> 00:55:05,352
We'll have to hold up here
till dark, Chief.

670
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:07,513
Don't worry, Lance.
He won't follow us too far.

671
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:09,352
What makes you say that?

672
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,358
You think that big Cav colonel
wants everyone upriver...

673
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,893
to know we stole his board?

674
00:55:12,995 --> 00:55:15,054
I didn't steal it!

675
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,100
- Captain?
- Hmm?

676
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:22,295
Just how far up
this river we goin'?

677
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:27,205
It's classified, Chief.
I can't tell ya.

678
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:29,311
We're goin' up pretty far.

679
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:32,640
Is it gonna be hairy?

680
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:38,580
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.

681
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:42,487
You like it like that, Captain,
when it's hot, hairy?

682
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,889
Fuck.

683
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,529
Maybe you'll get
a chance to know...

684
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,005
what the fuckyou are
in some factory in ohio.

685
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:04,107
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go
get those mangos now, okay?

686
00:56:04,246 --> 00:56:06,271
- Take somebody with ya.
- Yeah, I'll take--

687
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:08,645
I'll go with him.

688
00:56:13,255 --> 00:56:15,485
Chef?

689
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:18,526
- Yes, sir?
- How come they call you that?

690
00:56:18,627 --> 00:56:21,027
- Call me what, sir?
- Chef.

691
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:25,260
- Because you like mangos and stuff?
- No, sir, I'm a real chef.

692
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:29,463
- I'm a saucier.
- saucier?

693
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:33,531
Yes, sir.
see, I come from New orleans.

694
00:56:33,676 --> 00:56:38,113
I was raised to be a saucier,
a great saucier.

695
00:56:38,214 --> 00:56:41,445
- What's a saucier?
- You specialize in sauces.

696
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:48,981
gotta be a mango tree
here somewhere.

697
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:57,430
Then, I was supposed
to go to Paris...

698
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,331
study at the Escoffier school.

699
00:57:00,436 --> 00:57:05,601
But then I got orders
for my physical.

700
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:18,350
Hell, I joined the navy.

701
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:21,048
Heard they had better food.

702
00:57:21,156 --> 00:57:23,590
Cook school-- that did it.

703
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:28,629
- Yeah, how's that?
- You don't wanna hear about that.

704
00:57:30,165 --> 00:57:34,363
They lined us up in front
of a hundred yards of prime rib.

705
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:37,667
All of us, you know,
lined up lookin' at it.

706
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:41,573
Magnificent meat. Really!
Beautifully marbled.

707
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:48,613
Next thing, they're throwing
the meat into these big cauldrons--

708
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:51,686
all of it-- boiling it!

709
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,779
I looked inside, man.
It was turning gray.

710
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:58,792
I couldn't fucking
believe that one.

711
00:57:58,894 --> 00:58:04,594
That's when I applied for radioman
school, but then they gave me--

712
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:46,067
What is it?

713
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:49,076
Charlie?

714
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:01,647
It's a tiger!

715
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:06,854
son of a bitch!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

716
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:09,453
Battle stations.
Lance, up front.

717
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:10,862
- get on your 60!
- got it.

718
00:59:10,966 --> 00:59:15,699
- Holy shit! A fuckin' tiger!
- Chef, come on!

719
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:18,864
- Captain, come on!
- Let's hop in and go!

720
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:21,135
Let's go!

721
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:23,801
You were right.
Never get out of the boat.

722
00:59:23,946 --> 00:59:26,608
- Bring that 60 forward!
- Why never get out of the boat?

723
00:59:26,749 --> 00:59:30,185
I gotta remember!
Never get out of the boat!

724
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:32,480
Never get out of the boat!

725
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,582
- How many is it?
- A fuckin' tiger!

726
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:40,218
- What?
- A tiger?

727
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:45,767
Yes! I've had it! I've had
the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!

728
00:59:45,868 --> 00:59:48,462
You can kiss my ass
on the county square...

729
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,538
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

730
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:52,539
I didn't come here for this.

731
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:55,269
I don't fuckin' need it!
I don't want it.

732
00:59:55,411 --> 00:59:59,814
I didn't get out the goddamn
eighth grade for this kind of shit!

733
00:59:59,915 --> 01:00:02,179
All I wanted to do
was fuckin' cook!

734
01:00:02,284 --> 01:00:05,481
I just wanted to learn
to fuckin' cook, man!

735
01:00:05,587 --> 01:00:08,488
- You're all right.
- What happened, bro?

736
01:00:10,592 --> 01:00:12,924
You're all right.
You're gonna be all right.

737
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:16,623
All right?
It's gonna be all right?

738
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:20,224
Never get out
of the fuckin' boat.

739
01:00:20,335 --> 01:00:23,793
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger!
good-bye!

740
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:27,908
Neverget out ofthe boat.

741
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:30,705
Absolutely, goddamn right...

742
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:34,645
unlessyou were
going all the way.

743
01:00:39,455 --> 01:00:41,821
Kurtz got offthe boat.

744
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:46,893
He split from
the whole fuckin 'program.

745
01:00:48,697 --> 01:00:51,291
How did that happen?

746
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,392
What did he see here
that first tour?

747
01:01:00,676 --> 01:01:04,203
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

748
01:01:04,346 --> 01:01:06,280
Ifyou joined
the Green Berets...

749
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:09,282
there was no way
you'd ever get above colonel.

750
01:01:09,384 --> 01:01:13,480
Kurtz knew what
he was giving up.

751
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:16,490
The more I read
and began to understand...

752
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:19,152
the more I admired him.

753
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:21,889
His family and friends
couldn 't understand it...

754
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:25,660
and they couldn 't
talk him out ofit.

755
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:29,225
He had to apply three times,
and he put up with a ton ofshit.

756
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:32,603
But when he threatened
to resign, they gave it to him.

757
01:01:36,645 --> 01:01:41,082
The next youngest guy
in his class was halfhis age.

758
01:01:41,216 --> 01:01:43,844
They must have thought
he was some far-out old man...

759
01:01:43,952 --> 01:01:46,352
humping it over that course.

760
01:01:46,455 --> 01:01:51,017
I did it when I was 1 9.
It damn near wasted me.

761
01:01:52,594 --> 01:01:54,960
A tough motherfucker.

762
01:01:56,298 --> 01:01:58,232
He finished it.

763
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:03,796
He could have gone for general...

764
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:06,807
but he went for himselfinstead.

765
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:11,212
Dear Eva...

766
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:14,043
T oday was really a new one.

767
01:02:14,149 --> 01:02:18,984
Almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin' ti ger.

768
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:21,612
Really un-fucking believable,
you know?

769
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:24,692
We're taking this guy,
Captain Willard, up the river...

770
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:27,819
but he hasn't told us yet
where we're taking him.

771
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,830
Come on, baby

772
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:32,366
Thought you might have
heard by now from Elwood.

773
01:02:32,467 --> 01:02:36,233
October 1967.
On special assignment...

774
01:02:36,338 --> 01:02:38,533
Kontoom Province, II Corps.

775
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,633
Kurtz staged Operation Archangel
with combined local forces.

776
01:02:42,778 --> 01:02:45,178
Rated a major success.

777
01:02:48,283 --> 01:02:50,843
He received
no official clearance.

778
01:02:50,953 --> 01:02:54,684
He just thought it up
and did it.

779
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:58,055
What balls.

780
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,357
They were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one.

781
01:03:01,463 --> 01:03:04,091
But after the press
got ahold ofit...

782
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:06,360
they promoted him
to full colonel instead.

783
01:03:07,903 --> 01:03:12,670
Oh, man, the bullshit
piled up so fast in Vietnam.

784
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:17,370
You needed wings
to stay above it.

785
01:03:43,238 --> 01:03:47,140
This sure enough is a bizarre si ght
in the middle of this shit.

786
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:51,376
Expecting us this time?

787
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,414
Damned if I know.

788
01:03:58,654 --> 01:04:00,588
Hello. Hello.

789
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:02,816
Jesus--

790
01:04:06,728 --> 01:04:08,992
Wow.

791
01:04:09,097 --> 01:04:13,329
- It goes back up into the truck.
- What?

792
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:16,131
We gotta get
all that stuff up.

793
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:23,369
Hau Phat. You ever been
up here before, Chef?

794
01:04:23,512 --> 01:04:25,412
I bet you we can score up here.

795
01:04:25,514 --> 01:04:28,381
Check out the bikes, Lance.

796
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:31,418
Yamaha, suzuki. Yeah!

797
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,785
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, sukiyaki.

798
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,154
Yeah, man.
This is something.

799
01:04:40,162 --> 01:04:42,096
- Please!
- This must be the guy.

800
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:44,563
Right over there.

801
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:46,998
sergeant. sergeant.

802
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:55,468
Three drums of diesel fuel,
PBR five--

803
01:04:55,576 --> 01:04:57,373
Come on, man! Move!

804
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:59,604
We don't have time. One hour.
That's all. What do you want?

805
01:04:59,747 --> 01:05:03,080
- Can I get some Panama Red?
- Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

806
01:05:03,184 --> 01:05:06,517
- Sergeant?
- Destination?

807
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,019
I don't have no destination.

808
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:10,386
I can't do a goddamn thing
without a destination.

809
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:13,927
- Sarge? Sarge?
- I need a destination!

810
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:16,053
I can't do a thing about it
with a destination.

811
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,927
These guys are with me.
Destination's classified.

812
01:05:19,033 --> 01:05:21,399
I carry priority papers
from Com-Sec Intelligence.

813
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:25,131
Okay, right, sir. Hey, listen,
it's a real big night.

814
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:28,299
Eight bucks for that--
Hey!

815
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:30,672
All right. Damn.

816
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:34,269
- Just give him some fuel.
- You got it.

817
01:05:34,415 --> 01:05:37,384
- Dog starts barking.
- Hey, listen, Captain.

818
01:05:37,485 --> 01:05:40,579
I'm really sorry about tonight.
It's really bad around here.

819
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:45,352
Just take this over to the man
at the supply desk and you got it.

820
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:48,622
Would you guys like some seats--
some press box seats for the show?

821
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:51,197
The show out here.

822
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:53,766
- Bunnies, bunnies.
- Playboy bunnies?

823
01:05:53,868 --> 01:05:55,699
You got it.
You gonna be here?

824
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:59,067
Hey, listen, Captain,
on the house.

825
01:05:59,173 --> 01:06:03,041
No hard feelings, huh?

826
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,342
Howya doin'out there?

827
01:06:40,447 --> 01:06:43,245
I said, howya doin'out there?

828
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,682
Wanna say hello to you

829
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:47,686

831
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:54,254
Hello, allyou

And the sailors!

834
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,595
We know how tough

835
01:07:03,704 --> 01:07:06,798
To prove it we're gonna give you
entertainment you're gonna like.

836
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:11,003
Miss August,
Miss Sandra Beatty.

837
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,140
Miss May,
Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!

838
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:23,120
And the playmate ofthe year,
Miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!

839
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:25,419
Y o! Whoa!

840
01:07:25,526 --> 01:07:28,461
Oh, Susie-Q

841
01:07:28,562 --> 01:07:31,463
Oh, Susie-Q

842
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,258
- Oh, Susie-Q baby, I love you
- Hel lo!

843
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,930
Susie-Q

844
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,498
I like the wayyou walk

845
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:45,704
I like the wayyou talk

846
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:49,111
I like the wayyou walk

847
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:53,084
I like the wayyou talk
Susie-Q

848
01:07:55,089 --> 01:07:58,024
Oh, Susie-Q

849
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:00,184
Oh, Susie-Q

01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:05,891
Oh, Susie-Q
Baby, I love you

851
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,934
Susie-Q

852
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:11,027
I love you!

853
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,775
- Come on!
- What's the matter?

854
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:18,777
Come on, baby!

855
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:27,349
Grease my gun!

856
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:37,061
I'm ready to powwow, baby!

857
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:53,870
Come on! All ri ght!

858
01:08:54,014 --> 01:08:56,278
You're cute. I like you.

859
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:59,511
I'm here, baby! I'm here!

860
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:06,391
Yeah!

861
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:08,791
- You fucking bitch!
- Take it off!

862
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:10,523
Take it off!

863
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:14,294
Hey, lover!
You want us to come over!

864
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:18,360
- I sure do!
- Sign my centerfold!

865
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,641
Sign my centerfold!

866
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:25,438
Come on, baby!

867
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,843
Goddamn!

868
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:40,888
Start her up. Hey!

869
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:44,988
Get out of my way!

870
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:46,726
Come on!

871
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:53,499
- Will you sign these?
- Let's go! Let's go!

872
01:09:59,313 --> 01:10:02,339
Hurry!

873
01:10:12,526 --> 01:10:14,426
So long!

874
01:10:56,437 --> 01:10:59,304
Charlie didn't get much USO.

875
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:05,007
He was dug in too deep
or moving too fast.

876
01:11:08,148 --> 01:11:13,085
His idea ofgreat R and R was
cold rice and a little rat meat.

877
01:11:14,421 --> 01:11:17,288
He had only two ways home--

878
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:20,792
death or victory.

879
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:34,866
No wonder Kurtz put
a weed up Command's ass.

880
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,777
The war was being run by
a bunch offour-star clowns...

881
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:44,112
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away.

882
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:47,085
Hey, you know, man,
that was far-fucking-out.

883
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:50,748
I collected every picture of her
since she was Miss December, Chief.

884
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:53,793
Hey, Clean, look at that.
She was here, man.

885
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:56,727
I even wrote to the cunt.
She didn't write me back.

886
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,821
You can really get hung up
on these broads, man...

887
01:11:58,932 --> 01:12:00,832
just like that cat in the delta.

888
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:03,027
- Yeah, you better believe it.
- What cat?

889
01:12:03,137 --> 01:12:06,129
The one that went up for murder.
He was an army sergeant.

890
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,768
Remember? This cat, man--
He really dug his Playboy, man.

891
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,037
Dig it.

892
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:15,273
When the thing arrived,
he was there to meet it, man.

893
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:18,976
Look at these beautiful
fuckin' jugs, man!

894
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:21,987
Yeah, so anyway,
he was workin' ARVN patrols.

895
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:25,547
One of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit--

896
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:28,787
One day the gook took his magazine
and wouldn't give it back.

897
01:12:28,896 --> 01:12:31,490
He said, "Give me
my magazine back."

898
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:35,295
Gook say, "You shut up.
I have you court-martialed."

899
01:12:35,402 --> 01:12:37,529
- Typical fuckin' ARVN.
- Yeah!

900
01:12:37,638 --> 01:12:41,574
-Then the gook starts to go too far.
-Chef. Take the wheel.

901
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:45,769
This dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady's tits.

902
01:12:45,913 --> 01:12:47,380
Take the wheel.

903
01:12:47,481 --> 01:12:51,815
He started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold.

904
01:12:51,919 --> 01:12:54,911
The sergeant said,
"You better not do that to her.

905
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:57,013
You leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl.

906
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:59,024
Don't do her like that."

907
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:03,859
- Gook say "Fuckyou" in Vietnamese.
- Damn.

908
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:07,229
The sergeant couldn't
handle it no more.

909
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:09,598
He just picked up his iron...

910
01:13:09,703 --> 01:13:12,103
flipped it to
rock and roll and--

911
01:13:12,206 --> 01:13:14,265
Boom!

912
01:13:14,374 --> 01:13:17,104
Gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the Playboy mag.

913
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:20,179
It blew his ass clean
off of the dock.

914
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:25,582
There wasn't no more lieutenant
that day. That was it for his ass.

915
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:29,588
- They burn him for it?
- The sergeant? Yeah, man.

916
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,681
They stuck his ass
in the LBJ.

917
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:35,455
It's too bad he didn't
get no medals or nothin'.

918
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,890
Fuckin' ARVN, man.

919
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,900
They should have killed the fuck.

920
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:46,200
Should have given
the fucker a Silver Star.

921
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:51,005
Bummer for the gook though,
ain't it?

922
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:56,779
Good morning, Vietnam.

923
01:13:56,883 --> 01:13:59,681
I'm Army Specialist
ZackJohnson on AMVN.

924
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:04,086
It's about 82 degrees in downtown
Saigon right now, also very humid.

925
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,056
We have an important message
for all GI's...

926
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,593
who are living offbase
from the mayor ofSaigon.

927
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,322
He'd like you to hang
your laundry up indoors...

928
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:11,829
instead of on the windowsills.

929
01:14:11,932 --> 01:14:15,333
The mayor wantsyou
to keep Saigon beautiful.

930
01:14:15,435 --> 01:14:17,665
Now here's another blast from
the past going out to Big Sam...

931
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:21,605
who 's all alone out there with
the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry...

932
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:26,236
and dedicated by the fire team
to their groovy CO.

933
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,247
-The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction. '"
-All ri ght!

934
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,376
Watch out, Clean!

935
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:35,648
Get down, bubba!

936
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:41,222
I can 't get no

937
01:14:41,328 --> 01:14:44,229
Satisfaction

938
01:14:44,331 --> 01:14:45,696
Hang on, Lance!

939
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:48,267
I can 't get no

940
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:51,360
Satisfaction

941
01:14:51,471 --> 01:14:53,530
'Cause I try and I try

942
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,098
- Get down, bubba!
- And I try and I try

943
01:14:57,244 --> 01:14:59,235
I can't get no

944
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,348
I can't get no

945
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:05,816
Yeah!

946
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,479
When I'm drivin'in my car

947
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:12,388
-And the man comes on the radio
- Tell 'em you did it, Lance.

948
01:15:12,492 --> 01:15:14,426
He's tellin'me
more and more

949
01:15:14,528 --> 01:15:19,761
- I seeyou is right on target.
-About useless information

950
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:23,962
- Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- All right!

951
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:27,666
Look out, Lance!

952
01:15:32,012 --> 01:15:33,343
That's what I say

953
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:37,083
"Commitment and
Counterinsurgency...

954
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:39,845
by Col. Walter E. Kurtz.

955
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,853
As long as our officers
and troops perform...

956
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,048
tours of duty
limited to one year...

957
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:49,925
they will remain dilettantes
in war and tourists in Vietnam.

958
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:53,591
As long as cold beer,
hot food, rock and roll...

959
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,191
and all the other amenities
remain the expected norm...

960
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:59,295
our conduct ofthe war
will gain only impotence.

961
01:15:59,406 --> 01:16:01,533
We need fewer men, and better.

962
01:16:01,675 --> 01:16:03,666
Ifthey were committed,
this war could be won...

963
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,074
with a fourth
of ourpresent force. '"

964
01:16:06,213 --> 01:16:09,011
Shit. Chicken time.

965
01:16:09,116 --> 01:16:12,244
You ain't shittin', bro.
They're motherfuckin'.

966
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:15,751
Who is that?

967
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,159
Is that you, Lazzaro?

968
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,660
Don't chicken out.

969
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:32,628
Lazzaro!

970
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:34,707
Come on!

971
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:40,007
- Fire on the canopy!
- I got it! Get outta there!

972
01:16:40,147 --> 01:16:44,049
Yeah! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

973
01:16:44,151 --> 01:16:46,346
Lance, get down!

974
01:16:46,453 --> 01:16:49,251
Put that fucker out, man!

975
01:16:55,962 --> 01:16:58,954
What the fuck
they think they're doin'?

976
01:17:22,022 --> 01:17:26,083
Late summer, autumn 1968.

977
01:17:26,193 --> 01:17:30,391
Kurtz's patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush.

978
01:17:30,497 --> 01:17:32,727
The camp started falling apart.

979
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:41,040
November.

980
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:45,908
Kurtz orders assassination of
three Vietnamese men and one woman.

981
01:17:46,046 --> 01:17:50,142
Two ofthe men were colonels
in the South Vietnamese army.

982
01:17:52,452 --> 01:17:55,353
Enemy activity in his old sector
dropped offto nothing.

983
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:03,885
Guess he must have hit
the right fourpeople.

984
01:18:03,997 --> 01:18:09,526
He joined the Special Forces.
After that his--

985
01:18:09,636 --> 01:18:13,072
The army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold.

986
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:15,698
- methods--
- Ifhe'd pulled over...

987
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:18,811
- it all would have been forgotten.
- unsound.

988
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,845
But he kept going.

989
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:24,007
- Now he's crossed into Cambodia--
- He kept winning it his way.

990
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,119
- with this Montagnard army of his--
- And they called me in.

991
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:32,055
Man like a god and follow
every order, however ridiculous.

992
01:18:35,262 --> 01:18:38,254
They lost him.

993
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:40,856
He was gone.

994
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,868
Nothing but rumors
and random intelligence...

995
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:47,770
mostly from captured VC.

996
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:52,106
The VC knew his name by now,
and they were scared ofhim.

997
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:54,236
He and his men were
playing hit-and-run...

998
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:56,975
all the way into Cambodia.

999
01:19:01,655 --> 01:19:03,885
I know what I'm doin'.

1000
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:06,049
I'm goin' to the White House
to have dinner...

1001
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,753
with the president
of the United States.

1002
01:19:08,862 --> 01:19:11,023
That's where I'm goin'.

1003
01:19:11,131 --> 01:19:13,497
Hey, Chef,
put the cover on that.

1004
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:17,629
Clean.

1005
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,800
How long has that kid
been on this boat?

1006
01:19:22,943 --> 01:19:24,968
Seven months.

1007
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:28,444
He's really specializing
in busting my balls.

1008
01:19:28,548 --> 01:19:31,244
Very possible, Captain,
he thinks the same ofyou.

1009
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:36,721
-Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
-I don't think.

1010
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:39,451
My orders say I'm not supposed to
know where I'm taking this boat...

1011
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:41,424
so I don't!

1012
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:46,864
But one look at you, and I know
it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.

1013
01:19:55,609 --> 01:19:59,443
We're going upriver about
75 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

1014
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:06,776
- That's Cambodia, Captain.
- That's classified.

1015
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:11,846
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,
but that's where I'm going.

1016
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:14,449
You just get me close
to my destination...

1017
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,461
and I'll cut you
and the crew loose.

1018
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:21,859
All right, Captain.

1019
01:20:43,356 --> 01:20:45,449
"DearSon...

1020
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:47,992
I'm afraid that both you andyour
mother will have been worried...

1021
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:51,359
at not hearing from me
during the past weeks...

1022
01:20:51,464 --> 01:20:55,264
but my situation here
has become a difficult one.

1023
01:20:55,368 --> 01:20:58,963
I have been officially
accused ofmurder by the army.

1024
01:21:05,545 --> 01:21:08,981
The alleged victims were
four Vietnamese double agents.

1025
01:21:09,082 --> 01:21:13,109
We spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence.

1026
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:20,121
When absolute proof was completed,
we acted-- we acted like soldiers.

1027
01:21:20,226 --> 01:21:22,717
The charges are unjustified.

1028
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:26,560
They are, in fact, and in the
circumstances ofthis conflict...

1029
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:28,896
quite completely insane.

1030
01:21:39,412 --> 01:21:44,076
In a war, there are many moments
for compassion and tender action.

1031
01:21:44,184 --> 01:21:47,119
There are many moments
for ruthless action--

1032
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,654
what is often
called ruthless...

1033
01:21:49,756 --> 01:21:53,021
but may in many circumstances
be only clarity--

1034
01:21:53,126 --> 01:21:55,094
seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it-- '"

1035

- Request dust-off.

I am unconcerned. '"

1041

Medevac, come in.

morality, and so I am beyond caring. '"

1043

Medevac, do you read? Over.

1044
01:22:19,953 --> 01:22:23,411
"You have all my faith.
Your loving father""

1045
01:22:42,342 --> 01:22:44,469
Jesus.

1046
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:47,409
No wonder I couldn't
get 'em on the radio.

1047
01:22:47,514 --> 01:22:49,414
What a dump.

1048
01:22:53,353 --> 01:22:55,344
- Hi there!
- How ya doin'?

1049
01:22:55,455 --> 01:22:57,514
Wow. That's a nice
little boat you got there.

1050
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,717
Never seen one
up here before.

1051
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:02,728
We called in a request
for Medevac. You receive it?

1052
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:04,729
Medevac? No.

1053
01:23:04,831 --> 01:23:07,197
We passed a downed Huey
with some KIA's.

1054
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,463
- On your way here?
- Yeah.

1055
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,664
- You goin' up this river?
- Way up.

1056
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:17,573
- Way upriver? Forget it.
- Why?

1057
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:21,202
We want to send
some people downriver.

1058
01:23:21,347 --> 01:23:23,713
- Just forget it.
- What the fuck was that?

1059
01:23:23,817 --> 01:23:27,344
- We'll be back in a couple of days.
- Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1060
01:23:33,693 --> 01:23:35,593
- Chief?
- Yeah, Captain?

1061
01:23:35,695 --> 01:23:37,595
Why don't you see what
you can do with that engine?

1062
01:23:37,697 --> 01:23:39,665
- I'm gonna look around.
- All right.

1063
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:43,133
Hey, don't leave without me.

1064
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:06,585
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1065
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:08,718
Don't ask me, man.

1066
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,879
Give my clothes back,
you asshole!

1067
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:38,249
Asshole!

1068
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:44,491
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1069
01:24:44,597 --> 01:24:49,694
He stepped on a land mine about two
months ago. He got blown to hell.

1070
01:24:49,802 --> 01:24:52,737
- Who's in charge here?
- Charge?

1071
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:54,932
I don't know, man.
I'm just the night man.

1072
01:24:55,041 --> 01:24:58,499
Just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.

1073
01:24:58,611 --> 01:25:01,205
What about you, fella?

1074
01:25:01,347 --> 01:25:04,805
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you
it's gonna jam. You mark my words.

1075
01:25:04,951 --> 01:25:07,715
- Keep it in that condition--
- Get off my back!

1076
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,879
- No, man, I'm telling you--
- Lay off!

1077
01:25:11,391 --> 01:25:14,827
Hey! Hey! Come here!

1078
01:25:14,928 --> 01:25:17,556
Is that your boat?
Come on inside.

1079
01:25:17,664 --> 01:25:20,258
What do you want?

1080
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:23,563
Come on inside.
I want to talk to you. Come on!

1081
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:28,198
Get out of the rain.

1082
01:25:28,308 --> 01:25:30,674
Get off me!

1083
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,005
Come on. Cut this shit.
Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.

1084
01:25:33,146 --> 01:25:37,742
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.

1085
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:41,581
- I got your ass.
- Your ass is shit.

1086
01:25:41,688 --> 01:25:44,748
Chef, your ass is shit!

1087
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:53,890
You're a motherfucker, man.

1088
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,628
Goddamn, my ear,
you motherfucker!

1089
01:25:59,005 --> 01:26:02,634
- Get him off me, Chef.
- You smart-ass.

1090
01:26:02,775 --> 01:26:04,868
Hey, guys.

1091
01:26:05,011 --> 01:26:07,775
I got you!
I got your ass!

1092
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,316
- You ain't shit, Chef.
- Hey, fellas.

1093
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:15,478
- You pulled my fuckin'--
- Hey, guys.

1094
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:19,080
I just made a deal with
the people from Hau Phat.

1095
01:26:19,192 --> 01:26:23,925
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for
a couple of hours with the bunnies.

1096
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:32,127
Whoa. Whoa. Captain!

1097
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:35,139
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?

1098
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:38,766
No, I'm not. Grab a couple of
barrels and get up to that big tent.

1099
01:26:38,911 --> 01:26:40,936
Come on!

1100
01:26:42,081 --> 01:26:44,072
Captain.

1101
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:47,618
You're giving away our fuel
for a playmate of the month?

1102
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,816
Nope, playmate
of the year, Chief.

1103
01:26:51,924 --> 01:26:55,553
Warm 'em up, baby!
Warm 'em up!

1104
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:58,357
Captain, we get in a fire fight
and run out of fuel...

1105
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:00,955
I want you to tell me
how she was.

1106
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:06,095
I made a deal for all of us, Chief.
How about you?

1107
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:12,144
- You got some mamas in there?
- Some what?

1108
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,909
Forget it, Captain.
I'll stay with the boat.

1109
01:27:18,017 --> 01:27:21,578
Hey, Captain!
Give me a hand.

1110
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:42,707
You know, I got a--

1111
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,901
I got every one
ofyour pictures.

1112
01:27:45,044 --> 01:27:47,877
I got the centerfold,
the playmate's review...

1113
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,676
the playmate of the year runoff.

1114
01:27:50,783 --> 01:27:52,751
I even got the calendar.

1115
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:58,119
Hey, oiseau.
How come you got a bird?

1116
01:27:58,224 --> 01:28:01,091
I used to be the bird girl
at Busch Gardens.

1117
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:05,290
- Busch Gardens?
- I used to train birds there.

1118
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:07,298
You are--

1119
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,494
- You are Miss December, aren't you?
- Miss May.

1120
01:28:10,603 --> 01:28:12,571
Is it coming?

1121
01:28:19,145 --> 01:28:22,911
- Miss December has black hair.
- It's over there.

1122
01:28:23,015 --> 01:28:26,781
He's not one
of my regular birds.

1123
01:28:26,886 --> 01:28:30,788
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1124
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:34,189
Being playmate of the year...

1125
01:28:34,293 --> 01:28:37,785
is the loneliest experience
I can imagine.

1126
01:28:38,998 --> 01:28:42,525
It's like--
You try to express...

1127
01:28:42,635 --> 01:28:47,470
your feelings to someone
and show them your heart--

1128
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:49,473
Yeah, I want to hear
about your bird act.

1129
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:51,509
I'd love to hear
about your bird act.

1130
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:55,513
But would you mind
just puttin' this--

1131
01:28:55,615 --> 01:29:00,314
Would you just mind putting
this blackwig on for me, please?

1132
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:03,149
And there's
this glass wall between you--

1133
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:05,884
this invisible glass.

1134
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:08,586
They can see
your mouth moving.

1135
01:29:08,694 --> 01:29:11,162
I used to train birds
for at least two years--

1136
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:13,198
- That's beautiful.
- at Busch Gardens.

1137
01:29:13,299 --> 01:29:16,564
This was cascading overyour
right shoulder. This was open here.

1138
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:20,298
But they can't hear
what you're saying.

1139
01:29:20,406 --> 01:29:24,365
I used to train them to stand
on their head and ride a bicycle--

1140
01:29:24,477 --> 01:29:26,377
Your right hand was--

1141
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:28,379
Hey, Chef!

1142
01:29:28,481 --> 01:29:31,450
- Get outta here, man!
- Come on!

1143
01:29:31,584 --> 01:29:34,519
- Does he want to talk to you?
- Later. Give me 1 5 minutes.

1144
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:38,647
You can never really make them hear
what you're trying to say.

1145
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:41,818
You okay with kind of bending?
That's it.

1146
01:29:41,928 --> 01:29:44,362
Your ass was sticking out
just a little-- Hey, man, fuck off!

1147
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,431
Fifteen minutes!

1148
01:29:46,532 --> 01:29:50,400
That's why I tried
so desperately...

1149
01:29:50,503 --> 01:29:53,961
to show somebody
that I had some talent.

1150
01:29:54,073 --> 01:29:56,064
Little baby macaws.

1151
01:29:56,175 --> 01:29:59,042
- Have you ever seen a baby macaw?
- That's kind of open there.

1152
01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:01,375
- They're all blue--
- Take off, would you?

1153
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,643
I got my rights, man!

1154
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,480
They make you do things
you don't wanna do--

1155
01:30:07,587 --> 01:30:11,079
Iike, this picture here.

1156
01:30:13,859 --> 01:30:18,228
I started feeling
repulsed with myself.

1157
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:21,926
You were just kind of bending
forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.

1158
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:24,696
- I love training birds.
- That's it.

1159
01:30:24,804 --> 01:30:28,205
That's it. That's very--
That's it. Voila.

1160
01:30:28,307 --> 01:30:32,368
You're beautiful.
I just want to--

1161
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:35,378
You know, I can't believe it.

1162
01:30:35,481 --> 01:30:39,747
Me,J. Hicks.
I can't believe I'm really here.

1163
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:44,448
Maybe I'm unfit
to have a relationship...

1164
01:30:44,557 --> 01:30:49,392
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1165
01:30:49,495 --> 01:30:52,987
Just think, if it hadn't
been for the Vietnam War...

1166
01:30:53,099 --> 01:30:55,397
I never would have met you,
Miss December.

1167
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:57,025
Miss May.

1168
01:30:57,136 --> 01:31:01,937
I wish--
I wish I could find...

1169
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,874
just one person...

1170
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:09,412
that could share
my point ofview.

1171
01:31:15,955 --> 01:31:18,014
Oh, you kiss like a bird!

1172
01:31:18,124 --> 01:31:20,285
Oh, God! Kiss me! Kiss me!

1173
01:31:21,294 --> 01:31:22,693
Who is that?

1174
01:31:22,795 --> 01:31:28,427
- You're drivin' me crazy! Kiss me!
- I love birds!

1175
01:31:32,471 --> 01:31:36,168
You finished yet?

1176
01:31:36,309 --> 01:31:39,142
Oh! Fuck!

1177
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:41,645
Like a bird!
Take me like a bird!

1178
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:44,944
Fly, baby! Cock it to me!

1179
01:31:45,051 --> 01:31:47,747
- Fly!
- I can fly like an eagle!

1180
01:31:47,853 --> 01:31:50,686
- Fly like an eagle!
- It drives me crazy!

1181
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:53,918
It drives me crazy!

1182
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:05,867
Lance, that was somebody's son.

1183
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:12,741
Lance, there were things
that they made me do...

1184
01:32:12,878 --> 01:32:14,937
that I didn't want to do.

1185
01:32:15,081 --> 01:32:18,812
They said, "Pull the ribbons
between your legs."

1186
01:32:18,918 --> 01:32:21,352
I didn't want to do it.

1187
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,185
But they said that was
what was expected of me...

1188
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:27,987
that that's what people
wanted to see.

1189
01:32:49,715 --> 01:32:53,651
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm next, ma'am.

1190
01:32:53,786 --> 01:32:56,448
Ha, ha! Hell,
I didn't know it was a cherry.

1191
01:32:56,555 --> 01:32:59,251
-Didn't know you never got no pussy.
-Shove it, fuckup.

1192
01:32:59,358 --> 01:33:02,156
Sorry about that. If I'd have
known, I'd take you to New Orleans.

1193
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,661
- Man, fuckyou.
- Introduce you to--

1194
01:33:04,764 --> 01:33:08,291
- Lay off, Chef.
- Cherry boy, cherry boy.

1195
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:10,665
You're a fuckin' dog!

1196
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:14,035
Come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.

1197
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,040
Lay off, Chef.

1198
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:18,075
You're the only fuckin' prick
I see around here.

1199
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:20,077
If I wanna play with a prick,
I'll play with my own.

1200
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:21,077
Lay off!

1201
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:23,705
What are you gonna
do with it, cherry boy?

1202
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:25,214
Chef, I said lay off!

1203
01:33:25,317 --> 01:33:29,754
Chef, knock it off! Give him
a break! What do you think I said?

1204
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:31,789
Then give your jaws a rest!

1205
01:33:31,891 --> 01:33:35,884
This ain't the army.
You are a sailor!

1206
01:33:35,995 --> 01:33:38,225
So get out of that
frizzly army-looking shirt...

1207
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:40,264
and stop smoking that dope!

1208
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:42,266
You hear me?

1209
01:33:46,105 --> 01:33:48,767
Lance, what's with
all the green paint?

1210
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,240
- Camouflage.
- How's that?

1211
01:33:51,377 --> 01:33:53,368
So they can't see ya.
They're everywhere, Chief.

1212
01:33:53,512 --> 01:33:56,948
I want you to stay awake up there,
man. You got a job to do.

1213
01:34:14,133 --> 01:34:18,035
Sampan off the port bow.
Sampan off the port bow.

1214
01:34:18,137 --> 01:34:20,571
Let's take a look. Lance.

1215
01:34:20,673 --> 01:34:25,167
Bring them in.
Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 1 6.

1216
01:34:25,311 --> 01:34:27,939
Clean, get on that 60!

1217
01:34:29,715 --> 01:34:31,615
What's up, Chief?

1218
01:34:33,052 --> 01:34:35,486
A junk boat, Captain.
We're gonna take a routine check.

1219
01:34:35,588 --> 01:34:38,989
Well, let's forget routine now
and let 'em go.

1220
01:34:39,091 --> 01:34:41,958
These boats are running supplies
in this delta, Captain.

1221
01:34:42,061 --> 01:34:44,495
I'm gonna take a look.

1222
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:46,531
My mission's got priority.

1223
01:34:46,632 --> 01:34:49,499
You wouldn't even be in this part
of the river if it wasn't for me.

1224
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:53,129
Until we reach your destination,
Captain, you're just on for the ride.

1225
01:34:53,239 --> 01:34:56,936
- Stand by, Lance.
- Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.

1226
01:34:57,076 --> 01:35:00,011
All right. Come on.
Let's bring it over.

1227
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:16,526
Look in that forward hooch.
Bring the people out of there.

1228
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:25,701
Come on!
Hurry up, motherfucker!

1229
01:35:27,373 --> 01:35:28,601
Can couc, you too.

1230
01:35:28,707 --> 01:35:31,005
- Keep your eyes open, Clean.
- I got you, Chief.

1231
01:35:35,347 --> 01:35:37,679
It's clear, Chief.

1232
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:46,585
Okay, that's them.
That's them. They're okay.

1233
01:35:46,692 --> 01:35:49,320
- Board and search it.
- It's just a fuckin' boat.

1234
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:51,362
- There ain't nothin' on it.
- Board it and search it.

1235
01:35:51,463 --> 01:35:54,694
Just some baskets and
some ducks, fuckin' bananas.

1236
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,631
- Ain't nothin' on it.
- Chef?

1237
01:35:56,735 --> 01:36:00,535
- What's wrong? Search it.
- There's the goat and some fish.

1238
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,539
- Chef!
- Fuckin' vegetables--

1239
01:36:02,675 --> 01:36:04,575
- Get on that boat!
- There's nothin' on it, man!

1240
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:06,167
- Get on it!
- All right!

1241
01:36:06,312 --> 01:36:09,611
Move it, asshole!
Goddamn it!

1242
01:36:09,715 --> 01:36:11,979
Just some pigs! Look, mangoes!

1243
01:36:12,084 --> 01:36:14,575
- What's in the rice bag?
- Fuckin' rice!

1244
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:17,121
- Look in there!
- Some fuckin' fish!

1245
01:36:17,222 --> 01:36:22,250
More coconuts.
Rice. Here's rice.

1246
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:24,556
- What's in that vegetable basket?
- Get out of here!

1247
01:36:24,663 --> 01:36:26,563
Come on!

1248
01:36:26,665 --> 01:36:28,724
Check that vegetable basket!

1249
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,734
- All right!
- Shut up, slope!

1250
01:36:30,836 --> 01:36:33,896
- There ain't nothin' in here!
- What's in the boxes?

1251
01:36:34,006 --> 01:36:35,769
- Look in that rusty can.
- Nothing!

1252
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:38,672
Just fuckin' rice!
There ain't nothin' on it!

1253
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:41,939
Check the yellow can!
She was sittin' on it. What's in it?

1254
01:36:45,317 --> 01:36:47,751
Chef!

1255
01:36:50,756 --> 01:36:53,953
Motherfuckers!

1256
01:36:56,295 --> 01:36:59,059
Motherfuckers!

1257
01:37:00,966 --> 01:37:04,458
- Hold it!
- Come on! Let's kill them all.

1258
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:07,903
- Motherfucking cocksuckers mothers!
- Hold it! Hold it!

1259
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:10,168
Let's kill all the assholes!
Shoot the shit outta all of'em.

1260
01:37:10,309 --> 01:37:13,540
- Hold it!
- Why not? Jesus Christ.

1261
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,479
Why the fuck not?

1262
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:20,814
- Clean?
- I'm good.

1263
01:37:27,559 --> 01:37:29,652
- You okay, Lance?
- Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1264
01:37:29,762 --> 01:37:32,424
- Chef!
- Look what she was hiding!

1265
01:37:32,531 --> 01:37:35,694
- You all right?
- See what she was runnin' for?

1266
01:37:38,303 --> 01:37:40,294
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1267
01:37:40,406 --> 01:37:43,273
It's a fuckin' puppy.

1268
01:37:43,409 --> 01:37:45,673
Give me that dog!

1269
01:37:45,811 --> 01:37:47,745
- Give me that dog!
- No! You're not gonna get it!

1270
01:37:47,846 --> 01:37:51,111
- Give it to me!
- Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!

1271
01:37:51,216 --> 01:37:54,310
Fuckyou! Fuckin' mango too!

1272
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:55,751
- Chef--
- You want that?

1273
01:37:55,888 --> 01:37:59,551
She's moving behind you.
She's alive. Check her out.

1274
01:37:59,658 --> 01:38:02,354
Chef! She's moving behind you.
Check her out!

1275
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:05,953
All right. All right.
Come on, Clean! Goddamn it!

1276
01:38:06,065 --> 01:38:09,262
She's not dead. She's wounded.
Give him a hand.

1277
01:38:09,368 --> 01:38:11,359
Just take it easy.
Take it easy!

1278
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:14,769
- Slow down and take it easy.
- Chef, wait a minute.

1279
01:38:14,873 --> 01:38:16,773
- Bring her up.
- Is she breathing?

1280
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:21,005
She's hurt. She's bleedin'.

1281
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:23,546
Bring her on board.
We're taking her to an ARVN.

1282
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:26,482
-What are you talking about?
-We're taking her to some friendlies.

1283
01:38:26,585 --> 01:38:29,554
- She's wounded. She's not dead.
- Get out of there.

1284
01:38:29,655 --> 01:38:30,849
The book says--

1285
01:38:41,667 --> 01:38:44,932
Fuckyou. Fuck 'im.

1286
01:38:45,037 --> 01:38:46,971
I told you not to stop.
Now let's go.

1287
01:39:47,099 --> 01:39:51,058
It was a way we had over here
ofliving with ourselves.

1288
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:54,628
We'd cut 'em in halfwith a
machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.

1289
01:39:56,809 --> 01:39:59,107
It was a lie.

1290
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:01,838
And the more I saw ofthem...

1291
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:04,210
the more I hated lies.

1292
01:40:06,118 --> 01:40:09,747
Those boys were never gonna
look at me the same way again...

1293
01:40:10,856 --> 01:40:15,418
but I felt like I knew one or two things
about Kurtz that weren 't in the dossier.

1294
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:24,827
Do L ung Bridge was the last
army outpost on the Nung River.

1295
01:40:29,241 --> 01:40:31,539
Beyond it,
there was only Kurtz.

1296
01:40:36,415 --> 01:40:38,815
- What do you thi nk?
- It's beautiful.

1297
01:40:40,185 --> 01:40:42,244
Huh? What's the matter with you?

1298
01:40:42,354 --> 01:40:44,822
You're acting kind of weird.

1299
01:40:44,923 --> 01:40:48,120
Hey, you know that last tab
of acid I was saving?

1300
01:40:49,228 --> 01:40:52,220
- I dropped it.
- You dropped acid?

1301
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:53,730
Far out.

1302
01:40:55,868 --> 01:40:59,099
Friendly!
Friendly! Friendly!

1303
01:41:04,776 --> 01:41:06,038
Take me home!

1304
01:41:06,178 --> 01:41:08,078
Goddamn it!

1305
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:11,274
- Fucking shore police! Shit!
- Man, you wanna die?

1306
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:13,316
Don't keep goin'!

1307
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:17,916
- You fuckin' police!
- Don't leave me!

1308
01:41:18,023 --> 01:41:20,116
Fuckyou!

1309
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:22,284
You'll get what you deserve!

1310
01:41:30,402 --> 01:41:32,495
Is there a Captain Willard
on board?

1311
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:34,538
- Yeah.
- Captain Willard?

1312
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:38,007
- Yeah. Who's that?
- Lieutenant Carlsen, sir.

1313
01:41:38,143 --> 01:41:40,805
Get that light off me!

1314
01:41:40,946 --> 01:41:43,915
I was sent here from Nha Trang
with these three days ago, sir.

1315
01:41:44,016 --> 01:41:47,452
Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.

1316
01:41:47,586 --> 01:41:49,952
- Don't know how happy this makes me.
- Why?

1317
01:41:50,055 --> 01:41:52,683
Now I can get out of here,
if I can find a way.

1318
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:59,897
You're in the asshole
of the world, Captain.

1319
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:06,033
Captain, where you going?

1320
01:42:06,138 --> 01:42:09,904
See if I can find some fuel
and get some information.

1321
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:12,135
Pick me up at the other side
of the bridge.

1322
01:42:12,277 --> 01:42:14,268
Somebody go with him. Chef.

1323
01:42:14,413 --> 01:42:16,278
I'll go.

1324
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:17,939
I wanna go.

1325
01:43:10,435 --> 01:43:12,926
Man, listen
to the music, man.

1326
01:43:13,038 --> 01:43:14,938
Where can I find the CO?

1327
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,940
You came right to it,
son of a bitch!

1328
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:21,711
Get down here!

1329
01:43:22,981 --> 01:43:26,144
You still got
a commanding officer here?

1330
01:43:26,251 --> 01:43:28,879
- Beverly Hills.
- What?

1331
01:43:28,987 --> 01:43:33,515
Straight up the road, there's a concrete
fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!

1332
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:36,822
Where the fuck else
do you think it would be?

1333
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:14,522
- Goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
- I thought you were dead.

1334
01:44:14,633 --> 01:44:16,863
Well, you thought wrong,
damn it!

1335
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:22,433
I told you to stop fucking
with me, didn't I?

1336
01:44:22,541 --> 01:44:24,168
You thinkyou're so bad,
huh, nigger?

1337
01:44:24,309 --> 01:44:26,300
What are you shooting at, soldier?

1338
01:44:26,445 --> 01:44:28,470
What the fuck
ya think I'm shootin' at?

1339
01:44:28,613 --> 01:44:31,377
I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks
out there by the wire.

1340
01:44:31,483 --> 01:44:33,178
But I think I killed them all.

1341
01:44:33,285 --> 01:44:35,378
You ain't shot shit. Listen.

1342
01:44:37,022 --> 01:44:40,014
Oh, shit. He's trying to call
his friends. Send up a flare.

1343
01:44:48,433 --> 01:44:50,731
Thinkyou so bad, huh, nigger?
You thinkyou bad, huh?

1344
01:44:50,836 --> 01:44:52,235
They're all dead, stupid.

1345
01:44:52,337 --> 01:44:55,397
There's one still alive
underneath them bodies.

1346
01:44:55,507 --> 01:44:56,997
Who's the commanding
officer here?

1347
01:44:58,210 --> 01:45:00,144
Ain't you?

1348
01:45:01,847 --> 01:45:03,371
You thinkyou so bad?

1349
01:45:03,515 --> 01:45:07,975
I got something foryour ass now,
nigger! I got something foryou now!

1350
01:45:09,754 --> 01:45:11,813
He's underneath the bodies, man.

1351
01:45:13,158 --> 01:45:15,353
Go get the Roach for me.

1352
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:19,055
Go get the Roach, nigger!
Go get the Roach.

1353
01:45:23,468 --> 01:45:25,800
Roach. Roach.

1354
01:45:28,406 --> 01:45:30,374
Got slopes on the wire, man.
You hear 'em?

1355
01:45:31,343 --> 01:45:32,867
Do you hear 'em?

1356
01:45:35,213 --> 01:45:37,807
Fuckyou, GI!

1357
01:45:37,949 --> 01:45:39,473
We'll bust 'em!

1358
01:45:42,254 --> 01:45:44,916
Hey, GI, fuckyou!

1359
01:45:48,994 --> 01:45:50,723
Fuckyou, GI!

1360
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:54,390
Fuckyou, GI!

1361
01:45:54,499 --> 01:45:56,660
Hear him out there
on the wire, man?

1362
01:45:59,304 --> 01:46:02,102
- I kill you, GI!
- You need a flare?

1363
01:46:06,978 --> 01:46:10,880
He's close, man.
He's real close.

1364
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:21,914
Fuckyou, GI!
I kill you!

1365
01:46:26,398 --> 01:46:28,298
Fuckyou, GI!

1366
01:46:33,138 --> 01:46:35,106
GI, fuckyou!

1367
01:46:37,342 --> 01:46:40,004
GI! GI--

1368
01:46:45,684 --> 01:46:47,015
Motherfucker.

1369
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:49,677
Hey, soldier.

1370
01:46:54,092 --> 01:46:55,957
Do you know who's
in command here?

1371
01:47:14,179 --> 01:47:16,647
Holy shit.

1372
01:47:21,319 --> 01:47:24,288
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys
just got blown off that bridge.

1373
01:47:24,389 --> 01:47:27,153
You hang on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

1374
01:47:31,196 --> 01:47:33,061
- What's that?
- Mail, man. Mail.

1375
01:47:33,164 --> 01:47:35,689
Later on the mail.
Watch them trees.

1376
01:47:37,936 --> 01:47:40,700
There's no diesel fuel,
but I picked up some ammo.

1377
01:47:40,805 --> 01:47:42,466
Let's move out.

1378
01:47:42,574 --> 01:47:46,305
- Did you find the CO, Captain?
- There's no fucking CO here.

1379
01:47:48,413 --> 01:47:50,677
Let's just get goin'.

1380
01:47:50,782 --> 01:47:52,682
Which way, Captain?

1381
01:47:58,356 --> 01:48:01,086
You know which way, Chief.

1382
01:48:01,192 --> 01:48:03,922
You're on your own, Captain.

1383
01:48:04,029 --> 01:48:05,428
Still wanna go on?

1384
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:07,122
It's like this bridge.

1385
01:48:07,232 --> 01:48:10,360
We build it every night, Charlie
blows it right back up again...

1386
01:48:10,468 --> 01:48:12,959
just so the generals
can say the road's open.

1387
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:14,800
Think about it.

1388
01:48:18,343 --> 01:48:21,073
- Who cares?
-Just get us upriver!

1389
01:48:25,383 --> 01:48:27,647
Chef, on the bow.

1390
01:48:28,887 --> 01:48:31,014
- Stand by, Clean.
- Let's go!

1391
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:27,308
You got one, Miller.
Geez, I got some too.

1392
01:49:27,445 --> 01:49:28,969
Whose package is that?

1393
01:49:29,114 --> 01:49:32,413
- Shit, you got another one, Clean.
- No shit? Wait a minute.

1394
01:49:32,517 --> 01:49:35,145
- Is that it?
- That's it foryou. Lance.

1395
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:39,753
Mr. L.B.Johnson,
there you go.

1396
01:49:39,824 --> 01:49:43,316
Far out, man. All right.
I've been waitin' for this one.

1397
01:49:43,428 --> 01:49:46,727
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.

1398
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:49,265
"Lance.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1399
01:49:49,367 --> 01:49:52,928
Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
Sue skinned her knee."

1400
01:49:53,037 --> 01:49:55,403
Man, I wanna get back
to Antoine's.

1401
01:49:55,507 --> 01:49:59,807
"I remember the time we went up to--"
How could I fucking forget? Beautiful.

1402
01:49:59,944 --> 01:50:02,640
"There could never be a place
like Disneyland, or could there?

1403
01:50:02,781 --> 01:50:03,975
Let me know."

1404
01:50:04,082 --> 01:50:07,415
Jim, it's here.
It really is here.

1405
01:50:11,956 --> 01:50:14,481
"There has been a new development
regardingyour mission...

1406
01:50:14,592 --> 01:50:16,924
which we must now
communicate to you.

1407
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:20,464
Months ago, a man was ordered on
a mission which was identical to yours.

1408
01:50:21,332 --> 01:50:24,995
We have reason to believe that he
is now operating with Col. Kurtz.

1409
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:30,196
Saigon was carrying him MIA
for his family's sake...

1410
01:50:30,308 --> 01:50:32,776
but they assumed he was dead.

1411
01:50:32,877 --> 01:50:36,836
Then they intercepted a letter
he tried to send to his wife""

1412
01:50:40,318 --> 01:50:42,218
Captain Richard Colby.

1413
01:50:44,389 --> 01:50:46,789
He was with Kurtz.

1414
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:49,382
Disneyland.

1415
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:52,054
Fuck, man, this is better
than Disneyland.

1416
01:50:52,163 --> 01:50:56,600
"Charles Miller Manson ordered
the slaughter of all in the home...

1417
01:50:56,701 --> 01:50:58,726
anyway as a symbol of protest."

1418
01:50:58,837 --> 01:51:01,271
That's really weird,
ain't it?

1419
01:51:01,372 --> 01:51:04,603
- Purple haze. Look, man.
- Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.

1420
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:07,973
- I got a tape from my mom.
- Rainbow reality, man.

1421
01:51:08,112 --> 01:51:11,479
Hey, Chief,
get a good whiff.

1422
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:14,347
Eva can't picture me
in Vietnam.

1423
01:51:14,452 --> 01:51:17,819
She pictures me at home
having a beer watching TV.

1424
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:20,519
Hey, Lance, man.

1425
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:22,957
Oh, hot potato,
hot potato.

1426
01:51:23,061 --> 01:51:25,928
I'm so gladyou decided
tojoin the navy.

1427
01:51:26,030 --> 01:51:29,363
Eva's not sure she can have
a relationship with me, you know.

1428
01:51:29,467 --> 01:51:32,197
Here I am,
1 3,000 fucking miles away...

1429
01:51:32,303 --> 01:51:35,397
trying to keep a relationship
with my ass.

1430
01:51:35,507 --> 01:51:39,238
That's much more than I can say
forsome ofyourfriends.

1431
01:51:39,377 --> 01:51:41,345
Ifthis tape is any good...

1432
01:51:41,479 --> 01:51:45,643
I will have Dad and the family
sendyou a tape oftheir own.

1433
01:51:58,029 --> 01:51:59,394
Fuckers!

1434
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:06,963
There! Over there!

1435
01:52:08,806 --> 01:52:10,706
Motherfuckers!

1436
01:52:21,452 --> 01:52:23,352
There. Over there!

1437
01:52:32,564 --> 01:52:36,625
Chef, check out Clean!
Captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.

1438
01:52:36,734 --> 01:52:39,032
Where'd the dog go?

1439
01:52:39,137 --> 01:52:42,231
Lance! Lance!
They got Clean.

1440
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:45,969
Where's the dog?
We gotta go back and get the dog.

1441
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:49,238
Hey, Clean. Hey.

1442
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:51,746
Hey, bubba.

1443
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,817
Bubba, you can't die,
you fucker!

1444
01:52:55,753 --> 01:52:57,311
Hey, bubba.

1445
01:52:57,422 --> 01:53:02,689
And so I'm hoping that--
pretty soon-- not too soon--

1446
01:53:02,794 --> 01:53:07,231
but pretty soon I'll have a lot
ofgrandchildren to love and spoil.

1447
01:53:07,332 --> 01:53:10,995
And then when your wife get 'em back.,
she'll be mad with me.

1448
01:53:13,237 --> 01:53:15,569
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama...

1449
01:53:15,673 --> 01:53:18,972
will come to celebrate
your coming home.

1450
01:53:19,110 --> 01:53:22,602
Granny and Dad are trying to get
enough money to get you a car...

1451
01:53:22,747 --> 01:53:27,343
but don 't tell 'em
because that's our secret.

1452
01:53:27,452 --> 01:53:30,182
Anyhow, do the right thing...

1453
01:53:30,288 --> 01:53:32,654
stay out ofthe way
ofthe bullets...

1454
01:53:32,757 --> 01:53:36,818
and bringyour heinie home
all in one piece...

1455
01:53:36,928 --> 01:53:39,192
because we love you
very much.

1456
01:53:39,297 --> 01:53:41,197
L ove, Mom.

1457
01:55:15,126 --> 01:55:16,787
Hold on.

1458
01:55:19,163 --> 01:55:21,063
Throw me the glasses.

1459
01:55:33,344 --> 01:55:35,972
Lance, take a 1 6 on the bow.

1460
01:55:38,716 --> 01:55:42,345
Chef. Chef.
On the 60.

1461
01:56:04,575 --> 01:56:05,599
Fuck me.

1462
01:57:14,679 --> 01:57:17,147
Cover the captain. Lance.

1463
01:57:17,248 --> 01:57:19,148
Cover the captain.

1464
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,027
They're French.
They're French.

1465
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:43,235
Pick up that weapon!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

1466
01:57:43,341 --> 01:57:44,899
Stand fast. Captain.

1467
01:58:19,744 --> 01:58:22,269
All right, you men.
Put down your weapons.

1468
01:59:17,201 --> 01:59:19,101
We lost one of our men.

1469
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:26,936
We French always pay respect
to the dead of our allies.

1470
01:59:29,847 --> 01:59:31,747
You're all welcome.

1471
01:59:34,385 --> 01:59:36,376
My name is Hubert DeMarais.

1472
01:59:38,022 --> 01:59:40,855
This is my family's plantation.

1473
01:59:40,958 --> 01:59:44,018
It has been such
for 70 years.

1474
01:59:45,129 --> 01:59:48,462
And it will be such
until we are all dead.

1475
02:01:59,997 --> 02:02:03,489
Captain, accept the flag
ofTyrone Miller...

1476
02:02:03,601 --> 02:02:06,092
on behalf of
a grateful nation.

1477
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:29,063
This food is really wonderful,
isn't it? The wine, the sauces.

1478
02:02:29,166 --> 02:02:32,693
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?

1479
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:35,033
The chef speak
only Vietnamese.

1480
02:02:35,139 --> 02:02:38,905
No kidding? He cooks like this
and he can't even speak French?

1481
02:02:39,009 --> 02:02:42,069
Hey, Lance,
the chef's a slope.

1482
02:03:14,411 --> 02:03:18,074
This is Baudelaire.
It's a very cruel poem for children.

1483
02:03:18,215 --> 02:03:22,083
But they need it, 'cause
life sometimes is very cruel.

1484
02:03:23,187 --> 02:03:25,087
As you can see.

1485
02:03:28,825 --> 02:03:30,952
Attack repels by the family.

1486
02:03:31,061 --> 02:03:33,052
Just for this war.

1487
02:03:33,163 --> 02:03:37,600
Vietcong, 58.
North Vietnamese, 1 2.

1488
02:03:37,701 --> 02:03:40,829
south Vietnamese, 1 1.

1489
02:03:40,938 --> 02:03:42,872
Americans, six?

1490
02:03:44,208 --> 02:03:47,575
Yes. Well, there were
perhaps mistakes.

1491
02:04:08,465 --> 02:04:11,127
May I present Captain Willard.
He is of a paratroop regiment.

1492
02:04:11,235 --> 02:04:13,396
Madame sarrault.

1493
02:04:13,503 --> 02:04:14,902
Captain.

1494
02:04:41,598 --> 02:04:43,828
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.
It was just a little story...

1495
02:04:43,934 --> 02:04:46,300
about Paris and people
starving during the war.

1496
02:04:46,403 --> 02:04:49,099
They are all around the table, and
there was a silence and somebody say...

1497
02:04:49,206 --> 02:04:51,231
"An angel is passing by."

1498
02:04:51,341 --> 02:04:54,606
so somebody said,
"Let's eat it."

1499
02:04:54,711 --> 02:04:56,042
Oh.

1500
02:05:01,685 --> 02:05:05,416
How long can you
possibly stay here?

1501
02:05:05,522 --> 02:05:08,150
We stay forever.

1502
02:05:08,258 --> 02:05:10,158
No, no. I mean...

1503
02:05:11,395 --> 02:05:13,363
why don't you go
back home to France?

1504
02:05:14,398 --> 02:05:18,357
- Back home?
- I mean, this is our home, Captain.

1505
02:05:18,468 --> 02:05:20,060
sooner or later, you're--

1506
02:05:22,873 --> 02:05:25,000
You don't understand
our mentality--

1507
02:05:25,108 --> 02:05:27,508
the French officer mentality!

1508
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:29,841
At first, we lose
in second World War.

1509
02:05:29,946 --> 02:05:32,972
I don't say that you
Americans win, but we lose.

1510
02:05:33,116 --> 02:05:34,105
Oh, Papa--

1511
02:05:35,252 --> 02:05:38,085
In Dien Bien Phu, we lose.
In Algeria, we lose.

1512
02:05:38,188 --> 02:05:40,588
In Indochina, we lose!

1513
02:05:40,691 --> 02:05:43,421
But here we don't lose!

1514
02:05:43,527 --> 02:05:46,519
This piece of earth,
we keep it.

1515
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:48,495
We will never lose it.
Never!

1516
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,135
You Americans.

1517
02:05:57,574 --> 02:06:02,011
In 1 945, yeah...

1518
02:06:02,112 --> 02:06:06,640
after the Japanese war,
your President Roosevelt...

1519
02:06:06,783 --> 02:06:09,980
didn't want the French people
to stay in Indochina.

1520
02:06:11,655 --> 02:06:13,623
so...

1521
02:06:13,724 --> 02:06:16,693
you Americans implant
the Vietminh.

1522
02:06:18,395 --> 02:06:19,623
What's he mean?

1523
02:06:19,730 --> 02:06:23,131
Yeah, that's true. The Vietcong
were invented by the Americans.

1524
02:06:24,267 --> 02:06:25,495
The Americans?

1525
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,861
And now you take
the French place...

1526
02:06:28,972 --> 02:06:31,133
and the Vietminh fight you.

1527
02:06:31,241 --> 02:06:33,141
And what can you do?

1528
02:06:33,243 --> 02:06:35,575
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

1529
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,240
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.
You never know what they think.

1530
02:06:39,383 --> 02:06:43,080
The Russian ones who help them,
"Come and give us their money.

1531
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:47,054
We are all Communists. Chinese,
give us guns. We are all brothers."

1532
02:06:47,157 --> 02:06:49,091
They hate the Chinese!

1533
02:06:49,192 --> 02:06:54,027
Maybe they hate the American
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1534
02:06:54,131 --> 02:06:56,361
I mean, if tomorrow
the Vietnamese are Communists...

1535
02:06:56,466 --> 02:06:58,366
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1536
02:06:58,468 --> 02:07:01,062
And this is something that you
never understood, you American.

1537
02:07:01,171 --> 02:07:03,071
I don't know.

1538
02:07:03,173 --> 02:07:06,665
Maybe in the future we can make
something with the Vietminh.

1539
02:07:06,777 --> 02:07:08,904
Don't you understand?

1540
02:07:09,012 --> 02:07:11,810
The VC say,
"Go away. Go away."

1541
02:07:11,948 --> 02:07:14,439
That's finish for all
the white people in Indochina.

1542
02:07:14,584 --> 02:07:17,849
Ifyou're French, American,
that's all the same.

1543
02:07:17,954 --> 02:07:21,515
"Go." They want to forget you.
Look, Captain.

1544
02:07:23,894 --> 02:07:26,920
Look, this is the truth.
An egg.

1545
02:07:29,366 --> 02:07:30,594
The white left...

1546
02:07:32,369 --> 02:07:35,463
but the yellow stays!

1547
02:07:42,646 --> 02:07:46,514
When I was in saigon,
I spoke to an American politician.

1548
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:49,619
He explained it very well.
He said, "Look.

1549
02:07:49,753 --> 02:07:52,916
Yesterday, it was Korea.
Today, Vietnam.

1550
02:07:53,023 --> 02:07:55,617
Tomorrow, Thailand,
the Philippines...

1551
02:07:55,725 --> 02:07:58,387
then maybe Europe."

1552
02:07:58,495 --> 02:08:01,521
Come on. Why not Europe?

1553
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:03,929
Look what happened
in Czechoslovakia recently.

1554
02:08:04,034 --> 02:08:07,629
Even before second World War Americans
knew exactly what was going on.

1555
02:08:07,737 --> 02:08:11,400
They don't want
that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1556
02:08:13,009 --> 02:08:15,170
All you white people are shit.

1557
02:08:15,278 --> 02:08:17,746
They are fighting--
fighting for freedom.

1558
02:08:17,848 --> 02:08:20,112
Freedom? Bullshit.

1559
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:23,083
French bullshit.
American bullshit.

1560
02:08:23,186 --> 02:08:25,552
Dien Bien Phu,
that serious.

1561
02:08:25,655 --> 02:08:29,523
All soldiers know
they are already dead.

1562
02:08:30,727 --> 02:08:32,786
You know anything
about Dien Bien Phu?

1563
02:08:35,966 --> 02:08:37,866
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't.

1564
02:08:39,135 --> 02:08:41,865
- Not really.
- Dien Bien Phu was an error.

1565
02:08:41,972 --> 02:08:43,234
A military mistake.

1566
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:45,672
A mistake?
A voluntary mistake!

1567
02:08:45,775 --> 02:08:47,402
Voluntary!

1568
02:08:49,513 --> 02:08:53,449
All the soldiers knew.
We knew we would be dead.

1569
02:08:53,550 --> 02:08:56,644
The generals and the colonels believe
it's impossible for the Viets...

1570
02:08:56,786 --> 02:08:59,482
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains.

1571
02:08:59,589 --> 02:09:03,821
But they do. Then they wait
for the rain to come.

1572
02:09:05,362 --> 02:09:09,992
When it comes,
no airplane can fly there.

1573
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:12,432
And our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters.

1574
02:09:12,536 --> 02:09:15,630
I mean, you know,
90 meters-- 70 meters.

1575
02:09:15,739 --> 02:09:18,401
I mean, that's crazy.
No army in the world can do that.

1576
02:09:18,508 --> 02:09:22,205
And they only do that
to be dead with their friends.

1577
02:09:28,985 --> 02:09:31,146
The French Army was sacrificed.

1578
02:09:31,288 --> 02:09:33,756
sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home.

1579
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:36,688
They put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn't win.

1580
02:09:36,793 --> 02:09:39,523
The students are
marching in Paris...

1581
02:09:39,629 --> 02:09:41,494
protesting, demonstrating.

1582
02:09:41,598 --> 02:09:43,862
They stab the soldiers
in their back.

1583
02:09:43,967 --> 02:09:47,698
The soldier would open
the grenade, it wouldn't work.

1584
02:09:47,804 --> 02:09:51,900
A piece of paper would fall--

1585
02:09:52,008 --> 02:09:55,205
"Union of French Women."
"We are for the Viets."

1586
02:09:55,312 --> 02:09:58,975
Traitors!
Communist traitors at home.

1587
02:10:00,884 --> 02:10:03,409
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1588
02:10:03,553 --> 02:10:07,455
The French is shit, huh?

1589
02:10:07,557 --> 02:10:09,821
No one care.
No one want--

1590
02:10:12,462 --> 02:10:15,625
Why don't you Americans
learn from us, from our mistakes?

1591
02:10:15,732 --> 02:10:17,632
Mon Dieux, with your army,
your strength...

1592
02:10:17,734 --> 02:10:19,998
your power, you could win
ifyou want to!

1593
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:24,669
You can win.

1594
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:31,479
You know, I'm sure
we can make something here.

1595
02:10:31,615 --> 02:10:33,515
I'm sure about it,
you know?

1596
02:10:33,617 --> 02:10:37,053
I never do something wrong
to the people here.

1597
02:10:37,153 --> 02:10:39,644
That's right, but the Communist
at home have never been traitors.

1598
02:11:05,315 --> 02:11:07,943
- Communist!
- socialist!

1599
02:11:16,126 --> 02:11:19,584
Capitaine, good night.
He was a socialist, you know.

1600
02:11:19,696 --> 02:11:23,792
We can stay. I know
that we can stay. We can.

1601
02:11:27,337 --> 02:11:30,738
You know, we always
helped the people.

1602
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:32,740
We work with the people.

1603
02:11:33,843 --> 02:11:37,074
so we can be friends,
we are agreed.

1604
02:11:49,192 --> 02:11:53,060
see, Captain,
when my grandfather...

1605
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:57,732
and my uncle's father
came here...

1606
02:11:59,703 --> 02:12:02,331
there was nothing--
nothing.

1607
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:06,136
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1608
02:12:07,877 --> 02:12:10,243
so we worked hard...

1609
02:12:10,346 --> 02:12:12,280
very hard, and brought...

1610
02:12:12,415 --> 02:12:15,976
the rubber from Brazil,
and then plant it here.

1611
02:12:17,187 --> 02:12:20,315
We took the Vietnamese,
work with them...

1612
02:12:21,224 --> 02:12:23,089
make something--

1613
02:12:23,193 --> 02:12:25,923
something out of nothing.

1614
02:12:26,029 --> 02:12:30,432
so when you ask me why
we want to stay here, Captain...

1615
02:12:32,035 --> 02:12:36,131
we want to stay here because
it's ours-- it belongs to us.

1616
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:38,139
It keeps our family together.

1617
02:12:40,043 --> 02:12:41,943
I mean, we fight for that.

1618
02:12:44,047 --> 02:12:48,381
While you Americans,
you are fighting for...

1619
02:12:48,518 --> 02:12:52,454
the biggest nothing in history.

1620
02:12:59,696 --> 02:13:04,531
I'm sorry, Captain. I will see
ifyour men need any help to...

1621
02:13:04,634 --> 02:13:06,727
repairyour boat...

1622
02:13:06,836 --> 02:13:09,862
so that you can go on
with your war.

1623
02:13:45,542 --> 02:13:48,443
I apologize
for my family, Captain.

1624
02:13:50,013 --> 02:13:52,311
We have all lost much here.

1625
02:13:53,583 --> 02:13:56,347
Hubert-- his wife
and two sons.

1626
02:14:01,257 --> 02:14:03,487
And I have lost a husband.

1627
02:14:09,299 --> 02:14:11,062
I understand.

1628
02:14:11,167 --> 02:14:13,692
You are tired of the war.

1629
02:14:15,371 --> 02:14:17,931
I can see it in your face.

1630
02:14:19,943 --> 02:14:24,004
'Twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war.

1631
02:14:25,515 --> 02:14:29,178
We called them
"Les Soldats Perdus--"

1632
02:14:29,319 --> 02:14:31,549
The Lost soldiers.

1633
02:14:36,259 --> 02:14:38,784
Ifyou like,
we can have some cognac.

1634
02:14:45,935 --> 02:14:49,029
I have to--
to see about my men and--

1635
02:14:56,279 --> 02:14:59,180
The war will be
still here tomorrow.

1636
02:15:09,459 --> 02:15:11,689
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1637
02:15:19,702 --> 02:15:22,432
I noticed you had
no wine at dinner.

1638
02:15:23,539 --> 02:15:26,633
No, I don't drink wine.

1639
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:33,775
I do like cognac, but I don't want
any now. Thankyou.

1640
02:15:35,118 --> 02:15:37,552
Well...

1641
02:15:37,654 --> 02:15:40,680
then I--
I must drink alone.

1642
02:15:50,934 --> 02:15:54,131
Will you go back
after the war to America?

1643
02:15:59,809 --> 02:16:03,267
Then you're like us--
your home is here.

1644
02:16:20,697 --> 02:16:24,599
Do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice?

1645
02:16:26,836 --> 02:16:30,397
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1646
02:16:31,541 --> 02:16:35,409
I used to prepare
a pipe for my husband.

1647
02:16:41,851 --> 02:16:46,151
'Twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1648
02:16:49,492 --> 02:16:53,622
He would rage and he would cry,
my lost soldier.

1649
02:16:57,266 --> 02:17:01,225
And I said to him,
"There are two ofyou.

1650
02:17:01,337 --> 02:17:03,965
Don't you see?

1651
02:17:04,073 --> 02:17:07,975
One that kills
and one that loves."

1652
02:17:09,912 --> 02:17:12,107
And he said to me...

1653
02:17:12,248 --> 02:17:16,947
"I don't know whether
I'm an animal or a god."

1654
02:17:19,489 --> 02:17:21,389
But you are both.

1655
02:18:03,332 --> 02:18:05,232
You want more?

1656
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:14,371
All that matters
is that you're alive.

1657
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:18,843
You are alive, Captain.

1658
02:18:22,452 --> 02:18:24,682
That's the truth.

1659
02:19:37,793 --> 02:19:40,591
There are two ofyou,
don't you see?

1660
02:19:42,632 --> 02:19:45,123
One that kills...

1661
02:19:45,234 --> 02:19:47,600
and one that loves.

1662
02:20:16,132 --> 02:20:19,033
Can't see nothing.
We stoppin'.

1663
02:20:19,135 --> 02:20:21,695
You're not authorized
to stop this boat, Chief.

1664
02:20:21,804 --> 02:20:25,296
I said I can't see a thing, Captain.
I'm stopping this boat.

1665
02:20:25,408 --> 02:20:27,308
I ain't riskin'
no more lives.

1666
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:30,140
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
You'll do what I say.

1667
02:20:31,948 --> 02:20:33,848
You see anything, Chef?

1668
02:20:36,219 --> 02:20:38,949
Why don't they
fucking attack, man?

1669
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,567
Watch it over here, Chief.

1670
02:21:00,543 --> 02:21:02,511
Got a stump.

1671
02:21:05,381 --> 02:21:07,076
On the fifties.

1672
02:21:07,216 --> 02:21:09,616
He was close.

1673
02:21:11,053 --> 02:21:13,180
He was real close.

1674
02:21:14,323 --> 02:21:17,759
I couldn't see him yet,
but I could feel him...

1675
02:21:17,893 --> 02:21:19,827
as ifthe boat were being
sucked upriver...

1676
02:21:19,929 --> 02:21:22,762
and the water was
flowing back into the jungle.

1677
02:21:25,301 --> 02:21:27,201
Whatever was going to happen...

1678
02:21:27,303 --> 02:21:31,205
it wasn 't going to be the way
they called it back in Nha Trang.

1679
02:21:36,312 --> 02:21:38,678
- Arrows!
- Fire!

1680
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:43,917
Chef, open up! Fire!

1681
02:21:47,089 --> 02:21:49,387
Lance, fire!

1682
02:21:57,099 --> 02:22:01,058
Chef! Chef, it's okay.
Quit firing.

1683
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:04,833
- They're just little toy arrows.
- Cut it out! Quiet!

1684
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:07,909
Chief, tell them
to hold their fire!

1685
02:22:08,010 --> 02:22:10,570
They're just little sticks.
They're just trying to scare us.

1686
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:12,671
Quiet!

1687
02:22:12,815 --> 02:22:15,716
You got us into this mess,
and now you can't get us out...

1688
02:22:15,818 --> 02:22:18,286
because you don't know where
the hell you're going, do ya?

1689
02:22:18,387 --> 02:22:20,480
Do ya?

1690
02:22:20,623 --> 02:22:23,786
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!

1691
02:22:25,328 --> 02:22:27,558
Lance, get the wheel!

1692
02:22:27,663 --> 02:22:31,895
You savages! Come and get it!
You son of a bitches!

1693
02:22:52,221 --> 02:22:53,745
A spear?

1694
02:24:13,302 --> 02:24:16,465
My mission is to make it
up into Cambodia.

1695
02:24:16,572 --> 02:24:19,507
There's a Green Beret colonel
up there who's gone insane...

1696
02:24:19,608 --> 02:24:21,007
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1697
02:24:22,478 --> 02:24:25,413
That's fucking typical!
shit!

1698
02:24:25,548 --> 02:24:27,778
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1699
02:24:27,917 --> 02:24:31,580
I'm short and we gotta go up there
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1700
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:35,417
That's fucking great!
That's just fucking great, man.

1701
02:24:35,524 --> 02:24:39,688
shit!
That's fuckin' crazy.

1702
02:24:39,762 --> 02:24:42,731
I mean, I thought you were
going in to blow up a bridge...

1703
02:24:42,832 --> 02:24:46,131
or some fuckin'
railroad tracks or somethin'.

1704
02:24:46,235 --> 02:24:48,703
- That's all right.
- No. No, wait. Wait.

1705
02:24:48,804 --> 02:24:52,171
We'll go together, on the boat.
We'll go with you.

1706
02:24:52,274 --> 02:24:56,677
We'll go up there,
but on the boat. Okay?

1707
02:26:02,745 --> 02:26:05,236
Part ofme was afraid
ofwhat I would find...

1708
02:26:05,347 --> 02:26:07,747
and what I would do
when I got there.

1709
02:26:09,752 --> 02:26:12,585
I knew the risks...

1710
02:26:12,688 --> 02:26:14,986
or imagined I knew.

1711
02:26:16,926 --> 02:26:19,486
But the thing
I felt the most...

1712
02:26:19,595 --> 02:26:22,655
much stronger than fear...

1713
02:26:22,765 --> 02:26:25,495
was the desire to confront him.

1714
02:27:37,306 --> 02:27:39,365
Just keep movin'.

1715
02:27:39,475 --> 02:27:43,605
Lance, keep your hands
away from the guns.

1716
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:12,993
It's all right! It's all right!
It's all been approved!

1717
02:29:14,369 --> 02:29:17,395
I ain't comin' in there!
Them bastards attacked us!

1718
02:29:17,506 --> 02:29:22,000
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man.
Zap 'em with your siren.

1719
02:29:32,254 --> 02:29:34,518
There's mines over there
and mines over there too.

1720
02:29:34,623 --> 02:29:37,820
And watch out. Those goddamn
monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1721
02:29:37,926 --> 02:29:41,089
Ah, that's a pretty one.
Move it right in towards me.

1722
02:29:41,196 --> 02:29:42,959
I'm an American.

1723
02:29:43,065 --> 02:29:45,863
Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.

1724
02:29:45,968 --> 02:29:48,459
Hi. American.

1725
02:29:48,570 --> 02:29:50,663
American civilian.
It's all right.

1726
02:29:50,773 --> 02:29:54,641
And you got the cigarettes. And that's
what I've been dreaming about.

1727
02:29:56,645 --> 02:29:59,409
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1728
02:30:03,485 --> 02:30:05,077
I'm a photojournalist.

1729
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:07,916
I've covered the war
since '64.

1730
02:30:08,023 --> 02:30:10,583
I've been in Laos,
Cambodia and 'Nam.

1731
02:30:13,896 --> 02:30:18,026
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing.
This boat is a mess, man.

1732
02:30:18,133 --> 02:30:20,397
Who are all these people?

1733
02:30:20,502 --> 02:30:24,302
Yeah, well, they think
you've come to--

1734
02:30:24,406 --> 02:30:25,737
to take him away.

1735
02:30:25,841 --> 02:30:29,004
- And I hope that isn't true.
- Take who away?

1736
02:30:31,180 --> 02:30:34,479
Him! Col. Kurtz.

1737
02:30:34,616 --> 02:30:38,382
These are all his children,
man, as far as you can see.

1738
02:30:38,487 --> 02:30:42,184
Hell, man, out here
we're all his children.

1739
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:45,920
Could we talk to Col. Kurtz?

1740
02:30:46,028 --> 02:30:50,260
Hey, mac.
You don't talk to the colonel.

1741
02:30:50,365 --> 02:30:52,265
Well, you listen to him.

1742
02:30:52,367 --> 02:30:55,632
The man's enlarged my mind.

1743
02:30:55,737 --> 02:30:59,434
He's a poet warrior
in the classic sense.

1744
02:30:59,541 --> 02:31:01,441
I mean, sometimes he'll--

1745
02:31:01,543 --> 02:31:03,135
Well, you say hello to him,
right?

1746
02:31:03,245 --> 02:31:05,645
He'll just walk by you
and he won't even notice you.

1747
02:31:05,747 --> 02:31:09,376
Then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll
throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1748
02:31:09,518 --> 02:31:11,486
"Do you know that 'if'
is the middle word in 'life'?

1749
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:14,521
Ifyou can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1750
02:31:14,623 --> 02:31:16,955
Ifyou can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1751
02:31:17,059 --> 02:31:20,119
I'm a little man. I'm a little man.
He's a great man.

1752
02:31:20,229 --> 02:31:23,357
"I should have been
a pair of ragged claws...

1753
02:31:23,465 --> 02:31:26,332
scuttling across floors
of silent seas."

1754
02:31:26,435 --> 02:31:28,665
- I mean--
- stay with the boat.

1755
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:33,207
Don't go any-- Don't go without me,
okay? I wanna get a picture.

1756
02:31:34,977 --> 02:31:38,344
He can be terrible
and he can be mean...

1757
02:31:38,447 --> 02:31:40,347
and he can be right.

1758
02:31:40,482 --> 02:31:43,474
He's fighting the war.
He's a great man.

1759
02:31:46,922 --> 02:31:48,822
I mean--

1760
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:54,852
I wish I had words, you know.
I wish I had words.

1761
02:31:54,963 --> 02:31:57,989
I could tell you something like,
the other day he wanted to kill me.

1762
02:31:58,100 --> 02:32:00,830
- something like that.
- Why'd he want to kill you?

1763
02:32:00,936 --> 02:32:03,336
Because I took his picture.

1764
02:32:03,438 --> 02:32:06,999
He said, "Ifyou take
my picture again...

1765
02:32:07,109 --> 02:32:09,634
I'm gonna kill you."

1766
02:32:09,745 --> 02:32:11,645
And he meant it.

1767
02:32:13,382 --> 02:32:16,044
see, just lay cool.
Lay cool.

1768
02:32:16,184 --> 02:32:18,152
Lay back. Dig it.

1769
02:32:18,253 --> 02:32:21,120
He gets friendly again.
He really does.

1770
02:32:21,223 --> 02:32:24,556
But you don't-- you don't--
you don't judge the colonel.

1771
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:27,288
You don't judge the colonel
like an ordinary man.

1772
02:32:34,102 --> 02:32:36,696
Okay, watch it now.
These are Americans. Americans!

1773
02:32:36,805 --> 02:32:39,638
You can feel the vibe
of this place.

1774
02:32:39,741 --> 02:32:43,142
Let me take your picture. Hey,
could you hold-- Hey, hello. Hello.

1775
02:32:43,245 --> 02:32:45,145
Could you hold up
a minute?

1776
02:33:07,202 --> 02:33:08,601
Colby.

1777
02:33:24,753 --> 02:33:26,482
The heads.

1778
02:33:26,588 --> 02:33:28,783
You're looking at the heads.

1779
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:32,087
I, uh-- sometimes
he goes too far.

1780
02:33:32,194 --> 02:33:34,856
He's the first one
to admit it.

1781
02:33:35,964 --> 02:33:38,865
- He's gone crazy.
- Wrong, wrong!

1782
02:33:40,202 --> 02:33:43,069
Ifyou could have heard
the man just two days ago--

1783
02:33:43,171 --> 02:33:45,799
ifyou could have heard
him then, God--

1784
02:33:45,907 --> 02:33:49,172
- You were gonna call him crazy?
- Fuckin' A!

1785
02:33:51,279 --> 02:33:53,611
I just wanna talk to him.

1786
02:33:54,983 --> 02:33:58,282
Well, man, he's gone away.

1787
02:33:58,387 --> 02:34:01,117
He's gone away. He disappeared
out in the jungle with his people.

1788
02:34:01,223 --> 02:34:04,317
- I'll wait for him.
- He feels comfortable with his people.

1789
02:34:04,426 --> 02:34:07,293
He forgets himself
with his people.

1790
02:34:08,663 --> 02:34:11,427
- He forgets himself.
- Captain?

1791
02:34:11,533 --> 02:34:14,525
Maybe we should wait
back at the boat.

1792
02:34:14,636 --> 02:34:16,126
- I thinkyou should--
- Okay, Chef.

1793
02:34:16,238 --> 02:34:18,468
We'll go back to the boat
for a while.

1794
02:34:18,573 --> 02:34:21,303
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1795
02:34:44,299 --> 02:34:47,063
This colonel guy,
he's wacko, man.

1796
02:34:47,169 --> 02:34:49,729
He's worse than crazy.
He's evil!

1797
02:34:49,838 --> 02:34:52,272
I mean, that's what the man's got
set up here, man!

1798
02:34:52,374 --> 02:34:54,842
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry.
Look around you!

1799
02:34:55,877 --> 02:34:59,074
- shit, he's loco.
- Then you'll help me?

1800
02:34:59,181 --> 02:35:02,275
Fuckin' A, I'll help you. I'll do
anything to get out of this joint.

1801
02:35:02,417 --> 02:35:05,580
- Good boy.
- We could blow all them assholes away.

1802
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:09,554
They're so fuckin' spaced out,
they wouldn't even know it.

1803
02:35:09,658 --> 02:35:14,254
I ain't afraid of all them
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1804
02:35:15,897 --> 02:35:19,799
I used to think if I died
in an evil place...

1805
02:35:19,901 --> 02:35:23,098
then my soul wouldn't be able
to make it to Heaven.

1806
02:35:23,205 --> 02:35:26,436
But now, fuck--

1807
02:35:28,009 --> 02:35:30,978
I mean, I don't care where it goes,
as long as it ain't here.

1808
02:35:31,079 --> 02:35:34,879
so what do you wanna do?
I'll kill the fuck.

1809
02:35:35,016 --> 02:35:37,951
- Get out of here.
- I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1810
02:35:38,053 --> 02:35:42,387
I'll go up with Lance and
scrounge around, check the place out.

1811
02:35:42,491 --> 02:35:44,925
see if I can find
the colonel, okay?

1812
02:35:46,228 --> 02:35:49,220
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1813
02:35:49,331 --> 02:35:52,494
Here. You take the radio...

1814
02:35:52,601 --> 02:35:56,867
and if I don't get back
by 2200 hours...

1815
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:01,034
you call in the air strike.

1816
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:05,174
"Air strike?"

1817
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,180
The code is "Almighty"...

1818
02:36:07,315 --> 02:36:10,716
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1819
02:36:10,819 --> 02:36:12,946
It's all in there.

1820
02:36:14,523 --> 02:36:18,550
Zero-niner-two-six-
four-seven-one-two.

1821
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:29,736
Everything I saw told me
that Kurtz had gone insane.

1822
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:35,467
The place was full ofbodies--

1823
02:36:35,577 --> 02:36:39,775
North Vietnamese,
Vietcong, Cambodians.

1824
02:36:46,821 --> 02:36:51,190
Ifl was still alive,
it was because he wanted me that way.

1825
02:37:24,392 --> 02:37:28,055
It smelled like
slow death in there--

1826
02:37:28,163 --> 02:37:30,495
malaria...

1827
02:37:30,599 --> 02:37:32,499
and nightmares.

1828
02:37:34,402 --> 02:37:37,303
This was the end
ofthe river, all right.

1829
02:37:50,785 --> 02:37:53,015
Where are you from, Willard?

1830
02:37:57,859 --> 02:38:00,293
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1831
02:38:05,267 --> 02:38:07,599
Were you born there?

1832
02:38:07,702 --> 02:38:09,897
Yes, sir.

1833
02:38:10,005 --> 02:38:12,200
Whereabouts?

1834
02:38:12,307 --> 02:38:14,207
Toledo, sir.

1835
02:38:20,248 --> 02:38:22,773
How far are you
from the river?

1836
02:38:28,957 --> 02:38:30,857
The Ohio River, sir?

1837
02:38:33,161 --> 02:38:35,061
About 200 miles.

1838
02:38:42,904 --> 02:38:46,135
I went down that river
once when I was a kid.

1839
02:38:50,645 --> 02:38:53,637
There's a place in the river--
I can't remember--

1840
02:38:53,782 --> 02:38:59,015
Must've been a gardenia plantation
or a flower plantation at one time.

1841
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:03,284
It's all wild and overgrown now.
But for about--

1842
02:39:03,391 --> 02:39:05,882
for about five miles
you'd think that...

1843
02:39:05,994 --> 02:39:09,430
heaven just fell
on the earth...

1844
02:39:09,531 --> 02:39:11,931
in the form of gardenias.

1845
02:39:28,116 --> 02:39:30,016
Have you ever considered...

1846
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:33,720
any real freedoms?

1847
02:39:38,860 --> 02:39:42,557
Freedoms from
the opinion of others?

1848
02:39:45,233 --> 02:39:48,532
Even the opinions
ofyourself?

1849
02:40:03,585 --> 02:40:07,851
Did they say why, Willard?

1850
02:40:09,357 --> 02:40:14,124
Why they wanted
to terminate my command?

1851
02:40:29,577 --> 02:40:33,069
I was sent on
a classified mission, sir.

1852
02:40:36,050 --> 02:40:40,043
It's no longer
classified, is it?

1853
02:40:46,594 --> 02:40:48,824
What did they tell you?

1854
02:40:51,199 --> 02:40:53,599
They told me...

1855
02:40:53,701 --> 02:40:56,363
that you had gone...

1856
02:40:56,471 --> 02:40:58,371
totally insane...

1857
02:41:00,475 --> 02:41:04,502
and that your methods...

1858
02:41:04,612 --> 02:41:07,513
were unsound.

1859
02:41:10,919 --> 02:41:13,444
Are my methods unsound?

1860
02:41:18,893 --> 02:41:22,488
I don't see any method...

1861
02:41:23,998 --> 02:41:25,898
at all, sir.

1862
02:41:32,006 --> 02:41:34,600
I expected...

1863
02:41:34,709 --> 02:41:36,870
someone like you.

1864
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:41,005
What did you expect?

1865
02:41:48,656 --> 02:41:50,556
Are you an assassin?

1866
02:41:55,263 --> 02:41:57,026
I'm a soldier.

1867
02:42:00,068 --> 02:42:01,968
You're neither.

1868
02:42:03,671 --> 02:42:06,868
You're an errand boy...

1869
02:42:06,975 --> 02:42:09,637
sent by grocery clerks...

1870
02:42:13,047 --> 02:42:15,811
to collect the bill.

1871
02:42:58,826 --> 02:43:00,760
Why, huh?

1872
02:43:00,862 --> 02:43:04,923
Why would a nice guy
like you wanna kill a genius?

1873
02:43:11,573 --> 02:43:13,803
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1874
02:43:13,908 --> 02:43:15,307
Why?

1875
02:43:16,878 --> 02:43:18,937
Do you know--

1876
02:43:19,047 --> 02:43:21,709
Do you know that the man--

1877
02:43:24,686 --> 02:43:26,779
the man really likes you?

1878
02:43:30,024 --> 02:43:32,151
He likes you.
He really likes you.

1879
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:37,129
But he's got something
in mind foryou.

1880
02:43:37,231 --> 02:43:39,756
Aren't you curious about that?

1881
02:43:39,867 --> 02:43:44,827
I'm curious. I'm very curious.
Are you curious?

1882
02:43:47,675 --> 02:43:50,940
There's something
happening out here, man.

1883
02:43:54,716 --> 02:43:57,082
You know something, man.
I know something that you don't know.

1884
02:43:57,185 --> 02:44:00,052
That's right,Jack.

1885
02:44:00,154 --> 02:44:03,123
The man is clear
in his mind...

1886
02:44:03,224 --> 02:44:05,522
but his soul is mad.

1887
02:44:06,761 --> 02:44:09,252
Oh, yeah.

1888
02:44:09,364 --> 02:44:11,264
He's dying, I think.

1889
02:44:11,366 --> 02:44:14,426
He hates all this.
He hates it.

1890
02:44:14,535 --> 02:44:17,595
But the man's--

1891
02:44:21,609 --> 02:44:24,271
He reads poetry out loud,
all right?

1892
02:44:26,147 --> 02:44:27,978
And a voice--

1893
02:44:29,117 --> 02:44:30,641
a voice--

1894
02:44:33,187 --> 02:44:35,883
He likes you
'cause you're still alive.

1895
02:44:35,990 --> 02:44:40,984
He's got plans foryou.
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.

1896
02:44:41,095 --> 02:44:45,031
You're gonna help him, man.
You're gonna help him.

1897
02:44:45,133 --> 02:44:47,863
I mean, what are they gonna say,
man, when he's gone, huh?

1898
02:44:47,969 --> 02:44:52,531
'Cause he dies when it dies, man.
When it dies, he dies.

1899
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:56,371
What are they gonna say about him? What
are they gonna say? He was a kind man?

1900
02:44:56,477 --> 02:44:59,969
He was a wise man?
He had plans? He had wisdom?

1901
02:45:00,081 --> 02:45:01,981
Bullshit, man!

1902
02:45:02,116 --> 02:45:07,349
Am I gonna be the one that's gonna
set them straight? Look at me. Wrong!

1903
02:45:10,358 --> 02:45:12,519
You.

1904
02:45:16,664 --> 02:45:18,757
Almost eight hours.

1905
02:45:23,738 --> 02:45:26,366
I'm asleep.

1906
02:45:26,474 --> 02:45:30,001
I'm asleep and dreaming
I'm on this shitty boat.

1907
02:45:41,589 --> 02:45:42,988
Fuck.

1908
02:45:46,561 --> 02:45:48,927
Has it been eight hours?

1909
02:45:51,365 --> 02:45:53,356
Hello. Almighty. Almighty.

1910
02:45:53,468 --> 02:45:58,303
This is PBR street Gang.
Radio check. Over.

1911
02:45:58,406 --> 02:46:02,206
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.

1912
02:47:25,393 --> 02:47:27,190
Oh, Jesus!

1913
02:47:33,968 --> 02:47:36,266
Oh, Christ!

1914
02:49:40,194 --> 02:49:41,491
Time magazine.

1915
02:49:42,797 --> 02:49:44,890
The weekly newsmagazine.

1916
02:49:46,167 --> 02:49:50,661
september 22, 1 967.
Volume 90...

1917
02:49:50,771 --> 02:49:53,467
number 1 2.

1918
02:49:53,574 --> 02:49:57,704
"The War on the Horizon. The American
people may find it hard to believe...

1919
02:49:57,812 --> 02:50:00,542
that the Us is winning
the war in Vietnam.

1920
02:50:00,648 --> 02:50:03,276
Nevertheless...

1921
02:50:03,417 --> 02:50:05,783
one of the most
exhaustive inquiries...

1922
02:50:05,886 --> 02:50:08,650
into the status
of the conflict yet compiled...

1923
02:50:08,756 --> 02:50:12,021
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of Us power...

1924
02:50:12,126 --> 02:50:14,686
two-and-a-halfyears
after the big buildup began...

1925
02:50:14,795 --> 02:50:17,821
is beginning to
make itself felt.

1926
02:50:17,932 --> 02:50:21,629
White House officials maintain
the impact of that strength...

1927
02:50:23,204 --> 02:50:26,367
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could...

1928
02:50:26,474 --> 02:50:29,637
simply be unable
to continue fighting."

1929
02:50:31,579 --> 02:50:32,773
Is this familiar?

1930
02:50:34,749 --> 02:50:38,378
"Because Lyndon Johnson
fears that the Us public...

1931
02:50:38,519 --> 02:50:41,852
is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions...

1932
02:50:41,956 --> 02:50:44,891
he may never permit the report
to be released in full.

1933
02:50:44,992 --> 02:50:48,155
Even so, he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings...

1934
02:50:48,262 --> 02:50:51,629
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known...

1935
02:50:51,732 --> 02:50:54,701
to permit experts
who have been working on it...

1936
02:50:54,802 --> 02:50:56,827
to talk about it
in general terms."

1937
02:50:58,639 --> 02:51:00,937
No date, Time magazine.

1938
02:51:14,588 --> 02:51:17,648
"sir Robert Thompson...

1939
02:51:17,758 --> 02:51:21,023
who led the victory
over Communist guerillas in Malaya...

1940
02:51:21,128 --> 02:51:23,790
is now a RAND corporation
consultant...

1941
02:51:23,898 --> 02:51:28,961
recently returned to Vietnam to sound
out the situation for President Nixon.

1942
02:51:29,070 --> 02:51:30,867
He told the president
last week...

1943
02:51:30,971 --> 02:51:34,099
that things felt
much better...

1944
02:51:34,208 --> 02:51:36,972
and smelled much better
over there."

1945
02:51:38,579 --> 02:51:41,139
How do they smell
to you, soldier?

1946
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:56,923
You'll be free.
You'll be under guard.

1947
02:51:57,031 --> 02:51:59,329
Read these at your leisure.

1948
02:51:59,433 --> 02:52:01,333
Don't lose them.

1949
02:52:01,435 --> 02:52:04,404
Don't try to escape.
You'll be shot.

1950
02:52:05,339 --> 02:52:07,603
We can talk
of these things later.

1951
02:55:26,507 --> 02:55:29,271
"We are the hollow men.

1952
02:55:29,376 --> 02:55:31,435
We are the stuffed men...

1953
02:55:31,545 --> 02:55:36,005
Ieaning together at peace
filled with straw.

1954
02:55:36,150 --> 02:55:40,849
Alas, our dried voices
when we whisper together...

1955
02:55:40,954 --> 02:55:45,789
are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass...

1956
02:55:45,893 --> 02:55:49,624
or a rat's feet over
broken glass in a dry cellar.

1957
02:55:49,730 --> 02:55:51,630
He's really out there.

1958
02:55:51,732 --> 02:55:54,724
shape without form...

1959
02:55:54,835 --> 02:55:56,427
shade without color...

1960
02:55:56,537 --> 02:55:59,233
paralyzed force...

1961
02:56:00,574 --> 02:56:02,474
gesture without motion."

1962
02:56:02,576 --> 02:56:06,603
Do you know what
the man's saying? Do you?

1963
02:56:06,714 --> 02:56:10,377
This is dialectics.
It's very simple dialectics.

1964
02:56:10,517 --> 02:56:14,044
It's one through nine.
No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.

1965
02:56:14,188 --> 02:56:17,555
You can't travel in space. You can't
go out into space, you know...

1966
02:56:17,658 --> 02:56:19,683
without like, you know,
with fractions.

1967
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:22,251
What are you gonna land on?
One-quarter? Three-eighths?

1968
02:56:22,363 --> 02:56:24,763
What are you gonna do when
you go from here to Venus?

1969
02:56:24,865 --> 02:56:26,264
That's dialectic physics, okay.

1970
02:56:26,367 --> 02:56:28,767
Dialectic logic is,
there's only love and hate.

1971
02:56:28,869 --> 02:56:30,837
You either love somebody
oryou hate 'em.

1972
02:56:30,938 --> 02:56:31,802
Mutt!

1973
02:56:33,974 --> 02:56:36,807
You mutt.

1974
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:39,640
This is the way
the fucking world is.

1975
02:56:39,747 --> 02:56:42,307
Look at this fucking shit
we're in, man!

1976
02:56:42,449 --> 02:56:44,383
Not with a bang.
A whimper.

1977
02:56:44,485 --> 02:56:47,943
And with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting,Jack.

1978
02:57:16,683 --> 02:57:19,584
On the river, I thought that
the minute I looked at him...

1979
02:57:19,686 --> 02:57:21,313
I'd know what to do.

1980
02:57:22,256 --> 02:57:25,316
But it didn't happen.

1981
02:57:25,426 --> 02:57:29,556
I was in there with him
for days. Not under guard.

1982
02:57:29,663 --> 02:57:32,029
I was free.

1983
02:57:32,132 --> 02:57:35,363
But he knew
I wasn 't going anywhere.

1984
02:57:35,469 --> 02:57:39,064
He knew more about what
I was going to do than I did.

1985
02:57:46,013 --> 02:57:50,313
Ifthe generals back in Nha Trang
could see what I saw...

1986
02:57:50,451 --> 02:57:52,783
would they still want me
to kill him?

1987
02:57:54,354 --> 02:57:57,346
More than ever, probably.

1988
02:57:57,491 --> 02:58:00,392
And what would his people back home
want ifthey ever learned...

1989
02:58:00,494 --> 02:58:03,054
just how far from them
he'd really gone?

1990
02:58:05,165 --> 02:58:07,133
He broke from them...

1991
02:58:07,234 --> 02:58:09,964
and then he broke
from himself.

1992
02:58:10,070 --> 02:58:13,437
I'd never seen a man
so broken up and...

1993
02:58:13,540 --> 02:58:15,440
ripped apart.

1994
02:58:15,542 --> 02:58:18,238
I've seen the horrors--

1995
02:58:18,345 --> 02:58:20,677
horrors that you've seen.

1996
02:58:22,249 --> 02:58:24,240
But you have no ri ght
to call me a murderer.

1997
02:58:24,384 --> 02:58:27,444
You have a right to kill me.

1998
02:58:27,588 --> 02:58:30,489
You have a right
to do that.

1999
02:58:31,725 --> 02:58:34,285
But you have no right
to judge me.

2000
02:58:40,601 --> 02:58:42,899
It's impossible for words...

2001
02:58:44,605 --> 02:58:46,163
to describe...

2002
02:58:48,141 --> 02:58:51,440
what is necessary...

2003
02:58:53,480 --> 02:58:55,744
to those...

2004
02:58:55,883 --> 02:58:58,374
who do not know...

2005
02:58:58,519 --> 02:59:02,046
what horror means.

2006
02:59:03,924 --> 02:59:05,323
Horror.

2007
02:59:08,061 --> 02:59:10,962
Horror has a face.

2008
02:59:13,233 --> 02:59:16,566
And you must make
a friend of horror.

2009
02:59:16,670 --> 02:59:20,299
Horror and moral terror...

2010
02:59:20,407 --> 02:59:22,307
are your friends.

2011
02:59:22,409 --> 02:59:24,536
If they are not...

2012
02:59:24,645 --> 02:59:28,445
then they are enemies
to be feared.

2013
02:59:28,582 --> 02:59:30,948
They are truly enemies.

2014
02:59:35,656 --> 02:59:39,490
I remember when I was
with special Forces.

2015
02:59:42,930 --> 02:59:46,923
seems a thousand centuries ago.

2016
02:59:50,404 --> 02:59:53,134
We went into a camp
to inoculate...

2017
02:59:55,409 --> 02:59:56,967
some children.

2018
03:00:00,847 --> 03:00:03,577
We'd left the camp...

2019
03:00:03,717 --> 03:00:06,982
after we had inoculated
the children for polio.

2020
03:00:08,655 --> 03:00:11,351
And this old man came running
after us, and he was crying.

2021
03:00:11,458 --> 03:00:13,323
He couldn't say.

2022
03:00:15,762 --> 03:00:18,026
We went back there...

2023
03:00:18,131 --> 03:00:21,862
and they had come
and hacked off...

2024
03:00:21,969 --> 03:00:24,494
every inoculated arm.

2025
03:00:26,073 --> 03:00:28,439
There they were,
in a pile--

2026
03:00:28,542 --> 03:00:30,100
a pile of...

2027
03:00:31,745 --> 03:00:33,645
Iittle arms.

2028
03:00:34,948 --> 03:00:37,917
And I remember...

2029
03:00:39,453 --> 03:00:42,479
I-I-- I cried.

2030
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:44,523
I wept like...

2031
03:00:46,093 --> 03:00:49,290
some grandmother.

2032
03:00:50,998 --> 03:00:55,833
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2033
03:00:55,902 --> 03:00:59,030
And I want to remember it.
I never want to forget it.

2034
03:00:59,139 --> 03:01:01,869
I never want to forget.

2035
03:01:01,975 --> 03:01:04,739
And then I realized...

2036
03:01:05,846 --> 03:01:07,814
Iike I was shot--

2037
03:01:07,948 --> 03:01:11,179
Iike I was shot
with a diamond--

2038
03:01:11,318 --> 03:01:14,947
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead.

2039
03:01:16,523 --> 03:01:20,391
And I thought,
"My God, the genius of that.

2040
03:01:20,494 --> 03:01:22,894
The genius."

2041
03:01:22,996 --> 03:01:25,760
The will to do that.

2042
03:01:27,234 --> 03:01:32,001
Perfect, genuine, complete,
crystalline, pure.

2043
03:01:33,907 --> 03:01:35,807
And then I realized...

2044
03:01:35,909 --> 03:01:39,743
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it.

2045
03:01:39,846 --> 03:01:42,576
These were not monsters.
These were men--

2046
03:01:42,716 --> 03:01:45,184
trained cadres.

2047
03:01:45,318 --> 03:01:47,946
These men who fought
with their hearts...

2048
03:01:48,088 --> 03:01:50,056
who have families,
who have children...

2049
03:01:50,190 --> 03:01:52,124
who are filled with love...

2050
03:01:52,225 --> 03:01:55,558
that they had the strength--

2051
03:01:55,662 --> 03:01:57,562
the strength...

2052
03:02:01,234 --> 03:02:03,134
to do that.

2053
03:02:03,236 --> 03:02:08,264
If I had ten divisions
of those men...

2054
03:02:08,375 --> 03:02:11,867
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly.

2055
03:02:13,513 --> 03:02:16,607
You have to have men...

2056
03:02:16,750 --> 03:02:18,650
who are moral...

2057
03:02:20,120 --> 03:02:22,452
and at the same time...

2058
03:02:22,556 --> 03:02:24,615
who are able to...

2059
03:02:25,726 --> 03:02:27,591
utilize their...

2060
03:02:29,896 --> 03:02:33,662
primordial instincts to kill...

2061
03:02:33,767 --> 03:02:36,736
without feeling,
without passion...

2062
03:02:37,971 --> 03:02:41,600
without judgment--
without judgment.

2063
03:02:45,979 --> 03:02:49,471
Because it's judgment
that defeats us.

2064
03:03:08,068 --> 03:03:11,299
I worry that my son...

2065
03:03:11,404 --> 03:03:15,306
might not understand
what I've tried to be.

2066
03:03:17,544 --> 03:03:22,675
And if I were
to be killed, Willard...

2067
03:03:23,950 --> 03:03:26,680
I would want someone
to go to my home...

2068
03:03:26,820 --> 03:03:30,153
and tell my son everything.

2069
03:03:32,592 --> 03:03:37,052
Everything I did.
Everything you saw.

2070
03:03:37,164 --> 03:03:41,191
Because there's nothing
that I detest more than...

2071
03:03:41,301 --> 03:03:43,633
the stench oflies.

2072
03:03:45,772 --> 03:03:49,003
And ifyou understand me,
Willard, you--

2073
03:03:50,877 --> 03:03:54,005
you will do this for me.

2074
03:04:59,479 --> 03:05:03,279
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty. Over.

2075
03:05:03,416 --> 03:05:07,284
PBR Street Gang, this is
Almighty standing by. Over.

2076
03:05:08,655 --> 03:05:13,319
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty
standing by. How do you copy?

2077
03:05:18,031 --> 03:05:21,489
They were gonna make me
a major for this...

2078
03:05:21,601 --> 03:05:24,593
and I wasn 't even in
their fuckin ' army anymore.

2079
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:30,298
Everybody wanted me to do it.

2080
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:33,345
Him most of all.

2081
03:05:33,446 --> 03:05:35,880
I felt like he was up there...

2082
03:05:36,016 --> 03:05:39,110
waiting for me
to take the pain away.

2083
03:05:41,221 --> 03:05:43,849
He just wanted to go out
like a soldier...

2084
03:05:43,957 --> 03:05:46,653
standing up.

2085
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:50,753
Not like some poor,
wasted, rag-assed renegade.

2086
03:05:54,100 --> 03:05:57,194
Even the jungle wanted him dead.

2087
03:05:57,304 --> 03:06:00,569
And that's who he really
took his orders from anyway.

2088
03:06:40,380 --> 03:06:44,316
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

2089
03:06:49,089 --> 03:06:53,219
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

2090
03:06:57,597 --> 03:07:00,691
Come on, baby
take a chance with us

2091
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:06,033
And meet me at the back
ofthe blue bus tonight

2092
03:07:06,139 --> 03:07:08,630
Blue bus tonight

2093
03:07:08,742 --> 03:07:11,802
Blue bus tonight
Blue

2094
03:07:11,911 --> 03:07:15,312
Come on, yeah

2095
03:07:17,550 --> 03:07:20,246
We train young men
to drop fire on people...

2096
03:07:20,387 --> 03:07:23,823
but their commanders...

2097
03:07:23,923 --> 03:07:27,450
won't allow them
to write "fuck"...

2098
03:07:27,560 --> 03:07:30,586
on their airplanes because...

2099
03:07:30,697 --> 03:07:32,597
it's obscene.

2100
03:08:55,415 --> 03:08:57,315
The horror.

2101
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,351
The horror.

2102
03:14:25,011 --> 03:14:27,036
Calling PBR Street Gang.

2103
03:14:28,014 --> 03:14:31,472
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
Do you read me? Over.

2104
03:14:32,919 --> 03:14:35,615
PBR Street Gang?

2105
03:14:35,721 --> 03:14:37,848
PBR Street Gang,
this is Almighty--

2106
03:15:15,628 --> 03:15:17,186
The horror.

2107
03:15:21,133 --> 03:15:22,691
The horror.
