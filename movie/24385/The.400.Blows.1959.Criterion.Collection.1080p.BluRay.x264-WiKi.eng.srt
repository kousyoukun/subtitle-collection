20

This film is dedicated to
the Memory of Andre Bazin

21
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,179
Doinel! Bring me that

22
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,698
Nice! Get in the corner

23
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,935
Just one minute left.
Silence

24
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:20,111
30 seconds left.
Silence, please

25
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,190
Be ready to pick up the papers

26
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,856
I'll count to three

27
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,858
One, two

28
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:44,197
three. Collect the papers

29
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,143
Get his, first

30
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,278
Give it to me. Wait a minute.
-What's going on?

31
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,183
He won't give me his paper.
-No exception

32
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,019
Asshole

33
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,854
Do I have everybody's paper?
Class dismissed

34
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,929
Not you

35
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,037
Recess isn't mandatory.
It's a reward

36
00:05:55,377 --> 00:05:59,871
Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unjustifiably punished by Sourpuss

37
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:04,109
for a pinup fallen from the sky
It will be an eye for an eye

38
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:07,954
You need a referee maybe

39
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,853
No recess for three days

40
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:12,789
That will teach you

41
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:26,199
Hey guys, look at this

42
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:30,767
What's so interesting over there?

43
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,889
We have a new poet in our class

44
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,622
Only he can't tell an Alexandrine
from a decasyllabic verse

45
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,198
Doinel, you'll conjugate
for tomorrow

46
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,857
go to your seat

47
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,503
in indicative, conditional and
subjunctive tenses the sentence

48
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,266
everyone else recitation books out

49
00:07:04,613 --> 00:07:06,638
I deface the classroom walls

50
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:13,920
and abuse French verse

51
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,125
The Hare

52
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:30,135
Now, Doinel, go get some water

53
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,604
and erase those insanities, or I'll
make you lick the wall, my friend

54
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:41,571
who gave you permission
to change seats, Richer?

55
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,354
In the season when the thickets

56
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,960
Glow with flowers

57
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,434
When the black tip

58
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,886
Of my long ears

59
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,028
Could be seen

60
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,963
Above

61
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:38,267
The still green rye

62
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:47,446
From which I nibbled

63
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:52,486
The tender stems

64
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,292
As I played around

65
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,726
One day that

66
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,639
Unaware

67
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:22,507
I was there

68
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:30,648
Fast asleep in my hutch.
Little Margot surprised me

69
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:38,298
I saw you, Simonet!
-I didn't do anything, Sir

70
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:44,098
Naturally.
She loved me so

71
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,137
My beautiful mistress

72
00:09:58,153 --> 00:09:59,882
She was tender

73
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,249
And sweet

74
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:07,693
How she hugged me on her lap

75
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:10,158
And kissed me

76
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,227
What idiot whistled?
I'm warning you

77
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,167
If no one confesses, you'll
all be sorry. Right, Simonet?

78
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,332
I didn't do it, Sir.
It wasn't me, Sir

79
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:25,468
Cowards, too! What a class this year

80
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:28,673
I've known idiots, but at least
they were discreet

81
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,150
and didn't get caught. And you

82
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:37,655
you call this clean? You made that
wall dirtier! Go back to your seat

83
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:41,557
Your parents will hear from me!
Poor France! What a future

84
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:53,804
Everybody steals money from their
parents! -Maybe but it isn't easy

85
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:58,344
I bet even Mauricet does it. -Come
here. We want to ask you something

86
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,209
Where'd you get these expensive
glasses? -I bought them

87
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:03,817
Did you steal the money
from your dad or your mom?

88
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,286
Don't pretend you've never
gone through their pockets

89
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:11,892
You're the louse
who got me in trouble

90
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,121
You're a louse, Mauricet!
Your days are numbered

91
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,992
You better watch it

92
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,727
I'll never finish tonight

93
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,974
Sourpuss is an asshole.
-It's his job

94
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:38,379
Before the Army gets me

95
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,919
I'll break his face

96
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,423
Bye.
-Bye

97
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:50,480
I deface the classroom walls

98
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,096
Hi, Mom.
-Hello

99
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,008
Where's the flour?
-The flour?

100
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,645
What's this? You didn't buy
what I told you to

101
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:23,574
Where's the list I left you?

102
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:27,680
I lost it. -No wonder you
get such bad grades

103
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,220
Get me my slippers

104
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,790
In the bedroom.
Under the bed

105
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,261
And go get that flour.
I need it right away

106
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:08,089
A difficult delivery. They used
forceps. It runs in the family

107
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:10,959
The same thing happened to her
mother. -It doesn't mean anything

108
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:15,398
For Fanny, it was over in ten
minutes. But with my last one

109
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,529
if I hadn't had a C-section,
I wouldn't be here, talking to you

110
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:22,835
And my sister, one every year.
Can you imagine?

111
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:30,941
The doctor warned her. She had to
have surgery. There was blood over

112
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:37,489
Always running, son?
-I got in trouble with Mom

113
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,789
You know you shouldn't
get your mother angry

114
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:47,591
What's that? -A fog-light. I'll
try it on Sunday at the race

115
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:03,110
Look at your son. All floured up!
-I'm not in the mood

116
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:05,149
Too bad. I am

117
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,947
What about my change?
-I need it for lunch at school

118
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:11,489
Ask your father

119
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:21,568
Nothing quiet on the home front.
-I need some money for lunch, Dad

120
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:26,298
Only 1.000 francs.
-Therefore you hope for 500

121
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:29,102
therefore you need 300.
Here's 100

122
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:34,245
Here's 500 more.
Next time ask your mother

123
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:38,442
Where are the scissors?
-Where are the scissors?

124
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:42,783
That's not funny.
Put that homework away

125
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:46,893
it's time to eat.
-Your mother's right. There's a time

126
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,756
and place for everything

127
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:54,394
Where did you get this pen?
-I traded it

128
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:57,236
You do a lot of trading lately

129
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,544
Do you smell something?

130
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:09,175
It's the fish.
-It's promising

131
00:17:10,752 --> 00:17:15,655
I can't wait. Go ask your mom
if the dishtoweI is burning. -Why?

132
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,286
That's a joke

133
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,976
You can cIear the tabIe now

134
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:42,378
I got a call from your cousin.
His wife is pregnant again

135
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,486
Four times in 3 years! Worse
than rabbits! That's disgusting

136
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:49,748
By the way, what should
we do with the kid next summer?

137
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:53,293
There's always camp.
-You're right and it's fun

138
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,692
We don't have to decide yet.
-The sooner the better

139
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,695
Hey, be careful

140
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,698
Isn't it a beauty?
-Lions Racing Club

141
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,009
What's going on here?
-Slowly

142
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:14,010
Where would you prefer
to race, next Sunday?

143
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:16,673
It's my pick this time.
-I want to rest on Sunday

144
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,517
I'II go over to Huguette's.
-What wiII the feIIows think?

145
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,181
Listen, I need a rest.
Between the cleaning

146
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,886
in the morning.
-And in the afternoon

147
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,226
Your typing in the afternoon. You
definitely got the touch! -Go to bed

148
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,860
'Night Dad, 'night Mom

149
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,730
You are so stupid

150
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:45,470
Can't you take a joke? -You're
wasting your time with this crap

151
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,581
Antoine, don't forget the garbage
and turn your light off

152
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:52,776
I'm making contacts. It could
help me get a promotion

153
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,450
You? You'll never be
VP of anything

154
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,498
Get up, get up,
we didn't hear the alarm

155
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:05,421
I deface the classroom walls

156
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,959
I have no socks left around these
holes! -Those are gone

157
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,500
Buy yourself some new ones.
The others are dirty

158
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:20,633
I gave you money for the kid's
new sheets, remember?

159
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:24,005
He prefers his sleeping bag

160
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:28,308
Don't you, sweetheart?
-At least, it keeps me warm

161
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,949
You're still here?

162
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:41,058
Why are you running?
-We're going to be late

163
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:44,994
We'll have to sneak in again and
we'll get in trouble. -Don't rush

164
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,658
Why?
-Sourpuss won't let you in

165
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:53,034
You think he'll do it? -Yes.
He can't stand you. You got money?

166
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:56,438
Sure. Lunch money.
-In that case, let's go

167
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,236
What's the plan?

168
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:24,905
Follow me. Put your bag
next to mine behind the door.

169
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,506
Will they be safe?
-I always leave mine here

170
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:17,265
Oh, my God. It's Antoine. I'm sure
he saw me. -Which one is your son?

171
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:20,566
The brown one.
He's supposed to be in school

172
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,710
You're going to get it tonight!
-Kidding? She won't tell my father

173
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:26,039
That wasn't him?
-Never saw him before

174
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:27,805
You're safe, then

175
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,801
I'll go back to school tomorrow

176
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,470
But I'II need an excuse note.
What about you?

177
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:03,742
I have an old letter from my folks
I never used

178
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:08,313
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight

179
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:11,890
But the handwriting?
-Imitate your mother's

180
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,051
It'll be hard, she writes funny

181
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:18,426
Don't worry. It will work!
-I hope so

182
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,236
Dear Sir

183
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:35,511
Will you excuse my son

184
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,515
Rene

185
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:44,118
who was sick

186
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:46,459
My son Rene

187
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:12,377
Something's burning again here?
-It comes from downstairs

188
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:16,011
Set the table for two only.
-Why? Has Mom left?

189
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,284
No, she called to say
she'd be home late

190
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,792
Her boss needs her for the inventory

191
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:27,265
So we'll cook ourselves and
have a real bachelor's dinner

192
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:31,695
She said there are eggs.
-I know where

193
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:39,770
How was school today?

194
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:44,181
What did you study?
-The Hare

195
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:48,879
Oh, yes. The Hare and The Tortoise.
-No, it's just The Hare

196
00:27:50,324 --> 00:27:53,191
Did you do well?
-I wasn't asked anything

197
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,193
You must be aggressive
to go forward in life

198
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:59,059
or else you won't make it
to the finish line

199
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:01,201
You have to take initiatives

200
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:07,564
Have you thought about your mother's
birthday? It's on the 17th, you know

201
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:09,902
I hope you'll get her something

202
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,304
Antoine, are you listening?

203
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,609
Oh, I know what you're thinking

204
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:20,019
She's been tough on you lately

205
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:24,419
She's nervous.
You have to understand

206
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,522
She has lots to do between
being a housewife and her job

207
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:31,596
And this place is too small

208
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:35,497
We might be moving soon.
I'm working on it

209
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:42,432
And you see, at the office

210
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:45,578
they take advantage of women

211
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:49,208
But she loves you, you know.
She does. Oh, shit

212
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:04,424
Where did you put my Michelin guide?
-I didn't touch it

213
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:07,192
Antoine, you know,
I can't stand it when you lie

214
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:11,328
I'm sure.
-I'm sure I had it yesterday

215
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:15,072
I swear it's not me!
-It's incredible

216
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:16,971
how things always disappear
in this house

217
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,078
I didn't take it

218
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,751
All right, I'll ask your mother

219
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:31,951
Go to bed

220
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:35,151
Don't forget the garbage

221
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:33,617
My boss drove me home

222
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:37,986
I couldn't refuse

223
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:41,218
Are you getting paid overtime?
-Of course, at the end of the month

224
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:43,727
He should give you cash

225
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:47,924
Enough already! -No wonder
you'll need to rest on Sunday

226
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:52,197
Where's my Michelin's guide?
-How would I know? Ask Antoine

227
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:54,897
He said he didn't touch it.
-He's always lying

228
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:57,100
Like you. -You should show him
some manners

229
00:30:57,277 --> 00:31:03,910
I gave him a name. I feed him.
-I'm sick of this

230
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:07,645
If you can't handle him, let's
send him away to boarding school

231
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,379
so I can have some
peace for a change

232
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,136
The best thing is to eat out
until the end of the month

233
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:33,802
For that, I need a clean shirt

234
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:36,609
You could at least wash the collar

235
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:39,752
If only you hadn't bought
that fog-light

236
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,319
I got it secondhand

237
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:52,456
Well? Open the door!
-What if it's the gas man?

238
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,464
They always send a notice first

239
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,705
Hi, Sir. I'm in Antoine's class.
I came to see if he is better

240
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:07,438
Better? Why?
-He wasn't at school yesterday

241
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:09,911
Did you hear that?

242
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,417
Thanks, kiddo.
-Bye, Sir

243
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:23,152
You don't seem surprised

244
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,363
Why should I be?
I expect anything from him

245
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:34,436
What excuse should I use?
-Something big

246
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:37,702
The bigger, the better. Last year,
when my mom broke her leg

247
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,574
I told them everything,
except that she was drunk

248
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:44,615
I didn't need a letter.
-I can't tell a thing like that

249
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:48,619
In any case, we can't show up
together. -Right. You go first

250
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,245
So, there you are

251
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:19,016
A little extra homework
and you get sick

252
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:23,589
And your parents fell for it. What
excuse do you have this time?

253
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:25,957
Let's see the letter

254
00:33:26,126 --> 00:33:29,892
I don't have one. -And you think
you're going to get away with this?

255
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:31,462
It would be too easy, my friend

256
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:37,565
But Sir, it's my mother.
-What about your mother?

257
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:38,898
She's dead

258
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:44,007
I'm sorry, kid. I didn't know

259
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:46,770
Was she ill?
-Yes, Sir

260
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:52,176
You should have told me. You should
always confide in your teachers

261
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:55,553
Go join the others

262
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:09,495
What did you tell him?
-Leave me alone

263
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:24,450
Better thorns in the woods than...
-Up your

264
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:29,044
If you washed your ears, Duverger,
you would hear the whispering

265
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:32,953
Than up your ass! -He's not
whispering. He wants to confuse me

266
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,824
I'm all mixed up now, Sir

267
00:34:38,732 --> 00:34:43,192
Than flowers in the cradle. -Flowers
in the cradle. Better to have freedom

268
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:48,007
And feel a threat...
-Than slavery

269
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:55,472
With an eternal April...
And you're eternally lazy

270
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,674
Sit down! F!
-I knew it at home

271
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:01,780
Doinel! Oh, sorry, my boy

272
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:03,286
Simonot

273
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:52,337
I suggest he gets
maximum punishment

274
00:35:52,506 --> 00:35:56,237
He's beyond that.
He was out of line

275
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:59,936
This is a matter for his parents.
-We'll settle this at home tonight

276
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:11,919
What're you gonna do?
-After that

277
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:15,960
I can't live with my parents
anymore. I have to go away

278
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:20,031
You're over reacting!
-Well

279
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,897
I've got to live my own life.
I'll write them a letter and explain

280
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,334
Right now?
-Yes, I better

281
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:30,237
Where will you sleep tonight?
-I don't know. I don't care

282
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,538
I might have an idea.
Meet me in an hour

283
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,806
in front of the fountain,
place Pigalle. -OK

284
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,336
It used to be my
uncle's printing factory

285
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:04,272
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in

286
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:05,968
Do you think it's dangerous?

287
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,778
No. It already hit the bottom!
At least you'll be warm here

288
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,868
Here's a mattress and a pillow

289
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,769
Wow, it's heavy

290
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:38,140
Don't come here until midnight

291
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,243
Keep my bag. You'll give it
back to me tomorrow

292
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:51,984
My dear Parents. I understand,
misspelled of course

293
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:54,558
the gravity of my lie.
-Listen to this

294
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:58,129
Why did he have me die and not you?
-He prefers me, obviously

295
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:00,766
But now, we can't
live together anymore

296
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:04,370
So I'm going to try to live
my own life here or elsewhere

297
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,529
When I'm a man, I'll return

298
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:12,110
and we'll talk about everything.
Goodbye. Love, Antoine

299
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:14,542
So, you think it's normal
that he hates me

300
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:17,911
You're too hard on him.
-He gets on my nerves

301
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:42,832
Can you help me catch him?

302
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:49,206
That's your sister? -I don't know
her. She asked me to chase her dog

303
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:51,509
Is it her dog?
-I don't know

304
00:38:55,755 --> 00:38:58,918
May I help you?
-Sure. The more the better

305
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:00,855
What's his name?
-I don't know

306
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:06,994
Beat it, kid!
-But she asked me first

307
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:14,301
MERRY CHRISTMAS

308
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,717
Tell me, Doinel, I bet
you got it last night

309
00:42:17,891 --> 00:42:19,688
Not at all, everything went fine

310
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:24,454
Parents are irresponsible

311
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:36,437
Last and simple question

312
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,650
No, the tip of the tongue
between the teeth

313
00:42:50,423 --> 00:42:51,856
As if you had a lisp

314
00:42:55,194 --> 00:42:58,357
But I can't, Sir. Not everybody
has a tongue like yours

315
00:42:58,998 --> 00:43:00,158
Shut up

316
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:03,867
Go, sit...
Go sit down

317
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,037
You're insolent

318
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,211
Fronchot, you're in charge
until I come back

319
00:43:53,453 --> 00:43:56,513
We don't know what
to do with him anymore

320
00:43:56,689 --> 00:43:59,487
My dear Lady, you don't deserve this

321
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:03,652
My poor darling. Are you alright?

322
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,855
Where did you spend the night?
-In a printing factory

323
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,165
I don't care about his grades.
All I want is for him to behave

324
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:12,497
Alright then

325
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:17,298
Maybe it's genetic

326
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:35,405
You mustn't catch cold

327
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,102
Now jump in bed

328
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:41,709
I'm not tired, Mom

329
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,208
No, no. You'll be more
comfortable in ours

330
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,633
You know, I was once
your age too

331
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:02,735
Children always forget that

332
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:05,303
I didn't want to confide
to my parents either

333
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,201
I kept a secret diary

334
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:11,737
One day, I'll show it to you

335
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:17,145
When I was your age
I ran away with a farm-boy

336
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,786
It wasn't serious
but we were caught

337
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:22,387
My mother made me promise
never to see him again

338
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,423
and she didn't tell my father.
So, I cried

339
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:29,323
but I obeyed, because
a mother always knows best

340
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:31,930
We, too, can have secrets, you know

341
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:36,001
What did you mean in your letter by

342
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,402
We'll talk about everything.
-I meant

343
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:44,237
my problems at school.
-So, tell me

344
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,935
I can't concentrate

345
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,315
I'd like to quit school
and start making a living

346
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:52,816
What are you saying?

347
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:55,853
I wish I'd studied longer

348
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,787
And if your father
had gone to college

349
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,984
he'd be much further in his career

350
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:04,255
I know you learn lots
of useless things at school

351
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:07,127
Algebra, science

352
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:10,065
Who needs it? But French, eh?

353
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:13,138
We all need to write letters

354
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:17,505
Let's share another secret, Ok?

355
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:23,976
If next time you have a test
you're among

356
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:27,915
the top five, I'll give
you 1.000 francs, Ok?

357
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:29,646
But you mustn't tell your father

358
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:09,448
The dying man pulled himself up

359
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:13,218
And gave his children
a piercing look

360
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,385
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

361
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:20,966
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

362
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:23,364
He raised his hand with anger

363
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:26,062
And shouted Archimedes'
famous last words

364
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,003
Eureka! I found it

365
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:46,623
Describe a serious event which you
witnessed and involved you personally

366
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:50,759
Eureka, I found it

367
00:48:54,768 --> 00:49:00,229
My grandfather's death

368
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:30,768
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary now

369
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:33,839
Well armed that girl

370
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:37,803
She used her weapons to be
promoted executive secretary

371
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,639
Of course, she's got what it takes

372
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:46,107
Now, we'll have to watch out for
her. You know, pillow talk

373
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,317
I used to tell

374
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,753
how to cheat on her travel expenses

375
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,825
but now I may regret it

376
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:59,260
By the way, I still haven't
found my Michelin guide

377
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:04,703
One of you must have it.
-Who cares?

378
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,361
Well, I don't Iike mysteries

379
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:11,100
You Ieft something on the stove
again. -No, I didn't

380
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:17,411
I can't believe this.
Stop screaming

381
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:19,745
Go get some water instead of
screaming

382
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,956
You idiot! I've had it with you

383
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:30,153
What possessed you,
to light a candle in there?

384
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,960
It was for Balzac, Daddy. -Balzac?
Are you pulling my leg?

385
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,332
It was for my writing class. -Leave
him alone. He promised me something

386
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:43,168
To collect our home insurance?
One candle won't do the job

387
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:45,811
You want my lighter, perhaps.
-Don't be ridiculous

388
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:50,112
As long as we feed you,
you'll do as you're told

389
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:53,245
or else we'll send you
to the military Academy

390
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:58,256
You never heard of it. You'll learn
fast! They'll keep you in the line

391
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,952
Why don't we get out of here

392
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:05,257
and go to the movies together?
-Good

393
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:08,424
That's your way of
teaching him a lesson?

394
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:11,935
Did you write a good paper?
-I think so

395
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:19,636
Trust him, Julien.
You'll have a pleasant surprise

396
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:22,577
Sounds dangerous. -So, are you
taking us to the movies?

397
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,149
What's playing?
-Paris is Ours

398
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:28,344
Since you're both against me.
-You'd rather stay here?

399
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:36,896
I deserve to go out! But they don't
care much for arsonists at the theater

400
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:15,592
She had one of those...
-That's all you noticed

401
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,600
I liked the movie.
-But it wasn't funny

402
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:29,238
But it had some depth.
-Some what?

403
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:50,602
Gen. Daredevil and his Army

404
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:56,406
Look at your mother's legs.
Pretty, eh?

405
00:53:06,987 --> 00:53:12,448
Home sweet home, smoky though.
-Don't forget the garbage, honey

406
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:17,088
I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it

407
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:11,040
Doinel, if your paper is first today
it's because I've decided to give

408
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:14,051
the results beginning with the worst

409
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:18,282
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend

410
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:23,225
To those less familiar with Balzac,
we have here A Sinister Affair

411
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:30,328
That Doinel chose to write about his
grandfather's death was his right

412
00:54:30,503 --> 00:54:35,167
We know he doesn't hesitate to
sacrifice his relatives if necessary

413
00:54:35,342 --> 00:54:38,140
It's not true, Sir. I didn't cheat!
-Judge for yourselves

414
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:45,049
The dying man pulled himself up, and
gave his children a piercing look

415
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:48,847
His hair bristled
on the nape of his neck

416
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:52,014
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime

417
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:56,026
He raised his hand with anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words

418
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:59,654
Eureka! I found it!
Well, I found it, too, Doinel

419
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,859
You're an abominable plagiarist!
-That's not true

420
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:04,970
Take your paper to
the principal, immediately

421
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,040
And tell him you're suspended from
class until the end of the semester

422
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:30,018
He didn't cheat, Sir. I sat next to
him. I would have noticed if he did

423
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:33,097
You want to be suspended, too?
-I wouldn't mind

424
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:37,359
Talking back? Get out

425
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:41,129
I don't mind being suspended but
I don't want to go out. -Get out

426
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:45,176
It's illegal! -I'll show
you who makes the law here

427
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,182
So, did you take him to the
principal? -No, he ran away

428
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:12,497
So I punched him
and I ran away

429
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:16,506
What happened? -He was furious. I'm
suspended from school until Christmas

430
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:25,982
Now I really can't go home

431
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:29,747
My father said he'd send me to the
Military Academy. -What's that?

432
00:56:29,923 --> 00:56:32,824
Some kind of military school.
-You'll wear a nice uniform

433
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:36,554
and besides, there's a future in the
Army. -Thanks, but no, thanks

434
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:41,167
If only it was the Navy!
I've never seen the sea

435
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:44,735
I've seen the Channel, the Atlantic,
the Mediterranean

436
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:49,136
but not the North Sea. Come on,
you can stay with me. We'll manage

437
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:18,837
Holy cow, a horse

438
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,334
It's my father's. It's a souvenir

439
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,502
It's big here

440
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,910
You can sleep on the couch. No one
will know. -What about your folks?

441
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:35,213
They're never here. My mother drinks
and my father is always at the track

442
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:36,787
You're free to come and go

443
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:41,456
First, we've got to find a way
to make some money

444
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:46,059
Right, that's the first thing to do.
-That's the first thing to do

445
00:57:46,232 --> 00:57:48,928
In the meantime, I'll take an
advance on my inheritance

446
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:09,636
Hi, Lady!
-Little wretch

447
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:40,802
Have you seen your mother lately?
-Today when I came home from school

448
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:46,341
She makes sure she's out
when I'm here

449
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:48,173
She must be up to something

450
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:51,845
Where's the fruit?

451
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,774
This is for you

452
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:44,000
Oh, 9:30. I'll be late for the club

453
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,648
Hurry up! We'll miss the newsreel

454
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,930
Boy, I'm thirsty

455
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:03,580
It's already empty, asshole.
-Your turn. Hurry up

456
01:03:15,928 --> 01:03:18,897
Eh, that's the old man!
-Help me with the blanket

457
01:03:32,178 --> 01:03:35,079
That's fine.
What's all this smoke?

458
01:03:35,248 --> 01:03:37,478
Where do you think you are?

459
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,551
Alright, retain the cost of
3 cigars on your pocket-money

460
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,689
What's this?
My horse is not a coat rack

461
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,856
It's worth a lot of money!
It's a work of art

462
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:52,794
I'll never get rid of it,
unless I have to

463
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,766
Turn your light off,
and go to bed now

464
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,908
Eh, not bad

465
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:22,219
Give me your Michelin guide.
-We could sell the horse

466
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:25,023
No. My dad would kill me

467
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:27,996
Coward! With the money
we'd live by the sea

468
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:30,897
have boats. We'd be on our own

469
01:05:29,295 --> 01:05:32,287
Make up your mind. -I'm sure we
could get one from my father's office

470
01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:36,026
Let's get it, then. -But we couldn't
sell it. They're all numbered

471
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:40,468
We'll pawn it.
My mother pawns everything

472
01:09:15,788 --> 01:09:17,312
How much?
-10 percent

473
01:09:18,124 --> 01:09:20,752
and 1000 francs in advance. -No,
when you get back with the money

474
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:22,917
I see you don't trust me

475
01:09:57,163 --> 01:10:01,224
We want it back.
-Where do you think you're going?

476
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,492
I thought you were gone

477
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:07,269
It didn't work. They want to see a
a receipt. -Give it back to us then

478
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,135
Fine, but I want
500 francs for my trouble

479
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:13,039
We don't have any money.
-Well

480
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:17,012
then 300. -We're broke.
Give us back our typewriter

481
01:10:17,183 --> 01:10:20,675
Then I'll keep the typewriter
as a down payment

482
01:10:20,786 --> 01:10:23,152
No way! It's ours!
-Listen

483
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:26,155
Give it back or I'll break
your face. -Hands off

484
01:10:26,325 --> 01:10:29,488
It's no more yours than mine,
alright? There comes a cop

485
01:10:29,662 --> 01:10:31,027
Let's ask him

486
01:10:33,365 --> 01:10:35,595
O.K. Keep the damned thing

487
01:10:40,973 --> 01:10:43,533
I'm sick of carrying it!
-It's your turn

488
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:46,906
My father will guess I took it.
-It was your idea

489
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:50,242
It was yours, asshole.
-I don't care. I'll leave it here

490
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:55,183
Are you nuts?
-Alright, I'll take it back then

491
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:58,289
but I'm going to wear a hat

492
01:10:58,457 --> 01:10:59,754
so the concierge won't recognize me

493
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,758
Please, bring it back for me.
-Oh, no! It wasn't my idea

494
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:09,628
OK. But you're an asshole.
Hold it, while I put on the hat

495
01:11:09,802 --> 01:11:11,201
You'll wait for me outside

496
01:11:47,206 --> 01:11:51,006
You're Mr. Doinel's son!
Put that down

497
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:53,906
Your father's not going to like this

498
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,413
This time, I'll show them
I'm doing my job

499
01:11:58,584 --> 01:12:01,644
Don't try to escape.
I'm warning you

500
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,618
I've dealt with punks like you before

501
01:12:06,558 --> 01:12:10,392
Mr. Doinel? Sorry to bother you

502
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:13,656
but you better come over

503
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:19,229
Let's say it's a surprise.
But not a pleasant one

504
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,198
Keep that hat on

505
01:12:30,082 --> 01:12:32,710
I'm not taking you to
a party, this time

506
01:12:32,885 --> 01:12:36,184
Happy days are over for you. Your
mother and I will have some peace

507
01:12:36,355 --> 01:12:39,051
Take a good look at your pal

508
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:41,989
because you won't be
seeing him for a while

509
01:12:57,776 --> 01:13:01,644
Maybe this will do it.
This can't go on anymore

510
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:04,282
If I'd done this when I was your age,
my father would have killed me

511
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:09,052
Can we see the Chief?

512
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:18,719
We've tried everything. Kindness,
persuasion, punishment

513
01:13:18,897 --> 01:13:22,856
But we never hit him.
-Sometimes, the old methods

514
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:26,061
Of course, but we're not like that

515
01:13:27,339 --> 01:13:29,899
He had a lot of freedom.
-Too much, perhaps

516
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:34,774
Not too much. You see, both my wife
and I work, and you know how it is

517
01:13:34,947 --> 01:13:36,642
I'm a father, too

518
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:40,212
I must admit it's not always easy

519
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:42,820
If only we could talk with him

520
01:13:42,988 --> 01:13:45,582
But he doesn't even listen

521
01:13:45,724 --> 01:13:50,286
You think he's listening now? Look
how I found him with the typewriter

522
01:13:50,462 --> 01:13:52,555
God only knows what goes on
in that head

523
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,359
Take down his statement

524
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,297
Vagrancy and theft

525
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,477
So, what's your decision?
-In any case

526
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,585
if I take him home,
he'll run away again

527
01:14:14,753 --> 01:14:18,280
I don't know. Maybe you
could send him some place

528
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:23,053
to the countryside, where they'd
make him work. He won't study anymore

529
01:14:23,228 --> 01:14:27,756
We could put him in a house of
correction. They're well organized

530
01:14:27,933 --> 01:14:31,232
He'd learn a craft.
-That sounds fine

531
01:14:31,403 --> 01:14:33,530
If there's room for him, of course

532
01:14:34,473 --> 01:14:38,534
But you'll have to fill out an
application for the transfer of your

533
01:14:39,478 --> 01:14:42,174
parental rights to the Department
for the Juvenile Delinquents

534
01:14:43,248 --> 01:14:46,445
He'll appear in the Juvenile Court
tomorrow morning

535
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:49,849
You or your wife must be present

536
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:53,449
No one saw you enter the building?

537
01:14:55,394 --> 01:15:00,889
I hereby declare having broken
into the building and stole

538
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:11,165
a typewriter

539
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:16,210
Sign here

540
01:15:17,015 --> 01:15:20,041
He's all yours

541
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:37,192
Take care of him.
I'm going home

542
01:16:13,038 --> 01:16:16,371
What did you do?
-I ran away from home

543
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,309
And you?

544
01:16:20,412 --> 01:16:21,970
Oh, I

545
01:17:04,756 --> 01:17:06,155
Here come the girls

546
01:17:11,964 --> 01:17:15,365
I saw a police station
in a movie. It was cleaner

547
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:20,095
I once saw a dirtier one.
-And I, more cheerful one

548
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:07,216
The limo has arrived, folks

549
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:26,897
Put on your jacket

550
01:20:24,623 --> 01:20:27,786
Tie, belt, shoe lace.
Empty your pockets

551
01:20:56,388 --> 01:20:57,480
Sign here

552
01:23:42,153 --> 01:23:44,621
Maybe we could take him back

553
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:47,519
but he'd have to change drastically

554
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:50,183
If only you could scare him,
Your Honor

555
01:23:50,362 --> 01:23:53,593
That's not my role.
-But we can't control him

556
01:23:53,765 --> 01:23:57,166
Or perhaps you're not
doing it the right way

557
01:23:57,335 --> 01:24:01,931
Tell me, is it true that he sometimes
spends his weekends home alone?

558
01:24:02,107 --> 01:24:07,135
My husband has a racing club.
It's possible we left him home alone

559
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:11,908
but he hates sports. He spends
hours at the movies, ruining his eyes

560
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:15,812
What does your husband have to say?
It's his son after all

561
01:24:17,756 --> 01:24:22,625
He's not. He married me when my child
was still a baby. -That's quite noble

562
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:27,231
I shouldn't have told you.
-On the contrary

563
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:30,061
I think we should place your child

564
01:24:30,235 --> 01:24:35,036
under observation in a special home.
-Could it be by the sea, Your Honor?

565
01:24:35,206 --> 01:24:37,140
We're not sending him
to Summer camp

566
01:24:38,076 --> 01:24:40,772
But I'll do my best depending
on what's available

567
01:24:41,513 --> 01:24:44,880
He'll stay there for 2 or 3 months
while I study his case

568
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,540
Then, we'll take a decision

569
01:24:47,852 --> 01:24:50,548
Believe me, this change
will benefit him

570
01:24:50,722 --> 01:24:52,349
Goodbye, Your Honor.
-Goodbye

571
01:24:57,028 --> 01:25:00,589
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR JUVENILE DELINQUENTS

572
01:25:36,434 --> 01:25:39,062
How did you end up here?
-And you?

573
01:25:39,237 --> 01:25:42,365
I made the wrong turn.
-I stole a typewriter

574
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:45,100
A typewriter? That's dumb!
No wonder you got caught

575
01:25:45,276 --> 01:25:48,837
They're numbered

576
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:51,948
You see that big guy?

577
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:53,414
He stole car tires

578
01:25:55,086 --> 01:25:57,111
Each time I cried

579
01:25:57,288 --> 01:26:00,155
my father would imitate
me on his fiddle

580
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:03,260
just to drive me nuts.
One day, I got fed up

581
01:26:03,428 --> 01:26:05,988
and I knocked him out

582
01:26:06,164 --> 01:26:08,792
Good for you. If I'd been you,
I would have killed him

583
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:16,768
Who's that? They caught him.
He escaped a week ago

584
01:26:19,811 --> 01:26:22,644
You know, you can escape
but you can't get caught

585
01:26:31,823 --> 01:26:34,883
What are you doing here?
Line up! Quick

586
01:27:38,489 --> 01:27:39,820
Show me the bread

587
01:27:43,394 --> 01:27:44,656
You couldn't wait, eh?

588
01:27:45,563 --> 01:27:47,155
Bring your plate and bread here

589
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:02,340
Right or left?
-Left, Sir

590
01:28:10,488 --> 01:28:11,887
And no talking

591
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:25,395
-I brought you that.
I bet they'd catch you and I won

592
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,844
So what? I had five days of fun

593
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:37,448
I'll do it again.
-What are you doing here?

594
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:43,219
Kanayan, to the psychologist

595
01:28:44,989 --> 01:28:48,254
If she drops her pen, pick it up
but don't look at her legs

596
01:28:48,426 --> 01:28:51,088
Or else, it will be on your record.
-My record?

597
01:28:51,262 --> 01:28:54,663
They keep a file on what everybody
thinks of you. The doctor, the judge

598
01:28:54,832 --> 01:28:57,027
even your parent's neighbors

599
01:28:57,201 --> 01:28:58,998
I know mine by heart

600
01:28:59,704 --> 01:29:03,834
I'm an unstable psychotic
individual with perverted tendencies

601
01:29:04,008 --> 01:29:07,375
What if I play dumb?
-Then, it's the funny farm

602
01:29:07,545 --> 01:29:10,013
or boot camp

603
01:29:16,654 --> 01:29:20,181
Why did you return the typewriter?
-Well

604
01:29:20,358 --> 01:29:22,690
since I couldn't sell it or anything

605
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:27,820
I got scared. I don't know
why I returned it. Just like that

606
01:29:27,999 --> 01:29:31,594
I hear you stole 10.000 francs
from your grandmother

607
01:29:31,769 --> 01:29:34,932
She had invited me for her birthday

608
01:29:35,106 --> 01:29:38,200
I thought she is old, and doesn't
eat much. She doesn't need the money

609
01:29:38,376 --> 01:29:40,435
She was going to die soon

610
01:29:41,245 --> 01:29:44,908
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I took some

611
01:29:45,717 --> 01:29:49,915
I knew she wouldn't notice.
And she didn't

612
01:29:50,088 --> 01:29:53,023
She gave me a nice book that day

613
01:29:54,225 --> 01:29:58,594
But my mother, she used
to go through my pockets

614
01:29:58,763 --> 01:30:02,665
That night, while I was asleep

615
01:30:02,834 --> 01:30:05,826
she must have found the money in
my pocket cause next day it was gone

616
01:30:06,738 --> 01:30:11,198
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it

617
01:30:11,376 --> 01:30:14,573
And then she took the nice book away

618
01:30:15,646 --> 01:30:17,409
One day I asked for it back

619
01:30:18,549 --> 01:30:20,540
and I found out she'd sold it

620
01:30:22,587 --> 01:30:24,555
Your parents say you're always lying

621
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:29,248
Oh, I lie, now and then, I suppose

622
01:30:29,427 --> 01:30:32,294
Sometimes, if I told them the truth

623
01:30:32,463 --> 01:30:34,294
they wouldn't believe me,
anyway. So I prefer to lie

624
01:30:35,033 --> 01:30:36,728
Why don't you like your mother?

625
01:30:37,735 --> 01:30:41,535
Well, she put me in a foster home
and then, when they had no more money

626
01:30:41,706 --> 01:30:42,968
I lived with my grandmother

627
01:30:44,242 --> 01:30:47,336
But then she got old and
she couldn't take care of me anymore

628
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:51,772
So, when I was 8,
I went to live with my parents

629
01:30:51,949 --> 01:30:55,248
I could tell Mom didn't like me.
She was always

630
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,854
yelling at me for no reason

631
01:30:59,023 --> 01:31:03,858
There were fights at home

632
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:07,190
and I, I overheard

633
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:15,002
that my mother had me
before she was married

634
01:31:15,173 --> 01:31:19,405
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once

635
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:22,876
that's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion

636
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:24,878
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born

637
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:27,145
Have you ever slept with a girl?

638
01:31:30,888 --> 01:31:34,984
No. But some friends of mine have

639
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:38,617
They told me where
the hookers hang out

640
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:43,666
And so I went, and I tried
to pick up some girls

641
01:31:43,835 --> 01:31:47,202
but they yelled at me.
So, I got scared and I left

642
01:31:47,371 --> 01:31:50,829
I went back several times

643
01:31:51,008 --> 01:31:53,374
Once a man asked me
what I was doing there

644
01:31:53,544 --> 01:31:56,479
He was North African. So I told him

645
01:31:56,647 --> 01:31:59,445
I guess he knew a lot of women.
He said he knew one

646
01:31:59,617 --> 01:32:05,647
a young one, who liked guys my age

647
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:10,352
So he took me to
the hotel where she was

648
01:32:10,528 --> 01:32:13,156
only she wasn't there that day

649
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:17,165
We waited an hour or two.
She didn't show up. So I left

650
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:18,185
Don't look for your father,
I came alone. Over there?

651
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:47,123
Your personal letter hurt
your father deeply

652
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:49,919
and of course he showed it to me.
Whatever you may think

653
01:33:50,094 --> 01:33:52,756
we get along well

654
01:33:52,897 --> 01:33:56,230
I went through a difficult time, but
you didn't need to remind him of it

655
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,664
He gave you his name, after all

656
01:34:01,005 --> 01:34:05,305
We were willing to try again
and take you back

657
01:34:05,476 --> 01:34:07,706
but the neighbors would talk.
You probably complained

658
01:34:07,878 --> 01:34:11,541
to the entire neighborhood.
-I didn't say anything, Mom

659
01:34:11,716 --> 01:34:15,516
I'm used to this anyway. I have
been criticized my entire life

660
01:34:15,686 --> 01:34:20,885
That's all I wanted to tell you.
And don't go crying to your father

661
01:34:21,058 --> 01:34:24,721
He told me to tell you
he doesn't care about you anymore

662
01:34:25,296 --> 01:34:27,992
So you will be sent to a Labor Center

663
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:33,231
You wanted to work.
Well, now you'll see if you like it
