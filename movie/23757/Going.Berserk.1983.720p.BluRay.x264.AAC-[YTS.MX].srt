*

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,602
* Well, John's the lead
in this movie scene *

5
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,138
* He's the Candy Man,
if ya know what I mean *

6
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,140
* And he drives
a long black limousine *

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,309
* With his sidekick Chick

8
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,277
* Now, John's a drummer
out on the street *

9
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,346
* But the man can't even
keep a beat *

10
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,481
* So he spins his wheels
to make ends meet *

11
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,850
* Huh?
* You got it?
Stay with me, now *

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,519
* John's got
a pretty little fiance *

13
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,587
* But her daddy's tryin'
to pull a power play *

14
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,789
* And if Big Daddy
gets his way *

15
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,227
* Our man John will be
wearin' cement shoes! *

16
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,597
* I'm confused

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,301
* We're goin'
berserk *

18
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,870
* You gotta be crazy
to live the way we do *

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,573
* Goin' berserk
Everything's hazy *

20
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,276
* And only your sweet love
will see me through *

21
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,610
* Everybody's
goin' berserk *

22
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,879
* Goin' berserk,
goin' berserk *

23
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,149
* But now, Salvatore
is a movie man *

24
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,184
* And he wants to put
the wedding in the can *

25
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,319
* If he can,
that's the rub *

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,621
* But Nancy's daddy's
got a different plan *

27
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,490
* What?
* Hold tight

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,362
* Cut to...
* ( Heavenly choir sings)

29
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,530
* You see, Sun Yi,
he's a holy man *

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,499
* But it's all a front
for his master plan *

31
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,534
* Ya understand?
* Huh?À*

32
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,836
* Now, Sun Yi runs
an aerobics class *

33
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,905
* And he runs it pretty slick

34
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,175
* It'll trim your thighs,
it'll pop your eyes *

35
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,243
* Jane Fonda's worried sick

36
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,312
* So the Holy One
slips John a gun *

37
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,514
* And he says he wants
Ed Reese undone *

38
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,416
* 'Cause Ed's a drag,
he's just dead wood *

39
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,850
* Get it?
* Got it!
* Good!

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,319
* Goin' berserk

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,189
* You gotta be crazy
to live the way we do *

42
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,423
* Goin' berserk

43
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,158
* Everything's hazy

44
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,227
* And only your sweet love
will see me through *

45
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,336
* Goin' berserk

46
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:18,172
* I'm a-startin' to
go b-b-b-b-b-berserk! *

47
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,573
* Goin' berserk

48
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,243
* I don't know what I want,
but I need it! *

49
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,611
* Goin' berserk

50
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,479
* Why don't you help me out
a little bit? *

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,415
* You know what I like
* Goin' berserk...

52
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,594
( Animals screeching
in distance )

53
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,297
( Jungle drums beating )

54
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,295
I know, I know.
We're almost there.

55
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,647
( Footsteps approach )

56
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,651
Hi. Hi.
Okay, let's start--

57
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,653
Oh, cut that out.
Will ya stop that?

58
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,356
C'mon, a joke is a joke.
Will ya cut it out?

59
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,959
Awright, smoke 'em
if ya got 'em.

60
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,496
Awright, lighten up
and listen to me, now.

61
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:49,763
Awright.

62
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,999
I guess you're wondering
how I got here.

63
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,335
Well, let me first
introduce myself.

64
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,704
My name is John Bourgignon
of the Melonville Bourgignons,

65
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,572
and a good friend of mine,
Chick Leff, and I

66
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,708
ran a limousine service
back in the States.

67
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,277
I was about to get married
to this girl Nancy Reese--

68
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,778
Well, see for yourself.

69
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,714
You're not gonna
believe this story.

70
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,682
You might believe it,
I don't know. You--

71
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,618
You might buy it, you might not.
Check it out.

72
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:18,426
I just gotta stop off
at Sal's for a second.

73
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,027
Aw, no, I don't
wanna go there.

74
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:20,961
He's gonna talk us
into acting

75
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,830
in another one of his
Kung Fu movies again.

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,665
Oh, that was
embarrassing.

77
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,500
What do you think
he wants?
I dunno.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,702
The only time he calls
is when we're late on
the loan payments,

79
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,404
and we're not late.

80
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,306
How's he make any money
on look-alike service?

81
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,475
He don't.
We're here to see
Mr. DiPasquale.

82
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,709
I think his mother
is on the phone.

83
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,710
May I say
who's calling?

84
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,312
Tell him John
and Chick are here.

85
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,513
I'll see if he's free.
Thank you.

86
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,485
MAN: Aw, fuck you!

87
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah?
Well, fuck you!

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,689
He's on a conference call.

89
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,724
If you'd care to take a seat,
he'll be with you momentarily.

90
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,493
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

91
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,106
Hey! Chick, Johnny!
I been waitin' for ya!

92
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,608
C'mon inside,

93
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,042
I didn't know
you guys were here.

94
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,612
* Here comes the bride,
here comes the bride *

95
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,381
I got an important
meeting inside.

96
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,349
No phone calls,
no interruptions.

97
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,450
I don't wanna
be disturbed.

98
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,851
What if you get
a phone call?

99
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,753
No phone calls.

100
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,656
I got an important meeting
inside. No interruptions!

101
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,857
No nothing!

102
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,526
Yes, Mr. Dispes--

103
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,661
DiPasquale!
DiPasquale!

104
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,633
Make yourself at home.

105
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,768
Is this
a real Oscar, Sal?

106
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,537
You bet your fat ass
it is, Johnny.

107
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,672
It's the real thing.

108
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,676
Best Foreign Film 1958.
My Big Hill.

109
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,645
Uh, somebody gave me that.

110
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,380
One of these days
I'm gonna have my own.

111
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,848
I been thinkin'
about gettin' back
in the movies, ya know.

112
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,083
Yeah. Sit down.
Thanks.

113
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,521
So, so, so--

114
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,456
a lot's been happening
since I seen you last.

115
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,391
Been readin' about you
in the paper and everything.

116
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,427
I mean, you're marryin'
Ed Reese's daughter,

117
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,661
that's a very big thing.

118
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,095
I guess so, yeah.

119
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,564
So, uh,
how'd you swing that?

120
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,166
Well, we met, and, uh,
we liked each other,

121
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,402
we fell in love,
and we're gonna get married.

122
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,504
That's very warm.
I mean, I like the--

123
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,573
The love thing
is very important because,

124
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,508
y'know, my own marriage
didn't work out too good,

125
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,876
but I don't wanna
get into that now.

126
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,845
Sal, show him
the picture.

127
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,547
Nah, he don't wanna
see the picture.

128
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,581
C'mon, show him
the picture.

129
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,882
He don't wanna--

130
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,684
Well, I carry a picture
of the ex on me.

131
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,553
Y'know, just for
old times' sake.

132
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,922
She was a sweet kid.
She was 18 when I married her.

133
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:29,890
Where'd you meet her,
in high school?

134
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,125
No. I wish
I we to high school.

135
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,561
Look at this.

136
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,596
Nice.
Took a good picture, huh?

137
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,564
Yeah.
Yeah.

138
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,899
Well...

139
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,702
the whole thing turned
to rat shit after the honeymoon.

140
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,472
Look, Sal, why'd you
call us here?

141
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,806
Wouldn't it be interesting

142
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,509
if you talked Ed Reese
into letting me

143
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,578
film the entire wedding?

144
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,780
No, I'm sorry.
It just wouldn't work.

145
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,515
You don't think
I'm good enough?

146
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,749
I didn't say that.

147
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,984
Maybe you didn't see
a little film

148
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,719
I like to call Kung Fu U.

149
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,454
What?

150
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,755
Maybe you don't remember

151
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,857
a little
Salvator DiPasquale production

152
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,594
which just happened
to gross $410,000

153
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,196
across this entire country
playing drive-ins.

154
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,732
I guess you don't
remember that, huh?!

155
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,468
And I put ya in
the damn movie!

156
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,236
Sorry, Johnny,

157
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,238
I got a bark
that's worse than my bite.

158
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,708
I gotta do something
about this temper.

159
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,576
Well, I-I'm sorry
I didn't know that.

160
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,678
No, that's all right,
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

161
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,647
I just think it's--

162
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:27,948
He just won't
go along with it,
that's all.

163
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,183
Hey, you wanna know
what I think?

164
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,920
I think it would be
good for his image.

165
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,755
I really feel
it'd be wrong.

166
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,989
I mean,
he doesn't like me.

167
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,691
Telephone,
Mr. Dispascous.

168
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,660
Moron!!!

169
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,895
Moron!!!

170
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,732
Hey, let me
ask you boys somethin'.

171
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,004
How much money do you
still owe on the limo?

172
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,607
I don't know,
about...

173
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,909
a little over 10,000,
I think.

174
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,712
12,300. It's a lot of money.
It's a lot of fares.

175
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,648
It's a lot of work.

176
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,950
Y'know, I'd be willing
to kiss that money off

177
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,852
if you could swing a deal
with Reese.

178
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,788
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

179
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,222
It's real important
to me, Johnny.

180
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,592
You do this for me,
I do this for you.

181
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,226
You scratch my back,
I'm scratchin'--

182
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,895
Sal, it's impossible.
Thanks very much.

183
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,496
Just think about it,
that's all.
We gotta go to work.

184
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,967
John, it's a lot of money.

185
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,735
I know it is. And I'm
thinkin' about it.

186
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,303
Good.

187
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,104
Awright, I'll tell you
what I'll do.

188
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,039
I'll ask Nancy
to ask the old man.

189
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,675
But I'm not
promisin' anything.

190
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,776
Great.
That's all I ask.

191
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:29,943
Now, do me a favor,
would ya?

192
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,278
I'm not coverin'
for you tonight.

193
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,547
I'm sorry.
I cannot work late.

194
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,583
We've got that
big brunch tomorrow
at Nancy's folks',

195
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,084
and I wanna be
perky and charming.

196
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,286
Easy fare,
they're classical musicians.

197
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,954
Just take 'em to their hotel,
it'll only take a minute.

198
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,256
No. No is no.

199
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,799
WOMAN: We're live
outside the courthouse

200
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,866
where religious cult leader

201
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,969
Sun Yi Day has just
been indicted on several counts.

202
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,339
Included are conspiracy,
tax evasion, kidnapping,

203
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,842
resisting arrest
and jury tampering.

204
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,678
Congressman Ed Reese,
the presidential hopeful

205
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,046
who's leading the crusade
against these people

206
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,881
will be joining us shortly--

207
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,983
Hi, Shirley.
Ah, Congressman.

208
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,754
Shirley, what everyone
must understand about this

209
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,590
is that it is not
religious persecution.

210
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,093
The Church of Sun Yi
is not a church at all.

211
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,596
It's a front,
it's a tax shelter,

212
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,365
set up solely for
personal financial gain.

213
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,868
How do you see
the situation?
There are--

214
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,037
Excuse me.
Reverend Sun Yi,
could we get a statement?

215
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,972
The Reverend Sun Yi
has no statements at this--

216
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,908
I'd like to say that
this is a very old story.

217
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,677
If you don't
understand something,

218
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,145
then you attack it.

219
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,013
You call it weird,
or a cult.

220
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,082
And you try to
destroy it.

221
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,017
Well, the person who is
leading the attack

222
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,987
is usually someone
who is on very shaky
moral ground himself.

223
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,022
He's unsure of himself,

224
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,391
and so he lashes out
in a paranoid way

225
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,893
against those of us

226
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,762
who have ascended
to a higher plane

227
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,130
of consciousness
and awareness.

228
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,367
Well, we'll survive this,
we always have in the past.

229
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,804
And when Mr. Reese
loses his anger and his fear,

230
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,372
we invite him to join us

231
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,041
in spreading our message
of love and profit.

232
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,777
Thank you very much.

233
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,178
( Chuckles )

234
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,913
Shirley,

235
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,915
this is pure crap.

236
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,183
Can we quote you,
Congressman?

237
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,051
Shirley,
you may quote this:

238
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,120
I am going to get him.

239
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,826
JOHN: A Spanish version
of The Beatles-- wonderful.

240
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,961
( Laughter )

241
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,364
Une momento.

242
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,967
Las Beatles.

243
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,770
Ringo.
Really.

244
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,739
Pablo.
How ya doin'?

245
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,940
Hi.
Hi.

246
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,675
Juan.
Juan.

247
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,043
How are ya?

248
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,178
Jorge.
Jorge.

249
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,780
Ha ha ha ha!

250
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,682
Oh...

251
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,417
and I'm Mick Jagger.

252
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,989
Quieres tequila?
Nah.

253
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,400
( Woman laughing )

254
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,772
JOHN: Not while
I'm driving, thanks.

255
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,707
( Chuckling )

256
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,709
Good shit.

257
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,410
No. Thank you very much.

258
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,984
( Hooting and hollering )

259
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,757
Ohh...

260
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,191
Ohh...

261
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,128
Oh, thank you, God.

262
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,898
Oh, thank you, God.

263
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,133
I owe Ya.

264
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,771
You gave me
a whole hour to sleep.

265
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,441
Ohh! That's all I need,
I just need an hour.

266
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,245
( Birds singing )

267
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,222
Aaah!

268
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,793
( Chuckling )

269
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,160
Sorry.

270
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,063
You're fat.

271
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,868
My husband was fat.

272
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,970
He's dead now.

273
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,205
Ah.

274
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,544
You must eat
like a pig.

275
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,080
( Chuckles )

276
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,117
Pig...

277
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,823
Yeah, yeah...

278
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,927
Cigarettes'll kill ya.

279
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,194
Um-hmm.

280
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,296
My husband smoked,
y'know.

281
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,800
He died from
smoking too much.

282
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,236
I thought you said
he died 'cause he was fat.

283
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,874
He was fat with bad lungs.

284
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,108
WOMAN: Granny?

285
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,011
Granny!
Oh, hi!

286
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,048
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

287
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,883
My little girl!

288
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,952
I see
you've met John.

289
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,088
No, I don't believe
I have.

290
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,523
Oh, Granny,
this is my fianc,

291
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,092
John Bourgignon.

292
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,027
Oh!
How do you do?

293
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:18,331
Oh, what a handsome young man!

294
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:22,202
I hope you will both
be as happy

295
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,873
as your grandfather
and I were.

296
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,089
John!

297
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,356
Aaah!

298
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,859
Are you okay?
I'm--I'm sorry.

299
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,028
I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Reese, very sorry.

300
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,096
That's all right.

301
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,132
He's just been
real tired recently.

302
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,002
He's been working so hard.
He's just exhausted.

303
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,137
Where's Dad?

304
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,272
He's still on the phone,
talking to Washington.

305
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,142
You know how it is
in Washington.

306
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,912
I'm sorry I'm late, everyone.

307
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,646
I always say you can
call me anything,

308
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,348
but don't call me
late for dinner.

309
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,150
Ha ha ha ha!

310
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,585
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

311
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,021
Ha ha ha!
Ha--huh-huh--

312
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,956
Yeah.

313
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,058
Mother, it's good to see you!

314
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,226
You're looking
wonderful as ever.

315
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,593
Hi, honey.

316
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,896
Hello, baby.
Hello, Daddy.À

317
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,597
Hello, Mr. Reese.

318
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,667
Yeah.

319
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,271
Daddy, John and Chick's business
is really improving now.

320
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,174
You think that's
gonna make you enough money

321
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,176
to support my daughter,
driving a limousine?

322
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,145
Yes, sir, I do.

323
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,313
That and I also
supplement my income

324
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,349
by drumming part-time.

325
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,651
As a matter of fact,
I'll be performing tonight.

326
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,254
Wonderful.
You hang out in nightclubs.

327
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,922
No, sir.
It's not really
a nightclub.

328
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:51,091
How much money
do you make a year?

329
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,193
Wouldn't you rather
talk about this in private?

330
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,995
No.
( Buzzer )

331
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,931
I'll get it.
Who could be at the back door?

332
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,033
That'd be probably
my best man, Chick

333
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,301
and his date.

334
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,336
I invited him, Daddy.

335
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,239
I was saying, how much money
do you make in a year?

336
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,709
Oh, in a year...

337
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,313
I would say anywhere
from 30 to, um...

338
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,715
11,000 a year, sir.

339
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,250
But I invest very heavily
in stocks.

340
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,086
Stocks.
Oh, yes.

341
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,453
Who's your investor?

342
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,123
It's, um...
you wouldn't know him.

343
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,325
Really?
No.

344
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,328
What's that name?
I know a lot of small firms.

345
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,198
Oh, they're just,
they're new, almost.

346
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,235
And, uh, they go
by the name of, uh...

347
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:39,739
of, uh, Smith and Barney
and there's Andy and--

348
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,474
Aaah!

349
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,211
I'm very sorry.

350
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,213
You clumsy ox!

351
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,315
Do you see
what you did?!

352
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,482
He didn't mean
to break the chair.

353
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,251
He's too fat!

354
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,485
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,756
I'm very sorry
about the chair, sir.

356
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,026
A little Crazy Glue
will fix that right up.

357
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,995
Here's my friend Chick Leff now
and--and his date.

358
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,430
Hi, everybody.
Thanks for the invite.

359
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,433
Oh, this is Misty.
Hi.

360
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,401
Oh, soup.

361
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,071
Pretty fancy place here,
huh?

362
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,372
Yes, it looks great.

363
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:15,075
Uh, you have
a half hour left.

364
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,010
It's up to you if you
want to get off or not.

365
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,411
Ohh!

366
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,180
( Whispers )
Cool it.

367
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,549
GIRL:
Do you know how ridiculous
you people look?

368
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, hello, darling.
Patty's here now!

369
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,322
I hate you people.
I hate all of you.

370
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,091
She doesn't
mean this.

371
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,026
But your day
of reckoning
will come!

372
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,127
And when it does,

373
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,495
I hope you get
what you deserve!

374
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,135
That's my daughter Patty.
She's the youngest.

375
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,305
Probably just a phase
she's going through.

376
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,440
If you like,
I'll talk to her.
I'm more her age.

377
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,743
Jesus, I need a drink.
I gotta make a martini.

378
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,046
He's been under
a lot of strain lately.

379
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,814
That's all right,
Mrs. Reese.

380
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,317
Stress has been known
to turn people into
complete shitheads.

381
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,320
Not your husband,
per se, uh, but...

382
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,823
( Doorbell )
I'll get it.

383
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,459
Maybe the wedding
will help to...

384
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,128
bring everybody
closer together.

385
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,063
Oh, yeah?

386
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,132
Weddings are like that.

387
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,467
Mrs. REESE:
Misty, your pimp
is here to see you.

388
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,137
Uh-oh.

389
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,540
WOMAN:
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

390
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,243
Come on, ladies,
let's run.

391
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,512
Run, run,
run, run, run...

392
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:31,218
The new recruits
sure look good.

393
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,354
Sun Yi showed great foresight
setting us up here.

394
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,489
Mind control
by way of the body.

395
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,591
Such empty minds,

396
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,861
crying out
for fulfillment.

397
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,397
I'd like to fulfill
that one in the red.

398
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,569
LEADER: Be tough, be strong,
your body is your best friend...

399
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,505
I claim my divine right...

400
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,508
ALL:
I claim my divine right...

401
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,277
...to material stuff...

402
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,147
...to material stuff...

403
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,182
...before someone else does.

404
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,185
...before someone else does.

405
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,388
My body, my mind,
my money...

406
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:12,125
ALL: Sun Yi.

407
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,194
Sun...

408
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,829
Okay, okay, that's enough.
Let's get down to business.

409
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,531
Murray, you got
a cigarette?
Yeah, here.

410
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,233
Let me have the regional
financial report.

411
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,634
It's not great news.

412
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,271
I told you, we're gonna have
a lot of bad publicity

413
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,205
from the Reese interview.

414
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:28,375
Transmissions have been
very clear on this.

415
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,278
The obstacle must be removed.

416
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,414
Angela, initiate Plan A.

417
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,416
Yes, Your Holiness.

418
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,850
Plan A.

419
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,856
Get the big guy
in the green limousine.

420
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,242
CHICK: Hi, guys.

421
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,544
Cut the small talk,
you're late!

422
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,446
I've been playin' pocket pool
up there for 15 minutes!

423
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,580
I got a grand opening today!

424
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,382
Awright, awright.
Where to, Sal?

425
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,318
3rd and Elsmere.
Mr. Hound Dog.

426
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,452
The hot dog people?

427
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,254
Yeah, they want the boys
to walk around

428
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,622
wearing sandwich boards.

429
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,957
It's not a bad idea.
Did you talk to Reese?

430
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,926
No, sorry.
I haven't had a chance.

431
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,329
Would you talk to him, Johnny?
This is important to me.

432
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,563
Yeah, I will.

433
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,465
Could you drop me off
on the way?

434
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,634
Yes, I would mind, actually.
Would you drive?!

435
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,568
Awright!

436
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,713
( Drums play
disco beat )

437
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,519
* You stick by
yi-yi-yi-yi *

438
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,489
* By my love

439
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,924
* Oh, oh, oh, oh

440
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,362
* My love

441
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,963
Hey, John?

442
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,431
* Yeah

443
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,300
What would you think

444
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,303
if we put like
a flat gray on the wall

445
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:06,973
and then maybe a Chinese red
lacquer trim on the molding?

446
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,641
Do you think
that'd be good?

447
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,009
* Yeah, yeah

448
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,344
* Yeah

449
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,380
Yeah. I do, too.

450
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,316
* Yeah, by my love

451
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,387
* With my love

452
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,390
* By yi-yi-yi-yi

453
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,425
* By my love

454
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,759
What?

455
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,661
John, did you hear
anything I was saying?

456
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,398
No. I'm practicing.

457
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,966
C'mon, Nance,
I'm practicing.

458
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,635
Yeah, but you've been
practicing all day long.

459
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,304
I know. I'm bad.

460
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,471
What do you mean,
you're bad?

461
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,340
You're the greatest.

462
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,008
You're a great drummer.

463
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,377
You tell that
to the guys tonight.

464
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,546
I think it's amazing what you do
with all these things.

465
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,980
What you do with
your little foot there...

466
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,549
I know,
it is amazing.

467
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:51,451
What you do with these--

468
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,286
what do you call 'em,
drumstick things?

469
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,787
Drumstick things.
That's very good.

470
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,056
Why don't you show me
how to use 'em?

471
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,791
No, no, no.
This takes years--
C'mon.

472
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,560
It takes years
to play this.

473
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,794
Show me.

474
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,563
No, I can't.
I gotta get ready to go.

475
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,064
Tell you what--
put 'em in your hands.

476
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,699
Why don't you just
sit down and play.

477
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,468
Go nuts, all right?
Have fun.

478
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,303
I gotta get ready.

479
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,748
( Playing snappy beat )

480
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,598
Gimme those things!

481
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,032
Don't ever do that again!

482
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,434
Sheesh!

483
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,408
( Women talking
and laughing )

484
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:00,687
Excuse me.
I'm lookin' for
a guy named Skipper.

485
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,489
I'm a guy named Skipper.

486
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,625
Damion, take that tablecloth
off there, will ya?

487
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,427
It's all bloody,
it looks terrible!

488
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,697
And I want baby blue spots
in all those fixtures!

489
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,099
Now get to it!
I'm trying!

490
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,868
Yes?
I'm John Bourgignon
from the Musician's Union.

491
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:19,372
Well, you tell those people
to take me off that Unfair List!

492
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,741
It's unfair to me,
I didn't do a damn thing.

493
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,476
I don't know
anything about that.

494
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,711
I'm just a drummer.

495
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,879
Oh, thank God
you're here.

496
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,917
Here's the costume.
The dressing room
is right back there.

497
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,487
Damion, be a dear
and get me a cup of coffee.

498
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,922
I'm only
one person!

499
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,625
I'm sorry.
I can't wear this.

500
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,660
Look at the Gross
National Product.

501
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,662
Well, in times
of inflation--

502
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,464
We've gotta go back
to the Gold Standard.

503
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,471
( Lowers voice )
How ya doin'?

504
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,105
Hi, how are ya?

505
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,707
Yo.

506
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah.

507
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,884
( Excited screaming )

508
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,188
I don't know about this.

509
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,491
I've heard those ladies
can get pretty rough.

510
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,892
Come on, it's a job.

511
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,595
They're women--
what can happen?

512
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,565
( Disco music plays )

513
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,933
( Women screaming )

514
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,158
Aaaaah!

515
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,830
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

516
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,481
You leave her alone!

517
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,949
Come on, come on!

518
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,491
Will you guys
help me out?!

519
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,496
You big bully!
You big bully!

520
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,465
Oooh!

521
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,574
He can't do that!

522
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,523
( Siren blares )

523
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:07,006
JUDGE:
Since most of you gentlemen
are not strangers to this court,

524
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,710
you know exactly
what kind of behavior
I will tolerate.

525
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,813
Any breach of courtroom protocol

526
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,883
will receive
the maximum penalty.

527
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,851
Am I understood?

528
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,623
Okay, let's get this over with.

529
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,024
We'll start at this end.

530
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,661
Approach the bench
and state your case.

531
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:35,267
( Defendant
talking )

532
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,839
What are you
doing here?

533
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,041
I set fire
to my family.

534
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,313
( Chuckling )

535
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,984
Oh, Jesus,

536
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,120
he set fire
to his family.

537
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,988
Oh, my God!

538
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,991
How ya doin'?

539
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,728
I dunno. I don't think
I'm doin' too good.

540
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,029
Right. Right.

541
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,665
Listen, you got
any 'ludes?

542
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:06,899
What?

543
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,735
'Ludes.

544
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,770
Shut up.
There's a cop.

545
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,672
How about some reefer?

546
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,906
Just relax,
will ya?

547
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,008
Toot. Ya got
any toot?
Shh!

548
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,345
Listen, I'm freaked.

549
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm freakin' out,
I'm not gonna make it.

550
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,615
Get outta my pocket!

551
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,751
We're all freakin' out here.
Just relax, will ya?

552
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,819
Okay.
Get some control of yourself!

553
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:27,954
Think positive.
You'll be all right.

554
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,021
All right.

555
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,890
This guy over here,

556
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,760
he just set fire
to his entire family,
for God's sakes!

557
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,895
Just don't look at him.

558
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,631
You're gonna be fine.
Just relax, all right?

559
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,132
Right.

560
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,734
Be positive.
I'm right here
if you need me.

561
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,370
Easy.

562
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,739
Where did our
public defender go?

563
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,708
Right here, Your Honor.

564
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,776
Oh, my God!

565
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,143
Think positive.

566
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,679
You don't even
know the case!

567
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,913
I know the law.

568
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,015
Would you like to
consult with your client?

569
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,717
I would like
a change of venue.

570
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,886
Denied. Proceed.

571
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,754
I request
a summary dismissal.

572
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,956
Can you support
that motion?

573
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,825
Yes, indeed I can.

574
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:06,959
There are thousands
of criminals

575
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,929
roaming all over the streets
just as guilty as my client.

576
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,163
Why pick on him?

577
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:12,932
What the hell
are you saying?!

578
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,834
Motion denied.

579
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,103
Your Honor, I would very much
like to have another lawyer,

580
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,738
because this one
is not to my satisfaction--

581
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:20,139
Shh. Shh.

582
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,942
Your Honor, I would like you
to disqualify yourself.

583
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,811
On what grounds?

584
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,445
On the grounds that
you've got a bad attitude.

585
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,747
A bad attitude?!

586
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,082
Denied!
Counselor--

587
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:33,085
Okay. May we
approach the bench,
please?

588
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,055
Yes.

589
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,724
Don't blow this.

590
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,191
All right,
don't worry.

591
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,061
May we speak
off the record here?

592
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,964
The proceedings so far
are real depressing.

593
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,099
I wanted to ask you,
do you have a toot?

594
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,968
A 'lude? Reefer?
Anything?
What the--?!

595
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,837
You are out of order!
I'm out of order?

596
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,404
You'r out of order!

597
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,774
This whole court
is out of order!

598
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,109
Twenty days
in the County Jail
for contempt!

599
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,846
This is worse than Attica!
Attica, that's right!

600
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:02,214
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica!

601
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,183
Attica! Attica!
Order! Order!

602
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:07,153
Attica! Attica! Attica!

603
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,155
Order in the court!

604
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,732
I mean, I'm cool.

605
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,835
I mean, I'm outta here.

606
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,036
Yeah.

607
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,273
You see, I,
Muhammed Jerome Willy,

608
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,141
have a plan.

609
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,143
Yeah.

610
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,746
See, Muhammed ain't
goin' to the joint.

611
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,047
No.

612
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,983
I'm a three-time loser,
man.

613
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,219
I mean, I'm gonna
do some time for this one.

614
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,857
And I don't feel like
dyin' in jail.

615
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,759
Hmm.

616
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,962
You with me?

617
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,230
What?

618
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,165
Are you with me?

619
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,901
What do you mean?

620
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,870
We outta here.
You with me?

621
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,505
Oh, no.

622
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,174
You gotta be crazy.
I'm not goin' with you.

623
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,976
You go yourself.

624
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,545
You're a murderer,
I'm just a--

625
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,047
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean--

626
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,782
Ohh!

627
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,284
I make my move,
you best keep up.
You dig?

628
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,220
I dig very much, sir.

629
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,057
No, wait!
I changed my mind!

630
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,558
Please! I don't
wanna go with you!

631
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,127
I can't!
I'll never keep up!

632
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:24,096
( Sirens blare )

633
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,885
Let's go.

634
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,922
Oh, no. No. no...

635
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:51,924
Aaah!

636
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,895
( Dogs barking )

637
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,341
( Sirens continue )

638
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,027
WOMAN:
Who is it?

639
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:31,097
It's me, baby.
Open up.

640
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:34,901
Muhammed,
what are you doing here?

641
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,767
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

642
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,603
I'm here to see you.
You look good, baby.

643
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,138
How about a little sugar?
Never mind the sugar.

644
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,140
I don't have any time.
I'm running late.

645
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,042
Do you think
I could borrow
a hacksaw?

646
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,944
Who's the surfer?

647
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,145
I just want to
cut this off,
and I'm gone.

648
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,214
Later.
Sit down.
Ohhh!

649
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,648
Baby, you look good.

650
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,083
What are you
doing in handcuffs?!

651
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,319
I got busted.
It's a long story.

652
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,021
That's it.
Get out of my house.

653
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,923
I'm not harboring
escaped criminals.

654
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,290
Do you have
an acetylene torch
I could borrow?

655
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,292
Sit down!

656
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,661
Listen to how the woman talks
to the man that pays the rent.

657
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,430
In your dreams.

658
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,198
You never
paid my rent
in your life!

659
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,666
Well, look,
I was gone.

660
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,135
I just never
got around to it.

661
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,937
It looks good, baby.

662
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,306
Hey--what's this?

663
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,042
Nothing.

664
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,910
It looks like
a suitcase to me!

665
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,045
You don't want to know.
Don't get involved.

666
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,312
Hey, baby. Baby.

667
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,148
Now, where my baby goin'?

668
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,083
I got a date.

669
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,384
See?
It's just a date.

670
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,686
A date?
Looks more serious
than a date!

671
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,455
Looks more like
an overnight trip!

672
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:32,058
Who you been seein'
behind my back?

673
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,692
Look, it's probably
just a pajama party.

674
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,694
A bunch of girl
get together,

675
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,196
they play some records,
they have some popcorn.

676
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,666
Francine,
get out here, now!

677
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,035
I'll come out
when I feel like it!

678
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,370
Be gentle
with the woman.

679
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,005
Women like
when you're gentle.

680
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,273
I'm gentle, it worked
for me all the time.

681
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:48,207
I'm tellin' ya,
it--it--

682
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,644
I'll just
shut the fuck
right up.

683
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,281
I don't belong to you.
I don't belong to anyone.

684
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,715
And I advise you
to get out of here

685
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,350
before heÀgets here.

686
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,152
Oh, lady, please reconsider.

687
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,954
You could help us, you know.
Before who gets here?

688
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,422
Before he gets here.

689
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,091
Look, I want him
to get here.

690
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,725
Matter of fact,
I'm in the mood for a fight.

691
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,161
I'm not afraid of him,
you, you, nobody.

692
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,497
And no woman talks
to Muhammed Jerome Willy
the way you been doin',

693
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:13,299
and especially
not in front of company!

694
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,702
I'm not impressed
with your company!
Now get out of here!

695
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,471
No woman, nobody
tells me to get out!

696
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,173
I'm tellin' ya
to get out!

697
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,513
I wish I could
take that back,

698
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,981
I didn't mean to say it.

699
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,682
I'm sorry I yelled.

700
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,085
What I wanted to say
was just...

701
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,486
that maybe we could all
sit down like adults

702
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,522
and just talk.

703
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,257
I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry for yelling.

704
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:39,491
Fine.

705
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,427
Let's sit down
like adults.

706
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,095
Let's just
sit down. Fine.

707
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,265
Ah.

708
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,068
You're nothin'
but a goddamn lazy
no-good fool!

709
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,003
And you're nothin'
but a two-timin' bitch!

710
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,173
You're nothin' but trouble.
I hope they hang your ass!

711
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,008
Good, 'cause that's
just what they're gonna do!

712
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,177
Doesn't that
feel better now?

713
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,411
Huh?

714
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,081
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

715
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:05,184
We break out,
runnin' and hidin'
from the police,

716
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,019
come all the way over here
to see you...

717
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,155
Only reason we came over anyway
was to say goodbye.

718
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:13,225
That's why you came over?
To say goodbye?

719
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,194
You mean in the midst
of all that trouble

720
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,428
you came over to see me?

721
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,297
That's right.

722
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,199
But that's okay
because I'm ready
to face the heat.

723
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,168
I know the police are out there
with their machine guns

724
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,403
and helicopters,
and we gonna get blown away.

725
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,438
But that's all right too,
'cause we ready to die.

726
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,240
No we're not.

727
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,209
But at least I got a chance
to behold my baby's face

728
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,311
one last time.

729
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,213
Oh...

730
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,117
Listen to this here.

731
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,554
Muhammed,
don't go.

732
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,190
Say "please."

733
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,324
Please.

734
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,259
Please.

735
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:51,063
Oh, baby, I love
the way you say "please."

736
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:52,398
That was
a great "please."

737
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,266
You're so good
to Muhammed.

738
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,434
Oh...

739
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:58,504
did my big Muhammed
miss me?

740
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,472
Oh, baby,
Muhammed missed you.

741
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,075
How much did he miss me?

742
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,344
I missed the smell
of your hair,

743
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,812
the taste of your neck...

744
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,547
Don't waste it.

745
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,249
Ohh!

746
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:13,185
Oh, no. Hey, man,
you got to go.
ÀWhy?

747
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,620
Now.
Ah, don't.

748
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,355
Out. Bye.
Ah, come on.

749
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,424
Thank you.

750
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,392
Let's jump to it, baby.

751
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,495
About how long?

752
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,264
Not long, man--
get outta here!

753
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,249
MUHAMMED:
Oh, baby. Oh, baby!

754
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,816
Unh! Unh!

755
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,219
Yes! Unh!

756
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,122
FRANCINE:
Oh, it's been so long...

757
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,858
( Both moaning )

758
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,535
( Banging against door )

759
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,571
FRANCINE:
Oh, Muhammed,
you thrill me!

760
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:08,640
More! More! More!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

761
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,914
You're so good,
you're so good....

762
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,349
Oh, baby...

763
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,887
( Panting )

764
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,929
Can I give you
a hand there?
Would ya?

765
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,199
Just hold this
while I open the door.

766
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,669
( Muhammed and Francine
moaning and yelling )

767
00:35:57,423 --> 00:35:58,457
Thanks.

768
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,392
Yeah, sure.

769
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,663
Push! Push! Push!
Push! Push! Push!

770
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,698
Push! Push!

771
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,900
Baby!!!!!!!
Aaaaaaahhhh!

772
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,472
Oh, you're the king!
You're the king!

773
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,507
Ohh! Ohh!

774
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,311
Muhammed?

775
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,348
Muhammed?

776
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,683
Aaaaaah!
Oh, my God!
What's wrong?

777
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,618
He's dead!
ÀWhat?

778
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:27,719
He's dead!
Oh, my God, he's dead!

779
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,488
He's what?

780
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:32,258
Dead! Aaaaah!!!!

781
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,654
Chick. Yeah, it's me, John.

782
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,456
I'm in a little bit
of trouble here.

783
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,259
I wonder if you could
come down here real quickly.

784
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,462
Yeah, I'm at, uh...

785
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,700
Okay, boys, last call.

786
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,436
I'll have
another draft,
please.

787
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:20,539
And, uh, another screwdriver
for my friend.

788
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,441
What's the matter
with your friend?

789
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:25,411
Ah, just--
just still meditating.

790
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,546
He looks
drunk as a skunk
to me.

791
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,980
Yeah.

792
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,453
I just hope
rigor mortis
doesn't set in.

793
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,455
Whoa! Hey!

794
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:39,024
Muhammed Jerome Willy!

795
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,059
My man, look out!

796
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,296
What's happenin',
blood? Huh?

797
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:46,732
Hey, man, it's me,
Wallace Jefferson,

798
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,534
you remember me.

799
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,502
Draft beer for you

800
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,739
and a screwdriver
for Mr. Personality.

801
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,541
Hey, man,

802
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,576
you remember
Maurice Walker,
the car thief?

803
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,611
Ha ha ha! He's dead!

804
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,414
Yeah, his old lady threw him
down an elevator shaft.

805
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,815
Musta happened three,
four years ago...

806
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,751
Chick! Where
in the hell were you?!
What's up?

807
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,454
( Continues talking )

808
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:11,056
This guy next to me
is dead.
He's what?!

809
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,492
He's dead!
Who's the other guy?

810
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,395
I don't know.
Did you bring it?
Yeah.

811
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,797
Just cut--
cut this off.

812
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,567
So how you been,
Muhammed?

813
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,336
You was always the--
This cat's always
the life of party.

814
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,338
Really? Funny
you say that.

815
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,574
Oh, yeah. You can
always depend on Muhammed.

816
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,076
This is my main man.
You in good company, Jack.

817
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,745
Ha ha! We were just
talkin' about ya.

818
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,747
You have mellowed out
a lot, man.

819
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,349
That's good, brother,
that's good.

820
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,617
Same thing with me, too.

821
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,852
Are you still
with Francine? Huh?

822
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,622
I been meanin'
to talk to you about that.

823
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,624
That's a heckuva woman
you got there.

824
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,626
Personally, I never thought
you had the energy for her.

825
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,628
But I can see
you done mellowed out now.

826
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,564
You're cool,
and that's good, brother,

827
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,534
because we get older,
we gotta start thinking
about our future, man.

828
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,568
You know?

829
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,638
What you
lookin' at, bro?

830
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,072
I'll tell you
all about it later.

831
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,140
I just want
to get out of here.

832
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,509
I feel kind of funny

833
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,477
just leaving him
sit there like that.

834
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,579
Well, at least
he's with his friend.

835
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,448
By the way,
Nancy set up a meeting

836
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,383
between Ed Reese and Sal
for tomorrow.

837
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,385
I can't make it,
I'm exhausted.

838
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,920
You gotta cover for me.

839
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,389
Awright, get some rest.
I'll cover for you.

840
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,491
Pal, I owe you
for this.

841
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,568
SAL: N ice tits,
huh, Congressman?

842
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:33,505
I'm sorry, I meant
to say breasts.

843
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,742
That was very crass,
I'm sorry.

844
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,677
NANCY: Y our wife was
a very beautiful woman,

845
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:40,579
Mr. DiPasquale.

846
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,913
Yes, she was, Nancy.

847
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,915
She certainly was.

848
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,717
See, she--

849
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,619
She wanted to be
an actress.

850
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,589
I was a very important
film director at that time--

851
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,924
a very important,
prominent movie director--

852
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,927
and she was using me
to get to the top.

853
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,663
And that...

854
00:39:57,663 --> 00:40:01,533
that hurt me very,
very deeply.

855
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,835
Let's get this thing
started, shall we?

856
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:06,171
I have other things
on my agenda this evening.

857
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,739
I'm sure you do,
Congressman.

858
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,841
I mean, what with
runnin' for president and all.

859
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,444
Please have a seat.
Nancy?

860
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:14,713
Aprs vous,
as they say in Paris.

861
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,683
I'll get some champagne,

862
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:19,585
because...

863
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,755
...I wanna propose
a toast.

864
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,925
Oh, thank you.
Okay.

865
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:33,632
To a very
successful campaign...

866
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:36,702
and an equally
successful marriage.

867
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:43,842
That's warm!

868
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,611
I just picked it up,

869
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,479
I didn't have
a chance to chill it.

870
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,214
It's not bad.
I think it's French.

871
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:52,017
I hope you understand,
Mr. DiPasquale,

872
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:56,021
I like the idea of capturing
my daughter's wedding on film.

873
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,790
I think the American public
would enjoy seeing

874
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,793
the daughter of
a prominent politician

875
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,763
marry an ordinary,
hard-working American boy.

876
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,766
But I'm not at all
acquainted with your work,

877
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,267
and on first impression,

878
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,837
I'm not at all impressed
by your lifestyle

879
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,605
or your character.

880
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,542
Hmm.

881
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,243
NANCY:
Why don't we just
take a look

882
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,546
at Mr. DiPasquale's film,
Daddy?

883
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:23,615
That's a wonderful idea,
Congressman.

884
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:24,916
Why don't we
look at the film?

885
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,685
Chick?

886
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,654
Huh? Oh.

887
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,723
'Cause I think
my work speaks
for itself.

888
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,992
Get the lights
while you're back there,
Chick.

889
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:42,668
*

890
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,536
Kee-yah!

891
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,876
Kung Fu U.!!!

892
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,980
This was
a very difficult film
to put together.

893
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,048
Hey, young fella.
Listen--

894
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,818
Why don't you try out
some of our other facilities?

895
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,953
We've got a lot
of facilities here,

896
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,855
like, well,
the Athletic Department.

897
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,024
And there's
a wonderful library.
Yes, I know.

898
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,859
Why don't you
check them out
when you get a chance?

899
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,861
I'll do that.
Now just beat it.

900
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,297
Thank you very much.
See you tonight.

901
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:15,667
So the Korean said, "Lice?
I thought you meant rice!"

902
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,803
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

903
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:19,905
Ohh! Oh, that's funny.

904
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,277
( clatter )

905
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,296
Hey, you, freshman!
Go get me some food!

906
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,998
Snap to it!

907
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,634
Chou.

908
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,143
That scene there
was critically acclaimed

909
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,845
in papers
across this country.

910
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:01,713
The reviewers ate it up.

911
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,915
We must teach them a lesson.

912
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,985
Seduce her!

913
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:09,888
Can't you read the sign?
No seducing in the cafeteria!

914
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:12,624
A-ha ha ha ha ha!

915
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:13,925
Now you'll pay the piper!

916
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,832
( Kung fu screams )

917
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:31,977
Me-me-me-me-me-me!

918
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,082
It was very big
in France.

919
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,128
Okay...

920
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,997
All rightie...

921
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,935
Now I gotcha!

922
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,837
And up! And together!

923
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,405
And one and two
and one and--

924
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,007
Take that!

925
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:05,076
There you go!
Goin' south!

926
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,678
All right, you--

927
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,680
You wanna play rough, huh?

928
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,448
Take that!
And that! And that!

929
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:11,683
Okay! Hunh! Hunh! Hunh!

930
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,084
REESE:
I've seen enough.

931
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,854
I thought that's all
it would take.

932
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,825
Nancy, honey,

933
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,893
will you wait for me
down in the limousine?

934
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,796
Let me talk
a little business
to Mr. DiPasquale.

935
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,765
That's a good idea,
Congressman.

936
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,099
I won't be long, baby.

937
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,201
Take him with you,
will ya?

938
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:32,070
Nice meetin' you, Nancy.

939
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,005
Chick, go on.

940
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,410
So, uh, Congressman,
where should we start here?

941
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,213
I have some marvelous ideas
about the procession itself,

942
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,849
but if you wanna talk money,

943
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,116
then maybe
we should talk budget.

944
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:46,852
I wouldn't give you
a wooden nickel

945
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:48,987
to film my daughter's wedding.

946
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,422
I think this whole
wedding idea

947
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,424
is a very bum idea.

948
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:57,128
I--I'm sorry
to hear ya say that,
Congressman.

949
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,765
I didn't really
wanna have to do this,

950
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:01,867
but, you know, I gotta--

951
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,836
Have you ever heard
of the Del Marino Motel?

952
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,073
What are you
talking about?

953
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,008
Well, it might
be coincidental,

954
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,978
but I got a property...

955
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:16,514
...and, uh, it seems
to have your name on it.

956
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:19,184
Unless, of course,
there's a different Ed Reese.

957
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:22,187
I thought you might
wanna take a look at it.

958
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,907
( Dogs barking )

959
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,978
CHICK: Calling Limo One.

960
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:50,115
This is Dispatch.
Come in, Limo One.

961
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:53,785
JOHN:
Yeah, this is Limo One.
We only got one limo.

962
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:57,022
Whaddya want, Chick?

963
00:45:57,022 --> 00:46:00,491
Don't forget to
get over to the
aerobics clinic tonight.

964
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,193
That lady asked for you
specifically.

965
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,329
Yeah, all right.

966
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,064
I'm gonna go to Mom's
and grab a burger.

967
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:07,966
Haven't been there
in years.

968
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,035
I've had a craving
for burgers all day.

969
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:12,303
A nice, quiet meal
at Mom's.

970
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:15,240
( Clank )

971
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,938
Ohh! Ha ha!

972
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:48,874
What are you doing
to my head, sir?

973
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:50,241
I will pay for this,

974
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,310
I will pay for any inconvenience
or damage done to you.

975
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,154
( Rock music blares )

976
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,194
( Music stops )

977
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:46,097
What happened
to the music?!

978
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,299
Music!
Come on!

979
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:53,038
I don't like
purple-headed faggots
jumpin' up and down.

980
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:56,641
Hey, why don't you
just leave us alone?

981
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:59,410
What are you supposed to be,
a rooster or somethin'?

982
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,279
Gentlemen, please!
Ladies!

983
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,148
Come on!

984
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,350
Have we forgotten
our own youth?

985
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,953
You don't remember
the '60s?

986
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:10,055
How rebellious
our music was?

987
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,990
Have you forgotten
acid rock?

988
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,059
Jimi Hendrix!
Woodstock!

989
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,427
And as far as the hair goes,

990
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,330
didn't our own long hair
turn a few heads?

991
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,200
Really. Y'know,
we should appreciate

992
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,702
another generation's
cultural movement!

993
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,637
( Spits )
Fuck you,
hippie!

994
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:32,077
Fuck you, hippie?

995
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,081
Fuck you, hippie...

996
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,184
You know, I would accept that
from anyone else but you,

997
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:41,052
you fucking rooster-head.

998
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,253
( Spits )

999
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,955
Ohh.

1000
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:47,092
I expect that from you...

1001
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:49,127
but you owe me
an apology!

1002
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,297
He's right.

1003
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:57,202
CROWD: "S"...

1004
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,503
"O"...

1005
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:00,105

"Y."

1008
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:07,512
S-o-r-r-y.
"Sorry.

1009
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:10,415
"Period.

1010
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,117
The end."

1011
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,122
Huh-huh-huh-huh....

1012
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,257
You know what?

1013
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,993
We've got a failure
to communicate.

1014
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:23,728
That's what it is.

1015
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:28,066
Now, I could stay here
all day long,

1016
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:30,268
and I could take
each one of you on,
one at a time.

1017
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,337
But I'm not going to.

1018
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:36,041
I'm going to leave you
with one thought...

1019
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,709
..this simple message.

1020
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:44,282
I still believe in it,
because this is right.

1021
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,551
I love all of you...

1022
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:49,020
my brothers and sisters.

1023
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,189
Peace.

1024
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,260
I'm leaving.

1025
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,128
Peace.

1026
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,471
Hey, bowling ball.

1027
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,284

Higher, higher,

1029
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:04,095
lift and reach, reach,

1030
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:06,097
reach for you
and reach for me,

1031
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:07,798
reach for money
and success,

1032
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,500
and reach!

1034
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:15,240
Reach...

1035
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,242
good. Here comes our boy.

1036
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:18,576
Set everything up.

1037
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,446
This could prove
to be very interesting.

John: Excuse me--

1039
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,559
Excuse me,
sorry to bother ya.

Hi. Excuse me.
Did you order--

Ooh. I'm, uh...

i'll wait here.

00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,620
Ha! Sorry.

1050
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,190
I got the limousine
right out front.

1051
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,857
I'm a little early,
i'm very sorry.

1052
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,593
Whenever you're ready,
right out front.

1053
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:10,261
Come in for a second.

1054
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,396
Come in?

1055
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,503
This is our driver.

1056
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,939
Hi. John bourgignon.

1057
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,908
Bruno. Hi.
Pleased to meet ya.

1058
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:25,310
I'm clarence.

1059
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,212
Clarence.
How are ya?
Nice to meet you.

1060
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:28,546
So, where we goin'
this evening?

1061
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,617
Where are we going
this evening?

1062
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:35,586
Where?
We're going out.

1063
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:38,189
We'll tell you
on the way there.

1064
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,690
How about
a drink, john?

1065
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,526
Not for me, thanks.
I'm driving.

1066
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:45,296
We insist. Just one drink
before we start our evening.

1067
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,198
I really can't.
It's company policy.

1068
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,334
Oh, please, john,
you must have one.

1069
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,502
I can't break
that company policy.

1070
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,504
Go ahead,
break it.

1071
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,906
Cheers.

1072
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,508
Cheers.

1073
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,510
Bad luck if you
don't all clink.

1074
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:03,414
Ah.

1075
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:07,585
We'll have ours later.
I see.

1076
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:09,687
Does it come
in that bottle?

1077
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,422
I'd like to get
the name of that.

1078
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,224
I'm havin' a little party
later on.

1079
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,692
How are you feeling?

1080
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,694
Me? I--

1081
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,665
I don't feel
very good.

1082
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:22,367
Why don't you
sit down, john?

1083
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,634
Thank you, I will.

1084
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,237
I kinda gulped it
a little fast there.

1085
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:27,938
I shouldn't do that.

1086
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,241
I've done that
since I was a kid,

1087
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,642
i have this bad habit.

1088
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,344
Ohh...

1089
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:35,446
ohh.

1090
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:38,015
Just relax, john.

1091
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:39,617
All right.

1092
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:44,021
Look at the girls
lovely, long-Limbed bodies.

1093
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:49,960
John, someone wants to
take the bodies away.

1094
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,497
No! You gotta be kidding!
Those bodies?

1095
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:54,399
Not a chance.

1096
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,534
He is in our power.

1097
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:58,403
Show me something.

1098
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,405
Is this a dream,
john?

1099
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:02,307
I don't know.

1100
00:54:02,307 --> 00:54:04,475
I am the only one
on this planet,

1101
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,278
the only one
in the universe.

1102
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:09,414
I am your world,
john.

1103
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,516
Okay, i'll buy that.

1104
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:13,751
You'd do anything
for me, wouldn't you?

1105
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,420
Yeah, sure.

1106
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,788
Even kill your
future father-In-Law.

1107
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,490
Okay. Why not?

1108
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,426
Bark like a dog.

1109
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,993
Arf! Arf!

1110
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,463
Thank you, john,
that won't be necessary.

1111
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:27,598
Very good dog, though.
Continue.

1112
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,568
Tomorrow you'll be going
to your wedding rehearsal.

1113
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:32,470
At a certain point

1114
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,804
someone will
come up to you

1115
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,806
with a playing card.

1116
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:40,445
That card will be
the five of spades.

1117
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,581
John, do you see this man?

1118
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:45,383
Yes.

1119
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,585
This man wants to
take away the bodies.

1120
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,854
When you see this card,

1121
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:52,757
you will kill
this man.

1122
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:55,426
Grrr...

1123
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,463
arf! Arf!

1124
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:00,665
Arf! Arf!
Heel. Heel!

1125
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:03,100
See what you did?
Idiot!

1126
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,036
Arf! Arf!
Sit! Sit!

1127
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:10,875
Mambo! Yeah!

1128
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,443
Sun yi:
What's this?!

1129
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:13,878
That's not a killer,
that's a schmuck!

1130
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,646
Angela:
Something has gone wrong.

1131
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,683
The hypnosis has magnified
his most juvenile traits.

1132
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:21,352
Well, is he gonna
kill reese or not?

1133
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:24,422
We won't know until he sees
the five of spades again.

1134
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,726
( church bell ringing )

1135
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,067
That irresponsible bastard.
I'm gonna kill him!

1136
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,570
Please, mr. Reese.
This is a house of worship.

1137
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,706
Oh, for god's sake.
Where is he?

1138
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,375
What's the real story,
you little weasel?

1139
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,677
I'm sure he had
a late fare.

1140
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,113
You don't realize
how hard he's been working.

1141
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:56,787
There he is now!
Hi, sweetheart.

1142
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,657
Where have you been?
I overslept.

1143
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,492
Now, let me
get this straight.

1144
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,494
Patty shows him
the five of spades.

1145
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:06,130
And he either
turns into a killer
or a schmuck.

1146
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,533
Why don't we all
assume our positions?

1147
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,401
Has anyone seen patty?

1148
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,902
I'll go find her.

1149
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,538
Thanks, john.

1150
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,809
Patty, what are you
doing here? Come on.

1151
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,445
John, would you sit down?

1152
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:21,579
They're waitin'
out there.

1153
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,913
Sit down!

1154
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,715
Ohh! What is it?

1155
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,917
I have something
that I have to show you.

1156
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,421
It's very important
that you see this.

1157
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,690
It's a matter
of life and death.

1158
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,124
What is it?

1159
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,435
MINISTER: Okay,

1160
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:47,204
we'll start off with
"Dearly beloved" and all that,

1161
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,840
then we'll move
straight into the personal vows

1162
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,710
that Nancy and John
have written for themselves.

1163
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,513
Would you care to read those
so I'll know what to expect?

1164
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:00,150
"I, Nancy,

1165
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,952
"take thee, John,

1166
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,955
"in soul and body,
Hmm...

1167
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,658
"and offer all my love to thee

1168
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,995
as our separate lives
merge into one."

1169
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,229
Lovely.

1170
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,664
Wait, I'm not
quite done yet.

1171
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:15,933
"With this ring,

1172
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,470
"a circle of
our precious love,

1173
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,539
I thee wed."

1174
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,008
Is that it?

1175
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:27,545
Yes. And then John
says his vows.

1176
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,547
John?

1177
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,916
Huaaaah!
Let's consummate
the marriage now!

1178
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,785
Dive! Dive!
Bbbbrrh! Bbbbrrh!

1179
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,489
Yeah! It's hickey time!

1180
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,659
He's acting like a schmuck!
He's not gonna kill anybody.

1181
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,661
No, he's not.
He'll have to
be reprogrammed.

1182
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:44,895
What's he gonna do?

1183
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:45,963
There's no telling
what he'll do.

1184
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,965
Ha ha ha ha!

1185
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,735
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1186
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:52,770
A little decorum, please!

1187
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,905
Did you say decorum?

1188
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:57,642
Did you say decorum?

1189
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:00,578
That big word coming out
of this little cute mouth--

1190
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:01,746
Say "decorum" again.

1191
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:04,515
Decorum! Decorum!

1192
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:05,983
I'm gonna put you up
on the mantel.

1193
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,686
You sit right there.
I wanna talk to everybody.

1194
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,588
Mom, Dad, Grandma,

1195
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:13,824
Patty, Nancy--I'd like
to talk about my dick!

1196
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,526
John, what are you doing?

1197
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,995
It's about this wide.
( Gasps )

1198
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:21,832
I'm gonna kill him!
Who's "Dick"?!

1199
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,535
JOHN:
Like I keep tellin' ya,
I don't know.

1200
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:26,003
I draw a blank.
I can't remember anything.

1201
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,838
What did I say
to that minister?

1202
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,907
You looked him
right in the eye
and said, "She's sexy."

1203
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,676
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna kill myself.

1204
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:35,613
Now, look,
this psychiatrist
we're going to is great.

1205
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,682
In fact, he's the one
that cured Sal.

1206
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:42,587
I gonna kill myself.

1207
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,589
Looks like
a mushroom.

1208
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:45,956
MAN: You must have some fear.

1209
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,058
that's unspoken.

1210
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,827
You must have some dream,
a recurrent nightmare...

1211
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,629
What haunts you?

1212
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,698
A dream--

1213
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,834
I got a dream that comes
almost every night or...

1214
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,335
every other night.

1215
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:00,104
All right,
tell me about that.

1216
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:04,308
Well, I don't know,
it's a little embarrassing.

1217
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,577
Y'know, it's one of
those dreams

1218
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:08,278
you don't want
to talk about.

1219
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,315
You can trust me,
I'm a professional.

1220
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:12,850
Yeah...

1221
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,652
Come on.

1222
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,320
All right,
what the hell.

1223
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:20,124
Well, I...

1224
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,793
It always starts
on this desert island,

1225
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:28,666
and there's this
beautiful girl there...

1226
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,769
I must admit, I am
kinda sexy in this dream.

1227
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:34,338
Did you ever see
that mov The Blue Lagoon?

1228
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:36,674
Well, it's kinda like that,
I guess.

1229
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,876
I'm on this island
with this beautiful girl.

1230
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,745
I don't know
how she got there,

1231
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,113
but you can do
whatever you want
in a dream, right?

1232
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,349
I really, I think,
turn her on a lot.

1233
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:48,052
But I'm not into that, y'know?

1234
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,787
No--she wants games,
all the time.

1235
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:55,125
She keeps on eating fruit
in front of me

1236
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,927
to show me that she's horny.

1237
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,163
Now, this drives me crazy.

1238
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:02,099
But no--ha ha!--
I don't bite.

1239
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,137
We meet at our palace--

1240
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:09,640
this palace that I built
on the beach.

1241
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,109
And I know that
this is the night--

1242
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,080
that it's got to be
the big confrontation.

1243
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,048
She wants it...

1244
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,919
She's like a nymphomaniac
in heat, if that's possible.

1245
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,021
That's the way she is.

1246
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,657
I can't do it--
I just can't do it with her.

1247
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:29,026
No matter how much I want to,
I can't--

1248
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:32,362
I gotta say no to he,
and it drives her crazy.

1249
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,131
She's begging me,
she keeps begging me.

1250
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,066
But I won't allow it.

1251
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,838
She keeps pounding
on the door,
driving me crazy.

1252
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:43,073
It's like a bad nightmare!

1253
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,943
At this point
I want to wake up
and I just can't!

1254
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,211
"More! More! More!"
she screams...

1255
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:51,081
More, I need you.
I want you"

1256
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,819
But I can't so I go off
to be alone with my thoughts.

1257
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,086
I'm alone, I'm alone,
I'm alone,

1258
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,855
I'm alone, alone, alone...

1259
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:02,793
( Continues )

1260
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:05,830
Then I look up,
and I'm not alone anymore

1261
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,198
and it's like the cast
and crew
of The Love Boat

1262
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,700
all lookin' down,
laughin' at me!

1263
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,802
They're pointing and laughing,

1264
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:13,704
and I'm standing there alone,
just...

1265
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:16,406
holding that one
little thought in my hand.

1266
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,478
Aaah, I'm so embarrassed,
but I smile,

1267
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,848
and I can't do anything!

1268
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,883
And they're still laughing!
Oh, it's disgusting!

1269
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,088
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

1270
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,422
Oh, that's funny!
Ha ha ha ha!

1271
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:36,260
Ha ha ha ha!
What's his problem?

1272
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,962
Oh, that's great.
Thanks a lot.

1273
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:39,163
Thank you.

1274
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,131
Thank you very much.
That's wonderful.

1275
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,500
What do you
make of that,
Doctor?

1276
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,036
Well, if you want
my professional opinion,

1277
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,139
I think someone
has altered his mind.

1278
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:51,742
Altered his mind?
Why do you think that?

1279
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:54,879
Well, his fear fantasy
is too vivid.

1280
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:56,814
I don't trust that.

1281
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:59,016
See, I think you've
been put under

1282
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:01,919
some sort of
post-hypnotic suggestion.

1283
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:06,256
Like, you know,
the Amazing Kreskin?

1284
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:08,793
No, it's not as simple
as just memorizing

1285
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,828
a few names from
the Tonight Show audience.

1286
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:12,162
I think your friend

1287
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,264
has been put under
an actual spell.

1288
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,166
There's only one way
to cure that.

1289
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,102
What's that?

1290
01:02:18,102 --> 01:02:20,905
To drop him on his head.
Drop me on my--

1291
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,840
Aaaaah!!!

1292
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:27,177
I'm gonna drop you!

1293
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,046
Doc, what are you doing?

1294
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:31,281
This is scare therapy.
It's like curing the hiccups.

1295
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,984
You see that Pinto?
That's my target.

1296
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:35,853
Is this gonna work?

1297
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:38,789
I don't know,
but I bet the spell is gone.

1298
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,190
So how do you feel--
nice and refreshed?

1299
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,092
I feel all right.
Good, good.

1300
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,861
Now, you talked to her--
what did she say?

1301
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,129
Yeah. I talked to her
while you were in the shower.

1302
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,197
She said she was
willing to meet you
here at the restaurant.

1303
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,233
That's it?
What else?

1304
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,335
Look, you're lucky
you got that much out of her.

1305
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:53,303
Now, what are you
gonna say to her?

1306
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,972
I'm gonna
take your advice.

1307
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,974
I'm gonna sit her down,
look her right in the eyes,

1308
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,976
and lie my ass off.

1309
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:00,277
Always works, Johnny.

1310
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,883
There she is.

1311
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:07,284
All right,
let's go.

1312
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,086
No, she looks pissed.
I'm gonna have a drink.

1313
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:10,187
Me, too.
I'll have--

1314
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:12,089
Get over there!

1315
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,024
Why, Nance!

1316
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,225
( Chuckling )

1317
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,894
Mind if I sit here?

1318
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:19,930
Thank you.

1319
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,234
So...

1320
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:26,603
so...

1321
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:29,840
I have never
been so embarrassed
in my entire life.

1322
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,210
Well, why don't we leave?
We don't have to stay here.

1323
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,845
You don't like it?
I don't like it, either.

1324
01:03:34,845 --> 01:03:36,180
I don't even know
why I'm bothering

1325
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,882
to stay here
and talk to you.

1326
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:40,017
Hey, gimme a break,
will ya? Let me explain.

1327
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:41,852
Give me a chance.

1328
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:43,220
Five minutes,
that's all I want.

1329
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,955
All right?
Um-hmm.

1330
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,924
Okay.

1331
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,026
You see...

1332
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:52,196
I--I think I've really--

1333
01:03:52,196 --> 01:03:55,199
I don't have any control
over myself anymore.

1334
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,602
Ho! You can say that again!

1335
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,138
My father wants
to kill you, John.

1336
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,273
Sure.
You're frightening!

1337
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:05,142
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1338
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:08,145
Neither do I.
Neither do I, Nancy,

1339
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,214
and that's why I went
to a psychiatrist.

1340
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,082
You did?

1341
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:13,383
I didn't want
to tell you,

1342
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,119
but yes, I went to
a psychiatrist.

1343
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,321
What did he say?

1344
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:20,257
What did he--
he said that...

1345
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,326
I'm, uh...

1346
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:24,061
I developed
a brain virus.

1347
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,432
You mean, you're sick?

1348
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,400
Crazy kind of sick, or...?

1349
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,071
It's more along the lines
of a 24-hour brain virus,

1350
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,406
something that can
affect your brain.

1351
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,408
Much the same--

1352
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,045
much like diarrhea
of the brain,

1353
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:43,680
in that the gray matter
kind of runs a little bit

1354
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,983
and mixes with the other.

1355
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:47,918
It's just a passing thing

1356
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,987
that he said that
if I got a lot rest

1357
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:52,022
and took a lot
of vitamin C--

1358
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:55,125
which I thought strange,
but vitamin C is very good--

1359
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,695
and the love of a good woman--
and those were his exact words.

1360
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:02,199
I know it sounds like
a John Wayne movie, but that's--

1361
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,968
the love of a good woman.

1362
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:06,370
What do we do now?

1363
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,339
Well, I guess
we could get married,
but I--

1364
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,709
would like to, but I know
you wouldn't want to do it.

1365
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:15,379
Who says I wouldn't
want to do it?

1366
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,082
Oh, come on, don't--
let's just drop it.

1367
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:20,117
Don't grovel.

1368
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:21,952
Well, I gave it a shot,
I gave it a very good shot.

1369
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:24,221
It worked.
Where did I get you?

1370
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,390
The virus? I was reachin'.
Thank you.

1371
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:39,236
Oh, yeah, I'm in love!

1372
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,371
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la!

1373
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:44,141
Ooh, you have a very nice ass!

1374
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,743
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I'm gonna bite it!

1375
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:48,478
John, what are you doing?!

1376
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,747
Don't do this to me,
John.

1377
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:52,682
I'm not gonna
do this to you.

1378
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,751
You relax me, baby.

1379
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:57,454
You soothe my soul,
my savage soul.

1380
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:00,090
What we have between us
is special.

1381
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,493
It's magic...
it's big magic.

1382
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:06,396
It's showtime! Yeah!

1383
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,465
All right, showtime,
ladies and gentlemen!

1384
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,634
Don't!

1385
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,338
Did you think
I was gonna do that?

1386
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:16,273
Ha ha ha ha!

1387
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:18,042
Let's mambo!

1388
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,244
* Dun-dun-dun,
dun-dun-dun-dun-dun *

1389
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,512
( Singing and yelling )

1390
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,781
John! Are you all right?

1391
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,416
I'm fine.
Take a bow!

1392
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,218
Oooh!
Ha ha ha ha!

1393
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:31,155
Yeah, I'm an ass,
and I'm lovin' it!

1394
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,490
* Brazil...

1395
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,525
Hey, let's mambo!
Thank you very much.

1396
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,294
Okay, fellas, take five.

1397
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:39,529
Can we have
a little light here, please?

1398
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,131
Thank you very much.

1399
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,434
Oh, that feels nice.

1400
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,303
Doesn't that feel nice?

1401
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,805
It's incredible
what light will do to ya,

1402
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:51,075
it just changes
the whole mood.

1403
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:53,210
I feel like singin'...
I feel like singin'.

1404
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,811
I hope you folks
don't mind.

1405
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:57,447
This next song
is dedicated...

1406
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:00,217
well, to you, honey,
my fiance.

1407
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,086
She's wonderful.

1408
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:04,321
This is her right here.
The one with the blue eyes

1409
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:06,323
and the soft blond hair.

1410
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:07,824
A wonderful lady.

1411
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:10,227
The greatest lady in bed
you'll ever wanna meet.

1412
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,262
She's amazing, I mean...

1413
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,331
I mean this.

1414
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,832
The things that she
could do with her mouth--

1415
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:18,068
Whoo.

1416
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:20,137
It's just--It's incredible.

1417
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,339
She knows so many
sexual positions,

1418
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:25,075
I'm dumbfounded half the time,
and I mean that, honey.

1419
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:26,576
I really do.
You're incredible.

1420
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:28,845
The best lay I ever had.

1421
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,316
I would put her up against
anybody in this room right now.

1422
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:35,119
She'll wear you down.
She'll wear you right down.

1423
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,187
She just grinds--
grinds you to death.

1424
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,588
I mean--ooh.

1425
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,158
You know, all day.
I'ts all day with her.

1426
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:42,492
She's non-stop.
She can't get enough,

1427
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,361
and I respect that,

1428
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:46,230
and I love you.

1429
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,331
And this song goes out
to you, honey.

1430
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,865
It's entitled...

1431
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:53,370
Me and My Dick.

1432
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,873
To help me out,
'cause this is a special song.

1433
01:07:56,873 --> 01:08:00,210
I'm gonna sing with my doll,
from my heart...

1434
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,478
for you, honey.

1435
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,615
I love you. I mean that.

1436
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:10,820
Drum roll, please.
( Drumm roll )

1437
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,522
I'm trying to understand,
John.

1438
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,391
I guess it's like
what Dr. Ted said.

1439
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:16,160
Somebody
must have put me
in a spell,

1440
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,328
and I've been walkin' around
in this voodoo-like trance.

1441
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:20,464
You were definitely
in a trance at that
wedding rehearsal.

1442
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:23,467
I know. I don't normally
act that way.

1443
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,136
I thank you guys
for stickin' with me.

1444
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:28,238
Hey, anything to get
the old Johnny back, huh?

1445
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,474
I'm gonna get the limo.
I'll meet you on the corner.

1446
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,145
You know, I love you,
Nance.

1447
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:36,480
I know you do.

1448
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,848
Everything's
gonna be okay.

1449
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,588
( Starts car )

1450
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,939
ANGELA: I want you to
open your eyes, John.

1451
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,607
This hypnotism
isn't gonna work.

1452
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:39,309
All it does is make him
act like a jerk.

1453
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,477
He's not gonna
kill anyone.

1454
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,312
Yes, it will work.

1455
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:44,981
His respect for the institution
of fatherhood was too strong,

1456
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:46,616
it caused a mental block.

1457
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,918
Once we destroy
that respect,

1458
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,255
he'll be exactly
what we want him to be.

1459
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:53,723
SUN YI: Who's that
imbecile out there?
That's his friend.

1460
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:55,592
Make him one
with the ocean.

1461
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:56,660
Let him sleep
with the fishes.

1462
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,462
You know, John,

1463
01:09:58,462 --> 01:10:01,331
a lot of bad people
are out there trying to get you.

1464
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,632
Really?

1465
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,601
That's why we had to
bring you here.

1466
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,503
We wanted to make sure
you'd be safe.

1467
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:08,305
That's very kind of you.

1468
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:11,675
One of those bad people
is your future father-in-law.

1469
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:14,444
I'm looking for John,
I wonder if you saw him.

1470
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:16,446
He's about this tall,

1471
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:18,515
light-colored hair,

1472
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,784
round...face,

1473
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:23,353
kinda good-natured,
good-natured guy,

1474
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:26,490
kinda ( Goofy laugh )...
laughs like that.

1475
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:29,025
I think he was with
a couple of gentlemen--

1476
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,428
Let's go!
And no trouble!

1477
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:33,563
Fathers are the root
of it all, John.

1478
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,732
I have a great respect for
the institution of fatherhood.

1479
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,701
Do you see?

1480
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:40,337
Fathers are bad, John,

1481
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:42,739
and they must be stopped
at all costs.

1482
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,708
Think of all the damage
they've done.

1483
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,810
You know, John,

1484
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,379
throughout history,

1485
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:50,814
it was the father

1486
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:53,283
who was the cause
of a the trouble.

1487
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,289
Hi, honey, I'm home!

1488
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,359
Hello, dear.

1489
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,428
Ha ha ha!
Where's Princess?

1490
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:05,829
There she is!

1491
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:08,765
Hi, Dad!
Hi, Princess!

1492
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:12,001
Ha ha ha!

1493
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,571
And where's my Kitten?
She's upstairs.

1494
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:17,474
Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Kitten!

1495
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:20,577
Why don't you just
slide down the banister?

1496
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,746
You know Daddy will
always be here to catch you.

1497
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:24,714
Here I come!
Wheeeee!

1498
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,490
Another cup, dear?

1499
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,425
No! This coffee sucks!

1500
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,765
Maybe it's the caffeine
that makes you so irritable.

1501
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:44,334
I'm not irritable,
goddammit!

1502
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,336
I'm an insurance salesman--

1503
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:49,072
insurance salesmen
never get irritable,
Margaret!

1504
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:51,475
Anything you say, dear.

1505
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,377
Hee hee hee!

1506
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:55,745
Where's Bud,
that gearhead son of mine?

1507
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:58,114
You locked him
in the shed for a week.

1508
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,816
Don't you remember, dear?

1509
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,551
Ho ho! Oh, yeah.

1510
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:03,620
Hi, Father!
Hi, Princess.

1511
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,855
Father, a very nice
young man asked me

1512
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,124
to the ROTC ball
next Friday.

1513
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:09,526
Can I go?

1514
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:11,361
No.

1515
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:14,464
But why not? He's
perfectly acceptable.

1516
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,566
And a lot of my friends
are going.

1517
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,535
I said no.

1518
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:21,070
Friday is Punishment Night,
Princess.

1519
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,338
Father, I really
want to go.

1520
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,574
Maybe you'd like to
talk about this in the den.

1521
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,909
Please, Father--

1522
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:28,778
Let's talk about it.
Let's have a little chat.

1523
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:30,780
No! No!!!
Come on, Princess!

1524
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,850
Margaret,
you're next!

1525
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:37,854
Hi, Mrs. Anderson.
Hi, Mr. Anderson.

1526
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,490
Do you think I could
hide out here for a while?

1527
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,459
Beaver, what's wrong?
You're covered with blood!

1528
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:44,561
Yeah, I know.
It's Wally's blood.

1529
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,763
See, Wally and I
were fixin' his bike
in the driveway,

1530
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,532
and Dad came home
and got real mad.

1531
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,467
So he took a gun out
and killed Wally--

1532
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,469
blew his head
clean off his shoulders.

1533
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:54,904
His face is all over
the garage door--
it's a real mess.

1534
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:57,106
FATHER:
Well, maybe your dad
knows what he's doing.

1535
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,808
I don't think so.
I think he flipped out.

1536
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,911
Margaret, call up Ward--
tell him Beaver's here.

1537
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,613
Don't do that,
Mr. Anderson.

1538
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,682
Please, Mrs. Anderson,
don't do that.

1539
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,584
I think it's time
you had your punishment,
Beaver!

1540
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:08,785
No, Mr. Anderson, no!

1541
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,588
No! No! No!

1542
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,558
No! No! No!

1543
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,693
No! Don't do that
to the Beaver!

1544
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,495
You can't do it
to Beaver!

1545
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:21,431
I hate you, Ward!
I hate Jim Anderson!

1546
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:23,700
I hate Ed Reese!

1547
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,602
Good, John.

1548
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:28,705
Now, when you hear
the minister say,

1549
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:32,141
"With this ring,
I thee wed,"

1550
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,779
you will take out your gun,

1551
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:38,147
point it at Ed Reese,

1552
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:41,585
and squeeze the trigger.

1553
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,553
( Church bell ringing )

1554
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:48,858
Hey, hey, hey!
It's the father of the bride.

1555
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:51,495
So nice to see you again,
Congressman.

1556
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:53,730
Couldn't have asked
for nicer weather, huh?

1557
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,733
Listen, we both know
why you're here,

1558
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:59,936
you low-life, scumbag,
son-of-a-bitch.

1559
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,871
Jim! Good to see you.

1560
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:04,207
Just don't press your luck.

1561
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:06,976
Don't ever try
to talk to me again,
ya hear?

1562
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,245
Oh, ho! Hey! Ha ha!

1563
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,515
That's wonderful,
that's great!

1564
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:13,683
What a thing.
Marvelous sense of humor.

1565
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,995
Nice and low.

1566
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:28,565
Bobby, let's get
the majesty of this damn thing.

1567
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:30,800
Yeah, just kind of
pan around.

1568
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,902
Just move! Move!

1569
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:35,505
What are you lookin' at?!

1570
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,006
I'm not here,
just do your thing!
It's a wedding.

1571
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,708
Friends of the bride
on this side,

1572
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:39,909
friends of the groom
on this side.

1573
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:40,944
Groom.

1574
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,782
Don't look at me!
Just keep walking.

1575
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:47,884
Can we get the black guy?

1576
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,786
Can you get in here,

1577
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:51,287
'cause that's very important
for the congressman,

1578
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,822
we need some black people
in this. That's nice.

1579
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,026
Hi. So far, so good,
huh?

1580
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:59,295
Hold your tongue.
The hardest part
is still to come.

1581
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,830
Where is the leader?

1582
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,666
He's around--somewhere.

1583
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,802
Watching like a cat
on the prowl,

1584
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:08,538
stalking his prey,
making every movement count.

1585
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,574
Shouldn't we go?
Yes.

1586
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,547
Keep moving.

1587
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:21,818
I was a little hungry.

1588
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:25,822
It's good.
It's a good thing
to be hungry.

1589
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,557
It's allowed.

1590
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,058
I saw Patty.

1591
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,561
You did a good job with her,
she looks very fine.

1592
01:15:31,561 --> 01:15:33,897
I hope the spell lasts.

1593
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:36,700
It's been known
to wear off under pressure.

1594
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,969
Negative thoughts...
no negative thoughts.

1595
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:41,671
Circulate.

1596
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:42,972
SAL: That's good,
just--just...

1597
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:44,340
That's good.

1598
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,975
This is--that's good.

1599
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,977
No problem, keep movin'.
This is a low angle,

1600
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,345
that's all right,
makin' a fillum.

1601
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,914
This is beautiful

1602
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:53,617
That's it,
just keep walkin' up,

1603
01:15:53,617 --> 01:15:55,652
that's fine, that's good.

1604
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,553
Makin' magic down here.
Looks fabulous.

1605
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,700
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today--

1606
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,701
Action!!!

1607
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:51,741
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

1608
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:55,011
In a matter of moments,
a union will take place

1609
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:58,047
within these hallowed walls.

1610
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:02,719
A union between a man
and a woman--

1611
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,822
who just happens to be
the daughter of a guy

1612
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:08,692
that could be the next
President of the United States.

1613
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:12,061
I'm Sal DiPasquale,

1614
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:14,698
and this is my fillum--

1615
01:17:14,698 --> 01:17:17,967
John and Nancy...

1616
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,703
The Wedding.

1617
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,876
Okay, Bobby,
you can zoom in now.

1618
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,879
That was great,
Mr. Dip--

1619
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,781
Get outta
the way!!!

1620
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,986
And now, John, your vows.

1621
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:41,691
John?

1622
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:46,963
Well, I guess Nancy's vows

1623
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:49,132
will suffice for both of you.

1624
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:51,701
And now we'll continue
with the ceremony.

1625
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:54,871
If anyone here
knows of any reason

1626
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:59,108
why this couple should not
be bound in holy matrimony,

1627
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:02,746
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1628
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,916
( Shopping cart
wheels squeaking )

1629
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:13,022
Do you,
Nancy, Wilhelmina Reese...

1630
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,991
( Squeaking continues )

1631
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:30,173
Do you, Nancy Wilhelmina Reese,

1632
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:34,811
take this man,
John Franklin Bourgignon,

1633
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,947
to be your lawful wedded
husband,

1634
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:42,151
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

1635
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:44,954
from this day forward?

1636
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,923
I do.

1637
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:50,827
Do you,
John Franklin Bourgignon,

1638
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:53,863
take this woman,
Nancy Wilhelmina Reese,

1639
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:57,000
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1640
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,203
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

1641
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:03,072
from this day forward?

1642
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:05,809
Yeah.

1643
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,516
With this ring

1644
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:15,819
I thee wed.

1645
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,825
Aaaah!!!

1646
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:29,165
Chick, it's all right,
I know what I'm doin'!

1647
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:30,066
Sal, stop those guys!

1648
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,836
Block the aisles!

1649
01:19:32,836 --> 01:19:34,003
ANGELA:
Get out of the way!

1650
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:37,106
We're in a church!

1651
01:19:38,341 --> 01:19:39,809
Chick, are you all right?

1652
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:41,144
Yeah, I'm fine.
How about you?

1653
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:43,880
I'm not hypnotized.
They wanted me to kill Ed Reese!

1654
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,215
Yeah, I know.
Look, what happened?

1655
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:48,551
Ah, they made me watch some
phony Father Knows Best film.

1656
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:51,988
I know TV--Jim Anderson
would never choke the Beaver.

1657
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:54,590
Johnny!
Are you all right, Nance?

1658
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,092
You just saved
Daddy's life!

1659
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:58,962
Will somebody
please tell me
what's going on?

1660
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:01,297
Daddy, Johnny
just saved your life!

1661
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,133
Well, you know...
Dad, you owe me one.

1662
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,234
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1663
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,904
Oh, my God.

1664
01:20:26,089 --> 01:20:28,157
Well, was I right,
or was I right?

1665
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,193
I told you this was gonna be
an incredible story,

1666
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:31,861
and it was.

1667
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,596
Can you believe
the way things work out?

1668
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,264
Sal and Ed Reese are partners!

1669
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,866
( Muttering in disbelief )

1670
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:38,935
All right,
it's a hot day out here.

1671
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,870
Let's get it right
the first time, awright?

1672
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:43,572
Ready? One, two, three, four!

1686
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:13,302

1687
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:15,071

1693
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,683
I tell you one thing,
I'm happy to have you here.

1694
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,618
Hey, man, you know,

1695
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,354
you oughta try
some skin softener
or somethin'.

1696
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:32,922
That stuff
look real hard,

1697
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:34,190
you oughta
take care of it.

1698
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,125
One thing I wanna
talk to you about, though.

1699
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,061
* Blue moon
Now that the noodle factory
is a success,

1700
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:40,964
and after all,
I am the Pasta King,

1701
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:42,265
I think we oughta
try to diversify.

1702
01:21:42,265 --> 01:21:43,432
What I think
we oughta do

1703
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:45,634
is get into animal noodles.

1704
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,403
We oughta make
little dog noodles

1705
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,072
and little cat noodles,

1706
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:51,640
little lion
and little tiger noodles,

1707
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,077
elephant noodles--
the kids'll love it!

1708
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:56,212
And that's my plan,
ya see?

1709
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,281
I'll get all the kids
goin' in the supermarkets,

1710
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,950
and they'll be buyin'
Wallissimo Jeffersoni Noodles,

1711
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,718
and we will make a fortune!

1712
01:22:02,718 --> 01:22:05,154
Which reminds me--
guess who I saw on
33rd and 3rd the other day?

1713
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:07,490
Leffkowitz!
You remember Leffkowitz.

1714
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,325
He a lawyer now.

1715
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,360
Did it at home, too--
correspondence course.

1716
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,997
That boy was always smart.

1717
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:16,665
He handles all my affairs now,
takes care of me legally.

1718
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,367
Matter of fact,

1719
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:21,437
I might say that Leffkowitz
is directly responsible

1720
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,339
for the condition
I'm in today.

1721
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:26,209
Two weeks ago we did my will,
I got it right here,

1722
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:28,277
he told me to keep it
with me at all times,

1723
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,013
y'know, like, just in case.

1724
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:31,480
Here, lemme read this to ya.

1725
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,116
See, it says right here,

1726
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:36,419
"I, Wallace A. Jefferson,
bein' of sound mind,

1727
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,687
spent all my money."

1728
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,357
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ain't that too much?

1729
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:44,760
Wait'll I tell ya what he said--
"That's wonderful."

1730
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,395
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1731
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:48,264
Hey, another thing
I wanted to talk to you about,

1732
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:50,099
is about my new idea.

1733
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:52,035
I call it "Raiders
of the Burning Bush."

1734
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:54,270
You see, all we have to do
is find the spot

1735
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,772
where the original
Burning Bush went down,

1736
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,774
and then we sell tickets
so people can go see it.

1737
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:00,509
Kinda like the Lost Ark,

1738
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:02,178
that's what they was
gonna do with it, see.

1739
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:03,779
But I think more people
would wanna see the spot

1740
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:04,880
where the Burning Bush
went down.

1741
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,416
I know you might think
it sounds kinda far-fetched,

1742
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,785
I know a lotta people probably
been lookin' for it,

1743
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:12,321
but it's hard to find
because the bush burned down.

1744
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,191
But you and me, Muhammed,
I think we can do it,

1745
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:17,226
and I bet we can
make a fortune, too.

1746
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:20,063
I know we could make enough
to buy me a new convertible

1747
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:22,265
after that dude stole it
from the noodle factory.

1748
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,300
You hired the cat.

1749
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,302
And don't let's us pretend
like you didn't hire him,

1750
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:28,037
because when he came
and asked for the job,

1751
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:29,338
I turned to you
and I said,

1752
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,074
"Should we hire him or not?"

1753
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:32,441
and I gave you the nudge
and you gave him the nod.

1754
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,343
So you did hire the cat.

1755
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,479
I never brought this up before,
but I'm bringin' it up now.

1756
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:38,747
So either you go in with me

1757
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,816
on this Raiders of
the Burning Bush,

1758
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,252
or I'm gonna have to
reconsider our partnership.

1759
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:47,056
The ice is meltin'
in your drink.

1760
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:50,293
Look here, I buy you the drinks,
you sit there-- you waste 'em.

1761
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:53,462
That's all right,
leave it there,
I'll drink it myself.

1762
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:55,831
Only trouble is,
every time I drink one,
then I gotta go again.

1763
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,101
You never have to go.

1764
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:00,203
I mean, I have two or three
and I'm off to the john.

1765
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:02,471
Used to be a time
when I could hold
a whole case.

1766
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:06,175
Now I have two or three drinks,
Boom! I gotta go.

1767
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:08,344
I guess I must
be gettin' older.

1768
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:11,214
Ain't nothin'
I can do about it, though,
you can't stop time.

1769
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:13,282
I mean, you see Time
walkin' down the street,

1770
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,851
you say,
"Hey, Time, hold it!
I wanna rap to you!"

1771
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,321
Time ain't gonna stop for you--
Time waits for no man.

1772
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:20,556
Time'll tell ya,
"Sorry, I got to march on."
