1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,170
Put it around there. Just turn
it around a bit.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,530
That's it. Bring it back around.
There, that's nice.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,640
Wait a minute, let me check -
just let me turn the brush. There.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,750
Good.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,610
David came to the college with
this pinstripe suit,

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,050
and a high starch collar
and a very thin little tie,

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,810
and this pudding bowl haircut.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,010
And I said to myself, "My God,
look at the state of this fella!"

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,920
I said, "He's like a Russian
peasant. A right Boris."

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,730
You know those crinkly chippers?

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,450
You see, he had a crinkly chipper,

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,960
when chips used to be straight.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,960
He always had bloody theories
about everything, you know?

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,560
"Here, well, there's more surface
area. It makes a better chip."

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,260
He had a need
to have a guiding theory.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,880
When he decided
he'd hit on the right one,

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,160
it was like someone who's suddenly
seen the light in a new religion.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,930
And you'd tend to dread meeting
him and being subjected to it again.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,830
It was always easy to get him
on the subject of cigarettes.

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,390
I asked him what he thought about
this billboard,

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,880
over on Santa Monica Boulevard.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,030
Right away, he says,

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,570
"Well, I should rent the billboard
across the street...

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,820
"..that would tell the number of
people who died of other causes."

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,980
I think he was a bit in love with me
for a while. I do think that's true.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,550
I remember wearing this
suit in San Francisco

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,530
and going up to Nob Hill, which is
a very steep slope,

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,240
and he said, "Celia,

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,550
"those trousers from the back,

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,630
"I don't think you
look your best in those."

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,640
And I never wore them again.

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,270
We had this
polar bear white carpet,

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,240
and he was doing some ink drawings
on the floor,

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
and he got a spot of ink
on the carpet,

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,830
and my father got hysterical.

36
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,750
I said,
"Dad, we should have him sign it.

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,780
"It'll be worth millions
in a couple of years."

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:25,820
This programme contains
some strong language

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,680
We go under the stairs,

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,840
a little cupboard
to hide under the stairs.

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,480
When the bomb drops on the street,

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,990
my mother screamed.

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,340
If she screams, you scream.

44
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,370
I mean, you're very frightened
if your mother's frightened.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,160
So, it's something I've always
remembered and, actually,

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,490
so had all my brothers and sister.

47
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,800
It's the first...

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,370
...first memory I have, yeah.

49
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,070
I was born in 1937,

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,810
and I do remember
the end of the Second World War.

51
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,910
I was brought up with rationing.

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,170
They didn't end rationing
till I was 16 years old,

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,070
so, you couldn't just go
and buy a bar of chocolate.

54
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,600
You could only buy sweets
Saturday morning

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,070
when you got your pocket money.

56
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,760
You would be given it
at nine o'clock

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,520
and the sweets had gone by 9.15.

58
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,030
You'd bought them and eaten them
and that was it,

59
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,810
and you'd have to wait
till another Saturday.

60
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,270
I mean, I was brought up
in austerity like that.

61
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,390
On the other hand,
we didn't feel poor.

62
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,480
Life was interesting, you know?

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,590
I mean, you're a kid,
so life is interesting

64
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,230
whether you have much money or not.

65
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,190
It's always interesting to children,
in that way. It should be, anyway.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,360
And it was to my father.

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,400
I mean, he...

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,320
he wasn't a very sophisticated man,
in many ways.

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,200
I mean, he was a bit puritanical
for me.

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
But he had a heart. I mean,
he cared about people,

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,890
and felt there should
be justice in the world.

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,940
I mean, he was political that way.

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,120
FROM A RECORDING: The one thing
I loved, my father could paint

74
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320
the line on a crossbar
of a bicycle

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,990
using a special long brush.

76
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,520
He'd rest your finger on the top,

77
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,040
and then you do it without a ruler,
you see?

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,710
Like a sign writer would.

79
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,110
But to watch it done without a ruler

80
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,560
was very thrilling, I thought.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,770
Incredible that you could make
a straight line like that,

82
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,720
just with your eye.

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,500
I mean, it's like watching
Michelangelo draw a circle.

84
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,110
Why are you popular?

85
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,360
What is it, do you think, in your
work that goes straight through

86
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,060
to the understanding and feelings
of a large number of people?

87
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,440
Well...

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,030
...I'm not that sure. Go on, try.
Of course.

89
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,640
I am interested in ways of looking,

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,330
and trying to
think of it in simple ways.

91
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,320
If you can communicate that,

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,560
of course, people will respond.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,480
Everybody does look,

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,580
it's just a question of how hard
they're willing to look, isn't it?

95
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,200
We were at a restaurant and somehow
the subject came up

96
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,290
of David's failings and faults.

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Henry took the napkin and wrote,

98
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,610
just like that,
as fast as you please.

99
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,770
It's so funny, I picked it up
and I've saved it ever since.

100
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,990
It started out, "stubborn",

101
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,560
then "hard of hearing"
was the next one.

102
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,630
"Generous to a fault",

103
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,170
"emotional in the guise of reason".

104
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,920
And "often overhardy".

105
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,010
And he's written in parenthesis,
"walking and bathing".

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,360
And the other one is,
which he's written is,

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,260
"unintentionally rude", and he's
underlined "unintentionally" twice.

108
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,280
I think it's a
really good description of David.

109
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,420
I've saved it for ever.

110
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,120
One of the things that my father
taught me

111
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
was not to worry too much what the
neighbours think.

112
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
Well...

113
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,400
that's aristocratic,
actually, not working class.

114
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,550
That's aristocratic.

115
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,990
I mean, "Fuck you, I don't
care what the neighbours think."

116
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,360
And my mother would have cared,

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,180
but Kenneth told me that,

118
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,410
"Don't you worry too much what the
neighbours think."

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,280
And I always thought,
I took that lesson, actually, yeah.

120
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,590
I noticed it.

121
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,080
When he was at Bradford Art School,
he was in an evening class,

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,840
life drawing, and there was a guy,

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,970
and bit of a sort rocker
or something,

124
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,970
and he had an art student girlfriend,

125
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,440
probably with that sort of
witch-type mascara

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,120
that was about then. And they were
real art students,

127
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,910
and there was the schoolboy,
you see, intensely drawing.

128
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,630
And he said this guy was just like
this on his thing,

129
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,050
and sort of putting his feet up on
the donkey, you know, and all this,

130
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,850
and just spent two hours taking
the piss out of Hockney

131
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,610
for being so earnest
and just drawing.

132
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,050
And the girlfriend was laughing
and the model was laughing.

133
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,360
And I said, "What did you do?"

134
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,080
He just said, "Well..." He said,

135
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,860
"Well, I just thought,
'Well, I'll fucking show them!"'

136
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,920
And he had revealed
the inner David, you know?

137
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,500
Willpower.

138
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,880
Nobody was there
when I arrived at the Royal College

139
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,430
and I just sort of got
a cubicle they appointed me

140
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,310
and I laid out my stuff

141
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,280
and then suddenly this very
strange-looking guy walks in

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
and doesn't say a word,

143
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,680
just starts setting up
in the cubicle next to me.

144
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,040
Then Derek Boshier came in

145
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,500
and took up the cubicle
on the other side,

146
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,320
so there was Derek on my left,
and David on my right,

147
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,010
and me in the middle, and we became
quite friendly after a few weeks.

148
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,150
He was living in a little
hut in Earls Court,

149
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,390
and I went there once or twice,
but it was not very large.

150
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,570
It barely fit the two of us in there.

151
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,660
ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,040
London in the '60s was becoming
very hip, very different,

153
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,740
also very anti- Establishment.

154
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,470
The atmosphere that I sensed in
the cubicles that were surrounding me

155
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,940
was of experimentation.

156
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,670
They wanted to experiment

157
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,270
to find something different
than what they knew

158
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,180
and they weren't even sure
what that was going to be.

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,920
I think they were interested
in America, definitely,

160
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,720
but, strangely enough, I think it was
the Abstract Expressionist painters

161
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,640
and the anti-traditionalism
of those artists

162
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,250
that really intrigued
the British painters.

163
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,570
The main thing then was abstraction.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,710
The Abstract Expressionists
were very big,

165
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,880
and so, by the end of
my second year,

166
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,100
I went to New York.

167
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,480
Somebody stopped me in the street

168
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,300
and said they had this ticket
for New York.

169
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,570
And it cost £40.

170
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,660
And all I had to give them
was £10 now

171
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,940
and I could have it
if I gave the £30 later.

172
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,310
I thought it cost a £1,000
to go to America.

173
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,210
I mean, I'd never thought
of going to America,

174
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,040
so, erm,

175
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,410
I said OK.

176
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,770
I only had about £12,

177
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,670
but I thought,
"Well, I'll get the money somehow."

178
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,350
I think almost the next day

179
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,790
this letter came

180
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
with a cheque for £100.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,500
I'd won a prize.

182
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
And then I started selling pictures

183
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,510
for £10, £12, £15.

184
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
In the end,

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,250
I went to America with about $350.

186
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,450
And that was to last me
for two months.

187

JET PLANE ENGINES WHINE

188
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,200
I had a great time in New York then.

189
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,760
I thought New York
was the place to be.

190
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,840
That was it, I thought.

191
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,950
I mean, it ran 24 hours a day then,
absolutely did.

192
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,140

195
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,510
'It makes every bleach

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,670
'It's the fabulous new way

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,130
'Lady Clairol hair lightener whips

198
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,490
I was living in my parents' home
in Long Island in Long Beach.

199
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,070
Friends of mine, and David,
were all in my house one evening

200
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,830
watching television

201
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,890
and this ad came on.

202
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,880
I don't even remember
what we were watching,

203
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,910
but this ad came on for Clairol
and saying, you know,

204
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,640
"Everybody should go blonde,
because blondes have more fun."

205
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,670
They all looked at it and they said,
"Wow. That sounds good."

206
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,560
And they rushed out and
bought Clairol hair dye,

207
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,570
and they were all sitting
in my parents' living room

208
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,230
dying their hair.

209
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
My father walked in
and almost had a heart attack.

210
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,010
"What the hell is going on here?!"

211
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,940
But that's where David decided

212
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,200
he was going to be blond
for the rest of his life.

213
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,400
Is he still blond?

214
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,030
Lovely, aren't they?

215
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
You can drop 'em on a stone floor
and pick 'em up again...

216
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,770
in pieces.

217
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,280
Give me eight and six
for the half a dozen, darling.

218
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,300
Eight shillings, half a dozen.

219
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,170
Right...

220
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
He was always drawing, always,
as long as I can ever remember.

221
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,730
When he had little stubby fingers,
he'd be drawing something.

222
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,210
And he never stopped.

223
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,490
And he didn't have paper
like you have today,

224
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,400
but you've got the edge
of notebooks and things or...

225
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,760
anything where there was a space.
A bus ticket, even.

226
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,030
So if he were on a bus,
he'd have a pencil in his hand

227
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,130
probably drawing other passengers,
things like that.

228
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,240
SIZZLING

229
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,660
SEWING MACHINE CLICKS

230
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,720
The weight.
Oh, yeah. Wow, the weight.

231
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,440
When you think now, you can
get it on Kindle, can't you?

232
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,600
SHE LAUGHS

233
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,920
Yeah.

234
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,770
Ah, yes, this is the sort of thing.

235
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,470
He would have been all excited

236
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,760
about who's done these

237
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,570
and why have they done them,
and, I mean, brilliant,

238
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,360
especially when you go back
with the history, as well.

239
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,660
So, yes, this would
have influenced him.

240
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,080
You see, this was the only way
you could see the world, wasn't it?

241
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,240
I mean, there was Cartwright Hall
in Bradford with some pictures.

242
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,370
By looking at pictures,

243
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,720
he would realise,
"I can do what I like,"

244
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,720
once you've seen these, can't you?

245
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,240
And it would give him
the freedom to be an artist

246
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,150
and be an artist who painted
exactly what he wanted to paint,

247
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,440
what he needed to paint.

248
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,720
He'd be looking at these

249
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,890
and looking at the techniques
and why they did...

250
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,800
He'd see it totally with his eye,

251
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,210
which would be quite different
to what the rest of us would see.

252
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,630
Badges.

253
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,580
"Good health is worth
more than a fortune."

254
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,920
Give me one, will you?
Put those in the car.

255
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,570
You're going to take 'em?
Yep. Oh, are ya?

256
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,030
Do you remember the hens,

257
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,080
the hens on the field up here
before they built the houses?

258
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,520
Oh, you'd only be ever so young.
Oh, yes. On, er...

259
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,470
Well, I have that somewhere.

260
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,650
It's framed.

261
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,680
Did you see anything, Margaret?

262
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,570
No, I can't find those cuff links.

263
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,700
'We used to live in Steadman Terrace
during the war.'

264
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,770
It was a small house and closed in.

265
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,010
It was claustrophobic,
actually, yes,

266
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,480
and there were five of us.

267
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,190
All right, we were only small,
so that didn't matter too much.

268
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
And it was at the top of a hill,
and you couldn't...

269
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,080
If it was dark,
you couldn't see a thing anywhere.

270
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,650
There was a lot of darkness
from that house in my memory,

271
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,490
so probably the same with David.

272
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,020
But I think the claustrophobia
could have been a bit of emotional

273
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,770
as well as space-wise.

274
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,380
I know he always says
he likes space.

275
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,580
But you do need space from people
as well, don't you?

276
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,900
In fact, that is what space is,
isn't it, actually?

277
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,930
What else is space?

278
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,210
Being alone.

279
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,820
MUSIC: L-O-V-E by Nat King Cole

280
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,390
# L is for the way you look at me

281
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,760
# O is for the only one I see

282
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,470
# V is very, very extraordinary... #

283
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,390
Within one week of coming here,
I'd never driven before,

284
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,240
I'd got a driving license,
bought a car, got a studio

285
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,050
and I thought, "This is the place."

286
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,730
It's got all the energy
of the United States

287
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,840
with the Mediterranean thrown in,

288
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,300
which I think is
a wonderful combination.

289
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,840
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

290
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,370
David took some snapshots,

291
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,680
he took Polaroids, of me standing
in front of the bar room,

292
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,720
and I was dusting some of the heads,

293
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,810
cos I had a lot of animal heads.

294
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,040
My first husband was
a great white hunter.

295
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,190
GUNSHOT

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,960
And David only took about three
black and white Polaroids.

297
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,290
I said, "Oh, David, how can you work
from black and white?"

298
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,120
"Oh," he said, "I can only work
from black and white photographs,

299
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,840
"because the colour of photography
is never the same as real life."

300
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,730
Anyway, so I took the pictures

301
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,640
and I said, "There's only one thing
you could call this painting,

302
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,800
"since I'm dusting.

303
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,660
"It's called
Beverly Hills Housewife."

304
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,140
SPRINKLERS SWISH

305
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,910
Some people will say, "Well,
LA is a good place to hide."

306
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:24,320
You can calve out a private life
here for yourself, if you wish,

307
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,020
and a lot of people do that.

308
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,810
Because of the kind of set-up
of the city and everything,

309
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,650
people don't walk here,

310
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,480
they take cars.

311
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,690
And David's had this place here
for many years,

312
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,840
but he wasn't part of a community
like Venice or Downtown LA.

313
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,480
But he just managed to get around,
all over the city.

314
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,120
I know that he would like
to go out on rides,

315
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,810
you know, driving way out
in the country,

316
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,560
and I think he's done that
several times, too.

317
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,960
I'll be there.
OVER PHONE: 'OK. Yeah, a guy came.

318
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,600
'He was asking about you earlier.

319
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,830
'He may try to reach you...'

320
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,000
All right, love.
'See you later.' Bye.

321
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,780
TV: 'My daddy promised me
a horse all for myself

322
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,690
'when I got here from back east.

323
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,240
'He said, "A boy needs a horse
to love and if it's the right boy,

324
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,050
"'the horse will learn
to love him, too."'

325
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,510
WESTERN MUSIC

326
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,120
There he is. Boy, he's a beauty.

327
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,560
No wonder he's the king
of the wild herd.

328
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,550
I've just gotta get him today.

329
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,330
That's for sure, Bob. We can't
disappoint that kid of yours.

330
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,720
He's coming in on the 459...

331
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,320
'When I arrived here, somebody said,

332
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,920
“Well, why have you come
to this cultural desert?"

333
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,690
'Well, I didn't think
it was a cultural desert,

334
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,820
'because I knew Hollywood was here.'

335
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,140
Come on, boys. Come on.

336
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,190
My father loved the cinema.

337
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,550
So did we as kids and, remember,

338
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm about the last generation
brought up without television.

339
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,990
I was 18 years old
when we first got television,

340
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,560
so my childhood
was radio and things.

341
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
But we loved the pictures.

342
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,830
They were always called
"the pictures".

343
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,670
Not "the movies", not "the cinema",
"the pictures".

344
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,800
"Can we go to the pictures?"

345
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,110
They had a powerful effect on me,
you know.

346
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,200
We used to go in the side entrance
and, of course,

347
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,310
there was a lavatory
down there with an exit

348
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,160
and kids used to go and open it.

349
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,720
Little kids'd run in free,
you know, doing that.

350
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,190
I used to tell 'em,

351
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,830
"If you walk in backwards,
they'll think you're coming out."

352
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,240
And I would point this out, though.

353
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,470
Probably because you were
sitting near the front,

354
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,360
the edges of the screen
seemed unimportant.

355
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,670
They were miles away, you thought
they were absolutely miles away.

356
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,910
Whereas now I'm very, very aware
of the edges of the screen

357
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,680
often making a pokey picture.

358
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,750
But at that time, I never thought
any picture was pokey,

359
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,520
because it was offering you
another world from dingy Bradford.

360
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,040
Remember, you're walking
through dingy streets

361
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,120
to a little local cinema
and when you come out,

362
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,160
you've been all over, you've been in
the French Revolution or somewhere,

363
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,520
so you come out with your
imagination working.

364
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,720
It was pictures, pictures, pictures!

365
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,470
GUNSHOTS

366
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,080
I've always said, in a way,
I was brought up

367
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,820
in Hollywood and Bradford,

368
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,860
because most of the films we saw
were American when I think of it.

369
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,660
I went to the cinema a lot
and we'd go home on the bus.

370
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,900
I'd always go upstairs
to the front of the bus.

371
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
I always travelled upstairs
on the bus,

372
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,060
always on the front seat,

373
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,270
so you could see more.

374
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,530
I always wanted to SEE more.

375
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,610
I, erm, was coming back
from New York and I'd bought,

376
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:52,400
in New York, some nudist magazines,
some male nudist magazines,

377
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,600
and at the airport, the Customs man,
who was about 22 years old,

378
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,590
opened the bag and they
sorted out the magazines.

379
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,600
If they were completely nude,
he put them on one side

380
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,400
and if they were not quite nude,
he put them on another side

381
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,830
and then they kept
the nude magazines.

382
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,050
I protested and said,
"Oh, come on, don't be silly.

383
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,080
"Just give me them back,"
and this, that and the other

384
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,170
and they took them away,

385
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,550
and I kept phoning up the
Customs office in the city

386
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,880
and I kept speaking to a man,
I don't know what his name was,

387
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,760
Mr Hittet, Hillet or something.

388
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,630
He said, "Oh, they are
definitely pornographic."

389
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
He'd looked through and
in one of the photographs,

390
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,910
the boys had painted their genitals
with psychedelic colours.

391
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,160
And I just didn't... I just didn't
know what to say to somebody

392
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,070
who didn't think that
was amusing or funny.

393
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,260
Then, erm...

394
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,690
...in the end, I had to get a lawyer

395
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,480
and I showed him magazines
of a similar kind,

396
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,170
and the moment the lawyer
wrote the letter to them,

397
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,840
they immediately came back.

398
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,480
A man appeared on the
doorstep in a peaked cap

399
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,190
with a big envelope marked
"On Her Majesty's Service"

400
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,730
and said, "You know what these are,"
and handed them in.

401
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,270
David became particularly intrigued
at the Royal College of Art

402
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:34,040
because I had a lot of magazines
like American Model Guild

403
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,560
and Physique Pictorial
stuck up in my cubicle,

404
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,070
and this fascinated him,
of course.

405
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,990
I was very out already in New York,

406
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,560
despite the fact that it was the '60s

407
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,070
and I had a lot of trouble being out

408
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,920
and I'd been beaten up
several times by, you know,

409
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,560
anti-gay homophobes,
but I just didn't care.

410
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,910
I thought, "Well, you know,
England is probably OK,

411
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,350
"nobody cares there
about this sort of stuff."

412
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,430
And he was intrigued to meet
somebody who was so out,

413
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,840
because I don't think he knew
anybody at that point

414
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,260
who was quite out and so
we became very close friends.

415
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,070
A couple of times
I've shared a bed with Hockney,

416
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,240
and once was I was stuck
for somewhere to kip.

417
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,920
Has anyone ever mentioned
his five-foot tall

418
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,190
turquoise teddy bear that he had?

419
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,720
HE LAUGHS

420
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,530
This fucking great teddy bear
from here to the wall.

421
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,690
With big eyes, it had,
and it was turquoise sort of fluff.

422
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,520
So this went down the middle
of the bed, you see,

423
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,000
between sort of, like,
straights and gays,

424
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,320
if you know what I mean.

425
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,480
I was this side, you see,
and this fucking great teddy bear...

426
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,610
You couldn't even see David,
and then the next morning,

427
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,130
we both woke up

428
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,440
and David sort of does
this sit-up in bed

429
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,250
above this turquoise teddy bear.

430
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,690
No glasses, you see,
and he sort of goes,

431
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,350
he sort of goes like this, you know.

432
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,000
He sort of goes...

433
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,750
IN YORKSHIRE ACCENT: "Hello!"

434
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,360
The paintings all related,
whether superficially or intensely,

435
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,610
on his life and his trying
to deal with his homosexuality

436
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,330
and trying to deal
with his fantasies

437
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,430
and trying to deal with the issues
of a sexual identity.

438
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,780
He used wit to play
with these identities.

439
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,830
He was really like a little
high-school girl about it, really.

440
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:23,910
I mean, it was all fantasy
and some sort of cutesy stuff.

441
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,120
I mean, like his fantasies about...

442
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,240
Who was that rock singer?

443
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,880
...Cliff Richard.

444
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't think he had had sex

445
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,990
at any point yet with a man,

446
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,580
but I think he certainly
fantasised a lot about it.

447
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,280
With David, it was probably
something about a way to get out

448
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,760
something about himself,

449
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,720
but I don't know if that was
the core of the painting,

450
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,070
because, you know, it's not
just pictures of men fucking.

451
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,960
There's something much more in there.

452
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,480
And homosexuality,
it's sort of a witty side issue.

453
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,240
Even if it seems to be
the subject of the painting,

454
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,350
it's not the subject of the painting.

455
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,120
If anything, the homosexual elements
in his paintings, for me,

456
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,870
were points to roam into the
painting and see other things

457
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,720
and give clues to maybe
parts of the painting,

458
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,360
but they weren't the painting.

459
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,200
MUSIC: L-O-V-E by Nat King Cole

460
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,160
# L is for the way you look at me

461
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,350
# O is for the only one I see

462
00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:00,560
# V is very, very extraordinary

463
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,360
# E is even more than
anyone that you adore

464
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
# Can love... #

465
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,580
When I went to Los Angeles,
it was really...

466
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,760
...three times better
than I thought it would be.

467
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,070
# ..just a game for two... #

468
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,200
I thought, "Well, this is it.
Hollywood is near here."

469
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,200
And I'd just read an American novel
called City Of Night by John Rechy,

470
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
which has accounts of kind
of lowlife in American cities,

471
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,560
and I thought it was all wonderful
and colourful and everything.

472
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,130
But, erm, I wanted
to get up to Hollywood

473
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,920
and see what it was all like

474
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,050
and see the hustlers
and the sea and everything.

475
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,000
And I bought a bicycle to go there,

476
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,130
because I didn't know
how to get there,

477
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,050
and, of course, it's about
16 miles from Santa Monica.

478
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,390
HORN BLARES

479
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,160
"Later, I would think of America
as one vast city of night

480
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,000
"stretching gaudily from Times
Square to Hollywood Boulevard,

481
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,090
"jukebox winking,
rock and roll moaning,

482
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,160
"America at night
fusing its dark cities

483
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,930
"into the unmistakable
shape of loneliness.

484
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,600
"Remember Pershing Square
and the apathetic palm trees,

485
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,850
"one-night sex and cigarette smoke

486
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,560
"and rooms
squashed in by loneliness.

487
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,370
"And I would remember lives
lived out darkly

488
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,800
"in that vast city of night,

489
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,340
"from all-night movies
to Beverly Hills mansions."

490
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,590
THUNDER RUMBLES

491
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,930
I got there and realised there
was nobody in Pershing Square.

492
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,830
It had all altered,
this empty thing, big palm trees.

493
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:17,220
I did find a bar later,
but it was then I realised,

494
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,940
"Well, I need a car."
You just need a car.

495
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,980
A bicycle won't do, I mean...

496
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,420
So I gave the bicycle away
and bought a car.

497
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,830
I used to work on a morning,

498
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,630
and then, in the afternoon,
it got very hot and sunny,

499
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,240
so I'd go and lie on the beach.

500
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,570
And then, I'd work again
in the evening.

501
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,570
And I'd maybe work until about
10 o'clock or 11 o'clock.

502
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,520
Then I'd go for a drink, you see.

503
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,620
In California,
the bars don't close until two,

504
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,470
which seems to me,
in a way, the ideal hour.

505
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,980
If you're going to close them
at all, it's the ideal hour,

506
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,110
because, in a way, it's not too late

507
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,390
and you can make up your mind
about things, I suppose,

508
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,340
you see, at two o'clock.

509
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,410
Four o'clock is a bit late, really.

510
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,930
You can go in a bar and meet the
equivalent of a plumber,

511
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,060
from Brooklyn,
could be sat at the next stool,

512
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,760
and some other guy...

513
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,130
...you know, a movie maker from
Hollywood could be sat at the...

514
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,750
...on the next stool.

515
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,840
I mean, that can happen.
In London, you can't do this.

516
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:50,810
Los Angeles to David meant surfers.

517
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,560
And there were a lot of boys around.

518
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,800
And, uh...

519
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,380
And all that was, I think, very...

520
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,210
...erotic and beautiful to David,
and he depicted it.

521
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,010
It was 1964
and Chris Isherwood phoned

522
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,390
and said that a young English
artist had phoned him

523
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,780
who was here in Santa Monica

524
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,010
and could he come by and visit
Chris on an afternoon?

525
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,140
Chris said, "Of course."

526
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,700
David Hockney arrived,
very dyed blond,

527
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,200
and my memory was in a gold jacket!

528
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,510
Chris was a distinguished writer

529
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,580
and I suppose the most famous
British queer living in, er, LA,

530
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,110
and, erm, yes, er,
David would have known about him

531
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,610
and would have read his books, too.

532
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,820
We'd already been together
15 years,

533
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,630
and at that time, that was
considered phenomenal.

534
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,700
Two men living together and 30
years difference between them,

535
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:39,020
and, er, they haven't, er,
shot one another or,

536
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,230
er, at least, er, split up.

537
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,380
Er, er, er, yeah.

538
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,860
He took a lot of photographs and
even did some preliminary drawings.

539
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,000
Chris, he got that figure
in the painting right away,

540
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,880
and you can tell from looking at the
painting, it's very freshly painted.

541
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,500
It was a really fresh version

542
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,070
and it was good,
I kept it, and, of course,

543
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,220
he had the, er,
photographs to remind him.

544
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,300
The painting of me

545
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,430
is much heavier technique,
if you look closely.

546
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,210
He had a lot of trouble with me.

547
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,060
I think it may have given
David the idea

548
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,840
of finding a partner for himself,

549
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,290
since it seemed to work
well for Chris and me.

550
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,430
David met a student at UCLA during
the summer, Peter Schlesinger,

551
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,710
and he liked Peter very much.

552
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,030
I believe Peter was what David was
somehow looking for.

553
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,830
But, er, he called once
and he was taking, erm,

554
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:06,350
this young student
of his from Tarzana in the Valley...

555
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,650
There's a place called
Tarzana where...

556
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,110
...where...Burroughs...

557
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:18,350
Burroughs lived in Tarzana
and created Tarzan.

558
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,430
Edgar Rice Burroughs
created it in the Valley

559
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,230
and so, it's called Tarzana.

560
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:29,430
And, er, and er, David did
a now famous painting of Peter

561
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,810
which is called The Room Tarzana.

562
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,190
DON BACHARDY: He was a very
attractive young man,

563
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,870
and quite beautiful and, er,

564
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:46,220
yes, I think
David was enchanted by him.

565
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:54,200
Neither had ever lived in a romantic
relationship with a partner

566
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,570
and that made it a lot of fun
to be around them.

567
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,630
My first encounter
was with a picture,

568
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,120
not with David as a person.

569
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,100
I was captured by Doll Boy,

570
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,430
as a picture
that seemed to me original

571
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,380
and "gay" in
the old sense of the word

572
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,080
and, er...rule-breaking...

573
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,070
and witty.

574
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,920
I particularly liked that painting
and, at that time,

575
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,270
had sufficient money
to buy it outright

576
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,010
and then wanted to meet David.

577
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,030
David acquired fans

578
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,580
with enormous facility.

579
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,300
Cecil Beaton had already bought

580
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,450
a picture on one
of his visits to the Royal College.

581
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,270
It was a time when Snowdon was
making photographs for a book

582
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,710
called Private View, and people
saw the potential in David

583
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,180
as someone that you could
write a lot about.

584
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,920
I had great ambition at the time.

585
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,150
I wanted to show what I thought of
as the greatest art.

586
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,470
I'd formulated a pretty strong
idea of what I liked most

587
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:28,080
and it was almost entirely American
Abstract colour field painting.

588
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,110
But, of course,
in England, I wanted to represent

589
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,310
what I thought was
the best in English painting,

590
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:37,430
whether it, it fitted in with
all of the American taste or not.

591
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,870
And Hockney was the only figurative
artist that I found interesting,

592
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,520
exciting,
that I wanted to be the defender of.

593
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,470
You could say David was the only
figurative artist

594
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,790
in a deadly serious Abstract place,
but, in fact,

595
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,640
the influence of the ones
on the other were quite strong.

596
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I mean, a number of his pictures
were painted

597
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,380
thinking about colour field
painting, you know.

598
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,670
He'd already

599
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,280
pretty rapidly became a blond,

600
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,850
a flamboyant dresser...

601
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,100
...a maker of
public statements, I mean,

602
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,950
the sort of person that draws
the attention of journalists.

603
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,240
And it was at the very moment when...

604
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,950
when the eye of the press
and the taste-makers

605
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,990
was on the British art world
and fashion world.

606
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,220
And David stood out as one
of the banner carriers

607
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,750
for the new approach to art,
life and, in fact,

608
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,450
the emerging openness of gay life.

609
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,350
David always had a sense of humour.

610
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,640
For instance, when Tony Snowdon
said, "Come round and have

611
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,790
"a look at Kensington Palace," when
he was married to Princess Margaret.

612
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,230
Tony used to take great delight
in those days

613
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,110
showing you the bathroom
with the M and the coronet

614
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,800
on top of a lavatory seat,
and saying,

615
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,070
"You can have a pee in," you know,
"Margaret's lav, if you like."

616
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,510
And then, he asked David to sign
the visitor's book and David said,

617
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,710
"No, no," he said,
"I'm not going to sign that.

618
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,250
"I don't want my name in there,
come the revolution!"

619
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:35,460
In 1962, I'd been at a demonstration
in Trafalgar Square.

620
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,830
When it was over, I thought
I'd come in the National Gallery

621
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,180
and have look at frescos
by Domenichino from a room

622
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,330
in the Villa Aldobrandini near Rome.

623
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,100
Then I became fascinated with, er,
things about the pictures.

624
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,030
The space of the picture, you see,
is really only one foot.

625
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,920
As you can see here, there's, er...

626
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,810
the picture begins here
and there's some floor.

627
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:12,540
And the dwarf that you see is
stood in front of this tapestry,

628
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,000
which is the back of the picture.

629
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,800
The picture is only the depth
of a, of a person,

630
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,630
as a matter of fact,
which is about one foot.

631
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,540
So I did my version of
this painting.

632
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,510
You can see the tapestry
quite clearly

633
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,990
and you can see I've painted
a fleur-de-lys border.

634
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,640
And instead of a dwarf, I got

635
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,710
a friend, in fact,
he's an art dealer called Kasmin,

636
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,720
to pose for me and I defined
the front of the picture

637
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,900
by putting a sheet of glass
over this section.

638
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,650
And I got Kas to pose for this
and I did some drawings

639
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,090
and I took some photographs of him
pressed against the glass.

640
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:01,390
And so my figure is trapped
between the tapestry and the glass.

641
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,630
In fact, the idea of that painting

642
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,670
I've kept repeating and repeating,

643
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,820
and the idea of a border still
interests me.

644
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,360
For example,

645
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,560
here's another painting that
I did in Hollywood.

646
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,310
Because it's got a border round it,

647
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:24,080
you cannot, as it were,
walk straight into the picture.

648
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,440
If it's got a border,

649
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,550
it's like this rope being here,
and to climb into it,

650
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,320
you've got to climb over this,

651
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,640
you see, and then you'd have to go
onto the diving board...

652
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,870
BOARD RATTLES

653
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,650
and fall into the swimming pool
and there's the splash.

654
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,670
WATER SPLASHES

655
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,190
'Henry Geldzahler was a curator
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.'

656
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,040
INTERCOM BUZZES
'Hello?'

657
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,260
Hi, Dave. It's Henry.

658
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,670
It was obvious that David was the
most important person in his life.

659
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,900
They spoke on the telephone almost
every day for 20 or 30 minutes.

660
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,470
Of course, in those days,
there were no mobile phones.

661
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,790
There was a table where
the telephone sat

662
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,430
and you had conversations.

663
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,870
So, I got to know David through
one-sided phone conversations

664
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,360
that Henry was having with him
and I realised

665
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,760
they shared absolutely
every aspect of their life.

666
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:47,180
The art, the books, the friendships,
the lovers, the gossip, everything.

667
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,780
It was total friendship.

668
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,830
David was essentially a figure
of the 19th century in many respects.

669
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:02,470
The literature, the art, the music
that he was deeply involved in,

670
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,040
much of it was 19th century,

671
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
and the same was true of Henry.

672
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,100
That's what David loved about Henry.

673
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,310
In the 1960s and the 1970s,

674
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,950
David was
a very unfashionable artist.

675
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,520
He was involved with
poetry, literature.

676
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:21,110
He wanted to bring all of these
things into his art.

677
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:25,240
So, David was engaging all of these
subjects that most artists

678
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,230
were working very hard to
eliminate from their work.

679
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,160
He was,

680
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,360
in many ways, a figure who was
excluded from the contemporary

681
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,080
dialogue that was taking place,

682
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,550
and to have Henry's, erm,
imprimatur, interest, friendship,

683
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,810
I think it meant a great deal
to him.

684
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,240
And he was not shy about telling
David what he liked and what he

685
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,840
didn't like about both his art
and his personality,

686
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,030
but he always did it in a very
loving, gentle way.

687
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,080
One of the things that David
relied on Henry

688
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,470
every six months or so, would be to
go through a stack of drawings,

689
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,590
and every now and then,
there'd be something,

690
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,260
and Henry would pick it up and tear
it up, throw it in the trash.

691
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:13,820
MUSIC: Una Furtiva Lagrima from
L'elisir D'Amore by Donizetti

692
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,320
If, next week,

693
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,390
this country did collapse

694
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:42,760
but on the very day it collapsed
you met your absolute true love,

695
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,960
you wouldn't give two hoots
about the bloody place collapsing,

696
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,040
would you?

697
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,270
I mean, you know, you'd think,
"Oh, all's right with the world.

698
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,810
"If we have a sandwich and a, and a
glass of beer, it doesn't matter."

699
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:01,820
# Una furtiva lagrima

700
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:11,550
# Negli occhi suoi spunto... #

701
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,350
Lots of David's portraits are about
togetherness, aren't they, really?

702
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,440
Togetherness is two people,

703
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,720
and it's always a kind
of interesting equation for him,

704
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,390
cos, in a way, we're all alone,

705
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,500
but it's nice to be part of
something and part of somebody else.

706
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,600
David and Ossie were really
good pals.

707
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,270
Ossie was a very flamboyant character

708
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,820
in his own way and single-minded.

709
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,590
In fact,
his shows were quite unique,

710
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,160
and he'd bill the music to
the fashion models,

711
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,630
to the whole catwalk experience.

712
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,530
We were all pals together

713
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,460
and I suppose leading a certain
bohemian life.

714
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,760
And it was very innocent then.

715
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,390
You were enjoying being young,

716
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,540
and in London, and doing things you
really liked doing.

717
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,400
David asked Ossie

718
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,740
and myself if we'd pose for him.

719
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,910
I remember going to Powis Terrace
and him taking lots of photographs.

720
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,120
And I know, for instance,

721
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,800
he couldn't get Ossie's feet
correctly painted,

722
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,550
so he put the shag pile carpet
on the floor

723
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,260
and hid his feet in the carpet.

724
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,240
And he made the bedroom
into the sitting room

725
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,110
cos he wanted to choose various
things that he thought were

726
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,990
to do with our personalities.

727
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,320
I met Peter
when he first came over with David.

728
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,830
There was this new person to engage
with and it was Peter.

729
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,240
I think he made a nice
home for David.

730
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,550
I think he wanted to have a,
a stylish home.

731
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:22,670
# Un solo instante I palpiti

732
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:33,390
# Del suo bel cor sentir... #

733
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,810
David had acquired the leases
on the surrounding flats

734
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:42,690
and said would I knock the walls down
between them

735
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:48,280
and make a very lovely
lateral apartment?

736
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,600
As far as I'm concerned,
I just designed the flat

737
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,000
that I'd want for myself.

738
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,020
Little did I know, I'd later have it.

739
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,680
David's quite sociable,
so he likes to give parties,

740
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,630
to have people around,

741
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,920
so to have a big room at one end
of the apartment and at the other

742
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,680
and then a beautiful long
gallery between them,

743
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,070
that was very appealing.

744
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:21,070
# ..Confondere I miei coi suoi sospir

745
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,120
# Cielo! Si puo morir! #

746
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:45,100
Peter dealt with curtains and tiles
and finishes and furniture.

747
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,250
Peter would go out
and hunt for things

748
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,580
and then he'd take David to
see them and decide together.

749
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,200
He would go out to the market and

750
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,760
buy vases and, you know...

751
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,970
bits and pieces,
but if it was like a big thing,

752
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,810
David would get very involved.

753
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,790
He was the first person
I lived with, yeah.

754
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,710
Yeah, it was very nice,
very, very nice. You know,

755
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:22,400
when people said to me, "Ah, well,
when you said you were gay

756
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:27,550
"in 1960 or something
and, well, it was illegal,"

757
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,560
and this, that and the other...
and this, that and the other,

758
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,070
and I said,
"Well, I lived in Bohemia

759
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,380
"and Bohemia is a tolerant place."

760
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,140
When he's in London,
he quite often pops round.

761
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,300
He used to just ring the doorbell
and come in and prowl around.

762
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,720
Particularly, he liked going into
his old studio

763
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,610
and just standing there,

764
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,060
remembering all the great paintings
he did there.

765
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,740
CLAVICHORD PLAYS

00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,250
The clavichord was near a doorway

767
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,000
which was near the window.

768
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,400
And so, it was, it was...
And I was leaning against it.

769
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,210
Yes, and it was, it...

770
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,770
With all our underwear all over
the floor.

771
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,040
It was... Wayne's jockstraps
were everywhere.

772
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,610
Well, they, I needed them.

773
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,970
Oh.

774
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,580
I was playing A flat, this note.

775
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,510
And I wanted to call
the painting A Flat.

776
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,790
A small flat.

777
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,300
Cos it was.
A very small flat, yes.

778
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:14,090
But it was really
a painting about stillness.

779
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,940
I think it would have been wonderful.
It's unfinished.

780
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,200
The development of what should have
been a really beautiful,

781
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,280
serene, happy,
listening, still painting

782
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:34,150
became a huge dilemma of mixtures
of colours and unfinished sequences

783
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,970
and painting out the floor and
repainting in the background.

784
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,480
And every time we went round there,
there was something different

785
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,510
going on and I just thought,
"This will never get done."

786
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,270
He was worried about something
called the vanishing point.

787
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,960
I think the problem wasn't really
the vanishing point.

788
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,550
It was the "vanishing Peter".

789
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,720
David was splitting up with Peter,

790
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,580
and that was a very upsetting
period, for both of them, actually.

791
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,920
David was very upset.

792
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,640
He was, I think,
genuinely in love with Peter.

793
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,490
They had their troubles.
But, you know,

794
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:23,760
starting a relationship is, er,
very tricky, er, even a man

795
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,560
and a woman, and, er,
the first time either of them

796
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,040
had ever been involved in
such a relationship.

797
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,060
Of course, they were going to
have problems.

798
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,090
That was a very upsetting period.

799
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,550
I think he was taking
tranquillisers as well.

800
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,640
He was just crying a lot.

801
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,640
I mean, it had been a long period
that he'd been with Peter,

802
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,520
and it was just suddenly
a devastating point, which actually

803
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,770
did come through the picture,
because it was an unfinished scene,

804
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,260
like his life was
unfinished without him.

805
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:23,580
# Un solo instante I palpiti

806
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:34,900
# Del suo bel cor sentir! #

807
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,900
I think there were
periods of depression.

808
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I have films of him lying on

809
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,870
the water bed, obviously very
depressed, being comforted by Henry.

810
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,850
Whether that was related to
the break-up with Peter

811
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:05,000
or whether that was just
something that is endemic

812
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,120
to his personality, I'm not,
I've never been absolutely sure.

813
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,320
He can be extremely up
and then we've all seen

814
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,240
moods where he's not happy.

815
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,080
But he got a lot of support.

816
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,330
In the summer of '75 and '76,
both he and Henry

817
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:33,160
stayed all summer
at my house at the shore.

818
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,870
It was right on the beach.

819
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:45,370
He liked being
there and he liked painting.

820
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:49,880
He uses his work to escape the world.

821
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,640
And I remember he'd sit there
in the living room and paint

822
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,120
and eat out of this huge barrel of,
um, something -

823
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,130
it wasn't potato chips or something,
and pretty soon the floor

824
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:02,130
would be covered with them
like they were sawdust or something.

825
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,660
It was an absolutely...
It was a unique time.

826
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:09,800
That's where he started
the Blue Guitar series.

827
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,520
I think that was in '76.

828
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,440
I'm not sure whether that idea
came from Henry or...

829
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,640
cos Henry read a lot -
read a lot of poetry,

830
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,090
but David always read a lot, too,

831
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,240
so I don't know who got the idea,

832
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,450
but he spent all summer doing
that series.

833
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:33,460
CLASSICAL GUITAR MUSIC

834
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,850
I mean, I'd begun the etchings
and then I thought, the title,

835
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:48,130
I just thought I would call it, er,
The Blue Guitar by David Hockney,

836
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:53,960
inspired by Wallace Stevens who was
inspired by Pablo Picasso.

837
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,390
And the names could get
bigger as they go down.

838
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:07,490
The source of the poem was
a painting of Picasso,

839
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,590
and so I'm turning the poem
back into a painting and etchings.

840
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:19,290
They said, "You have a blue guitar.
You do not play things as they are."

841
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,420
The man replied,

842
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:25,060
"Things as they are are changed
upon the blue guitar."

843
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,440
And they said then, "But play you must,
a tune beyond us, yet ourselves,

844
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,170
"a tune upon the blue guitar
of things exactly as they are."

845
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,440
When I read it, you see,
I loved the phrase,

846
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,800
"You do not play things
as they are",

847
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,490
because the Philistine response to
Picasso was,

848
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,220
"You do not paint
things as they are".

849
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:53,250
Well, there's no such thing as
"things as they are".

850
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:58,410
In painting, where you deceive
the eye with all sorts of devices

851
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,570
to make things look as they are...

852
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:05,600
I don't know, this, the poem just
triggered ideas in my head.

853
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,320
So, I started making drawings
which are just inventions,

854
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,220
which was, er, a change for me
from the past two years.

855
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,050
I... In the painting, for instance,
there's things...

856
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:21,450
Er, the coloured line right at the
top is simply a coloured line,

857
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,370
so that's absolutely as it is.
There's no illusion there.

858
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:28,800
But the water falling
is illusionistic.

859
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,680
And you make references to other
kinds of painting.

860
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,520
I mean, playing games like that
seemed such fun to me.

861
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,190
I just went on and on.

862
01:03:55,770 --> 01:04:00,810
The work has always been this
core of David's life.

863
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:04,370
The first break-up was very
difficult for him.

864
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,930
But the art is the thing

865
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:11,570
that gives him the anchor,
in life and in the world.

866
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,660
I mean, I think
anything that happens,

867
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,920
as long as he's able to, er,
see the world through his painting

868
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,290
and stuff, he could...
he could survive anything.

869
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,160
I've, you know... I've taken
photographs for a long, long time

870
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,870
and I have about 100 albums
full of photographs.

871
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:58,920
All of life,
it's all recorded pictorially.

872
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,720
Most people who ever come into it,
I photograph in some way.

873
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,480
And later, maybe I draw them

874
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,000
but usually I don't draw them
instantly, I just take a snap.

875
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,660
It is like a diary.

876
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,500
I'm just a snapper, really.

877
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,440
We see so many photographic images
and film images

878
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,200
and they're so mainstream,

879
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,790
we're so used to
thinking of those as the way

880
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,280
of representing the world,

881
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,030
but he knows that one can do
things with painting

882
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:48,790
that one cannot do with, with erm,
photographic technologies.

883
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:52,240
One can express visions
of the world, ways of seeing,

884
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,200
that invite you to look at things

885
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,230
that you would only just glance at
if it was a photograph

886
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:59,640
or even if you were seeing
it in reality.

887
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,720
He's introducing something much more
personal, something more moving.

888
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,750
And he's trying with many tactics

889
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,300
to show that painting can do this.

890
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,270
I'd become very, very aware of this

891
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:25,370
frozen moment that was very
unreal to me.

892
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,310
The photographs didn't really have
life in the way a drawing

893
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,080
or painting did.

894
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,670
And I realised it couldn't
because of what it is.

895
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:38,670
Compared to Rembrandt looking at
himself for hours and hours

896
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,640
and scrutinising his face,
and putting all these

897
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,560
hours into the picture
that you're going to look at,

898
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,390
naturally, there's many more hours
there than even you can give it.

899
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:51,110
A photograph is the other way round.

900
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,920
It's a fraction of a second, frozen.

901
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,710
So, the moment you've
looked at it for even four seconds,

902
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:01,390
you're looking at it for far more
than the camera did.

903
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:03,290
And, er, I...

904
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:06,930
er, it dawned on me that this
was visible, actually.

905
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:12,290
It IS visible, and, er,
the more you become aware of it,

906
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:14,290
the more this is a terrible
weakness.

907
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,530
Drawings
and paintings do not have this.

908
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:22,650
I made a little photographic
experiment with the Polaroid,

909
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:25,800
by putting 30 of them
together, made a,

910
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,080
a photograph of this house in a way
that I'd been trying to paint

911
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,150
the house from three different
viewpoints.

912
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:37,790
And the photograph excited me
so much and...

913
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:44,750
Well, time WAS appearing
in the picture and, because of it,

914
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:48,290
space - a bigger illusion of space.

915
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:51,670
Now, the space is an illusion -
I was aware of that,

916
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,840
but the time is not an illusion.

917
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,870
It is real and accounted for
in the number of pictures.

918
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,080
You KNOW it took time to
take them, wait for them,

919
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,720
put them down and so on.
And this began...

920
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:11,120
I realised was, er,
giving you this illusion of space

921
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,260
that we had not seen - I had not
seen - in a photograph before.

922
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,010
I'm interested in pictures,

923
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,240
made any way,
and the visible world

924
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,930
and representing it.

925
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:58,170
That's why Picasso is always
interesting.

926
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:03,130
He never left the visible world -
never left depiction, actually.

927
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:15,330
RAIN FALLS GENTLY

928
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:35,830
His greatest hero for most
of his life has been Pablo Picasso,

929
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:39,480
whose art moves through phases
and different approaches

930
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,600
and styles with great frequency
throughout a long life.

931
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,010
So David's aware of the fact

932
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,160
that almost everything he does
is going to sell the second

933
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,680
he's put his name to it and he does
not want to become a machine

934
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,550
for producing items of value.

935
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:28,040
He frequently ran into periods
when...

936
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,480
he was dissatisfied with, erm,
what he was doing

937
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,470
and thrashing about looking for
new and different ways of doing it.

938
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,830
He did not like just
going on using...

939
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:45,340
His...immense facility for drawing
didn't satisfy his ambition.

940
01:10:56,370 --> 01:11:01,730
Surfaces that you can decide
where to look, I find fascinating.

941
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:05,610
You know, in a way, with water,

942
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,930
you can look at a reflection,

943
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:11,190
then you're looking at the surface,

944
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,880
or you can suddenly take the
reflection away

945
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,300
and look through it...

946
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,640
And somehow
the problem of depicting it

947
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:28,650
becomes a wonderful way of,
in your head,

948
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:33,750
thinking of graphic terms
and devices to depict it all.

949
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,390
Early ones are done with very,
very stylised

950
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,400
form in the water -

951
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,650
jigsaw shapes with a heavy blue line
describing the interlocking shapes

952
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,800
as though somebody's jumped
in the pool

953
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,780
and all the shapes are dancing.

954
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:09,170
The painting called The Sunbather -
the dancing line is yellow,

955
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,890
which happens if it's very sunny

956
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:15,850
and you get this dancing yellow
line all the time.

957
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,010
Later on I could make
the water look very fluid

958
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:32,560
and wet by putting acrylic paint
that was very, very diluted,

959
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,810
and you put a detergent in it,
so when you paint on the canvas,

960
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,270
the canvas soaks it
up like blotting paper.

961
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:51,270
Even the painting of the Splash,
for instance -

962
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,020
somehow what I quite
liked about doing it was

963
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:59,810
the perversity of painting something
that lasts for one second.

964
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:05,120
But it took me seven clays'
work to paint the splash itself.

965
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,980
If you look carefully, it's painted
in single lines with a small brush.

966
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:21,200
I like the idea, you see,
of a realistic painting,

967
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,560
of a real figure,
looking at another figure

968
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,670
but the other figure is distorted
naturally by the water.

969
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,190
COW MOOS

970
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,660
SHEEP BLEATS

971
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,190
I was the technical director

972
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:12,650
when the Met opened
the French triple bill.

973
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,130
What we did was to take David's
pieces, in the case of Parade,

974
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:20,380
the ideas of someone

975
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,850
who's basically not working
all the time in the theatre,

976
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,920
and translate them to the stage,

977
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,460
but add the things that you know
that...that make it...make it work.

978
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,840
Oh, I think the challenges were,
for him, just the scale of things.

979
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,530
This is a model of the Metropolitan
Opera stage.

980
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:49,020
And the story of the opera
is about a naughty child.

981
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,010
And the little boy says,

982
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,890
"I'm fed up of being good.
I want to be wicked."

983
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,610
So, he picks up
a poker from the fireplace,

984
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:01,980
He runs around the room,
he smashes the teapot.

985
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:10,960
MUSIC: L'Enfant Et Les Sortileges

986
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,240
Very shortly after the Met
reopened, there was Parade,

987
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,200
in the wintertime when everyone is
desperate for light

988
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,920
and colour and here is something
totally fresh, totally new,

989
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,770
something unlike anyone
had ever seen at the Met.

990
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:28,480
Um, and I think it just...

991
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,280
It lifted people's spirits
and it...

992
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,570
it kind of took them
to a different place.

993
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:37,710
And David was a major instrument
in having that happen.

994
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,090
Henry and David in Europe,
they would arrive in a European City

995
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,320
and immediately go to
the opera house,

996
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,970
look to see what was playing,
get tickets.

997
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:06,090
And then they'd go to the museum.

998
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,610
Then they'd have lunch
and they'd go back to the hotel.

999
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,920
Henry would write.

1000
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,000
David would have his sketch pad
and his coloured pencils.

1001
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,360
Then they'd have a nap.

1002
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,950
Then they'd come out, have dinner,
go to the opera house.

1003
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,480
MUSIC: Tristan Und Isolde by Wagner

1004
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,730
There's a lot of music.

1005
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,850
There's often four minutes of music
with nobody singing, which means

1006
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,610
you've to be looking at something.

1007
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:43,400
In fact, you've to be looking
at something in an interesting way

1008
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,820
to hear that music,
to really hear it.

1009
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:51,850
So, we'll figure a way, you know,
to slowly reveal the forest

1010
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:54,050
and so on, I mean,
just do it very slowly.

1011
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,250
'Tristan And Isolde,'

1012
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,280
I worked for a year in here on it.

1013
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,640
One year, actually, it took,

1014
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,330
'matching the music
and getting the colours and things.

1015
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:08,340
'It was a long, big job. I used'

1016
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,360
to sit up here with it and I'd...

1017
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:18,360
We had a big model with lights,
and I had all these little lights

1018
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,410
where I could, er,
change it and do things.

1019
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,560
Sometimes, I'd smoke a joint

1020
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,930
and then put on the music
and fiddle with the lights.

1021
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,630
It was terrific, actually,
that, doing it.

1022
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:41,210
And, I must confess the other night
I saw Tosca, I was looking

1023
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:46,560
at Tosca, and it suddenly occurred
to me that the only Puccini opera

1024
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,170
that doesn't have a lot of cruelty
in it is, um, Boheme.

1025
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:53,930
At least she dies, er, from TB.

1026
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,050
This opera,
not only does nobody die,

1027
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:02,360
it ends on the best note of hope
I've ever come across

1028
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,540
on a musical stage, I think,

1029
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,260
that there is real hope for us
wretched people.

1030
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,420
This is actually the drawing we're
finally using to make

1031
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,930
the set for the Poulenc opera, which
is a scene in the South of France.

1032
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:18,980
It's supposed to be jolly
and pretty. Erm...

1033
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,570
'Unlike some designers
and unlike some artists,

1034
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,720
'David was completely swept up
with the music.

1035
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,530
'To him,
the music suggested visual things

1036
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:33,450
'and I think that was a big appeal.'

1037
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:36,180
And one of the things that often
is missing

1038
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,200
in theatrical productions is that
kind of reverence for,

1039
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,640
for the...for the work of art,

1040
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,210
but also a kind of willingness
to be completely one

1041
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,770
with its slightly sentimental side,

1042
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,320
and David loved that.

1043
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,860
MUSIC: Parade by Eric Satie

1044
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:20,250
'It's gone now for me, music.'

1045
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:25,440
I don't go to the opera any more
because I can't really hear it.

1046
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,640
I mean,

1047
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,770
I'd have to sit right at the front
or something.

1048
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:32,540
I mean, I...I don't go because

1049
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,240
if you go, I leave the theatre
a bit depressed.

1050
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,200
Well, he's just coming off of
his theatre work, OK, and he's

1051
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,440
fed up with that.

1052
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,410
He doesn't know what
he wants to do next

1053
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:21,250
and he is kind of loose at
this moment.

1054
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,200
And he's visiting friends and he's
having a good time in New York,

1055
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,780
and he comes over for dinner,
OK, to see what I'm up about.

1056
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:32,410
And so, I show him the, er,
great Ellsworth Kelly paper images.

1057
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,050
And he's absolutely thunderstruck.
He's moved, really moved.

1058
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:39,010
And he also said, you know,
'These, Ken, are fantastic.

1059
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,540
"How are they made?"

1060
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,260
So I said, "Well, you know,
stay for, you know, after dinner.

1061
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,570
"Stay till tomorrow and I'll show you.
We'll make up a couple of pieces of paper

1062
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:48,080
"and I'll show you how it's done."

1063
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,290
That, that's the turn-on, you know.
"Oh, you'll show me? OK."

1064
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,980
So we started to play.

1065
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,730

01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:05,850
At first he confessed

1067
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,490
about, "Oh, I don't want to do this.

1068
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:10,010
"I have to make every
one of these myself," you know.

1069
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:12,140
"They're not reproducible,"
you know.

1070
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:15,210
"I don't know
whether I want to do all these."

1071
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:18,220
But he did all these,
and every time he did a new one,

1072
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,810
he wanted to make another one.

1073
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,080
And we wound up working
18 hours a day.

1074
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,970
I mean, it was slave labour
for 49 days.

1075
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,620
All of us just loved it.
We couldn't get enough of it.

1076
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:32,260
Because each and every piece
he made was just one more note

1077
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:38,080
of greatness that he was
putting down for us to hear, to see.

1078
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,600
And he knew that he was onto
something as much as we did.

1079
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:55,980
I think Paper Pools helped him
tremendously in his painting.

1080
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,190
Yeah, I really do.

1081
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,280
Um, because I think it freed him up.

1082
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:08,690
I think it also gave him a different
kind of idea about colour,

1083
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,950
how to use colour more boldly.

1084
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,930
Come on, Stanley. Come on.

1085
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,490
'David loved having the dachshunds
down there and walking on the beach.'

1086
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,880
DOG BARKS

1087
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:16,480
'But I think, ultimately, David's house
in Malibu, it wasn't very David.

1088
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,350
'I mean, it was very David
in its kind of hominess,

1089
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:21,790
'but I don't think it ever became

1090
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,280
'his home, I mean, David's never been
a weekend person, so

1091
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,070
'I thought it was a bit strange.

1092
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:29,500
'And it was decorated very nicely
and cosy.

1093
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,620
'It was very funky and old-fashioned,
unlike slick Malibu at the time.'

1094
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,430
But, er, as anybody that's
lived in LA knows,

1095
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:43,390
it's actually a long way to go to go
have lunch or to have a dinner

1096
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,880
and get in the car and drive.

1097
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,760
It was a transitional time.

1098
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,700
A lot of David's older friends were
not there all the time.

1099
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:08,030
It was a world in the 1970s
where to be gay was

1100
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,030
to be beautiful and fashionable.

1101
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,800
There in the palm of your hands.

1102
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,840
When David came to New York, a lot
of times, he was here to party.

1103
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,840
He would go to the baths.

1104
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,280
He would go out to the bars.

1105
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,740
He was having a good time.

1106
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,470
And then, all of a sudden,
AIDS came along

1107
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:34,750
and suddenly things went exactly
in the opposite direction,

1108
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,520
and it... It was like a plague.

1109
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,440
One person after the next would
come down with AIDS

1110
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,730
and it was quite simply
a death sentence.

1111
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,920
I think it was something that

1112
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,010
shook David to his core.

1113
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,960
You think about them every day

1114
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,830
and then you stop it,

1115
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,920
because there's too many, actually,

1116
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:50,120
er, and it would

1117
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,590
rather drive you mad
if you think about it.

1118
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:58,770
Er, and slowly, you have to realise
it's kind of part of...

1119
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:02,920
it's become part of your life,
this, er...

1120
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,350
something you never, ever expected.

1121
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,150
At the time, I couldn't
write down all the people.

1122
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:21,970
I mean...

1123
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,120
It did change New York.

1124
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:30,480
I think it's THAT that changed it
more than anything else,

1125
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,510
because I...

1126
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:37,320
When I think of all those people,
if they were still there

1127
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:41,420
in New York, New York would be
different today, it would.

1128
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,120
There would be Bohemia still.

1129
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,680
And that's the world I arrived
in and that's the world

1130
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,340
I lived in, actually.

1131
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,840
Two thirds of the people that he was
really close to

1132
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,720
suddenly just weren't there any more.

1133
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,130
They just disappeared.

1134
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,290
And Henry, when Henry died,
it really was the final blow.

1135
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,990
Of course, Henry didn't die of
anything to do with HIV or AIDS,

1136
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:14,590
but I think that was
a terrible blow for David.

1137
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:23,410
When Henry died, it affected
David, I think, particularly badly

1138
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:26,350
because I think he realised he was
never going to find another person

1139
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,670
who knew him as well as Henry did.

1140
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:34,560
Truman Capote once said, "Love is
never having to finish a sentence."

1141
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,490
And what that means is you're
so much on the same page

1142
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,720
with the other person,
you can begin a sentence

1143
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,150
and they immediately know
what you're going to say.

1144
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,310
It's that kind of communication

1145
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:49,550
that Henry had with David and vice
versa. And when Henry died, that was

1146
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:53,290
something that David never really
discovered in anybody else again.

1147
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,210
CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYS

1148
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,550
FIRE CRACKLES

1149
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:24,350
So, I goes round to David's,
you see, one morning,

1150
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:27,410
and he's got this colour TV set
and he says, er, and says,

1151
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:30,200
"Ah, would you like to see it?
You ever seen colour TV?"

1152
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,050
And he switches it on,
you see, and he gets the colour

1153
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,770
and he turns the colour up
right full on,

1154
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,480
as far as the knobs'll go,
you know, and he goes, "Aye."

1155
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,440
And he looks like this
and he says, "Aye,"

1156
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,780
he says, "you can have it Fauvist
if you want," you know.

1157
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:50,400
# Happy birthday, dear David

1158
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,940
# Happy birthday to you. #

1159
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,530
CHEERING

1160
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,080
WOMAN: Oh, he's icing his cake.
Oh, you see that?

1161
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,880
'There's a wonderful self-portrait

1162
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,840
'he did on his birthday,
where he literally

1163
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,440
'took off his Brooks Brothers
red-and-white striped shirt'

1164
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,280
and laid it on the copying machine
and printed it in red.

1165
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,360
It's a wonderful...
And then he drew his face

1166
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,530
and did the self-portrait.

1167
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,190
He has such bravura

1168
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:28,820
because he has such amazing
ability as a draughtsman.

1169
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:37,890
FAX MACHINE BEEPS

1170
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,790
When the plain paper fax came,

1171
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,230
where you could have
individual pieces of paper,

1172
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:45,590
David bought back that

1173
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:48,560
pattern he uses all the time
of doing pictures in grids,

1174
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,000
so that the small piece of paper can
suddenly become

1175
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,260
this enormous picture.

1176
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,120
WOMAN: Oh, it's tennis.

1177
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,310
There's two players,
a net in the middle.

1178
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,180
APPLAUSE

1179
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,880
He even sent a big show,
a whole show, to Brazil,

1180
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,720
to the Biennale, er,
that he never went to.

1181
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,030
He just gave the instructions of how
to put it up and it was put up.

1182
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:19,030
I think he thought it was amusing
that hand was coming back

1183
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:21,560
to this technology that most
people in business

1184
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,540
were using to communicate contracts
and legal deals.

1185
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,670
I think he's always looking for
new tools.

1186
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:34,630
He takes something that
seems very common and everyday.

1187
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:38,770
And in 2009, David had
already done, I think,

1188
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:41,650
about 200 of the iPhone drawings.

1189
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,960
Most of them were flowers.

1190
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,640
We all got them
in New York, when we woke up

1191
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,130
in the morning,
so you'd have this wonderful flower

1192
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:49,100
in the sunlight
of his bedroom window.

1193
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,560
Then the iPad came out

1194
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,960
and then the drawings got
so even more amazing, but also you

1195
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,200
could do the playback of the
animation of the actual drawing,

1196
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,920
which was a huge new thing.

1197
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:05,000
Even David had never been able to
watch his own work as it was

1198
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,020
unfolding.

1199
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,970
I think it was a real lens
into David's creative process.

1200
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:21,390
Stanley.

1201
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:24,710
Good boy. Good boy.

1202
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,610
He's a good boy.

1203
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,990
Thank you. You're welcome.

1204
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:59,210
I think that David wants us
to think differently.

1205
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:02,120
He wants us to see differently
and think differently.

1206
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,290
He makes you stand in the painting.

1207
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:07,490
He makes you look up and left
and right and down.

1208
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:10,720
And you, the experience
becomes a different one

1209
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,900
from the traditional easel painting.

1210
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:21,670
David thought that
the idea of a viewer

1211
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:25,440
and the vanishing point was very
anti-humanistic.

1212
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,230
And the idea of you
being the vanishing point

1213
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:31,840
and the world around you
opening up to you

1214
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,330
was almost a religious concept
in David's mind, I think.

1215
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:48,090
I think there is possibly
a great connection

1216
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:53,900
between the way we depict space
and the way we behave in it.

1217
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,520
I've always thought
perspective was a problem,

1218
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,590
so anything that is now helping
to change it, like this

1219
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:16,190
photograph I did on an iPhone,
I find quite exciting, actually.

1220
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:23,440
This is... This seems to me
to be widening perspectives.

1221
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,390
It's a different perspective, wider.

1222
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:30,610
Things are opening out,
it seems to me.

1223
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:35,600
It's better to go that way than
that way, I think.

1224
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,830
That way is...
better than doing that, I think.

1225
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,920
He realised that there was
a non-photographic way

1226
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:02,830
of seeing the world,
which David really embraced.

1227
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,760
Particularly because we don't
see the world through one eye,

1228
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,410
we see the world through
two eyes spatially,

1229
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:13,010
and I think that the spaces
of California, the Grand Canyon,

1230
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:16,940
all of those things excited him,
and he always thought that painting

1231
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:20,380
could express those things in ways
that photography couldn't.

1232
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:25,390
He always said one photograph
is not good enough

1233
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,480
and that photo collages were

1234
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,060
an attempt to try to have
a wider perspective.

1235
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,580
He kept saying, "Wider perspectives
are needed now."

1236
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,500
'There are some good landscape
photographs.'

1237
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,760
There are, but not that many.

1238
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,810
Partly because, I mean,

1239
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:09,800
cameras see surfaces,
they don't see space.

1240
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:11,260
But WE see space.

1241
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,880
I think the thrill in landscape

1242
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:18,450
is a spatial thrill, actually.

1243
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:19,630
I think so.

1244
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,670
Nature is the endless infinity,
isn't it?

1245
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:23,750
You always go back
to nature for things.

1246
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:25,020
I mean...

1247
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,950
That's what I was
doing in Yorkshire, yeah.

1248
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:38,930
He ate it, yeah.

1249
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,680
So, now we've got an I

1250
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:42,800
that's been made into an X.

1251
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:44,520
You ate it, didn't you, Barney?

1252
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,640
See that letter there, look? That X?

1253
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,110
Barney ate the X.
So I had to make a new one.

1254
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:51,170
So you had to make one from an I.
Yeah.

1255
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:53,000
And what about that missing I?

1256
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,010
That's totally confused me now.
I realise what's thrown me out.

1257
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,820
You never had too many ls.

1258
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:59,130
It's lack of the I.

1259
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,130
Yeah, in this game.

1260
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:02,500
65. That's, er, K.

1261
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,810
I don't believe it.
And you've got 177?

1262
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:11,560
Yeah. And I'm 65? I'm 193.

1263
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,110
You've not been watching.

1264
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:16,760
And that, also, you see, Barney
helping's not much help, really.

1265
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,010
No, he's a bit thick.

1266
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,880
He can't spell that good, really.

1267
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,320
No, he can't spell at all.

1268
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,560
Would you like the timer?

1269
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,480
No, I would not, sir. Thank you.

1270
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,070
DAVID LAUGHS

1271
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:40,840
My mother was a very,
very...strong woman.

1272
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:46,070
She could look at me with
piercing eyes.

1273
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,400
All right.

1274
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,500
Oh, there they are.

1275
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,040
She died at 99. She lived

1276
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,660
most of the 20th century.

1277
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,690
She was born in 1900

1278
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,500
and died in 1999.

1279
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:08,520
Ooh, are you feeling it, Paul?

1280
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,950
No. Oh.

1281
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,090
Great! The Queen's on!

1282
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:18,450
'She had four of her children there
when she died,

1283
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,170
'so she was blessed, actually.'

1284
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,520
Cheers.

1285
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,830
Cheers.

1286
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:29,260
'I think her last act of will
was waiting for John to come

1287
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,680
'from Australia.'

1288
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:32,560
Do you want some more cream, David?

1289
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,370
Oh, just a little bit, please.
That's enough.

1290
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,170
'There? Yes, thank you.'

1291
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:41,600
The last night I stayed up with her
telling her John would be

1292
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,960
here in a few minutes.

1293
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,170
And then she died two hours later.

1294
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:50,100
But he was very pleased
that he'd got there

1295
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,350
and she knew he'd got there.

1296
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:17,830
I remember 1966 and
I've just arrived back in Bradford,

1297
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:20,440
and you can tell, I've just come
back from Hollywood.

1298
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,160
And I put a cigarette in my mouth

1299
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,710
and my father's trying to take
it out of my hand.

1300
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:30,180
And that's 50 years ago now.

1301
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:33,470
And I'm just about to outlive him,
I think, this year.

1302
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:53,640
Back then, in the '50s, you've
got to remember that a young painter

1303
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,000
was 40.

1304
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,090
So, if you were going to be
a painter,

1305
01:39:58,090 --> 01:40:01,960
it took a tremendous amount of
commitment then...

1306
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:07,000
that you had to face the fact that
you'd probably be digging roads

1307
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,690
or working in the mill or anything

1308
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:12,930
until you got old enough
to be a young painter.

1309
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:21,480
In those days,

1310
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,840
there was a tremendous
amount of aggression going on,

1311
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,490
and I was involved with various
gangs and things.

1312
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:30,560
I was all in all sorts of fights,
always was.

1313
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,090
But Dave was much tougher than me.

1314
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:35,960
He wasn't involved with fights
and things.

1315
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,640
But he'd go around with
his bowler hat on

1316
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:42,810
and his moleskin trousers,
pushing a pram

1317
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:46,200
with an easel, canvas and paints.

1318
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:50,840
And it takes
a bit of strength to do that.

1319
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:53,620
I couldn't have done that.

1320
01:40:55,480 --> 01:41:01,330
# L is for the way you look at
me... #

1321
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,730
When David left to go to America,

1322
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:07,700
he just changed his pram for
whatever else there was out there.

1323
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,130
It was the same thing.

1324
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:12,270
In a way, LA was another Bradford.

1325
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:19,000
His whole outlook on things,
in many ways, has stayed the same.

1326
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,810
I mean, there were things
that opened up for him,

1327
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:25,120
like the gay thing and all that.

1328
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,100
I mean, that, that was
a tremendous influence on him.

1329
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:32,710
But, basically,
he's still searching.

1330
01:41:57,690 --> 01:42:03,740
# L is for the way you look at me

1331
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:10,170
# O is for the only one I see

1332
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:16,570
# V is very, very extraordinary

1333
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:22,330
# E is even more than anyone
that you adore can

1334
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:28,250
# Love is all that
I can give to you

1335
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:34,570
# Love is more than just
a game for two

1336
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:37,410
# Two in love can make it

1337
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:40,690
# Take my heart and please don't
break it

1338
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:45,610
# Love was made for me and you

1339
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:50,920
# Love was made for me and you

1340
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:54,380
# Love was made... #

1341
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,150
