穿过大风雪
through the blizzard, through the gale...

曾经一切平静! 曾经一切流畅

不管你是穷人还是富人
You may be poor or rich it doesn't matter which

Millionaires, they get theirs like the butcher and the baker

He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:33,505
所以你最好老实点 迎接小生命

Every time his funny little whistle sounds

29
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:11,977
每个人都很困乏
Everybody hurries to the circus grounds

“On the treetop”

37
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,811
这是哪里了?
Where are we here? Oh, here.

When we get our pay we throw our money all away

With happy hearts It's circus day today

难道你不认为这些是你从未见过最有趣的? 看看它的耳朵
Ain't that the funniest thing you ever saw? Look at his ears.

150
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:00,402
嘿 快看 一只象
Hey, guys, look it! Smitty's an elephant!

151
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,658
- 让我看看 - 啵!
- Aw, let me see! - Boo!

152
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,451
- 象妈妈把它藏起来了 - 它不出来了
- You can't hide him from us. - Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

153
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,077
我们要看  
- Come on! - We wanna see him!

154
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,122
- 我们要看哪 - 我们来这就是为了看这个的 
- We wanna laugh. - Sure, that's what we came for.

155
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:21,128
世界上最大的弹弓
Hey, the biggest slingshot in the world.

156
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,381
我抓到你了 
Hey! Cut that out! Hey, let's get out of here.

157
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:27,300
怎么回事啊?
You're hurting me! Help! Here, you! What's going on?

158
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,554
停止! Mrs.Jumbo
Down. Mrs.Jumbo, down!

159
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,474
当心她
Surround her. Tie her down.

160
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,824
当心
Get down!

161
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,826
安静下来! 带她出去 
Calm down! Tie her down!

162
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,107
'疯狂大象'   '小心! '
Darling, it was so funny.

163
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,442
真有意思! 你能拍它吗?
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

164
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:41,320
它小的时候 我还以为它会死掉呢
When she doused the ringmaster, I just thought I'd die.

165
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,198
好了 大伙 我想她做的大过份了
Well, personally, I think she went a bit too far.

166
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,699
不管怎么样我们都该保持淑女形象啊
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.

167
00:20:46,742 --> 00:20:48,451
- 你说的对 亲爱的 - 非常对
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes. - Oh, that's very true.

168
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,911
不过我想那是出于母爱吧
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.

169
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,371
但是也不能当做胡来的藉口啊
But it's certainly no excuse for what she did.

170
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,458
也许母爱让她冲昏了头啦! 
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.

171
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,959
女孩们 听着! 我不想吃东西时
It's true, my dear, and she has such a streak in...

172
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,002
过于宁静
A guy can't eat in peace.

173
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:03,087
是的 但是妈妈喜欢...
Yes, but mother love does...

174
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:05,381
总是在闲聊
Gab, gab, gab. Always gossipin'.

175
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,884
女孩们 听着! 
Girls, girls! Listen!

176
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,386
如果我有个像他这样的儿子啊
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

177
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,347
- 继续说啊 - 继续
- Well, darling, tell us all. - Go on, go on.

178
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:19,059
我今天听说啊 主人将她监禁了
Well, I heard today that they have put her in solitary confinement.

179
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:21,144
- 哦 不  - 你不是那个意思!
- No! - You don't mean it!

180
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:23,730
好可怕的事啊! 
Oh, how awful for her!

181
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:26,607
那么我要说啊 任何事情我都不会怪她的
Well, I-I must say, I-I don't blame her for anything.

182
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:30,485
完全正确! 都是那个小怪物的错...
You're absolutely right. It's all the fault of that little...

183
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,613
都是他那对鬼-耳-朵
F-R-E-A-K.

184
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:38,158
就是嘛! 那对鬼耳朵只有他妈才会喜欢哪
Yes, him with those ears that only a mother could love.

185
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,412
他耳朵没有什么不好啊
What's the matter with his ears

186
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,581
我看不出有什么不好的 我觉得很可爱耶
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em. I think they're cute.

187
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:49,293
女士们 女士们! 这一点也不好笑
Ladies, ladies! It's no laughing matter at all.

188
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,628
哦 她是对的
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

189
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:56,215
别忘了我们大象连走路都带着尊严哪
Don't forget that we elephants have always walked with dignity.

190
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,717
那个耳朵使我们觉得丢脸
His disgrace is our own shame.

191
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,760
- 说的对 - 当然是
- Yes, that's true. That's very true. - Oh, indeed it is.

192
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:05,556
坦白说 我不愿意跟他吃同样的干草了
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat at the same bale of hay with him.

193
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:06,973
我也不…我也不愿意
No. Right.Me either, dearie.

194
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,768
我也有这种感觉
I should say.Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

195
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:12,270
它走过来了
Here he comes now.

196
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:16,064
我们假装没看到它
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

198
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:25,573
你喜欢这样吗? 每只象都那么冷淡这小家伙好可怜喔
How do ya like that? Givin' him the cold shoulder.

199
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:29,952
可怜的小家伙
Poor little guy.

200
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:34,371
它失望的走了 它没有朋友 
There he goes, without a friend in the world.

201
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:38,249
也没有人可以依赖
Nobody to turn to.

202
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:43,462
我一定要为他尽点力才行
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

203
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:50,468
一只老鼠
A mouse!

204
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,641
你们喜欢欺负小东西 是不是?
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?

205
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,392
你们来找我啊
Well, why don't you pick on me?

206
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:09,234
你们以为你们的血统很优越吗?
A proud race.

207
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,568
可是你们却没有种! 
Overstuffed hay bags!

209
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,999
居然怕一支小老鼠
Still afraid of a mouse.

210
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,293
我要去告诉那小家伙
Ho-ho, boy. Wait'll I tell the little guy.

211
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,129
你在哪里啊? Dumbo
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

212
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,882
可以出来了
You can come out now.

213
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:40,384
是不是我吓到你了 Dumbo?
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

214
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,678
你出来嘛! 我是你的朋友哦
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

215
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:44,722
快点出来啊 好吗?
Come on out, won't ya?

216
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,850
你不会连我这么小你都害怕吧?
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?

217
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,854
你会害怕我? 是
Ya are? Must've overdid it in there.

218
00:23:53,895 --> 00:23:56,647
我不是那个意思 我只是有时有点奇怪而已 
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

219
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,694
Dumbo 看我给你带来什么了 
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

220
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,824
你要先出来才行啊 Dumbo
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Ya gotta come out first.

221
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,248
我知道也许你不信赖我
Too bad ya don't trust me, 'cause I thought...

222
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:22,170
除了你我 你要考虑考虑你妈呀
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we might get your mother out of the clink.

223
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,171
我猜你没兴趣吧
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't be interested. So long, Dumbo.

224
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:33,845
那我只好走 再见了 Dumbo! 
Well, that's more like it.

225
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,555
你知道 你妈妈并不是真疯狂
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

226
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,017
她只是为你操碎了心
She's just brokenhearted.

227
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:42,936
没有人能够不为你的耳朵而烦恼的 
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.

228
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:46,314
老天啊! 我不该这样说你的 对不对?
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

229
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:51,360
你快乐一点嘛 Dumbo 我觉得你的耳朵还是很漂亮的
Aw, gee, Dumbo. I think your ears are beautiful.

230
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:55,362
当然啦 事实上我觉得你又灵巧又可爱
Sure. As a matter of fact, I think they're very decorative.

231
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,408
有很多大耳朵的人都很有名
You know, lots of people with big ears are famous.

232
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,743
老弟 我们最重要的是要有个特色 对不对?
Ho-ho, boy. All we gotta do is build an act.

233
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:05,872
要做一个大明星
Make ya a star. A headliner!

234
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:08,249
头号大明星 Dumbo
Dumbo the Great!

235
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,087
最伟大的?
Uh-oh. The great what?

236
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:20,091
你知道吗 Dumbo 我们有个好主意
Ya know, Dumbo, we gotta get an idea.

237
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:24,095
可不是普通的主意哦 是特别的主意
Not just any idea. Something colossal, like, uh...

238
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:27,932
我有个好主意
Have I got an idea! What an idea!

239
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,266
他们是不会有好主意的
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.

240
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,645
想象一下 我需要有一支大象
Just visualize: One elephant climbs up...

241
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:37,982
爬到其它大象顶上去
on top of another elephant until finally...

242
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:40,316
直到最后十七支大象
all 17 elephants...

243
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,820
排成一个出色的队形
have constructed an enormous pyramid...

244
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:45,988
金字塔形
of pachyderms.

245
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:48,573
这个时候我站出来 
I step out.

246
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:50,575
吹哨子
I blow the whistle.

247
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,119
- 耶 - 号声和鼓声齐奏   
- Yeah. - The trumpets are trumpeting.

248
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,038
- 耶 - 然后我们的节目
- Yeah. - And now...

249
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,456
就出现高潮了!
comes the climax!

250
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,417
什么是高…高潮啊?
Yeah? What is the climax?

251
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,961
我还不知道呢
Hmm. I don't know.

252
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:06,379
我就知道他想不出来
I knew he never had nothin'.

253
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:09,382
也许当我睡著的时候
Well, maybe it comes to me...

254
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:13,136
我就会想到了
in a vision while I dream.

255
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,639
- Good night, Joe. - Good night, Boss.

256
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,639
高潮! 
Climax.

257
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:22,852
高潮! Dumbo 你就是那个高潮! 
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

258
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:27,271
我一会就回来 我会负责你的前途的
I'll be back in a minute. I'm gonna take care of your future.

259
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:27,864
我是你的潜意识
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.

260
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,491
和你的灵感
Your inspiration.

261
00:27:31,575 --> 00:27:34,119
现在要集中注意力了
Now, concentrate.

262
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:38,873
记得你的那群大象
Remember? Your pyramid of elephants...

263
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,082
要排成金字塔状
are standing in the ring waitin' for a climax.

264
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:45,045
- 高潮 - 现在我告诉你什么是节目高潮! 
- Climax. - You are now getting that climax.

265
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,088
- 高潮 - 什么?
- Climax. - How's the reception?

266
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:50,382
不错 就是现在
Comin' through okay? Good.

267
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,926
好! 突然从一片静寂之中出现高潮了
Suddenly, from the sidelines, comes your climax.

268
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,386
- 高潮 - 快速跑过舞台
- Climax. - Gallopin' across the arena.

269
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,432
他一路跑过滑扳道
Arena.He jumps from a springboard...to a platform.

270
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:02,767
他升上舞台了 在整个大象堆中最高点 他摇着旗子
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid, he waves a flag...

271
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,561
光辉的结束
for a glorious finish!

272
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:08,647
- 结束? - 谁来完成你的高潮戏呢?
- Finish? - And who is your climax?

273
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,649
有大耳朵的小象!
The little elephant with the big ears!

274
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:17,154
最矮的…Dumbo
The world's mightiest midget mastodon! Dumbo!

275
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,156

276
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,700

277
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,077

在这个微小...
On this tiny...

285

而不足道的球上面...
little, insignificant ball...

286
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,017
大象们要堆成一个金字塔的形状
we will construct for you...

287
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,019
这可不是开玩笑的

请你不要压我好不好啊 亲爱的?
Gaining a little weight, aren't you, honey?

然后跳上舞台
Jump on the springboard.

302
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:51,198

308
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:10,548
一幕不可思议的秀
accomplished in front of your faces.

309
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:13,258
大象们要展现
Seven jungle giants...

310
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,260
她们的柔力了
each one weighing not...

311

who will spring from this springboard...

316
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:35,860
然后一下子跳到大象群的最高平台上面  
to the top of this pyramid, waving his little flag...

317
00:31:35,943 --> 00:31:39,239
在上面摇动旗子进入这个节目的最高潮!

I never thought I'd live to see the big top fall.

326
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:22,706
都是Dumbo 我的脸也不能见人了
Because of that Dumbo, I never can show my face there again.

327

- You'll hurt the little guy. - Aw, go on.

421
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:06,422
- 不会啦! 大象根本没有感觉 - 是 它们是橡胶做的
- Elephants ain't got no feelings. - No, they're made of rubber.

422
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:09,300
这主意蛮好的 那我们去跟老板说好不好?

Yeah, sure. This is worth real dough.

426
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:18,766
我们要让大老板加多报酬 
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

434
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,627
高贵的象是不会哭的哦
and pachyderms don't cry.

435
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,795
哭又有什么用呢 对不对? 它只会让你打嗝
What's cryin' get ya anyhow? Nothin' but the hiccups.

436
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:58,966

442
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:26,947
我们到现在还不是很走运
We may have had a lot of hard luck up till now...

443
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:30,283
但是 我想我们一定会做大事[成功]的

Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

449
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,548
我想大概你肚子有点饿吧
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.

450
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:52,051
Dumbo 我们一定会成功
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

451
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:55,054
嘿 你到底怎么回事啊?

452
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:03,895

快看 快看 大象在游行 
Look out, look out Pink elephants on parade

它们来了 
Here they come Hippity-hoppity

465
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:47,746
到处都是大象

467
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:53,000

They're walking around the bed on their head

468
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:56,002
到处都是
Clippity-cloppity Arrayed in braid

469
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:58,464
勇敢些 大象
Pink elephants on parade

470
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,548
- 我做什么呢? - 我做什么呢?
- What'll I do - What'll I do

471
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:02,883
多么不同寻常的想法! 
What an unusual view

472
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,845
我可看到虫 看到了细菌
I can stand the sight of worms and look at microscopic germs

473
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:11,432
这些东西对我而言还是太多了 
But Technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me

474
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:13,433
我可不是
I am not the type to faint

475
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:15,519
以貌取人的那种人
When things are odd or things are quaint

476
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,646
所见的不一定是真的
But seein' things you know there ain't

477
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,273
说不定给你一个巨大的惊奇
Can certainly give you an awful fright

478
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,317
多奇妙的景观! 追上它们 
What a sight Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

479
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,196
我害怕 我需要你的帮助
I'm afraid, need your aid Pink elephants on parade

480
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:29,696
- 嘿 - 大象    
- Hey, hey, hey - Pink elephants

481
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,950
大象
Pink elephants

482
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,952
大象
Pink elephants

483
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:04,408
- 你看那里… - 我的天哪! 
- Well, looky here, looky here. - My, my.

484
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:06,409
这真是不寻常的事…
Why, this is most irregular.

485
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:09,078
我真是不敢相信我的眼睛
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

486
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:16,459
- 他们死了吗? - 死人是不会打鼾的
- They ain't dead, is they? - No. Dead people don't snore.Or do they?

487
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:20,046
你们在干什么啊?
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus? Come on.

488
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:24,258

Step aside, brother. Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

489
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,426
有好消息吗? 哪来的好消息?
What's the good news? What's fryin', boy?

490
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,430
- 看看下边! - 小心不要震惊得摔跤! 
- Just look down there, brother. - And prepare yourself for a shock.

491
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,230
- 我的脚呢? - 去 叫醒他
- Well, hush my beak! - Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

492
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:42,440
去看看他们在上面做什么?
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.

493
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,649
- 好 - 问问他们想要什么 
- Yeah. - And "ax" them what they want.

494
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:47,068
好的 这件事情让我来好了
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

495
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:15,341
大象嘛! 
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

496
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:18,303
哦  大象?
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

497
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,018
这有什么好笑的 你们这些孩子在下面作什么?
What's so funny? What are you boys doin' down here, anyway?

498
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,228
我们在下面干什么啊?
What are we doin' down here?

499
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,228
有没有听到他说话?
Well, hear him talk.

500
00:52:30,312 --> 00:52:33,315
飞到树上去
Go on. Fly up a tree where you belong.

501
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,735
- 老鼠兄弟! - 老鼠兄弟?
- Say, look here, Brother Rat. - Brother Rat?

502
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:41,113
听着 我不是你的兄弟 我也不是老鼠 
Now listen. I ain't your brother and I ain't no rat, see?

503
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:43,907
我认为任何一支大象
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

504
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:47,785
都不会爬树
and no elephant ain't up in no tree, either.

505
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:51,413
哦  不 我在树上?
No! No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?

506
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:53,582
树上?
Tree?

507
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,047
Dumbo.

508
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,716
Dumbo. Wake up.

509
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:07,676
Wake up, Dumbo!

510
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,346
别往下看! 我们好像确实在树上
Don't look now, but I think we're up in a tree.

511
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:43,248
不要管那些混蛋 我们走吧
Aw, don't pay no attention to them scarecrows.

512
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:46,458
Dumbo 我们回马戏团去! 
Come on, Dumbo. Let's get back to the circus.

513
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:48,586
再见了! 
So long, boy!

514
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:59,887
我真想不通我们怎么会在树上
But I wonder how we ever got up in that tree, anyway.

515
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,515
我想想看啊
Now, let's see.

516
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:07,143
大象是不会爬树的 对吧?
Elephants can't climb trees, can they?

517
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:09,769
不  不  不 太荒谬了! 
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

518
00:54:09,853 --> 00:54:12,938
是我们爬上去的?那也太高(太难)了
Couldn't jump up. Mm-mm. It's too high.

519
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:15,607
用飞的! 也许你们是飞上去的
Hey there, son. Maybe you all flew up.

520
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:20,654
飞上去?  对呀! 我们是飞上去的 
Maybe we flew up. Yeah, maybe we...

521
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:23,781
对啦 Dumbo 你可以飞了
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

522
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:26,491
我真笨 怎么以前从没这样想过呢?
Boy, am I stupid. Why didn't I think of this before?

523
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:29,911
用你的大耳朵 Dumbo 你看你的耳朵 它们是最好的翅膀呀! 
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo. Why, they're perfect wings.

524
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:34,665
这特别的天赋让你飞的! 它会让你飞得很高 很高 很高
The very things that held ya down are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

525
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:37,000
我都已经可以想像到那种情形了
I can see it all now.

526
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:39,670
Dumbo 你是世界上的第九大奇迹! 
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe!

527
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:41,962
全世界唯一会飞的大象! 
The world's only flyin' elephant!

528
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:47,008
你以前看过会飞的大象吗?
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

529
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:50,678
- 我看过马会飞啊 - 我看过龙会飞 
- Well, I've seen a horsefly. - Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

530
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:52,930
- 我看过房子会飞啊 - 嗯!
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly. - Yeah!

531
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:56,767
我也看过…
See, I've seen all that too.

532
00:54:56,851 --> 00:55:00,478
我看过花生跳舞 我听过一大群人的乐队
I've seen a peanut stand and heard a rubber band.

533
00:55:00,561 --> 00:55:03,522
我看过针眨眼呢
I seen a needle that winked its eye.

534
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:06,983
这些都不足以让我惊讶
But I be done seen about ever'thing

535
00:55:07,026 --> 00:55:09,276
至到我看见大象在飞
When I see a elephant fly

536
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,155
- 你们在说什么? - 我说至到我看到大象在飞
- What'd you say, boy? - I said when I see a elephant fly

537
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:16,700
我看到过门摇晃 听过钻戒的声音
I seen a front porch swing heard a diamond ring

538
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:19,577
我见过弯曲的铁轨
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

539
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,372
但这些都不足为奇
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

540
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:25,624
至到我见到大象在飞
When I see a elephant fly

543
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,298
我在一本关于大象的书上见过与这接近的现象
I saw a clotheshorse He rear up and buck

544
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:37,675
我还听说用蔬菜茎作的人
And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck

545
00:55:37,758 --> 00:55:40,720
我只是听说 没亲自见过 
I didn't see that I only heard

546
00:55:40,761 --> 00:55:43,430
我会提供你第一手资料的
Just to be sociable I'll take your word

547
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:46,724
- 我听说一辆车聊天呢 - 我看见棒球拍
- I heard a fireside chat - I saw a baseball bat

548
00:55:46,765 --> 00:55:49,727
我会为此而笑到死
And I just laughed till I thought I'd die

549
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:53,481
我不会对这些惊讶
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

550
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:56,649
至到我见到会飞的大象
When I see a elephant fly

552
00:56:09,076 --> 00:56:12,538
我不会对这些惊讶
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

553
00:56:12,622 --> 00:56:17,000
至到我见到会飞的大象
When I see a elephant fly

554

有翅膀的大象

555
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:24,839
当我听到大象会

556
00:56:24,922 --> 00:56:27,466
飞

让我来说说
The Reverend Rodent is gonna address you.

560

你应该要觉得惭愧才对的
You ought a be ashamed of yourselves.

561
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,154
你这么的大个子怎么可以欺负这个小可怜虫! 
A bunch of big guys like you...

562
00:56:53,238 --> 00:56:56,532
想象一下你刚出生就和母亲分离了
pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.

563
00:56:56,616 --> 00:57:00,869
那时你只是个小宝宝...
Suppose you was torn away from your mother when you was just a baby...

564
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:03,371
晚上没有人喂你...
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

565
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:08,334
也没有温暖的鼻子抱着你入睡
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk to snuzzle into.

566
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:10,752
你们会喜欢这种孤单吗...
How would you like to be left out alone...

567
00:57:10,835 --> 00:57:14,214
就在寒冷无情的夜里独处
in a cold, cruel, heartless world

568
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:17,550
你们知道为什么会这样吗? 你们知道吗?
And why? I ask ya, why?

569
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:21,636
他只是长了一对大耳朵 大家就叫他怪物
Just because he's got those big ears, they call him a freak.

570
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,846
成为马戏团里的笑柄! 
The laughingstock of the circus.

571
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,515
当它妈妈要保护它的时候...
Then when his mother tried to protect him...

572
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:28,975
马戏团还把她锁起来 
they threw her into the clink.

573
00:57:29,058 --> 00:57:32,853
甚至他们把它当小丑一样对待!
And on top of that, they made him a clown!

574
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:35,856
他好可怜喔
Socially, he's washed up.

575
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,152
你们这些冷血动物 嘲笑它对你们有什么好处?
Ah, but what's the use of talkin' to you coldhearted birds?

576
00:57:40,193 --> 00:57:42,403
来吧 开玩笑吧!
