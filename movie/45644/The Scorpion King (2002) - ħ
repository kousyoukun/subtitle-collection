2
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,618
我們幹掉巴比倫人

3
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,553
我們幹掉美索不達米亞人

4
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,291
我們幹掉亞述人

5
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:14,265
邁錫尼人、閃族人

6
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,632
但是…

7
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:21,402
我們一直沒機會

8
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,568
幹掉

9
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:25,843
阿卡得人

10
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,751
先砍手還先砍腳

11
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,019
希望神會憐憫你

12
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,996
因為我弟弟可不會憐憫你

13
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,826
我沒事

14
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,038
能當我哥算你好運

00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:51,822
在金字塔時代之前

17
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:54,485
東方崛起一支強悍的遊牧部落

18
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:57,894
橫掃古老世界的蠻荒大地

19
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,009
按照部落習俗

20
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:14,069
他們推舉強者為王

21
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,585
他名叫曼能

22
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,483
曼能刀法如神，武功蓋世

23
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:48,408
身邊有一位巫師

24
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,279
能預言每場戰役的勝負

25
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:55,382
曼能大肆剷除異己

26
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:02,756
倖存的對手寥寥可數

27
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:19,908
肅靜         父王叫你們肅靜

28
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,573
不要講話

29
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,382
大家聚集在此

30
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,086
就應該摒棄成見

31
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,890
趁著為時未晚

32
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,295
殘存的部落

33
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:43,325
應該團結抵抗暴君

34
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:46,395
他有巫師協助

35
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,634
誰也不是他的對手

36
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:53,975
巫師…要是死掉，怎麼辦

37
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,982
現在計劃太遲了點

38
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,645
我襲擊過曼能的車隊

39
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,984
截斷他的補給線

40
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:06,423
但是他依舊勢如破竹

41
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:10,930
我不會派我的部下去白白送死

42
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:14,330
你還有什麼部下？巴煞

43
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,926
你已經一無所有

44
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,769
有的只是一堆石頭和黃沙

45
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:24,334
我若不是帝王

46
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,041
你又為何向我下跪

47
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:31,083
巴煞，衛士

48
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,457
阿卡得人

49
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,556
還以為他們早就絕種了

50
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,863
他們是最後的阿卡得人

51
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:52,894
他們會送巫師上黃泉

52
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:56,806
你相信這種為錢殺人的部族

53
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,073
別小看他們，他們是世代相傳

54
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:03,343
訓練有素的刺客

55
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:08,217
他們開出什麼條件，父王

56
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:11,082
廿顆雞血紅寶

57
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:14,388
那是我們最後的財寶      住口

58
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:19,589
要是他們剷除巫師

59
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,860
你們作不作戰

60
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:36,338
一言為定

61
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,248
只要我們還有一口氣在

62
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:43,989
巫師必死無疑

63
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,126
刺客

64
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,294
他…

65
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,269
我們免費奉送

66
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,407
日落前會到曼能的大本營

67
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,309
你什麼時候要把它換掉

68
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:14,046
別理他，他不是有意的

69
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,385
馬比較快
可是駱駝比較聰明

70
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:06,531
他交給我

71
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,369
活得自由

72
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,205
死得光榮

73
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,582
住手，聽我說，我是祭司

74
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:22,587
放了我，我用五種語言賜福你們

75
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,048
你會用五種語言尖叫

76
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,922
馬賊         等一下

77
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:54,245
喂，我沒那麼重

78
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,613
小心那個胖子，他在你後面

79
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,522
不管你是誰，放我下來

80
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:38,689
謝謝你，好心的人      安靜

81
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:41,029
我安全回去，你重重有賞

82
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,549
巫師的帳蓬

83
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,295
撤退

84
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,014
讓開

85
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,017
別讓他跑了

86
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,666
你被出賣了，馬沙亞斯

87
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:29,030
你知道我的名字
還有你來的目的

88
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:39,376
他在帳蓬裡

89
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,386
你，到後面去

90
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,636
生擒到阿卡得人

91
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:34,468
實屬難得

92
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:41,070
聽說你們的忍功一流

93
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:44,446
你要是不死，別忘了教我

94
00:13:57,163 --> 00:14:00,929
你的威風現在跑哪去了

95
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,197
你…背叛自己的父親

96
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,967
對，他當時非常震驚

97
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,908
從他的表情可以看出來

98
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,740
我以我父親的首級

99
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:19,150
向大王效忠

100
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:22,984
我相信你的忠心
這個還沒死

101
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,028
漂亮

102
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,768
帶他過來

103
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,888
活得自由

104
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,824
死得光榮，哥哥

105
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:13,071
現在…

106
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,274
要怎麼處置他？

107
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,333
他今晚命不該絕

108
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,140
是嗎？

109
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:24,215
走著瞧      他不會死在你手上

110
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:26,843
也不會死在你部下手上

111
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,920
你預見這樣的景象

112
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:39,226
一意孤行只會招來橫禍

113
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:42,199
神今晚眷顧他

114
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:43,758
只有神？

115
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,834
傷腦筋了

116
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:58,007
要送你歸西，又不能親自動手

117
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,770
厲害吧？

118
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,109
用煙把火蟻熏出巢穴

119
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:37,320
來享用我們的項上人頭

120
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,755
你覺得好笑         有一點

121
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,727
因為我逃得掉，而你呢

122
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:47,061
只能等死，誰叫你昨晚丟下我

123
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:50,227
那你還不逃
看到那個守衛沒

124
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:54,636
他猛灌犛牛尿，要不了多久…

125
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,365
看到沒？

126
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:11,846
馬賊呢？

127
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:44,515
快點，快救我出去

128
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,687
你答應…不殺我

129
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,957
好，我答應

130
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,261
記住，你是阿卡得人

131
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,460
阿卡得人說話一向算話

132
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,797
沒錯

133
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:02,205
答應帶我走，有好處分我一份

134
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:07,912
什麼？可以，我答應

135
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,359
搞定，不要動

136
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,734
這邊有一隻

137
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:34,500
好大一隻

138
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,063
哇，這只是蟻後

139
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,942
我們要去哪？

140
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:43,175
去曼能的土地，替我哥報仇

141
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,120
不准碰我的弓         沒問題

142
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,417
你在叫誰？         我的坐騎

143
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,901
是只駱駝

144
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:11,708
後面很擠，麻煩你挪一挪

145
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:13,438
嘿，我們說好的

146
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:17,107
沒錯，我沒殺你…還沒

147
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:27,624
我的女巫今天看到什麼

148
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:57,853
看到什麼

149
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,085
你的大軍將會西征

150
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,529
大敗依希絲女王的軍隊

151
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,968
把消息傳給各將領

152
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:13,300
準備打最後一仗

153
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,465
是的，大王

154
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:31,051
你認為我不擇手段

155
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:34,388
也許你忘了外面的情形

156
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,521
殘忍、無知、野蠻

157
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,661
但是我會撥亂反正

158
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:47,331
我會平息數百年的動亂

159
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,499
為天下帶來長治久安

160
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:58,679
血流成河換不來和平
卻可以換來服從

161
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,720
那樣就夠了

162
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:06,753
一旦我完成霸業

163
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:11,654
你將與我共享王位

164
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,190
與我同床共枕

165
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:18,634
但是，大王…

166
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:22,435
與你同床，我會失去預知能力

167
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:27,501
你也會失去作戰的優勢

168
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:30,514
那個時候

169
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,573
我已經不需要巫師

170
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,690
娥摩拉城

171
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,130
打家劫舍，辛苦了一天

172
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:48,393
最棒的就是去娥摩拉城玩

173
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,731
雖然所多瑪城也不錯

174
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,670
可惜我不能去

175
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,175
你不去？

176
00:21:58,243 --> 00:21:59,733
相信我

177
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:03,248
我是很想找那些紅衛隊算帳

178
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:07,513
可是我被通緝，不可能進得去

179
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:12,249
我有信心，我們一定進得去

180
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:35,302
看吧，守衛森嚴到
連蒼蠅都飛不進去

181
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:39,078
我希望我幫得上忙

182
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,345
你幫得上忙

183
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,653
你有什麼事？

184
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:51,059
我來領賞的

185
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:54,699
馬賊      我認識他

186
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,860
這次一定讓他腦袋搬家

187
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,997
他沒頭會比較好看

188
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,412
怎麼回事
我就說靠你進得來

189
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:13,144
給我朋友來杯好酒

190
00:23:13,218 --> 00:23:16,016
等一下，我好像記得

191
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:19,353
你一記老拳

192
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,120
揮過來         酒來了

193
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,961
有什麼需要儘管吩咐

194
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:29,892
還是大城市好

195
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:33,199
幫我看著駱駝      沒問題

196
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:35,672
你在這裡做了多久

197
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,040
肉串好不好吃

198
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,880
品質保證

199
00:23:50,956 --> 00:23:53,220
由龐貝城僧侶鑄造的純鋼

200
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,159
看啊，全世界最鋒利的劍

201
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,822
在娥摩拉城就要佩戴好劍

202
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,058
觀賞鳥、肉食鳥

203
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,761
世界上最漂亮的珍禽

204
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:07,101
阿兵哥，看你肌肉緊繃

205
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:10,699
我來幫你鬆弛一下
或者我們一起

206
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,971
先生，我幫你帶路

207
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,565
你需要嚮導帶路

208
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,279
好的嚮導會帶我進曼能的宮殿

209
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:52,283
聰明的嚮導就不會

210
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:55,582
不然你只會進曼能的地牢

211
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,630
不在我身上

212
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:16,329
想不想賺這顆

213
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:31,145
準備動手，我一半，你一半

214
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,954
好吧，都交給我

215
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:39,889
乾脆繞路走就不要殺人了

216
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:48,388
天啊，你是不是要殺我

217
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,025
等一下再說

218
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,730
曼能動不動就要砍我的頭

219
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,030
不要碰         這是什麼

220
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:59,009
那是我精心泡製的魔術粉

221
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,545
魔術粉

222
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,308
對，魔術粉

223
00:27:03,382 --> 00:27:07,512
我花一大筆錢買來的中國配方

224
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:11,920
泡製成功的話

225
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,788
不但可以開山辟路

226
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,296
還可以造福人群

227
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,990
也可以為害人間

228
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,103
我的發明都被曼能拿來作戰

229
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:31,802
曼能在哪         你想殺他

230
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:35,945
對

231
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:37,709
既然如此

232
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:40,149
他在練武場

233
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:56,426
放手，放開我

234
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:00,294
我又沒做什麼

235
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:06,727
你知道偷竊的下場

236
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,836
有刺客

237
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,023
跟我來

238
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:10,195
又是你         我怎麼出去

239
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,102
從那扇門

240
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:17,566
那是什麼         我最新的發明

241
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:20,076
快速運輸機

242
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,204
不過著陸有點問題

243
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:25,142
開門

244
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:28,379
開門
小心，不要啟動機器

245
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,045
好

246
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:47,064
我的天

247
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,099
是男人

248
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:54,009
這是什麼地方         曼能的後宮

249
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,140
不過他很少來      我們好寂寞

250
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:06,116
別煩我，行不行
說話小心點

251
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:09,592
小心，這些是精密的儀器

252
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:13,153
曼能大人欣賞你算你好運

253
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:14,960
老傢伙

254
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:21,133
要是我發現你和刺客有關係

255
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:23,367
我就要你的命

256
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:28,372
我們會讓你滿意

257
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:30,539
我相信，但是…
不要走

258
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:33,812
留下來嘛      謝謝，我趕時間

259
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,877
我們會讓你美夢成真

260
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:08,985
放箭

261
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,434
快追

262
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:47,780
快追

263
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:22,724
你是要殺我，還是要盯著我

264
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:34,761
吸氣

265
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:00,997
讚美神

266
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,469
你好大膽，敢碰我

267
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:15,940
我是阿卡得人，奉命來殺你

268
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,643
不過現在你活著對我更有用

269
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:22,151
別讓我改變主意

270
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:27,786
他說，大小不重要

271
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:30,885
重要的是能耐

272
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,203
可惜，我現在要走了

273
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:51,544
就是那個叛徒      我的天

274
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,592
他死了

275
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:08,530
認命吧，臭駱駝

276
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,864
我才是你的主人，你要聽我的

277
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:15,269
他死了，死了

278
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,932
死了

279
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:21,204
你還活著，我就知道

280
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,110
對

281
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:26,639
我才剛跟駱駝說

282
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:28,913
沒人能殺死我們的馬沙亞斯

283
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,686
上去         我幹嘛要聽你的

284
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:35,749
你不是要殺我
其他人會比你先死

285
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:40,059
你真會安慰人

286
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:44,964
你朋友是誰         曼能的巫師

287
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,707
曼能的巫師，你瘋了
我們會被她害死

288
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,938
我要用她引曼能出來

289
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:56,947
所以你先利用我，再殺我

290
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:59,142
我覺得好過多了

291
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:01,879
我也可以倒過來，先殺你

292
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:05,053
我們要去哪

293
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:08,490
死亡谷      死亡谷？

294
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,028
哪有人去死亡谷的

295
00:36:11,095 --> 00:36:13,620
你以為那個名字叫假的啊

296
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:16,290
等我一下

297
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:29,274
你帶十二名高手去追

298
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:32,077
殺了他

299
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,947
把她帶回來

300
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,611
得手立刻通知我

301
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,181
是的，大王         大王

302
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:46,256
軍中傳出巫師出走的謠言

303
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,691
是嗎？         是的，大王

304
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:54,602
那就想辦法壓制這股聲浪

305
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,936
讓士兵以為她還在

306
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:05,409
找到那個阿卡得人

307
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:14,891
送這枝箭給他

308
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:22,655
我們是不是到了

309
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:24,867
是

310
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:29,168
到家了

311
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,277
你想去哪，巫師

312
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:27,756
急著回曼能身邊
不，急著離開你

313
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:31,893
我再也不回去，他從小就軟禁我

314
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:39,970
那晚在帳蓬，你為什麼幫我

315
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,780
我知道你可以幫我逃走

316
00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:59,755
要走就走，外面比我還危險

317
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:22,748
什麼叫你找不到

318
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,448
我知道就在附近
你在找什麼

319
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:30,517
躲避沙暴的地方
什麼沙暴

320
00:39:30,595 --> 00:39:32,529
你會看到的

321
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:45,876
曼能是不是沒來

322
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:48,036
他派了走狗來

323
00:39:48,112 --> 00:39:50,046
他比你想的要聰明

324
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:52,845
應該是懦弱

325
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:55,613
我可不可以回家

326
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,819
待在這裡，蓋住

327
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:04,828
你們不會有事的

328
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,048
他單槍匹馬來挑戰

329
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:34,353
曬到神智不清了

330
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:37,155
取他首級者，賞金一千

331
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:24,772
阿卡得混蛋

332
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:29,640
他在哪

333
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:43,386
這邊

334
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:49,893
你們兩個先進去

335
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:34,140
踩在石頭上

336
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:31,765
跟我來

337
00:44:04,535 --> 00:44:05,695
不要碰

338
00:44:37,435 --> 00:44:38,527
懦夫

339
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:42,362
有種就出來

340
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:30,549
阿卡得人

341
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:20,563
你還活著，好像拍蒼蠅一樣

342
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:22,868
你太厲害了

343
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,559
告訴我，有沒有辦法救他

344
00:46:54,371 --> 00:46:58,705
他中了蠍子毒，在發高燒

345
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:00,107
就算不死…

346
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:03,408
蠍子血也會永遠留在他體內

347
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:45,480
巫師

348
00:47:57,368 --> 00:47:59,427
真是奇跡

349
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,836
她救了你，我就知道她有辦法

350
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:08,970
她差點沒命，還好有神的保佑

351
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,546
為什麼？

352
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,850
為什麼冒生命危險救我

353
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,458
因為我相信你會拯救百姓

354
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:26,326
他們不是我的問題，曼能才是

355
00:48:27,498 --> 00:48:30,399
你和百姓有相同的問題

356
00:48:57,962 --> 00:49:00,954
啟稟大王，索瑞克有消息

357
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:05,835
阿卡得人終於死了

358
00:49:12,977 --> 00:49:14,968
有事嗎？大王

359
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:18,872
沒事

360
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:20,940
一切順利

361
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:23,987
事實上，因為非常順利

362
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:27,182
所以我要把計劃提前

363
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:31,250
明晚我們設宴慶祝出師大捷

364
00:49:31,328 --> 00:49:35,196
然後揮軍掃平殘餘的叛逆

365
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:37,529
下去吧

366
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:40,927
大王

367
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:45,374
按照慣例，巫師應該出席會議

368
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:48,809
為什麼她今天不在
她不舒服

369
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,313
我希望不嚴重

370
00:49:51,382 --> 00:49:55,113
嚴重的話，你自然會知道

371
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,447
退下

372
00:50:03,961 --> 00:50:05,826
她還活著

373
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:08,729
跟他一起，在來的路上

374
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:10,562
去準備

375
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,378
成功了，成功了

376
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:29,145
大人

377
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:32,518
能在荒郊野地看到你真好

378
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:34,853
你快來看，我成功了

379
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:37,621
快點，快點

380
00:50:37,694 --> 00:50:39,628
巫師大人

381
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:46,499
你看，我成功了

382
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:50,506
我的中國配方，我的魔術粉

383
00:50:50,574 --> 00:50:53,475
原來我需要的是硝石

384
00:50:53,544 --> 00:50:57,310
硝石就在這裡，這裡多得是

385
00:50:57,381 --> 00:51:00,475
對了，你們誰有帶水

386
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,320
你想可以喝嗎？

387
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,130
本來可以         好喝

388
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,294
沙巖有天然的過濾效果

389
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:20,495
安靜

390
00:51:27,077 --> 00:51:30,069
我還活著，我還活著

391
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,314
目前是

392
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:02,043
走

393
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,561
刺客，神待我不薄啊

394
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,656
上次見面， 你想殺我

395
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:25,668
現在輪到我報答你

396
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:27,203
你們擅闖禁地

397
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:30,900
我們能生存全靠這裡夠隱秘

398
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:35,206
只要你們活著，問題就來了

399
00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:37,577
沒問題，我絕對守口如瓶

400
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:40,845
我連怎麼來的都不記得

401
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:43,045
太遲了         巴煞

402
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:47,987
我們收留所有曼能的敵人

403
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:50,822
你應該知道
他是個危險人物

404
00:52:50,894 --> 00:52:55,058
你判斷錯誤
我的判斷讓大家活到今天

405
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:57,657
這個人不可靠，我可以證明

406
00:52:57,734 --> 00:52:59,258
把那個女人帶上來

407
00:53:04,074 --> 00:53:07,066
誰敢碰她，就別怪我不客氣

408
00:53:14,618 --> 00:53:17,348
正合我意

409
00:54:28,992 --> 00:54:30,516
不公平

410
00:54:51,381 --> 00:54:52,370
打他

411
00:55:15,572 --> 00:55:17,631
你服不服         不服

412
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,505
你還是執迷不悟

413
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:23,012
我們是同仇敵愾的兄弟
兄弟？

414
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,446
你會連累我們

415
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:27,915
曼能一定會追來

416
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,849
把他的巫師搶回去

417
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,378
沒錯，我認得她

418
00:55:33,457 --> 00:55:36,255
曼能不會罷手，除非她回去

419
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:39,022
曼能有了她，會更銳不可當

420
00:55:39,096 --> 00:55:41,587
會更肆無忌憚

421
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:44,998
你們躲得了一時，躲不了一世

422
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,763
要是不阻止他

423
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:49,601
他就會血洗這塊土地

424
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:54,607
有誰可以阻止他

425
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:56,168
你？

426
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:59,113
你敢挑戰他的百萬大軍

427
00:56:03,253 --> 00:56:04,515
敢

428
00:56:25,075 --> 00:56:27,441
男的應該讓女的         說得對

429
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:29,445
三盤兩勝如何

430
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,978
棗子？

431
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:35,415
哦，謝謝

432
00:57:22,132 --> 00:57:24,293
卡珊卓

433
00:57:35,245 --> 00:57:37,179
你終於贏了

434
00:57:58,034 --> 00:58:00,127
我預見一個景象

435
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:03,772
曼能會追到這裡

436
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,705
大開殺戒

437
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,367
你確定

438
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:18,479
我預見的景象

439
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:20,716
就像池面的浮光掠影

440
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:23,826
時隱時現

441
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:26,055
忽暗忽明

442
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:29,022
不過有件事我確定

443
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:31,033
曼能會率領大軍

444
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:33,262
踏平此處

445
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:36,032
曼能會死在我手上

446
00:58:43,213 --> 00:58:45,738
阿卡得人，看來神今晚眷顧我

447
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:04,962
你跟曼能決鬥

448
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:07,997
會死在他手上

449
00:59:10,307 --> 00:59:12,605
那是你命中注定

450
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,908
我的命運由我掌握

451
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:11,964
我需要你幫忙

452
01:00:41,464 --> 01:00:44,661
你不能丟下我們         冷靜點

453
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:48,898
你一個人去，等於是去送死

454
01:00:53,376 --> 01:00:56,209
你要騎我的馬上哪去

455
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:59,339
娥摩拉城，我們怎麼勸都沒用

456
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,714
不帶你的巫師去

457
01:01:01,785 --> 01:01:04,447
她回去了，怕連累你們

458
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:06,546
我不會讓她一個人面對曼能

459
01:01:06,623 --> 01:01:08,557
讓開         阿卡得人

460
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,820
你這是去送死

461
01:01:10,894 --> 01:01:13,692
讓你單槍匹馬去

462
01:01:17,534 --> 01:01:20,230
我不就沾不到光

463
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,930
今晚我們熱烈慶祝

464
01:01:54,304 --> 01:01:55,896
大家

465
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,270
盡情享用

466
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:00,673
明天我們奮勇殺敵

467
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:10,383
我差點捉到他，可惜被他跑掉

468
01:02:10,453 --> 01:02:12,614
連弓都不要了

469
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:17,258
大王

470
01:02:18,428 --> 01:02:20,953
有件事造成軍心動搖

471
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:25,334
那就麻煩了，請說

472
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:28,666
傳言

473
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:31,172
女巫師已經出走

474
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:34,977
士兵不應該輕信

475
01:02:36,479 --> 01:02:38,310
無聊的宮廷傳言

476
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:41,544
我向你保證，她十分安全

477
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:44,610
問題是出征在即

478
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:46,621
士兵不要口頭保證

479
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:51,790
你懷疑我的話

480
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:53,726
不敢，大王

481
01:02:53,797 --> 01:02:56,994
不過她是振奮軍心的象徵

482
01:02:57,066 --> 01:03:00,331
總要眼見為真才好         大王

483
01:03:07,944 --> 01:03:10,105
我奉召而來

484
01:03:11,047 --> 01:03:12,674
近來身體不適

485
01:03:12,749 --> 01:03:14,649
還望大王恕罪

486
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:19,920
我軍即將大捷，令我精神一振

487
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:24,090
這樣可以穩定軍心了吧

488
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:28,722
把你預見的景象告訴他

489
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:36,003
我看到我軍大捷

490
01:03:37,974 --> 01:03:42,070
你的敵人會自動現形

491
01:03:50,987 --> 01:03:53,080
停

492
01:03:54,224 --> 01:03:57,990
裡面是什麼         裡面是什麼

493
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:02,156
裡面…是個驚喜

494
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,698
為今晚的宴會助興

495
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:08,828
泰克麥王子吩咐的

496
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,670
非常好

497
01:04:17,447 --> 01:04:21,213
讓我看看…這位姑娘

498
01:05:11,968 --> 01:05:14,163
去我的寢宮

499
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:16,171
我有事跟你談

500
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:23,775
請大王恕罪

501
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:30,041
我明白

502
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:35,490

00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:03,605
Believe me, I'd like to
even the score with a few
of those Red Guards myself.

831
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:07,948
But with the price I've got
on my head, I'd never make it
through those gates.

832

What business do you have here?

838
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:51,460
I've come to collect a bounty.

839
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:55,099
- Horse thief.
- Oh. I know this dog.

840
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,260
They'll behead him for sure this time.

841

He'll be all the prettier

Ajug of your finest wine

Wait a minute.
The last thing that...

847
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,719
that I remember
was this huge...

848

Please, let me know if
there's anything else you'd like.

The world's finest swords.

Huh? You can't get respect in Gomorrah
without a quality blade...

Hey, soldier.
Those big muscles look cramped.

Mister, mister.
Guide, mister.

865
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:44,999
You need a guide
to find your way in Gomorrah.

866
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:50,679
A good guide might be able to show me
a way into Memnon's palace.

867
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,683
But a smart guide wouldn't,

868
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:55,982
or he'd be shown
into Memnon's dungeon.

All right.
I'll kill 'em all.

How about we go around them
and not kill anybody?

- Good Lord.
Are you going to kill me?
- Maybe later.

Memnon's always threatening
to have my head.

Don't touch that.

Yeah, magic powder.

887
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:07,975
It's a Chinese formula
that I procured at great expense.

888
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:12,387
If I get the recipe right,
it'll move mountains,

Like all my inventions,
Memnon will try to use it for war.

893
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,269
- Where is Memnon?
- Oh, you mean to kill him, do you?

894
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:38,176
- Yes.
- Well, in that case,

895
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,616
I'd say he was
in the training courtyard.

It was meant to be

problem with the landings.

- Lord Memnon's harem.

- But he visits so rarely.
- And it gets so lonely.

- Can't you leave me alone, Thorak?

No!

Yeah!

1149
00:55:16,273 --> 00:55:20,039
- Do you yield? Then you're a fool.
- Never.

1150

- We're brothers in the same cause.
- Brothers?

You brought death to my people.

Memnon will follow you.

He will come
for his sorceress.

1154
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:33,890
Yes, I know who she is.

1155
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:36,755
And Memnon will stop at nothing
till she's returned.

1156
00:55:36,827 --> 00:55:42,094
He'll come swifter
and deadlier once he has her.
Memnon will stop at nothing.

1157
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:45,727
Hide here as long as you can, but
believe me when I say he'll find you.

1158
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:50,103
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep
across this land and kill all of you.

I've had a vision.

Memnon will follow me here

You know this?

The things I see...

are like shimmers in a pond.

Some are certain,

But I do know this...

1178
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:33,663
Memnon will release his armies
and ride straight through this place.

1179
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:36,433
Memnon will die by my hand.

1180

That is your destiny.

You can't go alone.
You're going to get yourself killed.

Where do you think
you're going with my horse?

1191
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:59,673
To Gomorrah.
Nothing we can say will stop him.

Without your sorceress?

She returned to save
the lives of your people.

1194

I won't let her face
Memnon's wrath alone.

- Step aside.

I would've captured him myself,

My lord.

There is something
that is troubling our soldiers.

How distressing.
Pray tell.

1210

It's been said the sorceress
is no longer by your side.

You have my word,

If the men are to fight, to die,

- It is not that, sire.
