But they can bring obedience.
That will suffice for now.

And when I have become the king of legend,

166

then you shall take your place beside me

167
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,605
on a throne and in my bed.

168
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,608
But, my lord,

169
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,405
in your bed I would lose my gift of sight

170
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,118
and you would lose
your advantage in battle.

171
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,745
The day I speak of

172
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,249
is the day I no longer need your vision.

Let me tell you,

175
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,848
after a hard day of looting and pillaging,
there is no greater city than Gomorrah.

176
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,683
Except maybe Sodom.

- I wish I could join you.
- You're not going?

Believe me, I'd like to even the score
with a few of those Red Guards myself.

179
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:07,075
But with the price I've got on my head,
I'd never make it through those gates.

180
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,497
I have faith in you, my friend.
You'll get us in.

181

You see? They've got the city sealed up
tighter than a crab's buttocks.

182

I wish there was something
I could do to help, but...

185

I've come to collect a bounty.

- Oh. I know this dog.

He'll be all the prettier without it.

- You got us in. I knew you could do it.

A jug of your finest wine
for my road-weary friend here.

Mister, mister. Guide, mister.

You need a guide
to find your way in Gomorrah.

210
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,363
A good guide might be able to show me
a way into Memnon's palace.

But a smart guide wouldn't,

lose your powers if you...

647
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:58,325

to keep a king from taking advantage?

648
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,827
Well, neither could my ancestors.

649
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,123
And how long will this time of peace last?

650
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,836
Nothing lasts forever, my king.

651
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,382

652
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,094
Then we'll make our own destiny.
