How are you...
enjoying the job?

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,808
Yeah, not bad. Good, thanks.

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,647
I've noticed
the customers like you.

32
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,715
Okay, great. Yeah, well,
I try to be friendly.

33
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,016
Unlike me.

34
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,385
I'm increasingly finding
I don't like you.

35
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,521
- Right.
- You know, the beard

36
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,688
gets on my nerves.

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,557
What's wrong with shaving?

38
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,524
- Yeah, I know. I suppose I...
- Yeah...

39
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,292
And I don't like the way
you're always late.

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,694
I-I don't like the way
you dress.

41
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,729
And worse, I get the feeling

42
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,731
you think working here
is beneath you.

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,667
- Oh.
- But the customers like you.

44
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:21,475
So, if you want to
go full-time, you can.

45
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,608
Right.

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,843
Okay. Well, yeah, great.

47
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,612
Uh, let me think about that.

48
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,447
Or, eh, here's
the alternative, son.

49
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,316
Two weeks,
you're out on your ear.

50
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,756
Yeah. I'll give the job
to dozy Karen.

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,523
(clicks tongue)
Okay, great.

00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,358
Well, classic. Um...

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,027
- Yeah, I'll get right back to you.
- Good.

54
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,494
There's someone to see you.

55
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,432
Make it quick.
We've got stuff to sell.

57

Do you want the good news
or the bad news?

58
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,071
I'm gonna have to say
good news,

59
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,739
'cause I don't think I could
take any more bad news.

60
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,607
Well, the good news is

61
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,376
you're booked
for Latitude Festival.

62
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,112
No!

Yes! Yes!

It's not the biggest...

65
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,583
It's the,
it's the Suffolk Tent.

66
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,051
I don't care what tent,
it's Latitude!

67
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,219
It's a proper festival!

00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,494
I thought "Dinosaur"
was particularly strong.

- What are you doing here?
- Yes, mate!

98
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,069
- Yeah!
- Oh!

99
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,939
- I'm a road manager, innit.
- (laughs): Oh!

100
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,975
So everyone who said
that you were a lazy,

101
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,511
- useless, drug-taking drunk...
- Hello.

102
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,513
...who'd never get a job
were wrong.

103
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,780
Yes, they were, actually.

104
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,816
I'm in profitable employment.

105
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,151
A valued cog in
a well-oiled rock machine.

106
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,754
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

107
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,054
Good set, though, mate.

108
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,590
- Yeah.
- Did you hear it? I didn't see you.

109
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,691
I-If I'm totally honest,

110
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,725
I only popped by for
a quick bong behind the tent.

111
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,929
- Oh.
- But it was a lovely surprise to hear you.

112
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,196
I mean,
I didn't hear much of it,

113
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,965
to be honest, 'cause...

114
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,068
of the bong and stuff,
but... yeah.

115
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,504
Ah, you're still making sweet
love to young Ellie, I see.

116
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,571
- No.
- (laughs): No.

117
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,975
No, never. Not once.

118
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,044
That's a shame.

119
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,679
She's my manager.

120
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,514
Hey, do you wanna come
backstage for our gig?

121
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,850
- Wha... Please.
- Yeah?

122
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,550
- Let's do it, then.
- (laughs)

123
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,985
- Let's rock this road.
- All right.

124
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,687
JACK: So how long you been
back in Suffolk?

125
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,922
Oof. Well, I'm trying to live
outside the traditional

126
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,124
concept of time.

127
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,794
So, could be weeks,
could me months,

128
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,696
could be a year and a half,
no idea.

129
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,263
Oh, here we are.

130
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:34,934
- (cheering)
- Thank you so much.

131
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:39,537
JACK:
So what exactly do you do?

132
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,239
Make sure everything runs
like clockwork.

133
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,273
- Service the equipment.
- Right.

134
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:46,877
Make sandwiches, make teas.

135
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,614
Uh... Oh, Christ.

136
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,984
(mutters)

137
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,518
Sorry.

138
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,186
Sorry. Sorry, Michael.

139
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,588
You're fired.

140
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,659
Fair do's.

141
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,028
(crowd cheers)

142
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,165
Got fired.

143
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,165
Give Ellie one for me, yeah?

144
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,887
- No, really, we don't...
- Catch you later.

145
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:17,107
(Michael vocalizing
over speaker)

146
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,675
ELLIE:
Oh, great day.

147
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:19,910
JACK:
Yeah, great day.

148
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,246
Though, Elle,
we should stop now.

149
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,948
I can't do this anymore.

150
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,949
(scoffs) Don't be stupid.

151
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,884
You're gonna need
a bigger tent.

152
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,252
(American accent): You're
gonna need a bigger tent.

153
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,155
No, okay, stop.
You gotta stop pretending

154
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,191
that we're in a thrilling story
with a big, exciting end.

155
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,727
We're in a little story
and it ends now.

156
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,696
I think I hear something
special in my songs,

157
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,165
you think you hear
something special,

158
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,600
and I love you for it.

159
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,302
But no one else does.
No one ever has.

160
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,970
Uh, Nick loves
"The Summer Song."

161
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,706
Nick is famously
a world-class moron.

162
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,107
If it hasn't happened by now,
it's not going to.

163
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,275
It'll take a miracle.

164
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,145
Miracles happen.

165
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,679
I mean it.

166
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,247
This is a serious moment
for me.

167
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,083
This is just absolutely
not happening.

168
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,720
Look, I can't be the star that
we thought I could be at 14,

169
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,287
on that day in the school hall

170
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,958
when I sang a pretty cool cover
of "Wonderwall"

171
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,193
and you were there, backstage.

172
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,694
- I'm not hearing a word.
- Okay, but look.

173
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,997
This, this was my last gig.

174
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,934
And I'm so happy
you were there.

175
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,773
This is the end of our long
and winding road.

176
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,677
ELLIE: Come on!
The world is full of miracles.

177
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,045
JACK:
Like what?

178
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,982
Benedict Cumberbatch
becoming a sex symbol.

179
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,984
- Oh...
- You'll change your mind.

180
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,052
I won't. This is the start
of a better life.

181
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,559
And I'm...
feeling perky about it.

182
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,138
JACK:
Mmm.

183
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,639

184
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,076

- So despite all the pain and inconvenience,

you're not even gonna get
any sympathy.

(sighs, chuckles)
No one knows.

214
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,925
It was all over the world.

215
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:32,029
Electricity flicked off
for 12 seconds.

216
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,863
You were just unlucky
that at that exact moment,

217
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,867
a big bus hit you.

218
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,800
You know, the weird thing
they thought

219
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,668
was gonna happen at midnight
when we hit 2000?

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,471
- Oh, yeah, Y2K.
- It sort of happened.

221
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,808
It was very big news which,
um, you missed entirely.

222
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,943
- Because of the bus.
- Ah.

223
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,279
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

224
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,818
Right. I've gotta
get back to school.

225
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,319
- Elle?
- Yeah?

226
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,854
Thanks for taking
such good care of me.

227
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,491
You're welcome.
I'll come back later.

228
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,059
Will you still need me,

229
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,328
will you still feed me,
when I'm 64?

230
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,296
(laughs): I don't know.
I'll think about it.

231
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,998
- Why 64?
- What do you mean?

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,002
It's just... oh, forget it.
(chuckles)

233
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,441
What do you mean, "Why 64?"

235

ELLIE:
<i>I think the accident</i>

236
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,413
<i>was a message from God.</i>

237
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,149
- (scoffs)
- Yeah, he was very angry.

238
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,150
Elle, you think
me getting hit by a bus

239
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,053
was God's way of telling me
not to go back to teaching?

240
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,621
(laughs): Exactly. (squeals)

241
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,921
Incredible. It's amazing.

242
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,058
You know, God loves your stuff.

243
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,359
Look, if God had been remotely
interested in my stuff,

244
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,027
he would've once,
right, just once,

245
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,530
had someone write me
a fan letter who wasn't my mum.

246
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,165
(snickers) Or me.

247
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,101
- (laughs)
- Yeah.

248
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,102
(sighs) I didn't ask
to be The Beatles,

249
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,104
you know, I just wanted once
to have a standing ovation

250
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,341
not given by people who were
already standing at the bar.

I know Ellie said it was funny,

256
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,923

humor of this quality.

257

260
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,466

- Yes, yes.

261
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,468
It's true, we have
bought you presents.

262
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,236
- Exciting.
- Well, they have, obviously.

263
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,637

- Yeah, yeah.

- ELLIE: Oh, wow.

267
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,179
- Because you lost your teeth. That's...
- Yeah, I know.

268
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,147
- That's why that's funny. Okay.
- (laughter)

269

- Do you?

273
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,022
- Hilarious.
- Yeah.

274
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,357
All right. One more.

275
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,626
- I've signed your name, don't worry.
- One more, yes.

276
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,995
I don't know what this one
could possibly be.

277

278
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,666

279
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,404
- Mm-hmm.
- Or a... tiny little giraffe with no legs.

286
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,387
- ELLIE (laughs): Yes, play something.
- NICK: Come on.

287
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,723
- Play "The Summer Song."
- Let me get rid of this.

292
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,430
- Yeah! - Oh!
- What is he doing here?

293
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,433
Yeah, he got sacked.
He's staying with us,

294
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,568
- sleeping on the sofa.
- JACK: That is a disaster

295
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,337
- that could last forever...
- NICK: Yep. - Terrible decision.

296
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,670
- That's right.
- ...and ruin your entire life.

297

Oh, no charge.

their jumbo boxes

- of Nescafé and washing powder.
- That's right.

662
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,571
But you're gonna sing us
a new song now.

663
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,241

676
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,557
TV HOST:
Beautiful.

677
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,627
No mention of, uh, jumbo-sized
Fairy liquid, but nice work.

678
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:41,329
You ever thought about doing
a wholesale-based song?

679
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,665
Not really, no.

680
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,401
You could call it, uh,
"In My Warehouse"

681
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,735
instead of "In My Life."

682
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,371
Now, time to find out
what's happening

683
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:51,473
in Kerry's Kitchen.
(chuckles)

684
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,642
G'day, everyone.
It's Kerry here.

685
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,310
(laughs)

686
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,713
I could've written every song
of the Rolling Stones

687
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,150
or David Bowie.

688
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,318
I'll always just be Lowestoft's
warbling warehouseman.

689
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,752
(chuckling):
Oh, no, don't.

690
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:08,156
- That's not true. (laughs)
- So obviously is.

691
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:11,694
That song was really beautiful.

692
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,631
Who-who did you write it about?

693
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,200
Stop here. Stop the car.

694
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,371
(tires screech)

695
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,406
- Elle.
- Hmm?

696
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,542
- These songs.
- Mm.

697
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:30,579
There's something about 'em
you should know.

698
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,482
(ringtone playing)

699
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:36,284
Oh. Hi.

700
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:38,320
ED SHEERAN: Hi... it's the
musician... Ed Sheeran.

701
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:40,490
- I beg your pardon.
- Ed Sheeran.

702
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:43,225
- I'm a musician.
- Yeah, no, seriously though, who is it?

703
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,147
This must be a bad line,
I'll-I'll call you back.

704
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,866
Who was it?

705
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,901
He said it was Ed Sheeran,
the musician.

706
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,235
(scoffs) That'll be Nick.

707
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,171
- Mm.
- (ringtone playing)

708
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,539
- (laughs)
- Nick!

709
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,807
No, it's Ed Sheeran again.

710
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,709
Yeah, can I speak
to Carol, please?

711
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,176
There's no one
called Carol here.

712
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,878
Except there is.
She's always there.

713
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,615
Okay, mate, um,
I'll leave it there.

714
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,782
Amazing performance tonight
though, on TV.

715
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:10,788
That song, "In My Life,"
that was really beautiful.

716
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,291
What did he say?

717
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,461
He said he really enjoyed
"In My Life."

718
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,328
(scoffs)
And what did Carol say?

719
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,265
- She wasn't there.
- (chuckles) She's always there.

720
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,870
I think it might've been
Ed Sheeran.

721
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,807

ED:
Ouch.

738
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:34,402
So, uh, look, I'm sorry
to barge in like this.

739
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,804
No, no, uh, major pop stars

740
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,273
are always dropping round,
you know?

741
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,641
Lady Gaga won't leave us alone.

742

(chuckles) You're funny.

743
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,378
Well, funny-looking, at least.

744
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,246
Yeah, so, anyway, I live, uh,

745
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,983
I live locally,
and I saw your song on TV.

746
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:50,319
And it was really good.

747
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,721
- Wow.
- So I googled you,

748
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,724
and I listened to your songs
on the warehouse website.

749
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,626
And they were even better.

750
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,694
Gosh, thanks.

751
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,396
All right, don't mind me.

752
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:02,931
So, I've had
the support act drop out

753
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,000
of the European leg
of the tour,

754
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,936
and I was wondering
if you'd consider it.

755
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,672
- Consider what?
- S... Yeah.

756
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,574
- Being the opening act.
- (grunts softly)

757
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,275
- For you, seriously?
- JED: Nope.

758
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,312
Yeah, why not?

759
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,612
(chuckling):
W-Wha... When would I start?

760
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,447
- Tuesday.
- (sighs)

761
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,349
Do you know
where the pickle is?

762
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,516
No.

763
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:23,552
- No.
- Tu... What, Tuesday?

764
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,520
- Not next July?
- (chuckling): No. Tuesday.

765
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,456
- Is your hearing all right?
- (chuckling): No.

766
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,958
No, my hearing is fine,
it's just, you keep saying

767
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,358
lots of really strange things.

768
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,462
But yes, yes, thank you, yes.

769
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,732
- Um, how long do you need?
- About 30 minutes. Maximum.

770
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,067
Any more than that, people
start getting a bit restless.

771
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,569
- You know, "Bring on the ginger geezer."
- Yeah.

772
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,304
(laughs) Get in.

773
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,473
(laughs, sighs)
Night.

774
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,507
- Night.
- Night.

775
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:47,777
Night. Nice to meet you.

776
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,947
You look like Ed Sheeran,
you know.

777
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,317
I am Ed Sheeran.

778
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,855
Oh, right. Well done.

779
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,489
Light show?

780
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,023
- Preferably not, no.
- Well, that's good,

781
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:04,726
'cause I've only got the torch
on my phone, so...

782
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,061
(chuckles)
Have you got any beer?

783
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,730
Uh, cider.

784
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,565
- Cider works.
- (chuckling): Okay.

785
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,367
I'll have a cider with the man
that wrote "Yesterday."

786
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:14,103
Yeah.

787
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,639
Mum, Dad,
who drunk all the cider?

788
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,541
- ELLIE: <i>That is nuts!
- Yeah, as you said, it's nutty.</i>

789
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:22,411
And he's absolutely covered

No, it's not. No.

- (laughs)
- Don't. Don't start.

793
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,819
It looked so good online,
so I just ordered it,

794
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,920
and the most disgusting pink
thing in history turns up.

795

Tomorrow.

797
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,460

You're not coming?

798

No, of course not.

Um... yeah.

805
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,375
Well, I certainly can't do it
this Tuesday.

806

teacher's evening at 6:45.

And, although I like you, I...

I don't like you enough to let
down the whole of year ten.

Nothing to be worried about.

So, the vote!

960
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,454
Nope, no vote. No vote.

961
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,023
No. That was, uh,

962
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,492
an interesting moment.

963
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:26,460
I was always told that
there would be someone

964
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,096
who came along that was
a lot better than me,

965
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,400
and you are definitely
better than me, Jack.

966
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,569
Yeah, wow.
That was, uh,

967
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,603
one of the best songs
I've heard in my life.

968
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,940
I mean, these things
are complicated.

969
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,942
(chuckles) Yeah.

970
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:43,110
Obviously not complicated
for you, though, right?

971
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:44,913
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

972
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,114
Someone should probably shag
him while they have the chance.

973
00:44:47,116 --> 00:44:48,616
- (laughter) - Yeah.
- WOMAN: Pick me, Jack!

974
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:49,951
You're definitely Mozart, mate.

975
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,020
And I'm definitely Salieri.

976
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,190
Night, Jack.

977
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,161
Hi.

978
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:02,563
I'm Debra Hammer.

979
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:04,532
I'm Ed's manager.

980
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,268
We should talk.

981
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,302
Yeah. I... Well, I g... I mean,

982
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:10,271
- I've kind of got a manager back home.
- Oh?

983
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:11,505
No, but, but no,
but we should talk.

984
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:14,275
- Yeah.
- (chuckling): Okay, great.

985
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:15,878
That's great.

986
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,311
Uh... good.

987
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:19,248
Have a good night.
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

988
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,882
In Los Angeles?

989
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,085
Yeah, well, we, we need you
to come to L.A.

990
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:28,891
See, we pay and then you come
and you write songs

991
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,960
and then we release them,
and you make a ton of money.

992
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,496
And then we take most of it.

993
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,532
- (laughs)
- (chuckling)

994
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,300
Okay.

995
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:41,103
I have a question.

996
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,141
Is this the best
that you can look?

997
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,308
We'll figure it out.

998
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,879
Gorgeous.

999
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,648
CROWD (chanting):
<i>Ellie, Ellie, Ellie!</i>

1000
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,018
- (balloon pops)
- ELLIE: <i>Oh, well, in my capacity as Jack's</i>

1001
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,520
former musical mentor,
stroke manager,

1002
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:01,389
stroke roadie, stroke driver...

1003
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,025
(chuckles):
'Cause he can't even drive.

1004
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,625
- Ooh! - Loser! Loser!
- (all jeering)

1005
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:06,395
I did try to teach you.
I did try to teach you.

1006
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,697
- Honestly, no, you can have the job back.
- No, thanks.

1007
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,300
- (groans)
- Why would anyone ever leave Suffolk

1008
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,634
before the day they die?

1009
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,136
(cheering)

1010
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,706
Right, but if you must go
to Los Angeles

1011
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,608
- and hang out with perverts and drug addicts...
- I must.

1012
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,311
...then we wish you
good luck and success.

1013
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,947
Or, even better, failure

1014
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,480
- and a swift return.
- (laughs)

1015
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:28,150
ALL:
Failure and a swift return!

1016
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,554
- Yay!
- (cheering)

1017
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,554
(Ellie grunts softly)

1018
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,456
Will you miss me, Jack?

1019
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,125
Course I'll miss you.

1020
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,494
Hey.

1021
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,498
Of course I'll miss you.

1022
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,971
You're leaving, so...
I can ask you anything.

1023
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,909
(sighs)

1024
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:57,281
How did I get
in the wrong column?

1025
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,349
How did I get in

1026
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,288
the "friend, manager, roadie"
column, inst...

1027
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:10,093
...instead of the
"And I Love Her" column?

1028
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,130
- (knocking)
- SHEILA: What are you doing up there?

1029
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,565
Come on. If you don't
come downstairs soon,

1030
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,333
your mum will be too drunk
to make her speech.

1031
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:20,855
- SHEILA: Jack!
- Coming, Ellie Wellie?

1032
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,373
- Yeah.
- Come on down, my baby bunny, we miss you!

1033
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,675
- Jack!
- Ellie! - Jack! -Jack!

1034
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,409
SHEILA: Jackie, what are you
doing up there?

1035
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:30,612
Oh, God.
Are those definitely columns?

1036
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,447
- (chuckles, sniffs)
- LUCY: Jack!

1037
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:35,317
Well, a girl can certainly
tell the difference.

1038
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,319
(overlapping chatter
downstairs)

1039
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,121
- SHEILA: Jack!
- It...

1040
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:40,654
Actually, seriously,
it is getting a bit grim,

1041
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,724
so you may wanna,
uh, uh, come down.

1042
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,027
- Come on!
- We miss you!

1043
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,762
- ALL: Jack!
- (indistinct shouting)

1044
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:52,768
Wow, Ellie. That's...

1045
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,170
- big news on a big night.
- SHEILA: Ellie!

1046
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,505
ROCKY:
Jack, get down here now, mate!

1047
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,507

Jack Malik.
(chuckles)

1064
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:57,465
Welcome to
my little beach shack.

1065
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,168
(chuckles) Thank you
for coming all this way.

1066
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,371
- Good to see you. Well...
- (chuckles)

1067
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:07,275
- you're not very attractive.
- No.

1068
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,344
- You're out of shape.
- Yes.

1069
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,480
You're skinny,
yet, somehow, round.

1070
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,683
Uh-huh.

1071
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,884
You have been profoundly
unsuccessful for ten years.

1072
00:49:16,886 --> 00:49:20,322
- Yep.
- And until about a month ago,

1073
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,389
we'd call you
a complete failure.

1074
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,826
Well, that's not quite
how I'd put it, but...

1075
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,228
- We would say that you were a complete failure.
- Yeah.

1076
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,663
Sit, please.

1077
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,300
- But now, now...
- (clears throat)

1078
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,837
you've hit an extraordinary
songwriting groove,

1079
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,440
and you want to be the biggest
star in the world.

1080
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,543
- Well, mmm...
- "Yes" is the answer to that question.

1081
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,543
Well, yes, I guess.

1082
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:44,545
Not, "Well, yes, I guess."

1083
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,083
"Yes."

1084
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,750
I guess.

So, which is it?

I hated it, but n...

1129
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,715
I wasn't interested in it

1135
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,563
I hadn't given up smoking.

1136
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:18,833
I could just murder
a cigarette.

1137
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,902
Yeah.

1138
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,806
What's a "cigarette"?

1139
00:52:24,907 --> 00:52:27,244
What?

1140
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,750
(scoffs)

1141
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:38,989
Wow.

1142
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:46,895
Uh... oh, yes, Jack,
this is Hilary.

1143
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,331
She's gonna be working
with you on your image.

1144
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,032
Do I have to have an image?

1145
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,766
Well, if you don't
have an image,

1146
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:56,538
- then the lack of image becomes an image.
- Right.

1147
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,373
And the music sounds so joyful.

1148
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,076
It'd be a shame to let it down
by you being so...

1149
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:03,978
- off-putting.
- Mm-hmm.

1150
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,614
I can see how you two
might be friends.

Yeah, yeah.

1153
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:10,918
So, here...
Okay, here's the plan.

1154
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,054
We're gonna take
the five best songs,

1155
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,790
we'll put them online, right?

1156
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,592
No visuals, just the music.

1157

The enigma of Jack Malik.

1158

And then,
we wait until we've...

1159
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,101
fixed all of this,

1160
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:27,668

01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,304
- ELLIE: Hello?
- Hi, yes.

1415
01:05:11,306 --> 01:05:12,806
I-I came after you,

1416
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,775
but I missed the train.

1417
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,444
I'm sorry.

1418
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,512
- We need to talk.
- Let's talk.

1419
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,114
- Where are you?
- Right behind you.

1420
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:22,148
Having a cheese
and tomato baguette

1421
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,150
and a packet of crisps.

1422
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:26,223
(laughs)

1423
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:30,791
ROCKY:
Jack, would it, would it be

1424
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,460
annoying of me to point out
we should be

1425
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,828
- heading for the airport?
- How long have we got?

1426
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,632
Well, in real terms,
minus an hour.

1427
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,369
(panting):
Okay. (exhales)

1428
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,337
Rocky, this is completely not
a conversation you're part of.

1429
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:45,405
- No, of course it's not.
- Yeah.

1430
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:46,407
No, deeply private.

1431
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,708
With your future happiness
at stake.

1432
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,311
Right, did you two
sleep together last night?

1433
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,112
- No.
- No. - What a waste.

1434
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,646
Anyway, I'll keep an eye
on the clock.

1435
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,618
You've got precisely
four minutes.

1436
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,788
- So...
- So... - (phone chimes)

1437
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,791
Um...

1438
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,492
it's about last night.

1439
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,362
(sighs)
What about it?

1440
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,697
Well, it was almost
quite a moment.

1441
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,766
And I woke up, and I panicked.
And I wanted to talk.

1442
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,436
Okay, then talk.

1443
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,438
Right.

1444
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,608
So, um...

1445
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,878
N... (sighs)
'cause we... (groans)

1446
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,512
And how do you think
it's going so far?

1447
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:26,514
It's not great, but...

1448
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,583
No, no, let me try and help.

1449
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:33,454
(exhales) You've had 20 years
to make your move.

1450
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:37,291
Well, I couldn't exactly make
my move when I was seven.

1451
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,226
(stammers)
Then you've had ten years.

1452
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:43,329
Right. Well, we've always been
like brother and sister.

1453
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:47,300
It's very bad indeed for...

1454
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:49,302
for brothers and sisters
to have sex.

1455
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:50,804
- Except that we're not brother and sister.
- No, exactly.

1456
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,672
- Right, but...
- No, so...

1457
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:55,942
(exhales shakily)
I've been waiting half my life

1458
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:58,214
for you to wake up and love me.

1459
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:04,384
Having loved you
for half a lifetime,

1460
01:07:04,386 --> 01:07:05,719
I realized when you left,

1461
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,621
that I had made a bad choice
doing that.

1462
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:08,657
(breathes shakily)

1463
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,257
And now, it's got
even trickier because...

1464
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,793
if... (chuckles)

1465
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:15,795
When you were playing in pubs,
we were the perfect match.

1466
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,665
But now...

1467
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,833
I-I... (sighs)

1468
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,636
I'm an actual schoolteacher
in actual Lowestoft,

1469
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,505
and you're the world's greatest
singer-songwriter.

1470
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:27,708
- No, I'm not.
- Except that you probably are.

1471
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,210
Okay. Two minutes, ladies
and gentlemen, two minutes.

1472
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,947
Also, um...
Debra's on my phone for you.

1473
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,648
Apparently, she's having dinner
with the head of the label

1474
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,916
and you're meant to be
FaceTiming in, so...

1475
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:36,916
Just go away, Rocky.

1476
01:07:36,918 --> 01:07:38,485
Okay. One minute, 53.

1477
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,789
In the end, to you,

1478
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:43,757
I'll always, really, just be
Ellie with the frizzy hair.

1479
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,626
(sighs) And Ellie from
the "Fun chum" column.

1480
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:49,630
Ellie, who, for reasons
no one understands,

1481
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:53,467
drives you around in her car.
(chuckles)

1482
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,636
So, just go and please
just catch your plane.

1483
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:56,936
(sniffles)

1484
01:07:56,938 --> 01:07:59,907
We haven't finished
the conversation.

1485
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,009
Well, um, we have.

1486
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:05,779
We have.

1487
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,848
Unless...

1488
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,951
in Liverpool Lime Street at...

1489
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,355
11:14 on a Friday...

1490
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:17,893
(breathes shakily)
unless you choose to stay.

1491
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,400
DEBRA (over phone):
Jack.

1492
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:29,636
Jack. You have to
get on the plane.

1493
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:32,573
- What are you still doing in Liverpool?
- I can't stay today.

1494
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,774
I've gotta do
<i>The Late Late Show</i> tomorrow,

1495
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:36,676
and I've gotta do the
Marketing Meeting of Meetings

1496
01:08:36,678 --> 01:08:39,813
- and, oh, it's ridiculous...
- And that was your chance.

1497
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,782
(chuckling):
Now, quick, go.

1498
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,253
Please, leave.

1499
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:46,619
- Sorry.
- Hey, do you mind if I nick a couple of crisps

1500
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,800
- for the journey?
- Look, I want you to be happy and,

1501
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,558
and to make marvelous music.
I always have.

1502
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,493
- No, not all the crisps!
- Okay.

1503
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:54,961
Just go, go, go, go, go.

1504
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,797
Your, your future is
o-out the door and to the left.

1505
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,535
A taxi rank.

1506
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,974
JACK:
I'm sorry.

1507
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,012
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so...

Now, uh, Jack, I,

1514
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,809
I do believe I speak for
everyone in attendance today

when I say...

- (chuckles) it is the climax of our careers...
- Yes!

01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:50,783
...to be working on this
mind-bending album with you.

Give it up, y'all.

Yeah!

You, you don't have to clap
every time.

1522
01:09:58,593 --> 01:09:59,760
But thanks very much.

1523
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,362
- (laughter)
- Mr. Modesty!

1524
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,663
- Give it up for modesty!
- No, seriously, d...

1525
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:06,100
That's what he does
right off the top. (chuckles)

1526
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,935
Now, as you all know,
the songs we released online

1527
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:12,005
have created
unprecedented excitement.

1528
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,073
- (cheering)
- Yes.

1529
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,808
- Yes.
- No.

1530
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,476
So, now upon us falls

1531
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:20,046
the mighty task of packaging
everything together

1532
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:23,783
into one single,
irresistible album.

1533
01:10:23,785 --> 01:10:26,686
Now, Jack came up with some
title suggestions himself

1534
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:30,556
and, uh, (chuckles)
we worked on some of those.

1535
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:32,559
You know, I especially
got a kick out of

1536
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,996
<i>Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

1537
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,797
- (laughter)
- Yeah, that's... (chuckles)

1538
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:39,533
It's okay to laugh,
'cause it's funny.

1539
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,935
It is. It's, uh, (chuckles)
a lot of words, Jack.

1540
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:46,038
But ultimately, in the end,
we just felt it was, uh,

1541
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,175
- uh, too confusing, right?
- (murmuring assent)

1542
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,943
Too confusing. And, uh,

1543
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:54,747
<i>The White Album</i>
has some diversity issues.

1544
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:56,417
How?

1545
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,552
That's a lot of white, Jack.

1546
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:02,723
And I know you were
pretty enthusiastic

1547
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,525
about <i>Abbey Road.</i>
I gotta say,

1548
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,161
it didn't have a lot
going for it...

1549
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:08,796
if I can put it to you
like that.

1550
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:11,030
Uh, it's just a road,
with a bunch of people

1551
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:13,033
driving down the wrong side
of the street.

1552
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,167
- (chuckles)
- (laughter)

1553
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,689
That's not exactly
what I meant, but...

1554
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:17,738
But we've been developing
some ideas of our own, now.

1555
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,838
You know, we weren't just
sitting around.

1556
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,576
We focused on the one thing
that makes this man here

1557
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:26,613
unlike anyone else in the
entire world of music today.

1558
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,184
No collaborators, no cowriters,
no samples, no steals, hmm?

1559
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:32,752
No "featuring Cardi B,"

1560
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:36,189
no "featuring Bieber."

1561
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,993
Just the simple, pure genius...

1562
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,627
of <i>One Man Only.</i>

1563
01:11:41,629 --> 01:11:43,831
- (indistinct chatter)
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1564
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:48,601
And, as a second wave,
because of the miracle

1565
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:51,604
that is <i>One Man Only,</i>
it's just this.

1566
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:54,207
- Just this.
- (people gasping)

1567
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,476
- Mmm, mmm. I know.
- (cheering)

1568
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,610
I know.

1569
01:11:57,612 --> 01:12:00,980
So, let Operation Jack begin!

1570
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:02,216
Each week, a new song online.

1571
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:03,917
Each week, a new TV show.

1572
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,019
We start with Corden,
then we move to Kimmel,

1573
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,820
then Fallon, then Colbert

1574
01:12:07,822 --> 01:12:11,190
and then <i>Thursday Night Live!</i>

1575
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:12,658
Whoo!

1576
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,961
Song, song, song.
Show, show, show.

1577
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,662
Boom, bang, bazillions.

1578
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:18,698
Now, let's go make
so much money that,

1579
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,001
by this time next Christmas,
we are wiping our asses

1580
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,069
with solid-gold toilet paper.

1581
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:24,837
JAMES CORDEN: <i>Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome,</i>

1582
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:28,074
- the one, the only, Mr. Jack Malik!
- (cheering)

1583
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:30,711
<i>Jack, I'm such a fan.
It's great to meet you.</i>

1584
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,746
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

1585
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,046
<i>The songs of yours
that I've heard, they are,</i>

1586
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:35,748
<i>they're amazing.</i>

1587
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,818
What's life like for you
at the moment right now?

1588
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,119
I mean, the expectation
for the album

1589
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:42,055
is just rising
to insane levels, isn't it?

1590
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,091
Yeah, well, they're...
they're insane to me.

1591
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,827
- I mean, who here's excited about this album?
- (cheering)

1592
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,095
Listen to that.

1593
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:51,797
In this age of,
sometimes, 16 people

1594
01:12:51,799 --> 01:12:54,801
writing on one song,
suddenly, here's a guy,

1595
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:59,973
him and a guitar, and he writes
everything himself, on his own.

1596
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,015
Yeah. I mean... Well, you know,
that's how it always

1597
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,323
used to be, though, with,
uh, with, like, James Taylor

1598
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:05,711
or Stevie Wonder,
Bruce Springsteen.

1599
01:13:05,713 --> 01:13:07,146
So I don't think
it's that exceptional.

1600
01:13:07,148 --> 01:13:08,247
But is it just you?

1601
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:11,984
Well, yes.
(chuckles)

1602
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:15,188
- But is it?
- (laughter)

1603
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,090
(scoffs) Well, y-yes.

1604
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,025
- Yes, it is.
- Excellent.

1605
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,993
Because as chance would
have it, a-and do forgive me,

1606
01:13:20,995 --> 01:13:24,297
because we-we love a surprise
on this show.

1607
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,065
As chance would
darn well have it,

1608
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:29,670
I've got two men backstage

1609
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,171
who claim that the songs
are theirs.

1610
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,006
(audience murmuring)

1611
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,975
In fact, they say that all
of your tunes

1612
01:13:35,977 --> 01:13:41,280
are the work of their band,
The Beatles.

1613
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:43,283
(audience gasping)

1614
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,318
I d... I don't know...

1615
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,988
(chuckles) I don't...

1616
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:51,190
Well, let's see how this
plays out, shall we?

1617
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:52,592
Ladies and gentlemen,

Bang me backwards over a Buick.

It's gonna be the greatest

It's really incredible, man.

- How you doing? Um, I'm just in town for a couple

1629
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,930
of days. I thought I'd come
and see the genius at work.

1630
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,099
ED: I'm just trying to
work out your process.

1631
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:33,399
Is it music first
or lyrics first?

1632
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,467
JACK:
Um, it varies.

1633
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:36,970
But, like, with this song,
for instance, the, um,

1634
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,404
the-the "Hey Jude" one

1635
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:40,640
must have some story behind it.

1636
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,708
Well, yeah.
No, it do... it does.

1637
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:46,680
So, it was the son
of a friend of mine

1638
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,348
who was having a hard time.

1639
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,751
Um, it, it, it just,

1640
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:54,624
it came to me as a s...
as a song of comfort.

1641
01:14:57,892 --> 01:14:59,261
I don't believe you.

1642
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:02,194
What?

1643
01:15:02,196 --> 01:15:05,265
I mean, I just...
I don't believe you.

1644
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,868
- It's one genius idea after the other, you know?
- Oh, right.

1645
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,235
I do have a suggestion, though.

1646
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:11,304
Um, about the song.

1647
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:13,806
The-the title, "Hey Jude."

1648
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:16,743
Jude is just,
it's a bit old-fashioned.

1649
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:19,246
- That was the kid's name, right?
- What kid?

1650
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,381
- That the song's about.
- Oh, the kid, the kid, the kid.

1651
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,283
Yes, the-the... the sad kid.

1652
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:26,353
Now, l-let me just
give you this advice, right?

1653
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,953
Song title...

1654
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:30,157

I gotta take this.

1671
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,827
Just give me a minute, Ed.
Sorry.

I'm so glad you called.

1674
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,465
I'm not enjoying myself here
at all.

1675
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,498
Oh, right. Well, um...

1676
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,467
I've got two bits of news.

1677
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,002
I'm riveted.

1678
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,738
All right.
Well, the first one...

1679
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,073
- big one.
- Yeah?

1680
01:16:21,075 --> 01:16:23,476
The Pier Hotel.

1681
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,045
What? In Gorleston?
The place that

1682
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,846
closed down rather than
have me play?

1683
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:28,782
(chuckling):
Yes. It's reopening.

1684
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:29,649
You're bloody kidding.

1685
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,818
I am bloody not.
It's re-bloody opening.

1686
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,153
(chuckles)
That's amazing!

1687
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,887
That's huge news!

1688
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:37,424
That's-that's-that's
ma-bloody-ssive!

1689
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,391
- (sighs)
- All right, what's the second?

1690
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:41,827
I mean, it can't be as big.
But tell me anyway.

1691
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,396
Um...

1692
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:47,000
n-number two is...

1693
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,371
I've been seeing someone.

1694
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:52,708
Right.

1695
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,542
Do I know him?

1696
01:16:56,544 --> 01:16:59,345
Yeah. It's Gavin.

1697
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:02,118
I-I didn't want you to find out
from someone else.

1698
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,354
Every day,

1699
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,389
he puts me in the right column.

1700
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:11,257
Of course.

1701
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,559
The "true love" one.

1702
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,864
- (knocking on glass)
- Of course.

1703
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,898
I've gotta go.

1704
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,832
Ah, God.
Yeah, course you do.

1705
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,270
Um, okay. Bye. Bye.

1706
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,010
What? What could possibly
be so urgent

1707
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:33,046
that I can't make
a single phone call?!

1708
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:35,282
How the hell am I supposed to
get any of the songs right

1709
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:37,250
if you're just
all clustering me

1710
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,286
and stopping me
from being creative?

1711
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:42,924
How can I ever be creative
if I'm never ever left alone?!

1712
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,827
Okay.

1713
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,296
We'll leave you alone then,
genius.

1714
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:51,463
No, I'm not... I'm sorry.

1715
01:17:51,465 --> 01:17:55,435
No, it's g... It's, uh,
it's superstar rights.

1716
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:58,337
Treat the people that you work
with like shit on your shoes.

1717
01:17:58,339 --> 01:17:59,407
Hmm.

1718
01:18:03,277 --> 01:18:06,546
(sighs)

1719
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,113
Ellie told you the news, then?

1720
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:10,850
- Yeah.
- You know, I never, never understood

1721
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,418
what you didn't see in her.

1722
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:13,619
I mean, i-if I'd been you,

1723
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:18,591
twice a day I would have loved
her up like a lusty lion.

1724
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,926
Rocky, if I ask you
to just shut up,

1725
01:18:20,928 --> 01:18:24,396
really, really, really shut up,
would that be okay?

1726
01:18:24,398 --> 01:18:26,166
Right.

1727
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,903
Can I just start again and say,
"Isn't it wonderful news?

1728
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:32,037
"And I hope they'll be
very happy together

1729
01:18:32,039 --> 01:18:34,174
and have gorgeous kids."
Is that better?

1730
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,042
No. It's worse.

1731
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,644
I have got a third option.
But...

1732
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:41,046
I'm sorry.
Um, I'm really sorry, everyone.

1733
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:43,350
I'm just...

1734
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:45,051
I'm really stressed.

1735
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,420
What was so urgent?

1736
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,655
(over speaker):
Oh, um, no, nothing.

1737
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:52,626
It's just we have to
decide today where and when

1738
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:54,461
we're going to
launch the album.

1739
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,265
So, nothing big, apart from
probably the biggest decision

1740
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,000
of your stupid life.

1741
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,903
- What?
- You ass.

1742
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,137
I do have one thought.

1743
01:19:05,139 --> 01:19:06,506
- (crowd cheering)
- NEWSCASTER: <i>And the little town</i>

1744
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,042
<i>of Gorleston has never seen
anything like this before.</i>

1745
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:14,014
At 3:00 p.m. today, on the
rooftop of the Pier Hotel,

1746
01:19:14,016 --> 01:19:17,583
Jack Malik, local boy
turned pop phenomenon,

1747
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:21,320
will premiere his highly
anticipated first album.

1748
01:19:21,322 --> 01:19:22,988
And word seems to have got out.

1749
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,225
(cheering)

1750
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,297
(cheering continues
in distance)

1751
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,935
(knocking on door)

1752
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,002
Can we, uh...?

1753
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,037
Wow. Look at this.

1754
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,204
Look at you.

1755
01:19:39,206 --> 01:19:41,541
(sighs)
Didn't want to disturb.

1756
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,342
Just wanted to, you know...

1757
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:46,112
Well, it's...
Who'd have thought? (chuckles)

1758
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,314
While we were downstairs

1759
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:48,648
drinking cider
and eating jelly,

1760
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,984
you were up in your room
writing "She Loves You."

1761
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:53,219
- (chuckles)
- Well...

1762
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:55,587
Are you, uh,
you playing our song?

1763
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:58,123
- Your song?
- "Let It Be."

1764
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,426
Oh, well, we've never forgotten

1765
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:00,961
we were the first people
to hear it.

1766
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:03,296
Well, the start of it,
at least.

1767
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,497
Three times.
(chuckles)

1768
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:07,266
So proud.

1769
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:11,641
Our beautiful, blazing boy.

1770
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,342
- (clicks tongue) Aw. Oh.
- Aw. Still, don't wanna...

1771
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,478
- Mind your suit, love. It's... blue.
- Yeah.

1772
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,514
- We'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

1773
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,617
One last thing, son.

1774
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,252
Yeah, Dad?

1775
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:29,588
The sandwiches.
I see there's tuna.

1776
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,224
Are y-you gonna finish
them all?

1777
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,524
- No, please take them all.
- Or if you don't...?

1778
01:20:32,526 --> 01:20:37,296
Oh, what a day.
What an amazing day.

1779
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:38,598
- (whispers): Sorry.
- (sighs)

1780
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,234

1781

outside)

01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,543
Jack! Jack!

1785

- (chanting continues outside)
- Well, you look good.

1786
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,016
(chuckles):
That's a tight pant.

1787
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,219
- (chuckles)
- Mmm.

1788
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,354
(clicks tongue) Okay.
We've got a jaw and a chin.

1789
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,390
Ooh! (chuckles)
That's not bad.

1790
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:06,493
That's... This'll work.
This'll work. Mmm.

1791
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:08,161
- (kisses)
- Don't...

1792

(door closes)

1793
01:21:10,264 --> 01:21:11,663
- What? - Nothing.
- (knocking on door)

1794
01:21:11,665 --> 01:21:13,033
Yeah?

1795
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,268
(sighs, chuckles)

1796
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,769
- Oh. Hi, Ellie. Come in.
- (chuckles): Hi.

1797
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,671
- And who have we here?
- Um, Debra, this is Ellie.

1798
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,073
Ellie, this is Debra, my agent.

1799
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:21,373
- (sighs)
- No!

1800
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:23,676
The Ellie?

1801
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,778
- Oh! He's mentioned me?
- (chuckles)

1802
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,113
No, no. I'm kidding.
I know nothing

1803
01:21:28,115 --> 01:21:30,617
about his life because
he's a product to me.

1804
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,787
Unless you're the one
that was his manager.

1805
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:37,756
In which case, wow.

1806
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:39,492
Huge mistake giving that up.

1807
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,194
Oh, it's surreal, isn't it?
Being back at the Pier Hotel.

1808
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:44,096
- (chuckling): Yeah, indeed.
- Oh.

1809
01:21:44,098 --> 01:21:46,498
- I'm gonna go look at the stage, yeah?
- Mm.

1810
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,667
- Yeah.
- It's this way.

1811
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:51,203
Press conference in ten.

1812
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:52,704
Goodbye, lovebirds.

1813
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:54,474
(door closes)

1814
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:56,775
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
left Lime Street, okay?

1815
01:21:56,777 --> 01:21:58,644
- It was a terrible mistake.
- Oh, no.

1816
01:21:58,646 --> 01:21:59,813
- Don't say that, please.
- Can we...?

1817
01:21:59,815 --> 01:22:00,814
- Don't say that.
- Elle...

1818
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,314
I-I've heard your new songs.

1819
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,250
- They're incredible.
- O-Okay. No, they aren't.

1820
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,653
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1821
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,520
Everything changed
after the accident.

1822
01:22:08,522 --> 01:22:10,657
- Wha-What happened?
- GAVIN: Jack.

1823
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,359
- And here's Gavin.
- Jack, Jack.

1824
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:16,328
- Jack!
- (Jack chuckles)

1825
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:19,299
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
- Oh, hey, mate.

1826
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:20,300
- Jack.
- How you doing, man?

1827
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,801
- Jack. Jack.
- (Ellie chuckles)

1828
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:25,771
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, really?

1829
01:22:25,773 --> 01:22:27,841
It sounds like you do
and it's, "Jack."

1830
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:29,708
- (chuckles)
- Jack!

1831
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,810
- Oh...
- We were just coming to say good luck and, um,

1832
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:34,380
- break a leg.
- Yeah. Well,

1833
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:36,416
if I fall off the roof,
then a broken leg

1834
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,750
will be a good result.

1835
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:38,818
(chuckles):
All right, then. Let's go.

1836

Looks pretty quiet.

1842
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,551
Well, maybe we should do
a slightly shorter set?

No. Don't go back to teaching.

I've got no choice.

1855
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,617
Jack, if you go back
to teaching,

1856
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,685
that is when you've got
no choice.

1857
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:48,720
Yeah, because you'll end up
putting all your genius

01:23:48,722 --> 01:23:51,256
into all those kids
and then you won't have any

i-imagination or energy left
to put into your music,

01:24:25,893 --> 01:24:28,493
- (laughter)
- What's the inspiration behind

1872
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:29,828
"Strawberry Fields Forever"?

1873
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:32,532
- (clears throat) Well...
- Who was your favorite,

1874
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,399
John, Paul, George or Ringo?

1875
01:24:34,401 --> 01:24:37,537
- Sorry?
- Who's your greatest influence?

1876
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,338
Jack, is it true that you wrote
"Long and Winding Road" in...

1877
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,773
W-Why don't you record in
Abbey Road like they did?

1878
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,774
(overlapping shouting)

1879
01:24:42,776 --> 01:24:44,877
When can we see
another album, Jack?

1880
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,945
Jack, what's the story
behind "Let it Be"?

1881
01:24:46,947 --> 01:24:48,715
How'd you come up
with "Yesterday"?

1882
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,550
Thank you so much.
We have to go to the roof now.

1883
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:52,284
We'll see you later.

1884
01:24:52,286 --> 01:24:55,354
Jack, what was the first song
you ever wrote?

1885
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,889
Jack, what are you gonna
play for us today?

1886
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,993
It's a nice bar they've got
down there, actually.

1887
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:01,426
You haven't been drinking,
have you?

1888
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:04,329
No, I have not.
Well, y-yeah, I have.

1889
01:25:04,331 --> 01:25:06,933
But I find a couple of pints
midday sharpens my senses.

1890
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,970
- Oh!
- I'm not sure it does, mate.

1891
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:14,274
- (sighs)
- Right, here goes.

1892
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,542
Actually, before I open
this door, can I just say,

1893
01:25:17,544 --> 01:25:20,345
for a long time I didn't really
know why I'd been born.

1894
01:25:20,347 --> 01:25:21,514
Felt a bit pointless.

1895
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,015
But now I do know.

1896
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:27,819
I was born to serve the
greatest musician of all time.

1897
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:30,890
It is my honor now
to open this door

1898
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:34,460
for the moment the entire world
has been waiting for.

1899
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,298
Thanks, Rock.

1900
01:25:38,365 --> 01:25:41,400
Oh, it's certainly been one
hell of a journey, hasn't it?

1901
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:44,537
So it has. So it has.

1902
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:46,471
Right.

1903
01:25:46,473 --> 01:25:48,610
Here goes.

1904
01:25:51,879 --> 01:25:54,947
No, that's not...
Uh, wrong door.

1905
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:58,419
Um, let us, let us continue
our journey together.

1906
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:02,555
Right.

1907
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,590
Here it does go.

a minute, all right?

1940
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,055
Hey. Uh,

1941
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:51,890
these... these two have
been waiting to see you

1942

for an hour and they're

You can go now, Rock.
I'll be fine.

1949
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,851
I wonder if we could have
a little talk.

Lane and Strawberry Fields.

Yeah.

- No.

1958
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:38,607
I thought as much.

1959
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:44,580
Well, we just wanted to say
thank you, that's all.

1960
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:48,680
Thank me?

1961
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:51,082
We three seem to be
the only ones who remember.

1962
01:29:51,084 --> 01:29:52,717
And we can't sing.

1963
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,622
So, we just wanted to say...
thanks very much.

Myself also.
From bottom of heart.

I thought you were gonna
arrest me, or...

1968
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,835
- No. It's just lovely to hear the songs.
- Yeah.

1969
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:11,703
I have missed them so.

1970
01:30:11,705 --> 01:30:13,573
Can't remember
any of the lyrics.

1971
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,675
- No. I'm struggling there as well.
- I know.

1972
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:18,310
"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite's"
in completely the wrong order.

1973
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,211
- Very big mess, indeed.
- Oh, yeah.

1974
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:23,049
And "Hey Dude"? Really?

1975
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:24,884
I can't apologize.
It was bloody Ed Sheeran.

See, here's my take,
young Jack.

1992
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:57,216
A world without The Beatles,

1993
01:30:57,218 --> 01:31:01,119
is a world
that's infinitely worse.

1994
01:31:01,121 --> 01:31:02,755
So, thank you.

1995
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,893
And use it well.

1996
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,028
I'm trying, but it's hard.

1997
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,329
There's so much money
and success coming,

1998
01:31:11,331 --> 01:31:14,734
but I feel like I've become
the definition of living a lie.

1999
01:31:14,736 --> 01:31:16,939
Well, I can see it might
feel like that.

2000
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,947

2027
01:33:48,021 --> 01:33:51,556
<i>Fought for things
I believed in and won...</i>

2028
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:53,158
<i>a couple of times.</i>

2029
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,795
Found a woman I loved.

2030
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:59,098
Fought hard to keep her, too.

2031
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:02,137
Lived my life with her.

2032
01:34:03,236 --> 01:34:06,137
Fought hard for her?

2033
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:08,274
There were complica...
(sighs)

2034
01:34:08,276 --> 01:34:09,975
Sorry, what-what's your name?

2035
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:11,310
Jack.

2036
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:14,913
There were complications,
young Jack.

2037
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:17,483
Loss and gain.

2038
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,918
Prejudice and pride.

2039
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,953
But...

2040
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:26,457
it all turned out just...

2041
01:34:26,459 --> 01:34:28,329
fab.

2042
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:34,099
How's your love life?

2043
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:35,504
Bad.

2044
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:41,172
I let her slip away.

2045
01:34:41,174 --> 01:34:43,311
Try to get her back.

2046
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,011
You want a good life?

2047
01:34:47,013 --> 01:34:49,614
It's not complicated.

2048
01:34:49,616 --> 01:34:53,551
Tell the girl you love
that you love her.

2049
01:34:53,553 --> 01:34:58,893
And tell the truth to everyone
whenever you can.

2050
01:35:02,429 --> 01:35:04,395
Can I give you a hug?

2051
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:05,497
What?

2052
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:08,234
It's so good to see you.

01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,577
You made it to 78.

2057
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:20,816
You're a very strange man.

there's a little something
I want to say.

anything interesting before.

I'm gonna bring on

I know him as my dodgy
Moscow support act,

Ellie was my only fan.

who believed in me.

And that's why, tonight,
I asked Ed

2174
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:38,930
if I could come on and play,

2175
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:42,333
'cause I want to tell her...
and you,

2176

- what I've done.
- WOMAN: What are you saying?

Darn it, Ellie,
I've been untrue.

2178
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:55,680
All the songs I've sung tonight
were really written

2179
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,684
and performed by four men
called John Lennon,

2180
01:40:58,686 --> 01:41:02,554
Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr.

2181

01:41:07,328 --> 01:41:08,527
Me, I'm just a, sort of,

2185
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:14,533
get their astonishing stuff
into the world.

2186
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:17,702
- MAN: Beatles?
- And, uh, I-I-I passed their amazing work off

2187
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,905
as my own so I could look like
I was amazing, too.

2188
01:41:20,907 --> 01:41:22,873
(crowd jeering)

2189
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,610
I want you all to know that
I'm not gonna take any money

2190
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,878
for this work that isn't mine.

2191
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:31,315
So, you can have
all the songs for free.

2192
01:41:31,317 --> 01:41:33,685
Rocky, do it.

2193
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:35,354
ROCKY:
Right. Here goes.

2194
01:41:35,356 --> 01:41:38,256
JACK: They're being released,
for free, online now.

2195
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:42,728
And I'd love to not
take any more praise for it.

2196
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,564
So, um...

2197
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:47,435
I'm so sorry.

2198
01:41:50,536 --> 01:41:53,639
And while I'm at it, there's
one other thing to say as well,

2199
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:59,310
because... I've been a fool
twice over.

2200
01:41:59,312 --> 01:42:02,848
And I want to thank Ellie...

2201
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:05,553
- for her love.
- CROWD: Aw!

2202
01:42:08,454 --> 01:42:10,457
(Carol sighs)

2203
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:17,298
And, Ellie...

2204
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:21,970
Elle...

2205
01:42:24,871 --> 01:42:28,573
- I love you.
- CROWD: Aw!

2206
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:30,908
- Aw.
- (laughs): Oh.

2207
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:32,913
I always have.

2208
01:42:34,981 --> 01:42:37,618
Always.

2209
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,457
That's definitely enough
talking for one night.

2210
01:42:46,459 --> 01:42:47,626
(chuckles)

2211
01:42:47,628 --> 01:42:49,927
But it's been a blast.

2212
01:42:49,929 --> 01:42:52,430
- (cheering)
- MAN: We love you, Jack!

2213
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:54,866
WOMAN:
We still love you!

2214
01:42:54,868 --> 01:42:56,737
(cheering continues)

2215
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:06,347
(cheering loudly)

2216
01:43:09,048 --> 01:43:11,416
(panting):
Where's the stage?

2217
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:12,551
What floor is this?

2218
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:15,490
Where is the goddamn stage?!

2219
01:43:23,629 --> 01:43:25,997
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

2220
01:43:25,999 --> 01:43:28,667
- (sighs)
- That's a lot of information to take in.

2221
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:29,971
I know.

2222
01:43:31,172 --> 01:43:31,804
Well, if you'd told me I was
gonna be on the big screen,

2223
01:43:31,806 --> 01:43:33,441
I'd have got my hair done.

2224
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,675
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

2225
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:38,643
You didn't write
any of the songs?

2226
01:43:38,645 --> 01:43:40,412
(quietly):
No.

2227
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,614
That is very bad behavior.

2228
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,082
- On a global scale.
- Yeah.

2229
01:43:45,084 --> 01:43:46,788
It's very bad.

2230
01:43:54,727 --> 01:43:56,697
Well, this is a strange one.

2231
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:04,403
Of course I've always known
I was number two.

2232
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:06,771
But that's not
a bad place to be.

2233
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:10,675
Some of the best songs
never made it to number one.

2234
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:13,010
"Common People" by Pulp,
for a start.

2235
01:44:13,012 --> 01:44:14,779
It's a total classic.

2236
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:17,752
And obviously all I want
is for Ellie to be happy.

2237
01:44:21,621 --> 01:44:23,889
Gavin.

2238
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:26,460
Best man I ever met.

2239
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:30,194
(kisses)

2240
01:44:30,196 --> 01:44:31,695
- (sighs) Thank you, Gavin.
- MAN: He's here.

2241
01:44:31,697 --> 01:44:33,064
- He's here! - Go on.
- What is that?

2242
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:35,065
- Oh, God. - GAVIN: Go!
- Jack! - Jack!

2243
01:44:35,067 --> 01:44:36,467
- Oh, my... We should definitely go!
- Yeah, yeah.

2244
01:44:36,469 --> 01:44:38,068
- Shit!
- (all clamoring)

2245
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:40,104
Where's that lying
son of a bitch?

2246
01:44:40,106 --> 01:44:41,139
Move, idiots!

2247
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:43,707
MAN:
Look, he's here!

2248
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:45,042
- Jack!
- (clamoring)

2249
01:44:45,044 --> 01:44:46,610
Jack, please take me with you.

2250
01:44:46,612 --> 01:44:48,046
No one else will employ me.

2251
01:44:48,048 --> 01:44:49,079
I-I'm rubbish at my job.

2252
01:44:49,081 --> 01:44:50,148
Just hold them off, Rocky.

2253
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:52,050
In the name of money, stop!

2254
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:54,752
Get back here, you stupid,
English mother...

2255
01:44:54,754 --> 01:44:57,087
- Uh, ooh. Sorry, Debra.
- Jack!

2256
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,189
ROCKY:
Debra, stop this.

2257
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:00,395
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Jack!
