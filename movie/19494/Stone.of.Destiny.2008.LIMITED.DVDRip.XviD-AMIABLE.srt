of sandstone. You might pass right by it.

of our freedom, of our independence.

I suppose we'd forgotten about it.

Justice for Scotland.
Support home rule.

Justice for Scotland.

12
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,048
Come to the meeting.
Support home rule.

(THE REAL MCKENZIES:
"Tae The Battle")

18
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,428
Sorry!

19
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,929
The world we know is changing fast,
The walls are closing in

20
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,530
And now's the time to make a stand,
Don't let the cowards win

21
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:07,424
We're beset by a common foe,
Ye can hear the distant drums...

22
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,930
Come to the meeting.

23
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,370
(Man #2) With your support,
with your names upon this covenant...

24
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,730
as absolute proof of our resolve,

25
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:23,210
we will plunge this message
into the very heart of Westminster!

(Cheering)

27
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,187
Ian!

28
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:32,011
We, the people of Scotland,

29
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:35,451
declare our belief
that reform in the constitution...

30
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:39,891
is necessary in order to secure
good government.

31
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,451
With that end in view,

32
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:45,091
we solemnly enter this covenant.

33
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:46,611
We pledge ourselves...

34
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:48,971
in all loyalty to the crown...

35
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,051
to do everything in our power...

36
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,669
to secure for Scotland
a parliament!

37
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,052
With adequate
legislative authority...

38
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:03,192
in all Scottish affairs!

39
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:07,507
Scotland will not be ignored!

40
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,982
- Aye, let's see them ignore that.
- Aye.

41
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:32,893
It's only been 5 years since the war,
give them time.

42
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,973
Time? Time?
They've had centuries!

43
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,813
How many promises have they broken?
In 1707...

44
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:40,693
- Ancient history, mate.
- That's Scottish history, our history!

45
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:44,573
- The oldest nation in Europe.
- The oldest bloody nation in Europe!

46
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:47,374
You actually think Scotland
can look after their own affairs?

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:52,814
- Certainly not if you have the vote.
- All I'm saying is, give London a chance.

48
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,574
Here's the chance, right here.
See what they do with it.

49
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,614
If Scotland's ever going to be
a nation again...

50
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:01,585
Stop! Shut your stupid mouths.

51
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:04,534
There is no bloody nation.

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:09,506
There's nothing
but wind and rain and mud and shit.

53
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,894
Look at that. What does that say?

54
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:16,388
"North Britain", see?

55
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:20,156
We're all British now!

56
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:26,872
Scotland's dead. It died in its sleep,
and nobody even came to the funeral.

57
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,535
One for granddad.

58
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:36,215
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, you'll kill me.

59
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:39,055
- I will not.
- I heard you in there tonight.

60
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,976
You're an anarchist,
a menace to society.

61
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:44,976
Thanks, I'll take it as a compliment!
Come on.

62
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,876
All right.

63
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:48,856
- (Ian) You on?
- Yep!

64
00:04:48,857 --> 00:04:52,536
(Ian) Be careful, now.
Here we go. Hop!

65
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,216
(Groaning)

66
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:56,116
(Laughing)

67
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:01,029
- Ah, I broke my bum!
- (Ian) Ya-hoo!

68
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:08,351
- So, been to church recently?
- Yes, Dad.

69
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:12,297
- How's the studies? Going well?
- (Mutters)

70
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:15,790
- Speak up, please.
- Aye, fine.

71
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:23,466
- Still thinking about law?
- Aye, I'm not decided yet, but...

72
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:28,074
- Still with that covenant thing?
- Aye.

73
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:30,337
Harris, please.

74
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:32,577
Look at him, he's not stupid.

75
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,978
- Instead of studying...
- I am...

76
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,858
No, you're not. You're throwing your
life away with that nationalist rubbish.

77
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:40,578
- I have pride in my country.
- That's not the point.

78
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,658
Nobody could be prouder of Scotland
than I am, and you know it.

79
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:47,218
- But you have to get on in life.
- I know. I said I might try law.

80
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,658
When?
You try this, you try that. When?

81
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,868
Sweetheart, he's only come home
for the day, and Bill's here.

82
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,019
How are your studies, Bill?

83
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,219
Good, sir.

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,029
You're on to your second degree,
aren't you?

85
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,579
- Aye, sir.
- Still president of the students' union?

86
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,699
I'm not throwing my life away.
If I see wrongs that need to be righted...

87
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,939
There's always something wrong.
Let me tell you something, lad.

88
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,139
What's wrong is not out there.

89
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,995
What's wrong is in here.

90
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,238
This is a world for doers
not for dreamers.

91
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:36,233
Try and make something
of your life, son.

92
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,020
Here's those things.

93
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:53,100
If the trousers don't fit, bring them back,
I'll make a pillow cover.

94
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,540
Aye, Mum.

95
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,034
- Remember your father gave you that.
- Aye.

96
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:06,751
He doesn't mean to be harsh, Ian.

97
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:10,461
He had the same fire as you
when he was young.

98
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:14,701
But the world's not easy. He's worked
hard, made a good life for us all.

99
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,141
I know, Mum, I know.

100
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:19,315
He is proud of you, you know?

101
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,157
Aye, well, let him say so, then.

102
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,797
Thank you.

103
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:49,243
Ian... Bastards, eh?

104
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:56,143
- We'll get them next time.
- Aye, right...

105
00:07:56,144 --> 00:08:00,080
- They can't ignore us for ever.
- Oh, can they not?

106
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:03,383
- (Bill) People are outraged.
- No, they're not.

107
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,623
- How can you say that?
- Because it's bullshit.

108
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,943
- Calm down.
- It didn't even make the headlines!

109
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,063
- It's on the front page.
- Come on, mate!

110
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:13,103
How can people not care
about their own country?

111
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:15,481
People care. It's just...

112
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,184
- What?
- they're busy!

113
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:19,784
(Knocking)

114
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:23,424
Look, mate, nobody cared more
about the covenant than I did.

115
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:26,704
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Ian's blown a fuse again.

116
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,744
- We'll get a pint, talk about it.
- No more talk, all right? I'm serious.

117
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,864
- Someone's got to do something.
- What are you going to do, then?

118
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:36,424
- Get an army, invade England?
- Of course not.

119
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,199
What?

120
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:41,824
A symbol.
We need a symbol, a gesture.

121
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,985
Something to wake
these people up a bit.

122
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:46,585
- An act of revolution, a salt march.
- A what?

123
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:50,225
You know, Gandhi marched
across India protesting taxes on salt.

124
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:52,145
So you're Gandhi now?

125
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:56,625
Because, Bill, you know what we are,
what Scottish people are?

126
00:08:56,626 --> 00:09:00,755
We're ashamed.
Ashamed of being Scottish.

127
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:05,281
Screw them, 'cause I'm not.

128
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,118
Oh, look. Wendy Wood.

129
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,558
She was a friend of my mum's.

130
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,466
(Bill) Are you out of your mind?
It's in Westminster Abbey.

131
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,466
Right across from Parliament.
It's protected!

132
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:28,666
It's not a souvenir. "I'll take a postcard,
a tea towel and the Stone of Destiny".

133
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,466
Think of what it'll mean.
It's the most powerful symbol...

134
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,506
That's not the point.
They'll put you away.

135
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,747
You'll get twenty years.
Might as well go for the crown jewels!

136
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,227
You'd never get away with it.

137
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:41,947
I might.

138
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:46,827
Let's say you pull it off. You get it
out of the Abbey and back to Scotland.

139
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:49,547
- What will you do with it?
- I've not thought about that.

140
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,587
That's up to the people of Scotland.

141
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:57,347
But if it doesn't raise them to their feet,
then Scotland really is dead.

142
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:02,638
- It weighs a ton, you'll never lift it.
- Aye, not by myself.

143
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:08,788
Oh, you evil man.
I'm six months from my degree.

144
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,148
- I know.
- A lovely position waiting.

145
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,708
And your crazy scheme offers me what?
Destruction of everything I worked for.

146
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,948
Bill, all great schemes are crazy.
That's what makes them great.

147
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,388
- We'll ruin our lives.
- Probably, aye.

148
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,322
Prison, Ian.

149
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,683
Aye, maybe. But it's for Scotland.

150
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,949
I'm through with talk, Bill, I really am.

151
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,089
Now are you with me or not?

152
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,489
You bastard.

153
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,641
And a few more. Give us that
Westminster Abbey one, would you?

154
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,790
- Statesman's Corner.
- Statesman's...

155
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,770
Henry III, Edward I...

156
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,970
For you.

157
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,647
Here's the backdoor...

158
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:11,950
What do you have to do
to get a drink around here?

159
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,950
- I've told you already. Just take a seat.
- All right, I will.

160
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:17,203
Hey, hey!

161
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,390
Ya-hoo!

162
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:24,487
No, no, I don't think you're right, though.
If this was you, how can that be?

163
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:31,111
And... up!

164
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,631
(Groaning)

165
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,043
(Laughing)

166
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:39,831
- Islip Chapel... under renovation.
- That's right.

167
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,483
Edward I, Henry III,
Edward the Confessor...

168
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:46,723
...Coronation Chair.
- Yes!

169
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:54,272
'Talking about it was one thing.

170
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:57,571
'We Scots have always
been good at talking.

171
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:02,392
'But I had to see what we were
up against with my own eyes.

172
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:05,361
'Only then, would it be real to me.

173
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,363
'I was off to London'.

174
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:57,492
Hello. Did you want to join the tour?

175
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,114
Erm... no.

176
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,874
Is it all right if I just have
a wee look about?

177
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,367
As long as you promise
not to take anything.

178
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:33,635
(Man)... Henry Yevele incorporated
the latest technological advancement

179
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:36,515
for the 14th century,
the flying buttress.

180
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:41,276
With these, he was able
to raise the roof to 101 feet.

181
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:45,076
And it remains to this day
the highest roof in Britain

182
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:49,236
and the single leading cause
of stiff necks among tourists.

183
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:54,606
Now, if you'll follow me,
we'll go on to the cloisters...

184
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:09,329
- Nine pence, please.
- Oh... sorry.

185
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:13,317
- It's... err... very nice.
- Sorry?

186
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,557
The Abbey is so clean.

187
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:18,157
Must be a whole army of cleaners

188
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,775
in every night just... cleaning.

189
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,729
- Just once a week.
- Oh, that's surprising.

190
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,277
I suppose the night watchman could
always pick up a wee bit of rubbish.

191
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,055
Or men, depending
on how many you have.

192
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,009
(Coins jangle)

193
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,240
The Coronation Chair and Stone,
made in the reign of Edward I,

194
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:37,600
to house the Coronation Stone
of the Scots brought here in 1296.

195
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,040
Note how the Stone is incorporated
into the shelf beneath the seat.

196
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,360
When a king of England sits to crowned,
he sits over the Stone of Destiny,

197
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,320
which makes him, by Scotland's
own traditions, king of Scotland as well.

198
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:53,080
All without ever having to get
his royal trousers dirty.

199
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:56,380
The original coronation was in 1066...

200
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,641
(Telephone rings)

201
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:00,601
- Hello?
- (Ian) 'It's me'.

202
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:02,001
- Who?
- Me.

203
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,361
Ah, Gandhi. I was wondering
when you'd turn up.

204
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:08,121
I can't talk for long.
Never know who may be listening.

205
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:12,441
- I've been to visit my auntie's house.
- You what?

206
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:16,241
I said, I've been to my auntie's house
for a visit.

207
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:20,441
I didn't know you'd relatives in London.
Why didn't you go straight to the Abbey?

208
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:24,242
Listen, I'm telling you,
I went to visit her house.

209
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:26,482
Oh, right!

210
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,602
Where are you, I can hardly hear you?

211
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:31,562
- I'm in a pub! Would you let me talk?
- 'Sorry'.

212
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:35,122
I've had a good look at her new ring,
with the diamond in it.

213
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,442
- Right. How's it look?
- 'Lt's a lovely stone'.

214
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:41,122
But it looks heavier than we thought
and the setting's tricky.

215
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:43,722
- Is it?
- We may need another jeweler.

216
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:47,242
Right, we'll talk about it when you
get back. What train are you on?

217
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,603
I'll be late. I'm going for another visit.

218
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:51,523
Back to your auntie's house?

219
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:54,283
She won't be home,
but I'll go in the back.

220
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:57,523
OK. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

221
00:16:57,524 --> 00:17:00,523
Oh, and Ian,
if you see your auntie,

222
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:03,174
ask her if she wants her panties back.

223
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:36,244
Writing a book?

224
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:39,004
No, I'm just doing a wee sketch.

225
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:43,325
Why? Don't they have
any churches in Glasgow?

226
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,817
Move on, jock.

227
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,965
(Doorbell rings)

228
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,855
Mr. Hamilton, you're expected.

229
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,457
Just a moment, sir.

230
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:03,005
Ah, you're the young lad who
wanted to see me. Mr. Hamilton.

231
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:05,656
Have a seat. Some tea?

232
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:09,096
- Please. Thank you.
- Thank you Mrs. McQuarry.

233
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,966
A wonderful woman.

234
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,824
Been with the family since I was a boy.
Still treats me like one.

235
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,366
- I've seen you before.
- Err... covenant meetings.

236
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,366
That's right.
You're quite keen, if I remember.

237
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,459
(Laughs nervously)

238
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:29,726
(Clears throat)

239
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,343
Is this... err?

240
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,846
- Can I talk?
- I think so.

241
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:41,527
Because what I'm about to tell you
is of the utmost secrecy.

242
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:44,527
If what we say here
were to become known to others,

243
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:48,782
well, it could cause me and you
and Scotland irreparable harm.

244
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:53,226
Well, I'm on the edge of my seat.

245
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:55,807
I'm going to Westminster Abbey,

246
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:59,300
and I'm going to bring back
the Stone of Destiny.

247
00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:04,168
- Of course, it's been tried before.
- I know.

248
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,168
- Even considered it myself once.
- I didn't know that.

249
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,808
We were going to sneak in,
dressed like monks,

250
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,699
throw a cloak over the Stone
and drag it out after Sunday service.

251
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,488
I was 16.

252
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,448
Your plan's a bit more sophisticated,
I presume.

253
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,448
- Aye, I've got a couple of things...
- No details.

254
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,848
I'm chairman
of the Covenant Movement,

255
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,659
Rector of the University,
I can't afford to take the risk.

256
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,249
- You have accomplices?
- Aye.

257
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,369
- Done your research?
- Of course.

258
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,622
And the plan, is it airtight?

259
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,263
- Will it succeed?
- Aye, it will.

260
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,986
All right... what do you want from me?

261
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,449
Finances.

262
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,906
- How much?
- Fifty.

263
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,249
Fifty?

264
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,770
That's... err...

265
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,739
That's a fair amount.

266
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:07,386
Still, nothing's impossible, I suppose.
I... I could make arrangements.

267
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,850
You have a financial plan? A budget?

268
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:12,770
- Not really...
- I'll need something.

269
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:15,010
- We need to hire a car.
- Right.

270
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:19,550
Petrol, obviously, and meals.
Fish and chips, and so on.

271
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,730
£50,000 for fish and chips?

272
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,211
No. Fifty.

273
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:27,940
Fifty?

274
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:31,651
You came to me for £50?

275
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:34,011
Aye, well...

276
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,742
We're students, we're broke.

277
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,547
Mrs. McQuarry!

278
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,911
Kindly show young Mr. Hamilton
the way out.

279
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:59,772
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you, sir.
That was never my intent.

280
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:02,707
Thank you, ma'am. I'll find my own way.

281
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,932
Would you like me
to clear the tea things up?

282
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,132
No. I mean, yes.
Sorry, Mrs. McQuarry.

283
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,852
That's all right.

284
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,584
Nothing wrong with a man
changing his mind now and then.

285
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:23,391
Mr. Hamilton!

286
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,871
We never met.

287
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:47,934
Here's the chair. 5:30, one of us
slips into the back chapel.

288
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:52,774
My idea, so I claim the honor. At 6:30,
the Abbey closes and I hide here.

289
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:56,414
Under renovation, tarps, ladders,
it's perfect. I could be there all night.

290
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,774
Now, the night watchman
finishes around midnight, 1:00.

291
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,854
I come out, screw the lock off the door
and let you in.

292
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,414
Here's the brilliant part.
I say we do it at Christmas.

293
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,094
All of London will be in the pubs
at parties.

294
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,575
We'll come down on them when they're
lying in drink, their minds unbuttoned.

295
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:15,988
What? What, Bill, what's wrong?

296
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,985
- I plan to go home for Christmas.
- So cancel it.

297
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,175
I've got a committee meeting on 23rd.

298
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:27,870
Miss it.

299
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:34,193
- We should give this a bit more thought.
- No. Why? What's the matter with you?

300
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,736
I've been thinking, Ian...

301
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:40,856
I'm so close to my degree,

302
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:43,496
and I've got such a great
position waiting.

303
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:46,616
I mean, we could do 20 years for this.

304
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,536
Are you backing out?

305
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:53,268
We're getting married, Ian.
Jen and me. Next spring.

306
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:57,056
I mean, this is my life
we're talking about here.

307
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,673
I can't risk it.

308
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:02,514
Aye, aye. No, fine.

309
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:06,350
Forget it, Bill, I'll go myself.
I don't need you.

310
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,177
I'm sorry, Ian.

311
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,908
I really am.

312
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,079
(Jazz orchestra plays
"I've Got You Under My Skin")

313
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,832
Oh, hi.

314
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,659
(McCormick)... and this person asks,
"Are we going to keep the monarchy?"

315
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,473
And this voice from the back shouts,
"Aye, it's you! Long live King John!"

316
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:33,780
Excuse me a second.
Mr. Hamilton, is it?

317
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:35,340
Yes, sir.

318
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,719
- How's things?
- Aye... moving on.

319
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,593
Good.

320
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:47,460
One moment.

321
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:51,954
Jamie... I hear you're interested
in joining the committee...

322
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:55,672
What would you like me to do?

323
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,381
(Clears throat)

324
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:03,301
- Excuse me, it's Kay, isn't it?
- It might be.

325
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,341
- Ian Hamilton.
- I know.

326
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:08,021
Nice to meet you. You dancing?

327
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:11,501
- You asking?
- Aye, I might be.

328
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:14,661
I like the idea of teaching.

329
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:17,861
Working with children and helping them
find their way in the world.

330
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:19,981
It must be the Highlander in you.

331
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:24,182
Only happy when you're tending
the helpless or... battling the English.

332
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:26,302
Well, we're simple folk.

333
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:29,342
I like your necklace, by the way.
Boyfriend?

334
00:25:29,343 --> 00:25:32,582
No. From my father.
Wonderful man. A crofter.

335
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:37,102
- Ah, a wee farm lass.
- I grew up with the sheep.

336
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:40,102
And watching my father struggle
every day trying to feed us.

337
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:43,142
Paying taxes to a government that
knows as much about the Highlands

338
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,873
as they know about the moon.

339
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:49,303
What does he think of you now,
his young Covenanter?

340
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:53,223
Don't know, he's dead.
His ship was torpedoed in the war.

341
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:56,955
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Me, too.

342
00:25:57,544 --> 00:26:01,623
By the way,
why haven't you said hello before?

343
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,663
I sit right behind you
in European History.

344
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:08,715
- Didn't know you wanted me to.
- I didn't but that's no excuse.

345
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:33,184
- What's wrong?
- What are you doing for the holidays?

346
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:35,915
Going home. You?

347
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:39,881
I'm going to London
to bring back the Stone of Destiny.

348
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:44,643
I mean it.

349
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:48,185
You do, don't you?

350
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:51,225
And so did Wendy Wood
and Bertie Gray.

351
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:56,145
Every Nationalist worth his salt
has talked about it, but that's just talk.

352
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,665
I know.

353
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,385
Has it occurred to you there's a reason
why it's never been done?

354
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:03,354
Look, I've... I've been to London.

355
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:06,425
I know I can do it.

356
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,997
- Would you come with me?
- No.

357
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,386
If we fail, we'll be laughed at.
Even Scotland. I couldn't bear that.

358
00:27:13,387 --> 00:27:15,506
Nor could I, but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't do it.

359
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:18,466
- Can I ask why you're doing this?
- Ultimately, the glory of Scotland.

360
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,666
- Och!
- What?

361
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:23,626
It's not as much about
the glory of Scotland

362
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:26,866
as it is about the glory
of Ian Hamilton.

363
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,466
There's no need to insult me.
If you don't want to go...

364
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:33,426
I never said that.
I just want to know the lay of the land.

365
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:37,627
- All right, then, why me?
- For a start, you were recommended.

366
00:27:37,628 --> 00:27:40,387
And let's be honest... you're perfect.

367
00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:43,507
- Who'd suspect a wee lass like you?
- Is that what you think of me?

368
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,647
- I don't know you...
- No, you don't, do you?

369
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:51,387
First, the rules.
Number one, the answer is no.

370
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,347
I'm going to London for the Stone.

371
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:56,387
Nothing extracurricular,
if you follow my meaning.

372
00:27:56,388 --> 00:28:00,067
- It'd not even crossed my mind.
- Och, now you're insulting me.

373
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:04,039
- No, I... I didn't mean like that.
- What did you mean?

374
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:09,508
I just... Look, I think you're a smasher.
I just don't think of you in, like...

375
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:13,428
- I mean, I might if...
- Stop talking. You're making it worse.

376
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:16,921
(Raucous laughter and screaming)

377
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:21,948
- Him.
- Him?

378
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,628
(Screaming)

379
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:25,708
(Girl) Stop it!

380
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:29,108
Come on, we need
a bit of muscle, don't we?

381
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,009
Come on.

382
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,909
(Ian) 'I didn't really know Gavin,
but I'd seen him.

383
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,629
'An engineering student better known
for his drinking than his studies.

384

'But Kay said if you got past that,
he had a heart as big as Scotland'.

385
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,069
(Gavin) The Stone of Destiny?
(Ian) 'She was right'.

386
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,049
Let's do it.

387
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,989
(Ian) 'On top of that,
he was bloody strong! '

388
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,119
(THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS:
"Mutiny, I promise you")

389
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:18,723
Here's the mutiny I promised you

390
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:25,045
And here's the party it turned into

391
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:32,284
Here's the mutiny I promised you

392
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,887
And here's the moment it turned into

393
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,921
- So, tomorrow, then?
- Aye, first light.

394
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,551
You know, the Scots have a history
of being great debaters.

395
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:50,032
More often than not,
that's as far as we get.

396
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:53,352
I've poured my whole heart and soul
into the Covenant Movement.

397
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:56,112
It pains me to think maybe
it wasn't enough. Cigarette?

398
00:29:56,113 --> 00:29:58,888
Oh, you're out.

399
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:07,045
Ring me if you need help.

400

Don't worry, we won't.

401
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:13,192
That's quite the ego you have there.

402
00:30:13,193 --> 00:30:16,685
Now remember, we're in your hands.

403
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,313
Christ, Gavin! What's that?

404
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,553
You're lucky to get anything.
She runs, though.

405
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:34,648
Aye, but for how long?

406
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:43,593
- Who the hell is that?
- That's Alan. He wants to help.

407
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:46,474
- You didn't tell him?
- Well, he asked me.

408
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:48,674
You told him? How could you?

409
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:51,874
- He's not going to squeal, I know him.
- I don't give a shite!

410
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,194
- How old is he?
- 19, 20, what's the difference?

411
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:56,474
Look at him, he's... meek!

412
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:59,914
Well, he's here.
That should count for something.

413
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:03,674
Look, he's just shy, that's all.
I'll take full responsibility.

414
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:07,884
One mistake, he's on a train home.
Ye cannae say fairer than that.

415
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:09,914
No...

416
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:13,488
Hi, I'm sorry, we can't use you.

417
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:18,115
- Yeah. Course. All right.
- You'll have to forget you ever saw us.

418
00:31:18,116 --> 00:31:20,755
(Sighs) Yeah, I understand.

419
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:25,966
Ian, he's got a car.
And we could really use another car.

420

(Ian) 'We'd been thrown together,
the four of us. Strangers, really.

we'd known each other for years.

made him a good listener.

from the start'.

(Rousing orchestral music
over dialogue)

425
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,960
Basically, two teams.
I'll go with Gavin, Alan with Kay.

426
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:51,160
- I'll screw off the lock...
- We go in, get the baby.

427
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,721
- Put it in your car.
- Switch it to the Ford.

428
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:57,041
I get in Alan's car
and put my foot down for Wales.

429
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,081
- But the Stone's in the Ford.
- She's the decoy.

430
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:02,001
- In case anybody's seen your car.
- Right...

431
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:04,321
- Then we drive the Stone to Scotland?
- No.

432
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,561
That's the beautiful part.
We drive it south.

433
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:10,121
- They'll expect us to go to Scotland.
- Right.

434
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:12,521
We stash it somewhere, come back
when the heat's off. Simple.

435
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:15,481
Aye. What could possibly go wrong?

436
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:18,052
(Giggling)

437
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:21,242
(Ian) Thank you.

438
00:34:21,243 --> 00:34:23,222
Thanks.

439
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:25,842
(Gavin) Cheers.

440

Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
They'll be in their cups.

441
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,202
Bugger that. Excuse my French.

442
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,522
Why put off till tomorrow
what we can do tonight?

443
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:37,962
He's right. It's not a bad idea.
Why not do it tonight?

444
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:41,122
We've not slept.
I mean, can we even think straight?

445
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:45,502
Thinking's overrated. Come on,
are we men of talk or men of action?

446
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:50,563
We have to leave now.
Check your times.

447
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:53,055
Twenty past three now.

448
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:03,055
- Well, I'll see you, I guess.
- Depending on visiting hours in prison!

449
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:09,417
- Well, go on, now.
- Aye, we should leave.

450
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:12,932
See you at the party.

451
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:23,218
- (Ian) Ow!
- (Gavin) Hold still.

452
00:35:24,245 --> 00:35:29,455
- Don't stick me with the damn thing!
- Shut up, stop acting like a baby!

453
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:34,124
Will you stop moving?
Lie back and think of Scotland!

454
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:38,504
That's it. Careful with this,
'cause this is the big one.

455
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,820
Oh... honestly!

456
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:49,942
Get that down.
There, let's go have a look.

457
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:57,537
(Metallic clanging)

458
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,445
- You all right?
- Aye.

459
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:04,734
- How do I look?
- When's the blessed event, Mother?

460
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:12,206
And a merry Christmas to you, too, sir!

461
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:16,046
Can't wait to see the look on his face
tomorrow morning. Ready?

462
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,166
You realize the moment
I walk through that door,

463
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:21,579
my life will never be the same?

464
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:33,625
Right. Keep your eyes on Daddy.

465
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,127
- (Woman) Hello.
- Hello.

466
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:53,047
- Are you here to take the tour?
- Only if you're giving it, sweetheart.

467
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:55,927
Oh, no. I just hand out
the educational literature.

468
00:36:55,928 --> 00:37:01,297
Oh. Well, darling, by all means,
educate me.

469
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,689
(Man)... and it remains to this day
the highest roof in all of Britain

470
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,609
and the single leading cause
of stiff necks among tourists.

471
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,388
Well, I'm afraid that's all for today,
so if you'd like to follow me...

472
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,649
(Woman) The chapel is closing
in five minutes!

473
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,141
Five minutes to closing!

474
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:23,651
(Door opens)

475
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:26,188
(Tools clang)

476
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,104
(Doors shut)

477
00:39:42,454 --> 00:39:45,025
(Screams)

478
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:49,227
What the hell are you doing in 'ere?

479
00:39:49,935 --> 00:39:53,534
- Why didn't you shout out?
- Well, because of...

480
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:57,823
You're lucky I didn't hit you over
the 'ead. I'm patrolling all night.

481
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:00,574
How old are you?

482
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:02,793
How... how old am I?

483
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:07,072
Hey... you all right?

484
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:10,347
Aye.

485
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,865
You look 'horrible.

486
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:18,495
Oh... making yourself comfortable.

487
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:20,873
All right, put 'em on.

488
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:24,709
Come on, don't take all night about it.

489
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:29,815
Right, son. Let's be 'avin' you.

490
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:32,193
Come on. Come on, come on.

491
00:40:32,776 --> 00:40:36,335
There's a good lad.
You can't spend a night in 'ere.

492
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:38,316
Come on.

493
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,336
Wait a minute.

494
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,668
Merry Christmas.

495
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,476
(Metal clangs)

496
00:40:58,177 --> 00:41:00,976
- Christ!
- Hey, shut up! What happened?

497
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:04,057
It just doesn't make any sense.
We should've had half...

498
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:06,817
- He said he's patrolling all night.
- Maybe not...

499
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:09,937
I got caught, didn't I? Why did he
have to be so damn nice about it?

500
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:13,737
- He thought you were a vagrant.
- It's bad luck. We try again tomorrow.

501
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:17,777
- We'll think of something.
- Will we? Any brilliant ideas?

502
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:22,715
- Not that you'd listen anyway!
- Stop it, both of you! We're all tired!

503
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:28,337
Do you remember Robert the Bruce,
when he fought the English?

504
00:41:28,338 --> 00:41:30,617
And the story of his spider?

505
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:34,858
Six times he watched her spin that web
and six times she failed.

506
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,509
But she never gave up.

507
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:44,309
I think we should go back to the Abbey
and look for spiders.

508
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,396
Spiders!

509
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:05,713
Mrs. McQuarry... I have some work
to finish, so I'll be up for a bit.

510
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,230
You should get some sleep.

511
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,355
I have a bit to do myself.

512
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,231
Ian!

513
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:06,321
Ian, it's Kay! Hurry up!
Hurry up, it's Kay!

514
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:14,993
(Gasping)

515
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:17,341
She's burning up.

516
00:43:17,342 --> 00:43:20,357
Kay? Kay?

517
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:24,022
- I've got to get her to hospital.
- They'll ask questions.

518
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:26,673
A doctor, then. Something!

519
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:31,561
(Indistinct Annoy announcements)

520
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,914
Oh, thank Christ.

521
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:44,022
- Where's Ian?
- He's checking the schedules.

522
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:47,561
He wants to put Kay
on the next train home.

523
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:51,120
Gavin...

524
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:54,663
I've been thinking.
Maybe we should all be on it.

525
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:56,903
- Jesus Christ!
- Well, look at us.

526
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:59,863
Our money's almost gone,
we're half frozen and no sleep.

527
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:02,503
- It's a miracle we're not all in hospital.
- You want to quit?

528
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:04,143
- No!
- What are you saying?

529
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,783
I'm just saying,
maybe we need to rethink it.

530
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:09,143
Get Kay home and regroup.
The Stone's not going anywhere.

531
00:44:09,144 --> 00:44:12,143
I cannae believe this.
I stuck my neck out for you...

532
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:14,237
I'm just saying.

533
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:18,561
Next train to Glasgow's 11:25.

534
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:28,163
- What's the matter with you two?
- Tell him, then.

535
00:44:29,785 --> 00:44:33,184
- What? Tell me what?
- Alan wants to quit.

536
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:37,304
No, I don't! I'm just saying
maybe this is happening for a reason.

537
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:41,425
We're nearly half dead, and even
if we weren't, we can't do it without Kay.

538
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:44,825
One of us has to stay with the car.
That only leaves two to lift the Stone.

539
00:44:44,826 --> 00:44:50,105
It's not possible, you've said it
yourself, Ian. Maybe it's a sign.

540
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:53,865
Maybe we should just go home and
make a new plan. Try again another day.

541
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:56,905
- Is that what you wanna do?
- Yeah.

542
00:44:56,906 --> 00:44:58,985
No.

543
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:00,985
No, I really don't know.

544
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:03,105
I can't think anymore.

545
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:05,164
All right.

546
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,946
- Will you talk to him?
- Talk to him yourself!

547
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:13,306
You said you'd take
full responsibility for him.

548
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:17,226
Aye, and I will.
But answer me this: Is he wrong?

549
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:19,586
Could you for once in your life
accept the possibility

550
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:23,079
that somebody other than you
might be right?

551
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,963
All right. Come on.

552
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:43,707
Right, here's what we're going to do.
We'll take a vote. A secret ballot.

553
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,747
'S' means stay, 'G' means we go home.

554
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:49,227
And if you vote to go,
there's no shame in it, all right?

555
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:51,764
We can always live to try another day.

556
00:45:53,148 --> 00:45:55,267
But I will say this.

557
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:58,123
If we go home. Lf...

558
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:01,963
Will we really ever come back?

559
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,708
Doesn't the lassie get to vote?

560
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,628
We didn't think you heard.

561
00:46:15,629 --> 00:46:18,768
I'm just ill, I'm not dead.

562
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,289
"Stay".

563
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,843
"Stay".

564
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,486
"Stay".

565
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,764
Four "stays".

566
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,710
Excuse me, I wonder if you have
any rooms available?

567
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:12,710
We've just come in from... Shrewsbury.
And, err...

568
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,110
- That the missus?
- Aye. Err, no, sorry, she's my sister.

569
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:17,990
Is she drunk?
I won't have drunkards in my house.

570
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:22,191
No, she's not, she's just not feeling
very well. She just needs to sleep.

571
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:25,047
- All right, come in.
- Thank you.

572
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,151
Thanks for sticking up for me
back there.

573
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,449
Sod off.

574
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:45,551
Gavin?

575
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:47,191
(Sighs)

576
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:48,472
Aye?

577
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:51,912
- Are you sorry you came?
- Of course I am.

578
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:55,405
Nobody in their right mind
would want to go through this.

579
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,712
Then why are you?

580
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,488
I'm mad, obviously.

581
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:04,832
No.

582
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,971
No, really, why?

583
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:12,092
Gavin Vernon, the mad bloke,
opens beer bottles with his teeth.

584
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:18,713
And you want to prove to people
that there's more than that?

585
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:20,633
Prove it to myself.

586
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:25,953
It's funny... I'm just the opposite.
Being shy, you know?

587
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:29,764
Even when I was a wee boy, when
people would look at me, I'd just...

588
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,753
...freeze up.

589
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:37,133
But I always wanted to be someone,
you know? Have adventures.

590
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:44,252
- I just never though I'd have the nerve.
- You think too much.

591
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:50,594
Be more like me. Just dive in.
Something will come to you.

592
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:54,007
- Dive?
- Aye.

593
00:48:56,755 --> 00:49:00,714
What did you say to Ian,
that day in Glasgow?

594
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:04,969
I told him if you messed up,
I'd thump you and send you home.

595
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:07,767
Oh.

596
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,973
And I will, too.

597
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:31,455
Ian?

598
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:37,089
- Promise you'll come get me.
- I swear.

599
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:44,491
I knew you'd try to get me into bed.

600
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,694
What are you thinking?

601
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:54,516
Just that it's not long to Christmas now.

602
00:49:54,517 --> 00:49:56,236
I told my mum and dad
I'd be with friends

603
00:49:56,237 --> 00:49:59,196
and that I'd see them on Boxing Day.

604
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,847
My mum was so hurt.

605
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:09,117
I never meant to put you all through this.

606
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:13,816
Don't flatter yourself.
We're here because we want to be.

607
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,997
Stop taking everything on yourself, Ian.

608
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,517
You're not the great high and mighty.

609
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:24,933
Just another boy with grand ideas...
and a head like a concrete block.

610
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:30,838
And why do you want to push a rock
up a hill by yourself?

611
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,358
Just let go a wee bit.
Maybe people will like you more.

612
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,852
- You seem to like me fine.
- No, I don't, I just put up with you.

613
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:46,257
If you go for the Stone without me,
I'll break your arm.

614
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,559
(Ian) 'We were stuck.
We needed a new plan.

615
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,919
'So back we went to look for spiders.

616
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,857
'Lt was Gavin's idea to draw someone
out and grill him for information.

617
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:29,600
'Since the night watchman now
knew my face, I let him try'.

618
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:33,960
(Mimics English accent)
Magnificent architecture, isn't it?

619
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,895
It's smashing stonework, what?

620
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:45,456
You just don't see this sort of
craftsmanship anymore, do you?

621
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:50,253
(English accent) No... no, you don't.

622
00:52:03,802 --> 00:52:06,770
- I'm going.
- What? G-Gavin!

623
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:09,521
Gavin?

624
00:52:09,522 --> 00:52:11,041
Come on!

625
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:16,001
- Come on!
- Gavin, wait for me!

626
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,882
(Rings bicycle bell)

627
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:21,533
Gavin, will you stop that!

628
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:26,082
Ah!

629
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,141
Come on!

630
00:52:33,123 --> 00:52:35,215
Excuse me?

631
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:39,562
- Can I help you?
- Oh, good afternoon, sir.

632
00:52:39,563 --> 00:52:43,242
We were just passing by and remarking
on what a masterful example

633
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,723
of ecclesiastical architecture this is.

634
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:48,163
Sebastian Fenster, School
of Architecture, Whoreson College.

635
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,083
I've never heard of it.

636
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,723
I'm particularly impressed with
the preservation of the woodwork.

637
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,883
To my eye, the carvers
of the late Gothic period

638
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:58,363
far surpass anyone from
the Jacobean or Tudor periods.

639
00:52:58,364 --> 00:53:01,043
- I quite agree.
- They've really stood the test of time.

640
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:06,572
And... such formidable doors.
Oak, aren't they?

641
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,443
If it was up to me, we'd smash
through these stained-glass windows.

642
00:53:10,444 --> 00:53:12,004
That might be too noisy.

643
00:53:12,005 --> 00:53:16,004
But the old codger told me the Poet's
Corner door was replaced after the war.

644
00:53:16,005 --> 00:53:19,364
Now that tells me it's made of pine,
unlike this door here, here and here.

645
00:53:19,365 --> 00:53:21,364
Made of oak, never get through that.

646
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,404
The strength of oak is 1200 psi.
What's pine?

647
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:26,164
- 600.
- Right, no problem.

648
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:29,044
The right tool, the right place,
the right strength, we're through.

649
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:32,423
If we can't get through it
with a crowbar, we'll use his head.

650
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:37,404
- Come here you!
- (Alan) Gavin! Stop it! Put me down!

651
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:40,205
(Ian) 'And that was it,
after all our planning,

652
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:43,725
'we'd decided on a good,
old-fashioned Highland raid.

653
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:46,865
'But before that
I had a promise to keep'.

654
00:53:54,926 --> 00:53:57,685
- Who is it?
- Hi, I've come to fetch my sister.

655
00:53:57,686 --> 00:53:59,605
It's 2:00 in the morning!

656
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:02,845
Sorry. Our father's ill,
we have to leave immediately.

657
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:06,384
- I'll send her out.
- Actually, if I could just...

658
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:17,886
(Landlady) Get me the police.
Yeah, those Scottish boys are back.

659
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:21,406
How should I know? They're up to
something. Send someone right away.

660
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:23,806
Oh, Christ!

661
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:26,218
What's taking her?

662
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:30,166
Look, go and see again. Go on.

663
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:32,623
(Sirens wailing)

664
00:54:34,408 --> 00:54:37,422
- Shit!
- Hide it, hide it!

665
00:54:42,568 --> 00:54:46,060
(Alan) Get it on. Get it on.
Where's your coat?

666
00:54:49,968 --> 00:54:52,220
(Detective) You two...

667
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:56,302
License, please, sir.

668
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:03,768
What's... what's wrong, sir?

669
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:07,408
Lady there says you told her
you're from Shrewsbury.

670
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:09,183
Mr. Hamilton.

671
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,168
From Glasgow.

672
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:15,968
- Is this your car, sir?
- Aye, it is.

673
00:55:15,969 --> 00:55:18,368
Papers.

674
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:21,208
- Right, out!
- Hold on a second, sir...

675
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:25,827
- If you'd just let me explain...
- Thank you, sir!

676
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,609
What seems to be the trouble?

677
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,809
- Who are you?
- I'm with them. Is something wrong?

678
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,929
This gentleman seems to think
we stole the car.

679
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:42,369
That's silly. Where's Gavin?
Hasn't he got the papers?

680
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:47,819
Err... aye. Gav...
Our mate Gavin in the car there.

681
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,265
- How are you doing? All right?
- Worlds better, thanks.

682
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:01,146
(Detective) You mind
stepping out of the car, sir?

683
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,770
(Sighs heavily)

684
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:10,149
That road there leads you
straight out of London.

685
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:12,862
Take it.

686
00:56:25,372 --> 00:56:28,771
I heard her phone the police.
I came straight down.

687
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:31,491
Four Scots, two cars,
suspicious circumstances.

688
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,931
- They'll put two and two together.
- Maybe not.

689
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,171
I didn't come here to freeze my arse off
and go home with nothing.

690
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:40,611
It's 3:10. We've missed our time.
We've no clue what we're walking into.

691
00:56:40,612 --> 00:56:42,531
- Who cares?
- I say we try anyway.

692
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,149
- And they've got our names.
- They've also got our Stone!

693
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:50,508
- What about you?
- Yeah, let's do it.

694
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,783
Aye, we might as well
go down in flames.

695
00:57:25,894 --> 00:57:28,828
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Go.

696
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,504
(Gavin) Just cut it.

697
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:44,993
(Groaning)

698
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,472
(Gavin) Go, go!

699
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:59,111
- Higher. Try higher.
- Give me some light here.

700
00:58:02,655 --> 00:58:06,431
- (Ian) Come on.
- To hell with it. Get back.

701
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:10,911
- (Bang reverberates)
- Christ! Can you do that quietly?

702
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,055
- (Alan) Shut up!
- (Giggling)

703
00:58:21,056 --> 00:58:23,975
- (Alan) Gavin!
- (Raucous laughter)

704
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:27,495
Will you be quiet?
Come on, shush! Ian!

705
00:58:27,496 --> 00:58:29,895
(Laughter and banging)

706
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:32,193
(Gasps)

707
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:35,495
(Gavin) Come on.

708
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:37,016
(Groaning)

709
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,394
(Wood creaks)

710
00:58:42,337 --> 00:58:44,714
See? No problem.

711
00:58:48,977 --> 00:58:51,069
Come on.

712
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,873
Give me that.

713
00:59:02,698 --> 00:59:05,075
Right, take that.

714
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:12,797
- Gavin!
- Hey... it's Christmas!

715
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:18,390
(Groaning)

716
00:59:20,618 --> 00:59:22,777
OK, give me a hand.

717
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:25,269
(Wood creaks)

718
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:30,058
- Right, get behind it. Ready? Push.
- One, two, three...

719
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:31,658
(Groaning)

720
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:35,549
- (Gavin) Come on, push it! Again!
- One, two, three...

721
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:41,418
(Groaning)

722
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:43,989
Come on, one last push.

723
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:47,508
Three, two, one...

724
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,978
Ah! Put it down! Put it down!

725
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:51,832
(Resounding thud)

726
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:55,818
400-weight, my arse!
That's more like six.

727
00:59:55,819 --> 00:59:57,099
(Panting)

728
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,991
- Put it on the coat.
- Right, brilliant. Come on, let's go.

729
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,512
OK, on three.

730
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,955
One, two, three...

731
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,231
(Gasping)

732
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,579
We've broken it!
We've broken Scotland's luck...

733
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,549
Shut up! Shut up!
No, we didn't. Look.

734
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,260
These edges are worn.
This has been cracked for years.

735
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:32,180
Right, put it on the coat
and let's get it to the car.

736
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,460
(Groans)

737
01:00:33,461 --> 01:00:37,220
- Slide it under. Ready?
- Yeah.

738
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:40,360
- Come on!
- It's under.

739
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:43,912
Aye, I've got it. Let's go.

740
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:47,680
(Grunting)

741
01:00:52,422 --> 01:00:55,117
(Engine revs)

742
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,474
(Grunts)

743
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:06,392
- It's broken. Get back into cover.
- OK.

744
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:13,031
Come on. Hurry.

745
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:16,760
(Scraping)

746
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:22,358
(Gasps)

747
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,262
(Glass cracks)

748
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:29,196
Wait, wait!

749
01:01:33,383 --> 01:01:36,502
Well, it's not as if they'll be needing it.

750
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:38,595
(Grunting)

751
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:44,760
(Scraping)

752
01:01:46,584 --> 01:01:48,703
(Grunting)

753
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:51,063
- (Engine revving)
- Shh!

754
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,023
(Revving)

755
01:01:53,024 --> 01:01:55,515
What the hell's she doing?

756
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:02,423
Get back in...

757
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:06,075
A policeman's seen me.
He's coming across the road.

758
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:12,158
What are we going to say?

759
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:23,199
(Tapping)

760
01:02:26,465 --> 01:02:29,544
Sorry, officer... it's Christmas Eve.

761
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,984
Christmas Eve be damned!
It's 4:00 in the morning.

762
01:02:31,985 --> 01:02:34,904
Ah! Is it that time already?

763
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:38,545
- This the missus?
- No, she's my sis... err... girlfriend.

764
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,665
You're parked on private property.

765
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,785
Why did you move
when you saw me coming?

766
01:02:42,786 --> 01:02:46,065
- We knew we shouldn't be here.
- You should be on your way home!

767
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,785
Where'd he go?

768
01:02:47,786 --> 01:02:51,025
To hell with it, we'll move it ourselves.
Come on!

769
01:02:51,026 --> 01:02:53,357
Ready? Push!

770
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:56,945
That's it, sir,
we drove down for the holidays

771
01:02:56,946 --> 01:02:59,945
and arrived here too late
to get a bed, so...

772
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:02,025
We drove around
and we ended up... here.

773
01:03:02,026 --> 01:03:04,244
Oh, Lord!

774
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:08,506
Ah! That bastard,
making us do the work!

775
01:03:08,507 --> 01:03:10,466
Shut up and pull!

776
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:12,764
(Grunting)

777
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,586
- There's a car park along the road.
- Oh, good.

778
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:19,346
Then again, you could always run us in
and give us a bed in the cells.

779
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:21,439
(Grunting)

780
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:27,204

781
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,157
Police!

782
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:37,787
Well, you two best be running along, eh?

783
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:39,767
Aye.

784
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:45,847

(Footsteps recede)

786
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,509
We've got part of the Stone.
That's something.

787
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:40,269
- Take it somewhere safe.
- I've a friend in the Midlands.

788
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,647
Great. Let's go.

789
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,008
(Grunting)

790
01:04:57,151 --> 01:05:00,150
- Where's your coat?
- It's under the Stone.

791
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:03,165
You'll catch your death.

792
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:17,527
I seem to have forgotten
all my own rules.

793
01:05:18,511 --> 01:05:23,151
Kay... you realize when we get home,
we can't see each other?

794
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,551
I suppose.

795
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:27,247
It won't be safe.

796
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:31,731
Well, like I said,
I don't really like you anyway.

797
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:41,071
(Mimics English accent) It's been
a marvelous party, darling.

798
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:44,040
Thanks so awfully for inviting me.

799
01:05:47,033 --> 01:05:49,649
Take this.

800
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:16,688
Oh, they're in my coat!

801
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:24,833
- Maybe he ran them in.
- Aye, maybe.

802
01:06:24,834 --> 01:06:27,953
- What do you think we should do?
- I don't know.

803
01:06:27,954 --> 01:06:31,033
- Think we could carry it?
- Where? Into the street to catch a bus?

804
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,673
- You've not had any bright ideas!
- With you jabbering on?

805
01:06:33,674 --> 01:06:35,193
- I won't say another word!
- Don't!

806
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:36,353
- I won't!
- Good!

807
01:06:36,354 --> 01:06:37,923
Fine!

808
01:06:45,155 --> 01:06:48,274
That's it. Go and get the other car.

809
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:50,572
Oh, brilliant!

810
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:53,074
The keys are in his coat.

811
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,994
(Groaning)

812
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:56,894
Got it!

813
01:06:57,235 --> 01:07:00,514
Come on. Let's go.

814
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:02,971

(Gasping)

820
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:49,808
- They're not in here!
- What? Give me that.

821
01:07:55,877 --> 01:07:59,813
He left them in the car.
Please, God, he left them in the car!

822
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,237
Can we break in, hot-wire it?

823
01:08:05,238 --> 01:08:07,217
Stand back.

824

830
01:08:26,558 --> 01:08:28,650
It's finished.

831
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,418
We'd better get out of here. Come on.

832

01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,979
What's going on?

925
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,539
I just spent the last 5 hours
down at the police station.

926
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,871
Shit!

927
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,555
And they were asking me
a lot about you.

928
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,433
I told them
you spent Christmas with me.

929
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,299
(Sniggers)

930
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,393
That's last year.

931
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:27,799
Thanks, mate.

932
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:30,074
Aye.

933
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:34,031
There's something else.

934
01:18:35,141 --> 01:18:38,140
My dad's a builder
so he knows a lot about stone.

935
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:41,220
He said if the Stone's been dry
for 600 years...

936
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:43,700
and moisture gets in now and freezes,

937
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:46,620
the whole thing could just
disintegrate, nothing left.

938
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,301
We'll be shoveling it into paper bags.

939
01:18:49,302 --> 01:18:53,061
We need to go and get it.
Before we're all arrested.

940
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,360
Before there's no Stone left to get.

941
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:06,234
(Background music over dialogue)

942
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,633
What the hell is that?

943
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:39,201
Should we wait, see if they leave?

944
01:19:56,944 --> 01:19:59,103
Is that it?

945
01:19:59,104 --> 01:20:00,343
Aye.

946
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:03,836
- At least it's in one piece.
- Might as well be back in the Abbey.

947
01:20:13,585 --> 01:20:19,424
We... were just travelling through
and we saw your fires...

948
01:20:19,425 --> 01:20:23,235
Thought we'd see
if we could have a bit of a warm.

949
01:20:24,905 --> 01:20:26,838
Have a seat.

950
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:37,036
Expect you have a bit of trouble,
now and then. From the police.

951
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,905
Some.

952
01:20:39,906 --> 01:20:44,545
Well, that's because they don't like
the way you live. You're free.

953
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:48,145
I think freedom's the most
valuable thing that people can have.

954
01:20:48,146 --> 01:20:52,345
Many would take that freedom
from people they don't understand.

955
01:20:52,346 --> 01:20:55,997
Like yourselves and...
well... ourselves.

956
01:21:01,306 --> 01:21:06,986
Our people, the Scots, have died
for freedom over and over for centuries.

957
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:10,026
And we would again, too, gladly.

958
01:21:10,027 --> 01:21:15,146
But for us to continue our fight,
we need a symbol to unite our people.

959
01:21:15,147 --> 01:21:18,241
We've not done anything wrong,
although...

960
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:21,386
...what we have done is illegal.

961
01:21:21,387 --> 01:21:24,306
But we've done
the only thing we could.

962
01:21:24,307 --> 01:21:27,786
We need that symbol of freedom
so that the flame that burns in here...

963
01:21:27,787 --> 01:21:30,927
can never be extinguished.

964
01:21:34,068 --> 01:21:36,524
This symbol of yours...

965
01:21:36,988 --> 01:21:39,638
...where is it?

966
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:44,488
It's under your arse.

967
01:21:46,788 --> 01:21:49,324
(Laughs)

968
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:57,548
And it was under my arse!

969
01:21:57,549 --> 01:21:59,846
(Laughter)

970
01:22:01,949 --> 01:22:04,724
(Ian) Ready? Here we go.

971
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,681
(Gavin) Here we are.

972
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,049
Well done.

973
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:53,044
- (Bill) Good to see you.
- (Gavin) Let's do it, then, eh?

974
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:58,688
Pull that off.

975
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:08,687
Just back...

976
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:12,449
Watch your feet. Alan... Alan!

977
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:19,644
(Grunting)

978
01:23:32,512 --> 01:23:35,970
To the brave souls
who brought the Stone home.

979
01:23:37,152 --> 01:23:40,689
Wherever they may be.

980
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:44,922
May Scotland never forget them.

981
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:10,085
- Well done.
- Thank you, John.

982
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,293
Thank you.

983
01:24:27,394 --> 01:24:31,393
(Ian) 'I knew it was only a matter
of time before I was arrested.

984
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:33,953
'And I longed for it.

985
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:38,049
'The excitement.
The chance to have my say in court.

986
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,914
'But what really mattered
was the Stone.

987
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:46,954
'We couldn't just let it disappear.
Public sentiment would never allow it.

988
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:50,074
'I decided to put the Stone
into the hands of the authorities.

989
01:24:50,075 --> 01:24:52,194
'The next move would be theirs.

990
01:24:52,195 --> 01:24:55,994
'Would they leave it in Scotland
or take it back to London,

991
01:24:55,995 --> 01:24:58,954
'to the outrage of an entire nation? '

992
01:24:58,955 --> 01:25:04,324
- (Ian) And lift!
- (Kay) I've got it. Good. Careful.

993
01:25:04,995 --> 01:25:07,675
(Ian) 'We returned the Stone
to the Church of Scotland...

994
01:25:07,676 --> 01:25:09,755
'at the ruined Abbey of Arbroath,

995
01:25:09,756 --> 01:25:15,011
'where the Estates of Scotland met to
sign their Declaration of Independence'.

996
01:25:29,956 --> 01:25:32,075
(Gavin) Mind your backs.

997
01:25:32,076 --> 01:25:34,374
That's it, that's it.

998
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:51,847
You did it, Ian.

(Ian) 'The Stone was bundled back
to London and I never saw it again'.

1005

Are you the ones that took the Stone?
Which one of you is the leader?

1006
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,319
Speak to this man here.

1007

- What's your name?
- My name shouldn't matter.

1008
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,279
Our readers want to know.

we're the children of Scotland.
