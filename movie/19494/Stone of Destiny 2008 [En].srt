Sorry!

as absolute proof of our resolve,

Ian!

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,000
We, the people of Scotland,

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,440
declare our belief that
reform in the constitution...

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,880
is necessary in order to
secure good government.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,440
With that end in view,

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,080
we solemnly enter this covenant.

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,600
We pledge ourselves...

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,960
in all loyalty to the crown...

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,040
to do everything in our power...

Scotland will not be ignored!

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
- Aye, let's see them ignore that.
- Aye.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
It's only been 5 years since
the war, give them time.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
Time? Time? They've had centuries!

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,800
How many promises have
they broken? In 1707...

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,680
- Ancient history, mate.
- That's Scottish history, our history!

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,560
- The oldest nation in Europe.
- The oldest bloody nation in Europe!

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,360
You actually think Scotland can
look after their own affairs?

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,800
- Certainly not if you have the vote.
- All I'm saying is, give London a chance.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Here's the chance, right
here. See what they do with it.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
If Scotland's ever going
to be a nation again...

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Stop! Shut your stupid mouths.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,520
There is no bloody nation.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,520
There's nothing but wind
and rain and mud and shit.

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Look at that. What does that say?

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,400
"North Britain", see?

56
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,160
We're all British now!

57
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Scotland's dead. It died in its sleep,
and nobody even came to the funeral.

One for granddad.

59
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,200
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, you'll kill me.

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,040
- I will not.
- I heard you in there tonight.

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,960
You're an anarchist,
a menace to society.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Thanks, I'll take it as
a compliment! Come on.

63
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
All right.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,840
- (Ian) You on?
- Yep!

65
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,520
(Ian) Be careful, now. Here we go. Hop!

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,200

67

68
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,040
- Ah, I broke my
bum! - (Ian) Ya-hoo!

69
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,360
- So, been to church recently?
- Yes, Dad.

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,280
- How's the studies? Going well?
- (Mutters)

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,800
- Speak up, please.
- Aye, fine.

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,480
- Still thinking about law?
- Aye, I'm not decided yet, but...

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,080
- Still with that covenant thing?
- Aye.

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
Harris, please.

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
Look at him, he's not stupid.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
- Instead of studying...
- I am...

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,840
No, you're not. You're throwing your
life away with that nationalist rubbish.

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
- I have pride in my country.
- That's not the point.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Nobody could be prouder of
Scotland than I am, and you know it.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,200
- But you have to get on in life.
- I know. I said I might try law.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,640
When? You try this, you try that. When?

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Sweetheart, he's only come home
for the day, and Bill's here.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,000
How are your studies, Bill?

84
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,200
Good, sir.

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,040
You're on to your second
degree, aren't you?

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,560
- Aye, sir.
- Still president of the students' union?

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm not throwing my life away. If I
see wrongs that need to be righted...

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,920
There's always something wrong.
Let me tell you something, lad.

89
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
What's wrong is not out there.

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,000
What's wrong is in here.

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,240
This is a world for
doers not for dreamers.

92
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,240
Try and make something
of your life, son.

93
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
Here's those things.

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,120
If the trousers don't fit, bring
them back, I'll make a pillow cover.

95
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
Aye, Mum.

96
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,040
- Remember your father gave you that.
- Aye.

97
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,760
He doesn't mean to be harsh, Ian.

98
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,480
He had the same fire as
you when he was young.

99
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,720
But the world's not easy. He's worked
hard, made a good life for us all.

100
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
I know, Mum, I know.

101
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,320
He is proud of you, you know?

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Aye, well, let him say so, then.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,800
Thank you.

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,240
Ian... Bastards, eh?

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,160
- We'll get them next time.
- Aye, right...

106
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
- They can't ignore us for ever.
- Oh, can they not?

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,400
- (Bill) People are outraged.
- No, they're not.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,640
- How can you say that?
- Because it's bullshit.

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,960
- Calm down.
- It didn't even make the headlines!

110
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,080
- It's on the front page.
- Come on, mate!

111
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
How can people not care
about their own country?

112
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,480
People care. It's just...

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,200
- What?
- they're busy!

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
(Knocking)

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Look, mate, nobody cared more
about the covenant than I did.

116
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Ian's blown a fuse again.

117
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,760
- We'll get a pint, talk about it.
- No more talk, all right? I'm serious.

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,880
- Someone's got to do something.
- What are you going to do, then?

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,440
- Get an army, invade England?
- Of course not.

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,200
What?

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
A symbol. We need a symbol, a gesture.

122
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Something to wake these people up a bit.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,600
- An act of revolution, a salt march.
- A what?

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,240
You know, Gandhi marched across
India protesting taxes on salt.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
So you're Gandhi now?

126
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,640
Because, Bill, you know what we
are, what Scottish people are?

127
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,760
We're ashamed. Ashamed
of being Scottish.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,280
Screw them, 'cause I'm not.

129
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh, look. Wendy Wood.

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,560
She was a friend of my mum's.

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,480
(Bill) Are you out of your
mind? It's in Westminster Abbey.

132
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Right across from
Parliament. It's protected!

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,680
It's not a souvenir. "I'll take a postcard,
a tea towel and the Stone of Destiny".

134
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,480
Think of what it'll mean. It's
the most powerful symbol...

135
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,520
That's not the point.
They'll put you away.

136
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,760
You'll get twenty years. Might
as well go for the crown jewels!

137
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
You'd never get away with it.

138
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,960
I might.

139
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's say you pull it off. You get it
out of the Abbey and back to Scotland.

140
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,560
- What will you do with it?
- I've not thought about that.

141
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,600
That's up to the people of Scotland.

142
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,360
But if it doesn't raise them to their
feet, then Scotland really is dead.

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,640
- It weighs a ton, you'll never lift it.
- Aye, not by myself.

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,800
Oh, you evil man. I'm
six months from my degree.

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,160
- I know.
- A lovely position waiting.

146
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,720
And your crazy scheme offers me what?
Destruction of everything I worked for.

147
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,960
Bill, all great schemes are crazy.
That's what makes them great.

148
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,400
- We'll ruin our lives.
- Probably, aye.

149
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,320
Prison, Ian.

150
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Aye, maybe. But it's for Scotland.

151
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm through with talk,
Bill, I really am.

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Now are you with me or not?

153
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,480
You bastard.

154
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,640
And a few more. Give us that
Westminster Abbey one, would you?

155
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,800
- Statesman's Corner.
- Statesman's...

156
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Henry III, Edward I...

157
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,960
For you.

158
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,640
Here's the backdoor...

159
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,960
What do you have to do to
get a drink around here?

160
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
- I've told you already. Just take a seat.
- All right, I will.

161
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,200
Hey, hey!

162
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Ya-hoo!

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,480
No, no, I don't think you're right,
though. If this was you, how can that be?

164
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,120
And... up!

165
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
(Groaning)

166
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,040
(Laughing)

167
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,840
- Islip Chapel... under renovation.
- That's right.

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,480
Edward I, Henry III,
Edward the Confessor...

169
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
...Coronation Chair.
- Yes!

170
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,280
'Talking about it was one thing.

171
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,560
'We Scots have always
been good at talking.

172
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,400
'But I had to see what we were
up against with my own eyes.

173
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,360
'Only then, would it be real to me.

174
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,360
'I was off to London'.

175
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,480
Hello. Did you want to join the tour?

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,120
Erm... no.

177
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,880
Is it all right if I just
have a wee look about?

178
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,360
As long as you promise
not to take anything.

179
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,640
(Man)... Henry Yevele incorporated
the latest technological advancement

180
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,520
for the 14th century,
the flying buttress.

181
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,280
With these, he was able to
raise the roof to 101 feet.

182
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,080
And it remains to this day
the highest roof in Britain

183
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,240
and the single leading cause
of stiff necks among tourists.

184
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,600
Now, if you'll follow me,
we'll go on to the cloisters...

185
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,320
- Nine pence, please.
- Oh... sorry.

186
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,320
- It's... err... very nice.
- Sorry?

187
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,560
The Abbey is so clean.

188
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,160
Must be a whole army of cleaners

189
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,760
in every night just... cleaning.

190
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,720
- Just once a week.
- Oh, that's surprising.

191
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I suppose the night watchman could
always pick up a wee bit of rubbish.

192
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,040
Or men, depending on how many you have.

193
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,000
(Coins jangle)

194
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,240
The Coronation Chair and Stone,
made in the reign of Edward I,

195
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,600
to house the Coronation Stone of
the Scots brought here in 1296.

196
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
Note how the Stone is incorporated
into the shelf beneath the seat.

197
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,360
When a king of England sits to crowned,
he sits over the Stone of Destiny,

198
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,320
which makes him, by Scotland's own
traditions, king of Scotland as well.

199
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,080
All without ever having to
get his royal trousers dirty.

200
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,400
The original coronation was in 1066...

201
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,640
(Telephone rings)

202
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,600
- Hello?
- (Ian) 'It's me'.

203
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
- Who?
- Me.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,360
Ah, Gandhi. I was wondering
when you'd turn up.

205
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,120
I can't talk for long. Never
know who may be listening.

206
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,440
- I've been to visit my auntie's house.
- You what?

207
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,240
I said, I've been to my
auntie's house for a visit.

208
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,440
I didn't know you'd relatives in London.
Why didn't you go straight to the Abbey?

209
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,240
Listen, I'm telling you,
I went to visit her house.

210
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,480
Oh, right!

211
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,600
Where are you, I can hardly hear you?

212
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,560
- I'm in a pub! Would you let me talk?
- 'Sorry'.

213
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,120
I've had a good look at her new
ring, with the diamond in it.

214
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
- Right. How's it look?
- 'Lt's a lovely stone'.

215
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
But it looks heavier than we
thought and the setting's tricky.

216
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,720
- Is it?
- We may need another jeweler.

217
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,240
Right, we'll talk about it when
you get back. What train are you on?

218
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll be late. I'm
going for another visit.

219
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,520
Back to your auntie's house?

220
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,280
She won't be home, but
I'll go in the back.

221
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,520
OK. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, then.

222
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Oh, and Ian, if you see your auntie,

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,160
ask her if she wants her panties back.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
Writing a book?

225
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,000
No, I'm just doing a wee sketch.

226
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,320
Why? Don't they have
any churches in Glasgow?

227
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,800
Move on, jock.

228
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,960
(Doorbell rings)

229
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,840
Mr. Hamilton, you're expected.

230
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
Just a moment, sir.

231
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Ah, you're the young lad who
wanted to see me. Mr. Hamilton.

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,640
Have a seat. Some tea?

233
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,080
- Please. Thank you.
- Thank you Mrs. McQuarry.

234
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,960
A wonderful woman.

235
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,840
Been with the family since I was
a boy. Still treats me like one.

236
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,360
- I've seen you before.
- Err... covenant meetings.

237
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,360
That's right. You're
quite keen, if I remember.

238
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,440
(Laughs nervously)

239
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,720
(Clears throat)

240
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,360
Is this... err?

241
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,840
- Can I talk?
- I think so.

242
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,520
Because what I'm about to tell
you is of the utmost secrecy.

243
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
If what we say here were
to become known to others,

244
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,800
well, it could cause me and you
and Scotland irreparable harm.

245
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,240
Well, I'm on the edge of my seat.

246
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm going to Westminster Abbey,

247
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,320
and I'm going to bring
back the Stone of Destiny.

248
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,160
- Of course, it's been tried before.
- I know.

249
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,160
- Even considered it myself once.
- I didn't know that.

250
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,800
We were going to sneak
in, dressed like monks,

251
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,680
throw a cloak over the Stone and
drag it out after Sunday service.

252
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,480
I was 16.

253
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Your plan's a bit more
sophisticated, I presume.

254
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,440
- Aye, I've got a couple of things...
- No details.

255
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm chairman of the Covenant Movement,

256
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,640
Rector of the University, I
can't afford to take the risk.

257
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,240
- You have accomplices?
- Aye.

258
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,360
- Done your research?
- Of course.

259
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,640
And the plan, is it airtight?

260
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
- Will it succeed?
- Aye, it will.

261
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,000
All right... what do you want from me?

262
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,440
Finances.

263
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,920
- How much?
- Fifty.

264
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
Fifty?

265
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,760
That's... err...

266
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,720
That's a fair amount.

267
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,400
Still, nothing is impossible, I
suppose. I... I could make arrangements.

268
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,840
You have a financial plan? A budget?

269
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,760
- Not really...
- I'll need something.

270
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,000
- We need to hire a car.
- Right.

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,560
Petrol, obviously, and meals.
Fish and chips, and so on.

272
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,720
�50,000 for fish and chips?

273
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,200
No. Fifty.

274
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,920
Fifty?

275
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,640
You came to me for �50?

276
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,000
Aye, well...

277
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,760
We're students, we're broke.

278
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Mrs. McQuarry!

279
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,920
Kindly show young Mr.
Hamilton the way out.

280
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced
you, sir. That was never my intent.

281
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,720
Thank you, ma'am. I'll find my own way.

282
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,920
Would you like me to
clear the tea things up?

283
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,120
No. I mean, yes. Sorry, Mrs. McQuarry.

284
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,840
That's all right.

285
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,600
Nothing wrong with a man
changing his mind now and then.

286
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,400
Mr. Hamilton!

287
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
We never met.

288
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,920
Here's the chair. 5:30, one of
us slips into the back chapel.

289
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,760
My idea, so I claim the honor. At
6:30, the Abbey closes and I hide here.

290
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,400
Under renovation, tarps, ladders, it's
perfect. I could be there all night.

291
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
Now, the night watchman
finishes around midnight, 1:00.

292
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,840
I come out, screw the lock
off the door and let you in.

293
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,400
Here's the brilliant part.
I say we do it at Christmas.

294
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,080
All of London will be
in the pubs at parties.

295
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,560
We'll come down on them when they're
lying in drink, their minds unbuttoned.

296
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,000
What? What, Bill, what's wrong?

297
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,000
- I plan to go home for Christmas.
- So cancel it.

298
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,160
I've got a committee meeting on 23rd.

299
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,880
Miss it.

300
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,200
- We should give this a bit more thought.
- No. Why? What's the matter with you?

301
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,720
I've been thinking, Ian...

302
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,840
I'm so close to my degree,

303
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,480
and I've got such a
great position waiting.

304
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,600
I mean, we could do 20 years for this.

305
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,520
Are you backing out?

306
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,280
We're getting married, Ian.
Jen and me. Next spring.

307
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,040
I mean, this is my life
we're talking about here.

308
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,680
I can't risk it.

309
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,520
Aye, aye. No, fine.

310
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,360
Forget it, Bill, I'll go
myself. I don't need you.

311
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm sorry, Ian.

312
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,920
I really am.

313
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,080
(Jazz orchestra plays "I've
Got You Under My Skin")

314
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,840
Oh, hi.

315
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,640
(McCormick)... and this person asks,
"Are we going to keep the monarchy?"

316
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,480
And this voice from the back shouts,
"Aye, it's you! Long live King John!"

317
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,760
Excuse me a second. Mr. Hamilton, is it?

318
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,360
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,720
- How's things?
- Aye... moving on.

320
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
Good.

321
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,440
One moment.

322
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,960
Jamie... I hear you're interested
in joining the committee...

323
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,680
What would you like me to do?

324
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
(Clears throat)

325
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,320
- Excuse me, it's Kay, isn't it?
- It might be.

326
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,360
- Ian Hamilton.
- I know.

327
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,040
Nice to meet you. You dancing?

328
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,520
- You asking?
- Aye, I might be.

329
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,680
I like the idea of teaching.

330
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Working with children and helping
them find their way in the world.

331
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,000
It must be the Highlander in you.

332
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,200
Only happy when you're tending the
helpless or... battling the English.

333
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,320
Well, we're simple folk.

334
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,360
I like your necklace,
by the way. Boyfriend?

335
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,600
No. From my father.
Wonderful man. A crofter.

336
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,120
- Ah, a wee farm lass.
- I grew up with the sheep.

337
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,120
And watching my father struggle
every day trying to feed us.

338
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,160
Paying taxes to a government that
knows as much about the Highlands

339
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,880
as they know about the moon.

340
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,320
What does he think of you
now, his young Covenanter?

341
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,240
Don't know, he's dead. His
ship was torpedoed in the war.

342
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,960
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Me, too.

343
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,640
By the way, why haven't
you said hello before?

344
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,680
I sit right behind you
in European History.

345
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,720
- Didn't know you wanted me to.
- I didn't but that's no excuse.

346
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,200
- What's wrong?
- What are you doing for the holidays?

347
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,920
Going home. You?

348
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,880
I'm going to London to bring
back the Stone of Destiny.

349
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,640
I mean it.

350
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,200
You do, don't you?

351
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,240
And so did Wendy Wood and Bertie Gray.

352
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,160
Every Nationalist worth his salt has
talked about it, but that's just talk.

353
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,680
I know.

354
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,400
Has it occurred to you there's a
reason why it's never been done?

355
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Look, I've... I've been to London.

356
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,440
I know I can do it.

357
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,000
- Would you come with me?
- No.

358
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,400
If we fail, we'll be laughed at.
Even Scotland. I couldn't bear that.

359
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,520
Nor could I, but that doesn't
mean we shouldn't do it.

360
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
- Can I ask why you're doing this?
- Ultimately, the glory of Scotland.

361
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,680
- Ouch!
- What?

362
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,640
It's not as much about
the glory of Scotland

363
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,880
as it is about the
glory of Ian Hamilton.

364
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,480
There's no need to insult
me. If you don't want to go...

365
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,440
I never said that. I just want
to know the lay of the land.

366
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,640
- All right, then, why me?
- For a start, you were recommended.

367
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,400
And let's be honest... you're perfect.

368
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,520
- Who'd suspect a wee lass like you?
- Is that what you think of me?

369
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,640
- I don't know you...
- No, you don't, do you?

370
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,400
First, the rules. Number
one, the answer is no.

371
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm going to London for the Stone.

372
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,400
Nothing extracurricular,
if you follow my meaning.

373
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,080
- It'd not even crossed my mind.
- Ouch, now you're insulting me.

374
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,040
- No, I... I didn't mean like that.
- What did you mean?

375
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,520
I just... Look, I think you're a smasher.
I just don't think of you in, like...

376
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,440
- I mean, I might if...
- Stop talking. You're making it worse.

377
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,920
(Raucous laughter and screaming)

378
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,960
- Him.
- Him?

379
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
(Screaming)

380
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,720
(Girl) Stop it!

381
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,120
Come on, we need a bit
of muscle, don't we?

382
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,000
Come on.

383
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,920
(Ian) 'I didn't really know
Gavin, but I'd seen him.

for his drinking than his studies.

he had a heart as big as Scotland'.

(Gavin) The Stone of Destiny?
(Ian) 'She was right'.

Let's do it.

388
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,000
(Ian) 'On top of that,
he was bloody strong! '

389

(THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS:
"Mutiny, I promise you")

390
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,720
Here's the mutiny I promised you

391
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,040
And here's the party it turned into

392

Here's the mutiny I promised you

And here's the moment it turned into

- So, tomorrow, then?
- Aye, first light.

395
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,560
You know, the Scots have a
history of being great debaters.

396
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,040
More often than not,
that's as far as we get.

397

I've poured my whole heart and
soul into the Covenant Movement.

398
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,120
It pains me to think maybe
it wasn't enough. Cigarette?

399
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Oh, you're out.

400
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,040
Ring me if you need help.

Don't worry, we won't.

402

That's quite the ego you have there.

403
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,680
Now remember, we're in your hands.

404

Christ, Gavin! What's that?

405
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,560
You're lucky to get
anything. She runs, though.

406
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,640
Aye, but for how long?

407
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,600
- Who the hell is that?
- That's Alan. He wants to help.

408
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,480
- You didn't tell him?
- Well, he asked me.

409
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,680
You told him? How could you?

410
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,880
- He's not going to squeal, I know him.
- I don't give a shit!

411
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,200
- How old is he?
- 19, 20, what's the difference?

412
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,480
Look at him, he's... meek!

413
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,920
Well, he's here. That
should count for something.

414
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,680
Look, he's just shy, that's all.
I'll take full responsibility.

415
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,880
One mistake, he's on a train home.
Ye cannae say fairer than that.

No...

Hi, I'm sorry, we can't use you.

418
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,120
- Yeah. Course. All right.
- You'll have to forget you ever saw us.

419
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,760
(Sighs) Yeah, I understand.

420
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,960
Ian, he's got a car. And we
could really use another car.

with us from the start'.

(Rousing orchestral music over dialogue)

426
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,960
Basically, two teams. I'll
go with Gavin, Alan with Kay.

427
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,160
- I'll screw off the lock...
- We go in, get the baby.

428
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,720
- Put it in your car.
- Switch it to the Ford.

429
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,040
I get in Alan's car and
put my foot down for Wales.

430
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,080
- But the Stone's in the Ford.
- She's the decoy.

431
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,000
- In case anybody's seen your car.
- Right...

432
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,320
- Then we drive the Stone to Scotland?
- No.

433
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,560
That's the beautiful
part. We drive it south.

434
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,120
- They'll expect us to go to Scotland.
- Right.

435
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,520
We stash it somewhere, come
back when the heat's off. Simple.

436
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,480
Aye. What could possibly go wrong?

438
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,240
(Ian) Thank you.

439
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Thanks.

440
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,840

They'll be in their cups.

442
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,200
Bugger that. Excuse my French.

443
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,520
Why put off till tomorrow
what we can do tonight?

444
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,960
He's right. It's not a bad
idea. Why not do it tonight?

445
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,120
We've not slept. I mean,
can we even think straight?

446
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,520
Thinking's overrated. Come on, are
we men of talk or men of action?

447
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,560
We have to leave now. Check your times.

448
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,040
Twenty past three now.

449
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,040
- Well, I'll see you, I guess.
- Depending on visiting hours in prison!

450
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,400
- Well, go on, now.
- Aye, we should leave.

451
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,920
See you at the party.

452
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,200
- (Ian) Ow!
- (Gavin) Hold still.

453
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,440
- Don't stick me with the damn thing!
- Shut up, stop acting like a baby!

454
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,120
Will you stop moving? Lie
back and think of Scotland!

455
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,520
That's it. Careful with this,
'cause this is the big one.

456
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,800
Oh... honestly!

457
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,960
Get that down. There,
let's go have a look.

458
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,520
(Metallic clanging)

459
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,440
- You all right?
- Aye.

460
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,720
- How do I look?
- When is the blessed event, Mother?

461
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,200
And a merry Christmas to you, too, sir!

462
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,040
Can't wait to see the look on
his face tomorrow morning. Ready?

463
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,160
You realize the moment
I walk through that door,

464
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,520
my life will never be the same?

465
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,640
Right. Keep your eyes on Daddy.

466
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
- (Woman) Hello.
- Hello.

467
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,040
- Are you here to take the tour?
- Only if you're giving it, sweetheart.

468
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh, no. I just hand out
the educational literature.

469
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,280
Oh. Well, darling, by
all means, educate me.

470
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,680
(Man)... and it remains to this day
the highest roof in all of Britain

471
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,600
and the single leading cause
of stiff necks among tourists.

472
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Well, I'm afraid that's all for
today, so if you'd like to follow me...

473
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,640
(Woman) The chapel is
closing in five minutes!

474
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,120
Five minutes to closing!

475
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,600
(Door opens)

476
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,160
(Tools clang)

477
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,080
(Doors shut)

478
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,000
(Screams)

479
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,200
What the hell are you doing in 'ere?

480
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,480
- Why didn't you shout out?
- Well, because of...

481
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,800
You're lucky I didn't hit you over
the 'ead. I'm patrolling all night.

482
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,520
How old are you?

483
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,760
How... how old am I?

484
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,040
Hey... you all right?

485
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,320
Aye.

486
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,840
You look 'horrible.

487
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,440
Oh... making yourself comfortable.

488
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,840
All right, put 'em on.

489
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,680
Come on, don't take all night about it.

490
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,760
Right, son. Let's be 'avin' you.

491
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
Come on. Come on, come on.

492
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,280
There's a good lad. You
can't spend a night in 'ere.

493
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
Come on.

494
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,280
Wait a minute.

495
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,640
Merry Christmas.

496
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,440
(Metal clangs)

497
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,920
- Christ!
- Hey, shut up! What happened?

498
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,000
It just doesn't make any
sense. We should've had half...

499
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,760
- He said he's patrolling all night.
- Maybe not...

500
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,880
I got caught, didn't I? Why did he
have to be so damn nice about it?

501
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,680
- He thought you were a vagrant.
- It's bad luck. We try again tomorrow.

502
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,720
- We'll think of something.
- Will we? Any brilliant ideas?

503
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,680
- Not that you'd listen anyway!
- Stop it, both of you! We're all tired!

504
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,280
Do you remember Robert the
Bruce, when he fought the English?

505
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,560
And the story of his spider?

506
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,800
Six times he watched her spin
that web and six times she failed.

507
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,480
But she never gave up.

508
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,280
I think we should go back to
the Abbey and look for spiders.

509
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,360
Spiders!

510
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Mrs. McQuarry... I have some work
to finish, so I'll be up for a bit.

511
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,200
You should get some sleep.

512
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,320
I have a bit to do myself.

513
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Ian!

514
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,280
Ian, it's Kay! Hurry
up! Hurry up, it's Kay!

515
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
(Gasping)

516
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,320
She's burning up.

517
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Kay? Kay?

518
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,000
- I've got to get her to hospital.
- They'll ask questions.

519
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,640
A doctor, then. Something!

520
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,520
(Indistinct Annoy announcements)

521
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,880
Oh, thank Christ.

522
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,000
- Where's Ian?
- He's checking the schedules.

523
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,520
He wants to put Kay
on the next train home.

524
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,080
Gavin...

525
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,640
I've been thinking. Maybe
we should all be on it.

526
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
- Jesus Christ!
- Well, look at us.

527
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,840
Our money's almost gone,
we're half frozen and no sleep.

528
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,480
- It's a miracle we're not all in hospital.
- You want to quit?

529
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,120
- No!
- What are you saying?

530
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,760
I'm just saying, maybe
we need to rethink it.

531
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,120
Get Kay home and regroup. The
Stone's not going anywhere.

532
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,120
I cannae believe this. I
stuck my neck out for you...

533
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm just saying.

534
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,520
Next train to Glasgow's 11:25.

535
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,120
- What's the matter with you two?
- Tell him, then.

536
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,160
- What? Tell me what?
- Alan wants to quit.

537
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,280
No, I don't! I'm just saying maybe
this is happening for a reason.

538
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,400
We're nearly half dead, and even if
we weren't, we can't do it without Kay.

539
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,800
One of us has to stay with the car.
That only leaves two to lift the Stone.

540
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,080
It's not possible, you've said it
yourself, Ian. Maybe it's a sign.

541
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,840
Maybe we should just go home and make
a new plan. Try again another day.

542
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,880
- Is that what you wanna do?
- Yeah.

543
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
No.

544
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
No, I really don't know.

545
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,080
I can't think anymore.

546
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,120
All right.

547
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,920
- Will you talk to him?
- Talk to him yourself!

548
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,280
You said you'd take full
responsibility for him.

549
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,200
Aye, and I will. But
answer me this: Is he wrong?

550
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,560
Could you for once in your
life accept the possibility

551
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,040
that somebody other
than you might be right?

552
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,920
All right. Come on.

553
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,680
Right, here's what we're going to do.
We'll take a vote. A secret ballot.

554
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,720
'S' means stay, 'G' means we go home.

555
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,200
And if you vote to go, there's
no shame in it, all right?

556
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,720
We can always live to try another day.

557
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,240
But I will say this.

558
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,080
If we go home. Lf...

559
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,920
Will we really ever come back?

560
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,680
Doesn't the lassie get to vote?

561
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,600
We didn't think you heard.

562
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm just ill, I'm not dead.

563
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,240
"Stay".

564
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,800
"Stay".

565
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,440
"Stay".

566
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,720
Four "stays".

567
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,680
Excuse me, I wonder if you
have any rooms available?

568
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,680
We've just come in from...
Shrewsbury. And, err...

569
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,080
- That the missus?
- Aye. Err, no, sorry, she's my sister.

570
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,960
Is she drunk? I won't
have drunkards in my house.

571
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,160
No, she's not, she's just not feeling
very well. She just needs to sleep.

572
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,000
- All right, come in.
- Thank you.

573
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,120
Thanks for sticking
up for me back there.

574
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,400
Sod off.

575
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,520
Gavin?

576
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,160
(Sighs)

577
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,440
Aye?

578
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,880
- Are you sorry you came?
- Of course I am.

579
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,360
Nobody in their right mind
would want to go through this.

580
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,680
Then why are you?

581
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,440
I'm mad, obviously.

582
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,800
No.

583
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,920
No, really, why?

584
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,040
Gavin Vernon, the mad bloke,
opens beer bottles with his teeth.

585
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,680
And you want to prove to people
that there's more than that?

586
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,600
Prove it to myself.

587
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,920
It's funny... I'm just the
opposite. Being shy, you know?

588
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,720
Even when I was a wee boy, when
people would look at me, I'd just...

589
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,720
...freeze up.

590
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,080
But I always wanted to be
someone, you know? Have adventures.

591
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,200
- I just never though I'd have the nerve.
- You think too much.

592
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,560
Be more like me. Just dive
in. Something will come to you.

593
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,960
- Dive?
- Aye.

594
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,680
What did you say to
Ian, that day in Glasgow?

595
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,920
I told him if you messed up,
I'd thump you and send you home.

596
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,720
Oh.

597
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,920
And I will, too.

598
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,400
Ian?

599
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,040
- Promise you'll come get me.
- I swear.

600
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,440
I knew you'd try to get me into bed.

601
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,640
What are you thinking?

602
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,480
Just that it's not
long to Christmas now.

603
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,200
I told my mum and dad
I'd be with friends

604
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,160
and that I'd see them on Boxing Day.

605
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,800
My mum was so hurt.

606
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,080
I never meant to put
you all through this.

607
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,760
Don't flatter yourself. We're
here because we want to be.

608
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,960
Stop taking everything on yourself, Ian.

609
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,480
You're not the great high and mighty.

610
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,880
Just another boy with grand ideas...
and a head like a concrete block.

611
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,800
And why do you want to push
a rock up a hill by yourself?

612
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,320
Just let go a wee bit. Maybe
people will like you more.

613
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,800
- You seem to like me fine.
- No, I don't, I just put up with you.

614
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,200
If you go for the Stone
without me, I'll break your arm.

615
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,520
(Ian) 'We were stuck.
We needed a new plan.

616
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,880
'So back we went to look for spiders.

617
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,800
'Lt was Gavin's idea to draw someone
out and grill him for information.

618
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,560
'Since the night watchman now
knew my face, I let him try'.

619
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,920
(Mimics English accent)
Magnificent architecture, isn't it?

620
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,840
It's smashing stonework, what?

621
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,400
You just don't see this sort of
craftsmanship anymore, do you?

622
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,200
(English accent) No... no, you don't.

623
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,720
- I'm going. -
What? G-Gavin!

624
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,480
Gavin?

625
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,000
Come on!

626
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,960
- Come on!
- Gavin, wait for me!

627
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,840
(Rings bicycle bell)

628
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,480
Gavin, will you stop that!

629
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,040
Ah!

630
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,120
Come on!

631
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,160
Excuse me?

632
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,520
- Can I help you?
- Oh, good afternoon, sir.

633
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,200
We were just passing by and
remarking on what a masterful example

634
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,680
of ecclesiastical architecture this is.

635
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,120
Sebastian Fenster, School of
Architecture, Whoreson College.

636
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,040
I've never heard of it.

637
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,680
I'm particularly impressed with
the preservation of the woodwork.

638
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,840
To my eye, the carvers
of the late Gothic period

639
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,320
far surpass anyone from the
Jacobean or Tudor periods.

640
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,000
- I quite agree.
- They've really stood the test of time.

641
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,520
And... such formidable
doors. Oak, aren't they?

642
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,400
If it was up to me, we'd smash
through these stained-glass windows.

643
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,960
That might be too noisy.

644
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,960
But the old codger told me the Poet's
Corner door was replaced after the war.

645
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,320
Now that tells me it's made of pine,
unlike this door here, here and here.

646
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,320
Made of oak, never get through that.

647
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,360
The strength of oak is
1200 psi. What's pine?

648
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,120
- 600.
- Right, no problem.

649
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,000
The right tool, the right place,
the right strength, we're through.

650
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,400
If we can't get through it with
a crowbar, we'll use his head.

651
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,360
- Come here you!
- (Alan) Gavin! Stop it! Put me down!

652
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,160
(Ian) 'And that was it,
after all our planning,

653
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,680
'we'd decided on a good,
old-fashioned Highland raid.

654
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,840
'But before that I
had a promise to keep'.

655
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,640
- Who is it?
- Hi, I've come to fetch my sister.

656
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,560
It's 2:00 in the morning!

657
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,800
Sorry. Our father's ill, we
have to leave immediately.

658
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,360
- I'll send her out.
- Actually, if I could just...

659
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,840
(Landlady) Get me the police.
Yeah, those Scottish boys are back.

660
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,360
How should I know? They're up to
something. Send someone right away.

661
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,760
Oh, Christ!

662
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,160
What's taking her?

663
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,120
Look, go and see again. Go on.

664
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,600
(Sirens wailing)

665
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,400
- Shit!
- Hide it, hide it!

666
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,040
(Alan) Get it on. Get
it on. Where's your coat?

667
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,200
(Detective) You two...

668
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,280
License, please, sir.

669
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,720
What's... what's wrong, sir?

670
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,360
Lady there says you told
her you're from Shrewsbury.

671
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,160
Mr. Hamilton.

672
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,120
From Glasgow.

673
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,920
- Is this your car, sir?
- Aye, it is.

674
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,320
Papers.

675
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,160
- Right, out!
- Hold on a second, sir...

676
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,800
- If you'd just let me explain...
- Thank you, sir!

677
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,560
What seems to be the trouble?

678
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,760
- Who are you?
- I'm with them. Is something wrong?

679
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,880
This gentleman seems to
think we stole the car.

680
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,320
That's silly. Where's Gavin?
Hasn't he got the papers?

681
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,760
Err... aye. Gav... Our
mate Gavin in the car there.

682
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,240
- How are you doing? All right?
- Worlds better, thanks.

683
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,120
(Detective) You mind
stepping out of the car, sir?

684
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,720
(Sighs heavily)

685
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,120
That road there leads you
straight out of London.

686
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,840
Take it.

687
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,720
I heard her phone the
police. I came straight down.

688
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,440
Four Scots, two cars,
suspicious circumstances.

689
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,880
- They'll put two and two together.
- Maybe not.

690
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,120
I didn't come here to freeze my
arse off and go home with nothing.

691
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,560
It's 3:10. We've missed our time.
We've no clue what we're walking into.

692
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,480
- Who cares?
- I say we try anyway.

693
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,120
- And they've got our names.
- They've also got our Stone!

694
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,480
- What about you?
- Yeah, let's do it.

695
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,760
Aye, we might as well go down in flames.

696
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,800
- You all right?
- I'm fine. Go.

697
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,480
(Gavin) Just cut it.

698
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,960
(Groaning)

699
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,440
(Gavin) Go, go!

700
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,080
- Higher. Try higher.
- Give me some light here.

701
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,400
- (Ian) Come on.
- To hell with it. Get back.

702
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,880
- (Bang reverberates)
- Christ! Can you do that quietly?

703
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,000
- (Alan) Shut up!
- (Giggling)

704
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,920
- (Alan) Gavin!
- (Raucous laughter)

705
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,440
Will you be quiet? Come on, shush! Ian!

706
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,840
(Laughter and banging)

707
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,160
(Gasps)

708
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,440
(Gavin) Come on.

709
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,960
(Groaning)

710
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,360
(Wood creaks)

711
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,680
See? No problem.

712
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,040
Come on.

713
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,840
Give me that.

714
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,040
Right, take that.

715
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,760
- Gavin!
- Hey... it's Christmas!

716
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,360
(Groaning)

717
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,720
OK, give me a hand.

718
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,240
(Wood creaks)

719
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,000
- Right, get behind it. Ready? Push.
- One, two, three...

720
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,600
(Groaning)

721
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,520
- (Gavin) Come on, push it! Again!
- One, two, three...

722
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,360
(Groaning)

723
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,960
Come on, one last push.

724
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,480
Three, two, one...

725
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,920
Ah! Put it down! Put it down!

726
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,800
(Resounding thud)

727
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,760
400-weight, my arse!
That's more like six.

728
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,040
(Panting)

729
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,960
- Put it on the coat.
- Right, brilliant. Come on, let's go.

730
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,480
OK, on three.

731
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,920
One, two, three...

732
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,200
(Gasping)

733
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,520
We've broken it! We've
broken Scotland's luck...

734
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,520
Shut up! Shut up! No, we didn't. Look.

735
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,200
These edges are worn. This
has been cracked for years.

736
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,120
Right, put it on the coat
and let's get it to the car.

737
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,400
(Groans)

738
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,160
- Slide it under. Ready?
- Yeah.

739
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,320
- Come on!
- It's under.

740
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,880
Aye, I've got it. Let's go.

741
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,640
(Grunting)

742
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,080
(Engine revs)

743
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,440
(Grunts)

744
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,360
- It's broken. Get back into cover.
- OK.

745
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,000
Come on. Hurry.

746
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,720
(Scraping)

747
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,320
(Gasps)

748
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,240
(Glass cracks)

749
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,160
Wait, wait!

750
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,480
Well, it's not as if
they'll be needing it.

751
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,560
(Grunting)

752
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,720
(Scraping)

753
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,680
(Grunting)

754
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,040
- (Engine revving)
- Shh!

755
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,000
(Revving)

756
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,480
What the hell's she doing?

757
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,400
Get back in...

758
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,040
A policeman's seen me.
He's coming across the road.

759
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,120
What are we going to say?

760
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,160
(Tapping)

761
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,520
Sorry, officer... it's Christmas Eve.

762
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,960
Christmas Eve be damned!
It's 4:00 in the morning.

763
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,880
Ah! Is it that time already?

764
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,520
- This the missus?
- No, she's my sis... err... girlfriend.

765
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,640
You're parked on private property.

766
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,760
Why did you move when you saw me coming?

767
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,040
- We knew we shouldn't be here.
- You should be on your way home!

768
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,760
Where'd he go?

769
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,000
To hell with it, we'll
move it ourselves. Come on!

770
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,320
Ready? Push!

771
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,920
That's it, sir, we drove
down for the holidays

772
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,920
and arrived here too
late to get a bed, so...

773
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,000
We drove around and we ended up... here.

774
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,200
Oh, Lord!

775
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,480
Ah! That bastard, making us do the work!

776
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,440
Shut up and pull!

777
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,720
(Grunting)

778
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,560
- There's a car park along the road.
- Oh, good.

779
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,320
Then again, you could always run us
in and give us a bed in the cells.

780
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,400
(Grunting)

781

Police!

783
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,760
Well, you two best be running along, eh?

784
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,720
Aye.

785
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,800

(Footsteps recede)

787
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,480
We've got part of the
Stone. That's something.

788
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,240
- Take it somewhere safe.
- I've a friend in the Midlands.

789
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,600
Great. Let's go.

790
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,960
(Grunting)

791
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,120
- Where's your coat?
- It's under the Stone.

792
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,120
You'll catch your death.

793
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,480
I seem to have forgotten
all my own rules.

794
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,120
Kay... you realize when we get
home, we can't see each other?

795
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,520
I suppose.

796
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,200
It won't be safe.

797
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,680
Well, like I said, I don't
really like you anyway.

798
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,040
(Mimics English accent) It's
been a marvelous party, darling.

799
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,000
Thanks so awfully for inviting me.

800
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,600
Take this.

801
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,640
Oh, they're in my coat!

802
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,800
- Maybe he ran them in.
- Aye, maybe.

803
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,920
- What do you think we should do?
- I don't know.

804
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,000
- Think we could carry it?
- Where? Into the street to catch a bus?

805
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,640
- You've not had any bright ideas!
- With you jabbering on?

806
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,160
- I won't say another word!
- Don't!

807
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,320
- I won't!
- Good!

808
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,880
Fine!

809
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,240
That's it. Go and get the other car.

810
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,520
Oh, brilliant!

811
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,040
The keys are in his coat.

812
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,960
(Groaning)

813
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,840
Got it!

814
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,480
Come on. Let's go.

815
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,920

- They're not in here!
- What? Give me that.

822
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,760
He left them in the car. Please,
God, he left them in the car!

823
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,200
Can we break in, hot-wire it?

824
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,160
Stand back.

It's finished.

832
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,360
We'd better get out of here. Come on.

01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,920
- Oh!
- Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

924
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,240
Your landlady let us in.

925
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,920
What's going on?

926
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,480
I just spent the last 5 hours
down at the police station.

927
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,840
Shit!

928
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,520
And they were asking me a lot about you.

929
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:17,400
I told them you spent Christmas with me.

930
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,240
(Sniggers)

931
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,360
That's last year.

932
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,760
Thanks, mate.

933
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,040
Aye.

934
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,000
There's something else.

935
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,120
My dad's a builder so he
knows a lot about stone.

936
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,200
He said if the Stone's
been dry for 600 years...

937
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,680
and moisture gets in now and freezes,

938
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,600
the whole thing could just
disintegrate, nothing left.

939
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,280
We'll be shoveling it into paper bags.

940
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,040
We need to go and get it.
Before we're all arrested.

941
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,320
Before there's no Stone left to get.

942
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,200
(Background music over dialogue)

943
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,600
What the hell is that?

944
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,160
Should we wait, see if they leave?

945
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,080
Is that it?

946
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,320
Aye.

947
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,800
- At least it's in one piece.
- Might as well be back in the Abbey.

948
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:19,400
We... were just travelling
through and we saw your fires...

949
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,200
Thought we'd see if we
could have a bit of a warm.

950
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,800
Have a seat.

951
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:37,000
Expect you have a bit of trouble,
now and then. From the police.

952
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,880
Some.

953
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:44,520
Well, that's because they don't
like the way you live. You're free.

954
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,120
I think freedom's the most
valuable thing that people can have.

955
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:52,320
Many would take that freedom
from people they don't understand.

956
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,960
Like yourselves and...
well... ourselves.

957
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:06,960
Our people, the Scots, have died for
freedom over and over for centuries.

958
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,000
And we would again, too, gladly.

959
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,120
But for us to continue our fight,
we need a symbol to unite our people.

960
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,200
We've not done anything
wrong, although...

961
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,360
...what we have done is illegal.

962
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,280
But we've done the only thing we could.

963
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,760
We need that symbol of freedom so
that the flame that burns in here...

964
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,880
can never be extinguished.

965
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,480
This symbol of yours...

966
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,600
...where is it?

967
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,440
It's under your arse.

968
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,280
(Laughs)

969
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,520
And it was under my arse!

970
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,800
(Laughter)

971
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,680
(Ian) Ready? Here we go.

972
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,640
(Gavin) Here we are.

973
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,000
Well done.

974
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:53,000
- (Bill) Good to see you.
- (Gavin) Let's do it, then, eh?

975
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,640
Pull that off.

976
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,640
Just back...

977
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,400
Watch your feet. Alan... Alan!

978
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,600
(Grunting)

979
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,920
To the brave souls who
brought the Stone home.

980
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,640
Wherever they may be.

981
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,880
May Scotland never forget them.

982
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,040
- Well done.
- Thank you, John.

983
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,240
Thank you.

984
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,360
(Ian) 'I knew it was only a matter
of time before I was arrested.

985
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
'And I longed for it.

986

'The excitement. The chance
to have my say in court.

'We couldn't just let it disappear.
Public sentiment would never allow it.

the hands of the authorities.

'to the outrage of an entire nation? '

993
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:04,280
- (Ian) And lift!
- (Kay) I've got it. Good. Careful.

(Ian) 'We returned the Stone
to the Church of Scotland...

sign their Declaration of Independence'.

to London and I never saw it again'.

Stone? Which one of you is the leader?

- What's your name?
- My name shouldn't matter.
