2
00:00:55,097 --> 00:01:00,227
- They're coming to get you, Barbara.
- Stop it.

3
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:07,568
They don't like being awakened this way.

4
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,570
Why do you have to be so mean?

5
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,363
I'm your older brother.

6
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,992
Being mean is part of my job.

7
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:20,330
They're coming to get you, little sister.

8
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,507
You never know when to stop.

9
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,012
What's the matter? Getting scared?

10
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,556
You're still scared of her, aren't you?

11
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,391
That's why we're here.

12
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,561
No, that's not why we're here.

13
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:49,526
Why do we have to put ourselves
through this charade?

14
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,778
Because she is our mother.

15
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,239
Can't you give her one day of your life?

16
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,450
One day? This is the fourth time

17
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,286
in the three months since she died.

18
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,498
I'm spending more time with her now.

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,709
And you know why?

20
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,838
She couldn't be buried in the city.

21
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,634
She knew I had to drive you here.

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,429
We're 200 miles from a glass of beer.

23
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,182
Johnnie, we're here. Please stop it.

24
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,893
Stop what? The truth?

25
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,443
She damn near drove you into a convent.

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,111
When have you had a date?

27
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,864
That is none of your business!

28
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,450
The one thing she never ever drove,

29
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,869
was 200 miles to visit anything.

30
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,749
I need you to stop talking like that.

31
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,919
Don't talk like that. Not here.

32
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,588
Not in the middle of...

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,841
Of what?

34
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,760
Show some respect.

35
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,850
You really are afraid of this place.

36
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:06,019
God, you never stop.

37
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,607
For the love of God, Johnnie. Bastard!

38
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,067
Jesus, you're weird.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,738
Let's just get through this.
Just get it over with.

40
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,450
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

41
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,792
For the love of God, Johnnie.

42
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:35,632
They're horny, Barbara.
They've been dead a long time.

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,099
Look! There's one of them now.
He wants you.

44
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,228
He's getting closer.

45
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,274
- Dangerously closer!
- Stop it, Johnnie.

46
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,693
He's going to hear you.

47
00:03:54,818 --> 00:04:00,490
It doesn't matter. He knows we're here.
It's too late now.

48
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:05,537
There's no escape.
Nooo, mother!

49
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,874
You bastard.

50
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:15,130
- Johnnie
- I'm sorry. Very sorry.

51
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,674
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,596
Hey, man, are you okay?

53
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,433
Is there something we can do to help?

54
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,352
Weird, huh?

55
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,356
Johnnie!

56
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,036
Help!

57
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,373
Please, my brother!

58
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,811
Hey, mister!

59
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,689
Please, we need help!

60
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,483
Please, help us.

61
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,684
Is there anybody here?

62
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,439
Hello?

63
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,982
Hello?

64
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,536
Anyone else inside?

65
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:49,751
You got any shotguns in there?
Hunting rifles, anything.

66
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,087
I don't know.

67
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,387
You don't know?

68
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,562
Hey, come on!

69
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,362
Come on, let's go.

70
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,577
No!

71
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,205
Come on!

72
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,692
Die... damn it!

73
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,138
Who is he? Do you know him?

74
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:16,607
It's all right.
You did what you had to do.

75
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:22,404
Do you know any of them?
The ones outside?

76
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,703
This isn't your house?
You don't live here?

77
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,667
Look, talk to me girl.

78
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,962
Do you have a car?

79
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,011
Do you have a car?

80
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,356
The windows.

81
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:03,111
They can't break through the door,
but they can get through the glass.

82
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,114
God damn you!

83
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,409
God damn all of you!

84
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,234
Truck's on empty.

85
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:34,656
We can't take the chance
of running dry in the middle of nowhere.

86
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,994
We'll hole up here.
Hope that some help comes.

87
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,962
My name is Ben. What's your name?

88
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,717
Barbara.

89
00:18:56,345 --> 00:19:01,892
Look here, Barbara.
I don't need you falling apart on me.

90
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:08,273
I know you can fight when you have to.
You have to now, right now.

91
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,151
Fight with your thinking and feeling.

92
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,739
Fighting keeps you strong
and keeps you thinking straight.

93
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:20,410
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

94
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,834
Nobody knows.

95
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,969
Radio in the truck...

96
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:24,641
All I heard was trash talk.
Same as always.

97
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:31,440
People trying to sound like they know,
but they don't really know shit!

98
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,820
One guy said it's

99
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:42,534
escaped prisoners on the loose
from Hennessey.

100
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:48,248
Another guy said it's some kind of
chemical that makes everybody go crazy.

101
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,753
They don't know shit.

102
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:08,769
How do they explain a man walking around
with his neck broken?

103
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,439
A man shot full of holes

104
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,734
and still coming at you?

105
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,322
Assholes...

106
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:25,702
...down in Evans out for a good time
with their guns and their six-packs.

107
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:32,209
Assholes trying to round them up
and put them in the back of trucks.

108
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,966
Like they know
what they're going to do with them.

109
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:44,513
They had ten... twenty of them
in the back of this panel truck.

110
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:48,308
They opened the door
to let another one in.

111
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,437
They came spilling out of there.

112
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,606
Like bugs.

113
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,843
I was at a diner.

114
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,889
Windows shot out.

115
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,808
Lady next to me shot dead.

116
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,314
Others, too...

117
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,242
I saw six or seven go down.

118
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:36,041
Car exploded outside.

119
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:40,879
My car caught on fire.

120
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:45,008
It was like... like a war.

121
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:53,141
Some of those things
made it inside the diner.

122
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:56,061
Started coming after us.

123
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,481
Some good old boy comes chasing them.

124
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:05,404
Mean son of a bitch had
some kind of hot shit gun, like an M-16.

125
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:11,160
Starts... shooting around.
Bullets tearing up the place.

126
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:17,875
I saw one of those things take
thirty hits and keep on coming.

127
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,254
The damn thing had to be dead,
but it kept on coming.

128
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:27,009
Until it took a hit in the head.
That brought it down.

129
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:32,097
The only way to stop them,
you have to...

130
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,642
...get them in the head.

131
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:40,647
I don't know what's going on,
but I know it's not a prison break.

132
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:45,569
No chemical I ever heard about
can make a dead man walk.

133
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,825
This is something that nobody
has ever heard about or seen before.

134
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,622
This is hell on earth.

135
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,460
This is pure hell on earth.

136
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,654
Damn.

137
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:34,243
Doesn't take long
for the world to fall apart, does it?

138
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,355
There's got to be guns in this house.

139
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,321
Maybe upstairs.

140
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:15,409
I'll go take a look around.
Will you be all right down here alone?

141
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,745
- There's something up there.
- What?

142
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,831
What is it?

143
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:06,752
It's all right. Nothing to worry about.

144
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:12,549
- What is it?
- It's nothing. It's all right.

145
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,891
Ben!

146
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,772
It's all right, don't shoot!
It's just us!

147
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:12,317
- Who the hell is "us"?
- Tom Bitner.

148
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,530
This is Harry Cooper.
His wife is calling from the cellar.

149
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:22,536
They have a sick little girl down there.
My woman's down there, too.

150
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:27,499
- Mind if we ask who the hell you are?
- She's Barbara. I'm Ben.

151
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,004
- You damn near broke my arm.
- Harry, for God's sake!

152
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:38,260
- Aren't you going to answer?
- It's all right. Some people up here.

153
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,930
Didn't you hear all the noise?
We could have used some help.

154
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:45,309
Maybe you can see through walls.

155
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:51,106
We heard some banging around up here.
It could have been those things.

156
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,400
No, that isn't right.

157
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:58,030
We heard the girl calling out.
We were just scared.

158
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:02,284
You want to know the truth?
We were scared to hell.

159
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,579
You live here, Tom?

160
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:10,834
No... it's my uncle Rege's house.

161
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,629
He and my cousin Satchel.

162
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,551
My uncle is dead, I swear.
I touched him, he was stone-cold dead!

163
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,222
- That's the truth.
- We can talk in the cellar.

164
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,099
We walked on over to be with Satchel.

165
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:32,231
Radio said there was some trouble.
We didn't see anything.

166
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:36,360
- We've heard all this before!
- I didn't hear it before, Cooper.

167
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,905
Go on, Tom.

168
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:44,117
Me and Judy Rose walked over,
as I said.

169
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:48,247
After ten minutes,
Mr. Cooper came banging on the door.

170
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:51,124
How did you get here?

171
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,003
You trying to figure out
if somebody's got a car?

172
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:59,383
Mine is broken down on the interstate,
and the kid doesn't own one.

173
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:05,556
What about you, Mr. Ben?
You don't exactly look like neighbours.

174
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:08,600
Truck. Outside. Out of gas.

175
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:14,022
Gas? Evans City is five miles away.
We can make it on friggin' fumes.

176
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,651
What if we can't?
Are you willing to take that chance?

177
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:21,405
Besides, Evans City is a war zone.
I've been there.

178
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,742
It'll take a lot more than five miles
to get any help.

179
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:30,747
There's a gas pump out by the shed.
My uncle keeps it locked.

180
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:36,086
- You know where the key is?
- No, but I can hunt for it.

181
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:42,301
We will, but not now.
It could take too long.

182
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:47,472
We have to figure out what we're doing.
Finish your story, Tom.

183
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:51,226
This is bullshit! If we're going to
do something, let's do it.

184
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,813
Let's stand around and bullshit
in the cellar where it's safe.

185
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,692
- I'm not so sure that's a smart move.
- What do you mean?

186
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:02,779
I'm not sure locking ourselves
in that cellar is a smart move.

187
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,365
I want to know what all the options are.

188
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:09,995
What damn options? And who the fuck
gave you the right to decide for us?

189
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,166
I'm not deciding for you.
I'm thinking about my own ass.

190
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:18,921
- You want to go down there, go!
- Harry, what's going on?

191
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:23,675
Helen, quit yelling at me!
I can't think straight!

192
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,511
You know, Cooper.

193
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:30,015
I've only been around you for a minute,
but I don't like you very much.

194
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:36,271
I'm sure you feel the same about me,
so let's stay out of each other's way.

195
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,152
Go on, Tom.
What else do you have to tell?

196
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,989
Well... Like I said,

197
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:53,038
we were here for ten minutes,
then Mr. Cooper banged on the door.

198
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:58,961
We let in Mr. Cooper and his wife.
I saw the little girl was hurt.

199
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:04,007
I tried to call for help,
but the phone was making this sound.

200
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,637
I tried, but I couldn't call anybody.
That's when uncle Rege...

201
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:14,810
He came walking out of the bedroom.
He was dead a minute before.

202
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,564
He wasn't dead. He couldn't have been.

203
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,525
You made a mistake, that's all.

204
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,530
He was dead. I know he was.

205
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,992
What happened?

206
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:33,704
Uncle Rege went after my cousin.

207
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,623
He went after him like...

208
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,337
I don't know.

209
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:46,466
- Anybody else in the house?
- No, just them.

210
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,221
Tom...

211
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,599
Your cousin is dead.

212
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,605
I know he's dead. He shot himself.

213
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:05,611
When uncle Rege came after him,
I ran down to get the shotgun.

214
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:09,698
I couldn't imagine shooting uncle Rege.

215
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,535
I couldn't imagine doing
a thing like that.

216
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,456
That's when I told everyone
to go down in the cellar.

217
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,709
- It was my idea.
- It was a good idea.

218
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,087
Look outside.

219
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,683
- Into the cellar.
- No, it's a death-trap.

220
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,437
They may be able to
break through the door.

221
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:43,482
We'll be cornered down there.

222
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:48,654
- There's still some way to escape.
- A way out is a way in. The windows!

223
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,864
- We can board them up.
- There's no time...

224
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:56,119
There's only three of them.
I've handled more by myself.

225
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:59,790
- The cellar door won't hold them.
- But the windows will?

226
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:05,420
I don't need this.
If you want to go downstairs, go on!

227
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,131
You can be boss down there,
I'm boss up here.

228
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,717
What are you going to do?

229
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:20,519
- Come up, we need your help.
- You're crazy!

230
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:23,313
You're out of your minds!

231
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:27,192
This is Judy Rose.
Get the shelves from the kitchen.

232
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:34,199
- We'll board up the windows.
- Tommy, are you sure we'll be all right?

233
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,744
There are things out there
like uncle Rege.

234
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,123
Come on, do what I tell you!

235
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:50,090
I'll shut this door until somebody comes
who can get us out of here.

236
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,262
If somebody comes,
we'll try to remember to call you.

237
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,806
You lamebrains!

238
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,979
You're going to die up here.

239
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,630
- What's happening?
- They decided to stay upstairs.

240
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:33,509
- What about us?
- It's safer down here.

241
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:37,054
- What about Sarah?
- It's safer down here, Helen!

242
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,854
There's just this one hammer.
Here, use this.

243
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:50,150
Nail them up quick and dirty.
Get the windows covered.

244
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:55,364
We'll reinforce them later.
If you find any keys, hang on to them.

245
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,534
- How many people are up there?
- Two more.

246
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,620
- And they have the gun?
- No, they have two.

247
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:09,002
They might have a hundred guns,
but it's safer down here!

248
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,588
We have to get help for Sarah.

249
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:15,759
I'm not opening that door
and neither are you, and if you try...

250
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:22,599
What? It is your daughter lying there.
We have to get her to a doctor.

251
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:27,896
There's no doctors upstairs,
and there's no way out of here.

252
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:35,821
None of those yo-yos has a car!
What a place to be stuck.

253
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:39,992
In the middle of nowhere
with a bunch of yo-yos.

254
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,582
The fever's got worse.

255
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,918
Look, she's going to be all right.

256
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:54,173
Somebody will come,
we'll get out of here.

257
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:57,009
We're all going to be all right.

258
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,682
They're crazy.
They're out of their minds.

259
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,643
You bunch of yo-yos!

260
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:20,073
This is the last of the big stuff.
Not going to do it.

261
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,493
Hey, Tom, give me a hand.

262
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,632
Turn it over. Come on!

263
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,385
Get the legs.

264
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:46,683
All right, I'll be back here.
Come on, come on!

265
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,359
Great. Bring my gun when you come back!

266
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,827
Nail it.

267
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,622
Just get it up.
We'll reinforce it later.

268
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:11,625
They're so slow.

269
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:19,341
We could just walk right past them.
We wouldn't even have to run.

270
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:27,349
We have the guns.
If we're careful, we could get away.

271
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:32,563
You told me to fight.
I'm fighting, I'm not panicking.

272
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:36,608
This place is not safe.

273
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,946
We should leave before it's too late.

274
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:46,034
I know you want to get out of here,
and so do I. We're going to do it.

275
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,746
We'll find a way to the gas,
and we'll be gone.

276
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:54,418
You're doing fine, all right.
We're all doing just fine.

277
00:38:54,543 --> 00:39:00,007
We'll make it if we're careful.
Like you said, we have to be careful.

278
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:04,469
- We can get the doors and nail them up.
- Nice going, Tom!

279
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,098
Is she crazy or what?

280
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,022
Oh, my God!

281
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:17,733
Oh, my God, Tommy!

282
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,701
Wait a minute. Nail it up!

283
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,458
Get a few nails in there.
Get some in the table-top.

284
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,680
It's all right!
Keep nailing, keep pounding!

285
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,224
Come on, Tom! Over here!

286
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,229
Let's get this baby off.

287
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,325
Easy.

288
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,809
Hit it!

289
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:22,774
We're going upstairs for a minute.
We'll leave the weapons here.

290
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,238
Tom, wait a minute.

291
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:43,045
Wait a minute. Don't go up.

292
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,643
It's all right. Come on.
Don't look at it.

293
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,631
Is this all new stuff in here?

294
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:32,886
Uncle Rege is fixing up the place.

295
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:36,598
- No good.
- It's better than nothing, Ben.

296
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,684
No good.

297
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:55,868
Hey, Tom. Television.
Take it out and see if anything's on.

298
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,590
Found something.

299
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,927
Telling you what to do, I think.

300
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,308
Damn. This must really be big.

301
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:26,398
Station's in Zelionople.
It's only twenty miles from here.

302
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,109
Might as well be a hundred.

303
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,243
- It's going to come on live.
- We can't wait for it.

304
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:43,916
Give me a hand with some of that lumber.
We can use it to cover up the windows.

305
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:51,548
I must be stupid.
The old doors are all in the cellar.

306
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,686
Heads up down there.

307
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,773
Idiots!

308
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:12,361
- What's happening up there?
- How do I know?

309
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:16,782
They said they wanted to board it up.
Board it up, please.

310
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:20,661
- And you refused to help them.
- That's right.

311
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:26,041
I refused, and you know why?
Because they're wrong, Helen.

312
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:30,963
The cellar is the only safe place.
You just watch.

313
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:37,761
- They'll beg us to let them in.
- And what will you do then, Harry?

314
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:41,390
- Will you open the door then?
- Mr. Cooper?

315
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:47,980
We need the doors
to board up the windows.

316
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,067
Fuck him!

317
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,238
Mr. Cooper, can you hear me?

318
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:59,116
Cooper! Open this door right now!

319
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,452
We need those doors!

320
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:11,003
I have a shotgun.
Open this door or I'll blow it to shit!

321
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:15,299
What are you doing?
What do you hope to accomplish?

322
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,134
Shut up!

323
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:21,638
- I'm counting to three.
- We're going to open!

324
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,938
I'm counting, that's one.

325
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:40,240
What are you going to do? That's two!

326
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,494
Better open this door, Cooper.

327
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:10,521
Look, I won! You leave that door open!
We may want to get down there.

328
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:16,318
You want the best of both worlds.
You want to be able to run down here.

329
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:21,281
If you want to get into that cellar,
you get in there now or forget it!

330
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:24,952
I'm not boxing myself in
until there's no other choice.

331
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:28,163
And I'm not gambling with
my daughter's life!

332
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:33,877
- Stay up here, but don't count on me.
- I'm not counting on you for shit!

333
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:39,258
If you want to fight, get out!
This is our house.

334
00:46:39,383 --> 00:46:42,511
Here's you all playing rooster with it!

335
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:46,849
I'd like to know where you'd all be
if we didn't let you in here.

336
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,518
Where would you be
if we kicked you out?

337
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:53,105
We're not going to kick anyone out.

338
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,985
Let's try and work together
and get some of this shit done!

339
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:29,766
You ought to keep her covered.
Get some blankets from upstairs.

340
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,717
How did she get hurt?

341
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:08,347
One of those... people
bit her on the arm.

342
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,235
What? You want this one, too?

343
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:32,913
We have to get help.
We have to get a doctor for Sarah.

344
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:35,916
We're going to try.

345
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:40,587
Since you're not doing anything,
maybe you could look for those keys.

346
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:48,387
- What keys?
- Keys to the gas pump out back.

347
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:53,684
- There's a car?
- A truck! The gas pump is locked.

348
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:56,937
The keys could be anywhere!

349
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,947
Where are... keys...

350
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:10,159
I'm looking for... my God.

351
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,123
Oh, my God.

352
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,274
I need the hammer in here!

353
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,069
Bring the hammer...

354
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,883
Ease up! Ease up!

355
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:18,352
Helen, we have to go downstairs quickly!

356
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:33,867
Cooper, give me the nails over there!
I can't let go!

357
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:38,997
You have to help me out!
Give me the wrench and nails, man!

358
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:41,250
Cooper!

359
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:57,975
This is definitely not going to work.

360
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:04,398
Get out of the way!

361
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:10,320
- We have to get downstairs.
- Take your hands off me!

362
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,671
Don't shoot, it's Mr. McGruder!

363
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:32,551
- You shot Mr. McGruder!
- Look at his back.

364
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:36,972
Look at his back, I didn't do that!

365
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:44,855
It's like uncle Rege.
They're dead, but they're coming for us.

366
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,942
That's impossible. That just can't be.

367
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:52,237
Grab him.
We'll throw him out the window.

368
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,249
Is he dead?

369
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:09,713
Is he dead?
You're all seeing this! Is he dead?

370
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,759
Stop it! You're losing it girl.

371
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:19,056
You think so?

372
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,648
Whatever I lost, I lost a long time ago,
and I don't plan on losing more.

373
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,238
You can talk to me about losing it,
when you stop screaming at each other.

374
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:48,043
Are you all right?

375
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,091
It's going to be all right, okay?

376
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:59,012
- How many bullets does it hold?
- Fifteen. There's more in the desk.

377
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:10,607
We have a few more windows to cover up.
Grab some lumber and get started.

378
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:09,917
...random acts of violence
committed by people in a trance.

379
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:16,006
They have lost the ability
to communicate and reason.

380
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:20,969
The military has been mobilized,
but the violence is so widespread-

381
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:25,098
- that it is impossible
for the rescue services to respond.

382
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,811
People left to defend themselves...

383
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,698
Citizens faced with
the collapse of local police

384
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:47,162
have taken the law
into their own hands.

385
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:53,919
Most communities are without telephones,
many without power, some without water.

386
00:54:54,044 --> 00:55:01,343
The scientific community is focusing on
the trancelike state of the assailants.

387
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,805
Clearly a behavioural disorder,

388
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,768
but what could have caused
such a widespread and dramatic disorder?.

389
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:14,398
We've heard everything from
the ozone layer and chemical weapons

390
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:18,694
to... voodoo mysticism
and organisms from space.

391
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:24,408
Biologists in California
have released reports stating

392
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:30,914
that the bodies of the recently dead
are returning to life,

393
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:37,129
driven byan unknown force
that enables the brain to function.

394
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:46,013
Doctors at the CDC in Atlanta
reject that theory-

395
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:48,932
calling it preposterous beyond belief.

396
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:54,438
The only reasonable explanation
is a germ, a bacteria or a virus,

397
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,566
that has a mind-altering effect.

398
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:04,364
How a germ could have been delivered
over such a vast area remains a mystery.

399
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:08,368
It's being called Judgment Day by...

400
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:56,458
Where are you taking it?
No, that stays up here.

401
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,418
Get off my back! Damn it.

402
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:07,302
- Nice going, asshole!
- You were taking it downstairs.

403
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,179
You stupid...

404
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,476
Damn you!

405
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:17,062
You son of a bitch!

406
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,026
That was our only way of finding out
what was going on!

407
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:29,074
I wasn't taking it downstairs.
You can't get reception in a basement!

408
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,204
What the hell is she doing?

409
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:48,260
Is that your uncle Rege?
Do you think the keys are in his pocket?

410
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:08,655
- We have to get the keys.
- Damn it, stay back here.

411
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,269
We can get away.

412
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:43,607
- It's too dangerous.
- We could make it.

413
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:48,070
- Five miles. We have Cooper's kid.
- Leave them, we'll bring back help.

414
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,990
Make a move, we're drawing a crowd here.

415
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,378
You know I'm right.

416
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,089
We could walk right by them.

417
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,217
I've got the keys.

418
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,681
We have to get to the gas.
It's our best chance.

419
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:18,642
Everybody, back inside! Quick!

420
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,692
Damn it, get in here!

421
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:13,780
- You stay inside. Keep the rifle.
- You can't go out without the guns.

422
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:16,950
We have Tom's gun.
I want that gun in here.

423
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,912
I don't want any locked doors
between me and him.

424
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:23,999
- For crying out loud, do you...
- I don't want to hear another word.

425
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:29,254
The only way I'm going out
is with you keeping things straight.

426
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:35,093
- I'm coming with you.
- No, stay in here.

427
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:40,015
One to drive, one to work the gas
and one to ride shotgun. That's three.

428
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:43,936
Tommy, tell him I know how to drive.

429
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:48,148
Her daddy's got trucks,
she's been driving since she was little.

430
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:52,861
- All right. Is that shotgun loaded?
- Yes, I have shells in my pocket.

431
01:00:56,865 --> 01:01:00,911
Can't tell how many's on the porch.
That will be the toughest part.

432
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:04,414
Once we get to the yard
we ought to be all right.

433
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:12,047
There's no way.
You're never going to make it.

434
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,610
You keep an eye on us.

435
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:36,947
When we start driving back,
you get that kid up here!

436
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:41,368
You get in that truck, get it started.
Don't stop no matter what.

437
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:43,996
You just move!

438
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,881
Heads up!

439
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:59,219
Come on, damn it!

440
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,140
Get in!

441
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,622
Helen, damn it...

442
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:38,342
Ease up!

443
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:01,281
Shut the door!

444
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,369
Start, you piece of shit!

445
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:34,731
Come on!

446
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,739
What's happening?

447
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:53,375
Slow down, we lost Ben!

448
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:59,756
Stop the car! We lost Ben, go back!

449
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:16,231
- We lost Ben!
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

450
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:19,610
I was hollering at you. Go back!

451
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:31,038
- Here he comes. What should I do?
- Go down there and get him.

452
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:36,126
These are the wrong keys.

453
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:38,921
These are the wrong damn keys!

454
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,217
What the hell are you doing?

455
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:07,741
I want you down in that cellar, Helen.
There's nothing we can do up here now.

456
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:10,702
Do what he says.
I'll try and get to town.

457
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:13,956
If I can find any help, I'll be back.

458
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:17,167
- Come.
- We mustn't leave them.

459
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:36,562
- We should wait until Ben gets back.
- I want you in there where it's safe.

460
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:41,567
Into the cellar, now.
Your daughter needs you.

461
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:19,480
Sarah?

462
01:06:28,947 --> 01:06:31,325
Oh, my baby...

463
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,392
- I want that gun.
- You go to hell.

464
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:04,358
- I want that gun.
- Give it up. Just crawl back into...

465
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:08,403
Help me!

466
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:12,741
Cooper! Open this door, god-damn it!

467
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:17,538
Son of a bitch!

468
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:22,042
Open it up!

469
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:36,140
Open this door! God-damn it!

470
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,065
Give me that! Give it to me!

471
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:50,612
Cooper! son of a bitch!

472
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,415
Open the door!

473
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,902
Come on! Push!

474
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,999
Push!

475
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:54,635
Get his guns!

476
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,741
Sarah?

477
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:22,496
Shoot it.

478
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:25,541
No.

479
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:30,045
- Shoot it, Cooper.
- No.

480
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,507
But it's my...

481
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,468
No!

482
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:06,957
Stop! Ben, are you crazy?

483
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,630
Cooper, no!

484
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,474
Madness.

485
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:53,754
- Are you coming?
- No.

486
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:58,258
- We can still make it.
- No, I'm hurt bad.

487
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,055
Go on, get out of here.

488
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:06,725
I'll bring help if I can.

489
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:08,644
Go!

490
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,418
Oh, God!

491
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:29,423
Do not attempt to reach family.

492
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:34,970
Do not attempt to reach
any of the rescue stations.

493
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:38,015
They may no longer be in operation.

494
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:45,272
Repeating this advisory from the
Office of Emergency Preparedness.

495
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:52,404
The dead are being reactivated
by forces unknown.

496
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,448
You got that right.

497
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:58,118
The bodies are weak
and uncoordinated-

498
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:02,664
- but are capable of inflicting
damage on people and property.

499
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:09,213
They are to be considered extremely
dangerous, especially in large numbers.

500
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:15,469
These can be disposed of
only by incapacitating the brain.

501
01:17:15,594 --> 01:17:18,347
They got that right, too.

502
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:23,602
These reactivated bodies will attack
warm-blooded animals of all species

503
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:29,691
without provocation,
and will devour the flesh.

504
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:38,283
Acts of homicide and cannibalism
reported through the afternoon

505
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:45,374
are contributable, at least in part,
to these reactivated bodies.

506
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,834
Don't shoot!

507
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:41,180
Johnnie...

508
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:53,025
Jesus god-damn holy reverent shit!

509
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:58,489
What in the name of Jupiter's balls
are you doing out here alone, lady?

510
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:23,532
- Tell me, chief, are they slow-moving?
- Yeah, they're all messed up.

511
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:44,970
Shoot the fuck down!

512
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:50,434
They're us.
We're them, and they're us.

513
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:53,687
Say what?

514
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:58,317
Nothing.

515
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:04,740
- Having fun?
- Give me a break.

516
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:55,767
Drag that out of here.

517
01:22:55,893 --> 01:23:00,314
I'm going in. Watch your back.
There may be more of them.

518
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,871
You came back.

519
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:31,512
There's another one for the fire.

520
01:23:32,305 --> 01:23:38,739
