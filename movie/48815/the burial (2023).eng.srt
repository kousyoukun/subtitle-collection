00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,405
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gary.
I'm Jeremiah O'Keefe.

162
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,025
"Jeremiah." I like that.

163
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,235
That's biblical. Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations. That's biblical.

164
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,695
- Now, who's this?
- Hey...

165
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,485
JEREMIAH:
He's my junior counsel, Halbert Dockins.

166
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:02,105
Well, H-Hal's fine.

167
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,775
- Uh, it's an honor, Mr. Gary.
- You're too young

168
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:05,155
to be a lawyer, Negro.

169
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,485
I thought you was his foster child.

170
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:07,815
Really? Come on,
no, I'm just kidding with you.

171
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:08,905
Come on in here.

172
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,775
This is, this is my, uh,
partner, Reggie Douglas.

173
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,195
He runs my point.

174
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,985
So, what y'all got?
What y'all got for Willie Gary?

175
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,565
Hmm? P.I.?

176
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,065
I beg your pardon?

177
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,445
P.I. Personal injury.
Y'all got some personal injuries?

178
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,985
Didn't y'all see the sign outside?

179
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,445
That's the only kind of law
we practice round here.

180
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,775
Uh, well, yes and no.

181
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,315
Um, I guess...
I guess we sort of have a...

182
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,065
a P.I. case, but with a bit of a twist.

183
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,105
Bit of a twist?
Okay, what-what kind of twist?

184
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,485
What kind of case is it?

185
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:37,525
It's a contract law case.

186
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,605
Contract law? Oh, come on, man.

187
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,985
- We don't do no contract law here.
- REGGIE: Hell, nah.

188
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,605
That sound like a nap waiting to happen.

189
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:45,355
- Yeah. Yeah, we don't do no contract law.
- REGGIE: I mean, hell.

190
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,905
R-Right, but look, we understand
it's not necessarily your field,

191
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:50,485
but perhaps you could just hear him out.

192
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,455
I think you'll find the case compelling.

193
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,605
I am a, um, funeral director

194
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:01,275
from Biloxi, Mississippi.

195
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,655
I have a business there-- Well, actually,
I have several businesses there.

196
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:08,125
I have eight funeral homes
and one burial insurance company.

197
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,945
<i>We are a family business,</i>

198
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,655
<i>and have been for over a hundred years.</i>

199
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:15,945
<i>And we are not about to lose that</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

200
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,985
<i>After I returned from the war,</i>

201
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,775
<i>my father passed the business to me,</i>

202
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:23,155
<i>which I considered a sacred trust.</i>

203
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:26,195
<i>Annette and I were blessed</i>
<i>with 13 children,</i>

204
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:29,235
<i>and we intend for them</i>

205
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,155
<i>to carry the business into the future.</i>

206
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,025
<i>But about a year ago,</i>

207
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:35,775
<i>I ran into some financial trouble.</i>

208
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,695
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How can I help you?

209
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:40,405
We're here on behalf
of the state insurance commission.

210
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:43,275
Mr. O'Keefe, as a registered
burial insurance broker

211
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,655
in the state of Mississippi,

212
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,445
I'm sure you're aware
you're required to maintain

213
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:50,195
a certain minimum funds
in your account at all times.

214
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,125
Well, yes. Of course I'm aware.

215
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,445
Insurance regulators?

216
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,735
You gotta be kidding me.

217
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,155
What'd they say they want, exactly?

218
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,695
Truth is, I may have gotten myself
into a lot of trouble.

219
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,565
Trouble?

220
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,445
Jerry...

221
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:20,155
I've been your lawyer, what,
coming up on 30 years?

222
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,445
Was your friend even before that.

223
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,405
You and I both know

224
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:27,105
I've been in debt
up to my neck for years,

225
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,655
trying to make this business strong,

226
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,235
make it last,

227
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,795
so I have something to leave my children.

228
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,315
(sighs)

229
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,025
Let's not panic just yet.

230
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,525
I get how stressful this is,

231
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,905
but I'm pretty sure we can
find a way out of it.

232
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:44,235
Hold up a second.

233
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,485
Excuse me, son.

234
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,945
- Do you want another drink?
- No, no.

235
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,695
Whenever you get a chance,
could I get another bourbon over here?

236
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:51,335
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,315
So, look,

238
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,105
have you considered
selling off part of the business?

239
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,505
No.

240
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:05,295
Just part of it. Okay?

241
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,775
Well, I'm not saying I want to,
but if I did,

242
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,525
where would I find a buyer?

243
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,315
Canada, actually.

244
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,405
They made an inquiry.

245
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:17,155
Loewen Group? Oh, yeah.

246
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,985
They've been on a pretty significant
acquisition spree.

247
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,355
Going all across the country,

248
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,275
buying up every independently owned
funeral chain they can get their hands on.

249
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,985
These guys, they're really big players.

250
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:32,525
Now, you know how I feel
about these big corporations, now.

251
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:36,105
Yes, I do. But all I'm saying is
it's an option.

252
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,005
And it's out there.

253
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,795
Might be a way out.

254
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,045
You could think about it.

255
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:49,275
- (plane flying overhead)
- (car horns honking)

256
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:50,985
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

257
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,695
Jerry.

258
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,355
Perfect timing.

259
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:57,065
- Hey, you need a hand with that?
- Oh, no, I got it.

260
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,565
Hey, so, listen.

261
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:00,025
You're sure about this, right?

262
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,945
No, I've given this a lot of thought,

263
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,855
and I believe this is
the right thing to do for my family.

264
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,105
All righty, then.

265
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:06,775
Next stop, Vancouver.
You ready to go inside?

266
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:08,355
No, we got to wait for Hal.

267
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,275
- Who?
- I told you about Hal.

268
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:11,655
He's a friend of my son's from college,

269
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,155
very bright young man

270
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,405
just getting started out
as a lawyer and, uh...

271
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:16,985
Well, hell, here he comes now.

272
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,405
Recently passed the bar exam.

273
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,485
Hungry for experience.

274
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,235
Who, which one?

275
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,905
That tall kid?

276
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,105
Hey, hey, sorry.
So sorry, Mr. O'Keefe. Um...

277
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,275
My taxi just dropped me off
at the wrong terminal, so...

278
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,625
Oh, don't worry about it. Halbert Dockins,
I want you to meet Mike Allred.

279
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,605
Really great to meet you, Mr. Allred.

280
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,235
I'm very excited
to be a member of the team.

281
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,815
- Hi, there. Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

282
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,485
So you're a lawyer?

283
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,485
(chuckles) Uh, yeah.

284
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:48,405
Well, that's just great.
Good for you, son.

285
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:50,375
I'll see you guys inside.

286
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,585
Come on. We're going to Canada.

287
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,105
BOB:
<i>I work for Ray Loewen.</i>

288
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:01,815
<i>He's really looking forward</i>
<i>to meeting you.</i>

289
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,445
As I'm sure you can gather,

290
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:05,315
Ray's a very hands-on kind of guy.

291
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,315
One of the only CEOs in the industry

292
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,335
who likes to meet with
every seller personally.

293
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:12,735
Hey, Ray!

294
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:15,735
Allow me to introduce Mr. Jeremiah O'Keefe

295
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,405
- and his colleagues.
- It is a pleasure to meet you, Jerry.

296
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:22,985
So, boys, how do you like the way we do
business up here in Canada? (laughing)

297
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:25,405
Come on on board. Get you a drink.

298
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:27,405
(seabirds screeching)

299
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:30,985
BOB:
At present, we own 1,115 funeral homes,

300
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,525
427 cemeteries,

301
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:36,165
354 insurance companies.

302
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,735
RAY:
My strategy is simple.

303
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,985
Buy as many funeral homes as I can

304
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,355
and put myself in a position

305
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,195
for what I like to call

306
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,955
the Golden Era of Death.

307
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:51,905
Sorry?

308
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,065
It's when all the baby boomers
across the U.S.

309
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,355
finally reach their age of demise.

310
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,855
RAY:
Resulting in a minimum 60% increase

311
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,405
in death rates nationwide.

312
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:06,525
Do you have any idea how many people
are living in the U.S.,

313
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,775
right now,

314
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,795
over the age of 65?

315
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,105
51 million.

316
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,485
(Bob and Ray laugh)

317
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,815
JEREMIAH:
That sounds kind of cynical to me.

318
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,065
Aren't you worried
about losing sight of your customer?

319
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:22,155
RAY:
My customer?

320
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,295
What customer?
My customers are dead guys.

321
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:26,795
(laughing)

322
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,105
I'm just kidding.

323
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,375
I'm just kidding, Jerry.

324
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:36,855
Look, the more funeral homes I own,

325
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,445
the more money I make,

326
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:41,605
the more I am able to meet the demands
of my customer.

327
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,375
And provide for his... growing needs.

328
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,275
Maybe it's time that we drop
all this chit-chat

329
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,155
and start talking about a deal.
What do you say, gentlemen?

330
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:56,025
I'm interested to hear
what you have in mind, Ray.

331
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:58,025
My understanding

332
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,695
is that you're having a bit of trouble

333
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:01,525
with the state regulators down there.

334
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,985
How'd you come to that understanding?

335
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,235
RAY:
You own... what?

336
00:14:06,435 --> 00:14:07,695
Nine homes across the state?

337
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:08,815
JEREMIAH:
Eight.

338
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,485
I own eight funeral homes
across the state.

339
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,735
And my insurance business, of course.

340
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,945
So what about this?

341
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,775
You sell me three of your homes,

342
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:22,195
at a fair market value
to be agreed upon later.

343
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,655
Then, not only do you get to keep

344
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,815
the bulk of your assets,

345
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:30,355
but it would also provide you
with more than enough fresh cash

346
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,355
to deal with the regulators.

347
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,795
Now, there's something else
I want out of this deal.

348
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,985
I make most of my profits
from selling burial insurance.

349
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,065
There's no way I can survive
if you have a monopoly

350
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,065
on that, too, so what I propose

351
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:46,155
is that I sell you
three of my funeral homes,

352
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,955
fair market value...

353
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,025
...but you're going to have to promise,
here and now,

354
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,835
to no longer sell burial insurance
in southern Mississippi.

355
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,375
Okay.

356
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,315
So does this mean we have a deal?

357
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,655
I'll get my lawyers
to draw up the contracts

358
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,585
so we can get it done immediately.

359
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,025
What the hell is taking so long?

360
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,355
We closed on this deal, um...

361
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:28,775
Coming up on four months now.

362
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,815
They keep trying to re-trade the terms.

363
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:34,485
When we left Vancouver,
they said it would take 30 days max.

364
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,195
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I don't know, makes perfect sense to me.

365
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,375
MIKE:
Why?

366
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,315
Have you considered the possibility

367
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,605
that Loewen has no intention
of closing this deal at all?

368
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:47,905
Son, with all due respect,
you don't have the faintest idea

369
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,235
what you're talking about.

370
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:50,445
I think I do.

371
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,275
Think about it.

372
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:54,815
The longer he stalls,
the worse you're screwed.

373
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:57,025
First, the insurance commission
takes your license,

374
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,655
effectively destroying your livelihood,

375
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,985
until, sooner or later, you have no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.

376
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,525
Now not only does Loewen get
the three homes,

377
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,735
he can actually buy your entire business
out from under you

378
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:08,155
at yard-sale prices.

379
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:09,985
You really think
he's trying to bankrupt me?

380
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,315
Hell, he can't do that;
I got a signed contract.

381
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:15,025
It was only signed on our end.

382
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,735
With no closing date attached.

383
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,195
And, by the way, I heard Mr. Loewen

384
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,775
is actually still selling insurance
in the region.

385
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,855
Oh, come on.
Stop with the conspiracy theories.

386
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:25,025
Son, I'm sorry,
but you really are paranoid.

387
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,105
Okay.

388
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:27,195
Um...

389
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,025
would you mind doing me a favor?

390
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,815
Would you mind stop calling me son?

391
00:16:32,015 --> 00:16:35,485
I am not your son, Mike.

392
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:36,655
Whoa.

393
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,525
Just take it easy, okay?

394
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:40,445
You really want to be taken seriously

395
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,355
- as a lawyer in this town?
- Okay. Who says I'm not?

396
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:44,375
Enough of that, y'all.

397
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:51,485
Do you really think Mr. Loewen has the
intention of running me into the ground?

398
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:52,945
I do.

399
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,735
Why the hell should he be
on our clock anyway?

400
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,355
Well, that's it. I'm gonna sue him.

401
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,485
You've never sued anybody before
in your whole life.

Well, I'm liable to,
just about any minute now.

403
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:07,905
Yeah. Well, you think 75 years of age
is a good time to start suing people?

404
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,695
Old men don't file lawsuits.

405
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,695
The way I see it, if somebody tries
to take advantage of you,

406
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,525
and you know it's wrong,
it don't matter how old you are.

407
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:18,485
This fellow tried to bully me

- is to never forget where he came from.

Believe it or not, he's got

457
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:34,275
He supposedly hasn't lost a case
in over 12 years.

458
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:35,775
What does he know about contract law?

459
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,445
This is a contract law case.

460
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,525
The case was filed down in Hinds County.

461
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,355
That's a three-to-one Black/white ratio.

462
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,985
That means there's a 70% chance
we'll get a Black judge,

463
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,735
and if we do go to trial,

464
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,655
likely a Black jury as well.

He has been my attorney for 30 years.

469
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,985
He knows contract law better than anybody.

470

You're really gonna
make me spell this out.

Um...

good ol' boy Southern bigotry.

00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,525
I mean, a Black jury sees
a guy like that coming...

474
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:20,155
The idea of us pandering to a jury
like that, Hal, it's not...

475
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,945
It... (sighs)

476
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:25,025
This is not a discrimination suit.

477
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,125
You and I both know
that race has nothing to do with this.

478
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:36,155
I happen to know, for a fact,
that Mr. Gary is trying a case

479
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:37,955
down in Florida this week.

480
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,815
What if... what if...

481
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:43,815
you and I went down there,
just for the day,

482
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,755
and try to meet him in person?

483
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,315
Essentially, we just want
to hold the Loewen Group

484
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,945
responsible for their actions.

485
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,355
WILLIE:
Nah, nah, nah. That ain't what you want.

486
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:53,985
What you want to do
is you want to make 'em pay.

487
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,485
- REGGIE: Make 'em hurt,
make 'em pay. -Yeah, yeah.

488
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:57,405
So, how much money y'all trying
to get, hmm?

489
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:59,815
- JEREMIAH: Uh, $6 million.
- $6 million.

490
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,485
That's full, fair market value
plus damages,

491
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:08,655
and I've already filed a civil claim
in Hinds County, Mississippi.

492
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:10,485
HAL:
Well?

493
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,295
What-what do you think, Mr. Gary?
Do you like the case?

494
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,985
I'm gonna give you my personal opinion.

495
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:18,565
Honest.

496
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:22,735
Look, Mr. O'Keefe, I'm sorry for
what this Loewen guy did to you--

497
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,355
he sounds like he's a big asshole
and everything like that--

498
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,315
but, um, this ain't no Willie Gary case.

499
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:30,105
It just ain't. It ain't...

500
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,445
It ain't a Willie Gary case.

501
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:33,105
Uh, wait, what-what do you mean?
Why-why not?

502
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,105
It ain't a Willie Gary case

503
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:37,235
- 'cause it ain't for Willie Gary.
- No, but...

504
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,445
I'm sorry,
what is a "Willie Gary case," then?

505
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:40,855
- I don't...
- In other words, what he's saying is

506
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:43,695
a Willie Gary case is the type of case
where I have the upper hand.

507
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:47,195
Where I feel that I can take
this case to trial. Understand?

508
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,315
- All the way.
- And-and once I get 'em in that trial,

509
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:50,605
I mean, y'all seen my tape.

510
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:52,355
When I get 'em in front of--
especially in front of people

511
00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:54,485
that-that look like me--
I'm-a play 'em like a symphony.

512
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:55,945
Mm. Mozart.

513
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,985
A Willie Gary case is
where I could take that judgement

514
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,065
and push it all the way up,
to the heavens if I need to,

515
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:04,445
and get as much money as I can
for my client.

516
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:06,695
Uh, what he's saying is,
a Willie Gary case

517
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:08,025
is a case we know we can win.

518
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:09,695
This case... not so much.

519
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,455
Matter of fact,
your case a little bit iffy.

520
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:16,195
And, uh...

521
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,815
the other thing is this.

522
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:20,045
Don't take this the wrong way, but, uh...

523
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,485
He, uh, he's-- you're white-- he's white.

524
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:27,815
And I don't have white clients.

525
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,655
I've never had any, so...

526
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:35,545
No offense or anything like that,
but this is just unusual for me.

527
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:39,585
No offense taken, Mr. Gary.

528
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,985
That guy's too rich and famous
for us, Halbert.

529
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,565
Uh-huh.

530
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,985
Um, you know what, Mr. O'Keefe?
Just, um...

531
00:22:47,185 --> 00:22:48,315
- What?
- You know, just-just give me one second.

532
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:49,525
- All right?
- Where you going?

533
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:50,855
I'm-I'm gonna talk with him one more time.

534
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:52,275
G-Give me five minutes, okay?

535
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:54,065
The green light scenario,

536
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,985
when I was talking to the,
the one juror, uh, uh...

537
00:22:57,185 --> 00:22:58,445
What'd she have on?

538
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,405
I'd have maybe looked at her
a little bit longer.

539
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:01,735
You know, gave her some eye contact.

540
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:03,525
- Sometimes you got to romance them.
- Listen, I'm not...

541
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,355
- That's the thing, I don't know that...
- Look, Mr. Gary,

542
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:07,355
I'm so sorry to come back in here
like this, I really am,

543
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,195
- but I just need a minute of your time.
- WILLIE: What's going on with you, man?

544
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:10,905
- You lost? Huh?
- Yeah. Lost your mind...

545
00:23:11,095 --> 00:23:12,775
Or did he fire your ass
out there by the elevator?

546
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,525
Okay, yeah, maybe so,
but listen, I... I...

547
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:17,655
- I just need a minute of your time.
- You need a minute?

548
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,655
- One minute. That's all I ask.
- Well, you know what, that's all you got.

549
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,065
'Cause we busy. Then, come on, Hal.

550
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,945
I mean, Jerry's a... a dream client.

551
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:25,735
He's got a great narrative.

552
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,025
He's a war hero.

553
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:28,565
A decorated war hero.

554
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:30,275
He served in World War II.

555
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,275
- He was, he was awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross... -Yeah.

556
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,375
- ...for service for his country.
- Hmm.

557
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,405
- Is that all you got?
- Man.

558
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:37,565
That's it?

559
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:40,905
- Wasn't World War II about 50 years ago?
- Yeah, man.

560
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,275
- Hal, don't nobody give a shit
except them. -That's old news, nigga.

561
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:44,695
All right. All right. How about this?

562
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:46,025
Okay, um...

563
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,275
In 1976,

564
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:52,905
Jerry was serving as a two-term mayor
in his hometown of Biloxi.

565
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:54,905
The KKK tried to organize a march...

566
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:57,735
And he stopped 'em
from buying white sheets.

567
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:59,255
(Willie and Reggie laughing)

568
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:02,405
- Shit, man.
- I guess, I guess he's supposed to be

569
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,655
- our white savior now. (laughs)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. KKK, man.

570
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,195
REGGIE:
You sound like you in love with him, man.

571
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:07,445
(laughing)

572
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,945
No, that's not my point. I'm saying we're
hopefully trying the case in Hinds County.

573
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,155
- There's a three-to-one...
- Hold-hold on. Let me stop you, Hal.

574
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,565
Now, listen, Hal, I like you--
I-I think you come from good stock--

575
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:18,155
but you got to understand
how we work here.

576
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:21,195
One, we don't do contract law.

577
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:24,155
- Two, we don't have no white clients.
- REGGIE: No.

578
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,945
And three, that ain't enough money.

579
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,775
My, not enough money.

580
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:31,065
It ain't enough money, Hal.
You know, I-I-I love you, man,

581
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:32,775
but it ain't enough money for us.

582
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:34,735
Brother, look around.
You see where you are?

583
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,985
You don't see this mahogany wood?

584
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,485
- Gold finish?
- Got to see it.

585
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,905
- Preach. Yeah.
- REGGIE: It's the big time, baby.

586
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:42,105
We doing cases for $50 million,
$30 million,

587
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:43,735
- $80 million cases monthly.
- Yeah.

588
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,155
HAL:
Okay. Okay.

589
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:48,085
But how do you know this case
can't be something bigger?

590
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,355
Well...

591
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,695
we don't know.

592
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:54,625
You know something we don't?

593
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,605
Ray Loewen happens to sit at the top

594
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,775
of one of the biggest industries
in this country.

595
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:02,945
Hmm.

596
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:06,455
I'm talking about the $20 billion a year
death care industry.

597
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:10,275
There are two huge corporations moving in
and taking over everything,

598
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,235
and the Loewen Group is one of them.

599
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:16,605
Now, what they did to Jerry
is truly terrible, but...

600
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,735
I have a feeling it's just... it's-it...

601
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,125
No. I know. It's the tip of the iceberg.

602
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,355
- Hmm.
- HAL: Can I keep going?

603
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:26,695
Sure. Shit.

604
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,735
Well, that's where you should've started.

605
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,485
You guys try all these
$80 million cases, and...

606
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,605
and you have your private jet and
all that, I get it, that's fine, but...

607
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:34,945
Yeah, I do. <i>Wings of Justice.</i>

608
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:37,525
HAL:
Great. Look, you know as well as I do

609
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:40,315
that as far as the more elite
legal community in this country goes,

610
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:42,655
you're nothing more than
a glorified ambulance chaser.

611
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,945
- No offense. -Now, Hal, now don't make me
whoop your ass now.

612
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:46,695
- Disrespectful, boy.
- What if...

613
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,235
What if, what-what if...

614
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:51,565
what if this case is the one
that puts you on the map?

615
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,315
What if this case takes you
to a nationwide level?

616
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:55,735
I'm talking, um...

617
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,655
William Kuntsler,

618
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,775
Clarence Darrow,

619
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,545
Thurgood Marshall.

620
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,655
Look, I'm talking...

621
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:09,625
I'm talking Johnnie motherfucking Cochran.

622
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,655
("Everybody Everybody"

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,315
Oh, sure. Feel free to ask me anything.
I'm all ears.

00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:29,525
Good.

685
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,315
Um, question is, uh...

686
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:34,545
how do you feel
about working with Black folk?

No, sir. You want an honest answer?

690
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,605
- I need that.
- All right.

691
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,855
Well, if you want an honest answer,

692
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:48,155
truth be told,
I suppose I am a little prejudiced.

693
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:49,275
Mm. Okay.

694
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:50,485
I'm not saying I'm proud of it
or anything.

695
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,905
- I appreciate your honesty.
- In fact, I've been working real hard

696
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:54,025
on trying to overcome it.

697
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,605
Mm. Well, then you should.

698
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:57,275

- But yes.

You good? Huh? Good, good, good.

715
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,735
For all y'all that don't know who I am,
my name is Willie Gary.

716
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,235
Tell 'em who you are.

717
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:39,405
Now, I done brought a couple of partners
of mine from my firm up here from Florida

718
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:41,155
to help y'all win this case.

719
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:44,905
And for all of y'all who are unfamiliar
with the Willie Gary style of litigation,

720
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:46,155
let me break it down to you.

721
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,065
We 'bout to go to war.

722
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,235
'Cause that's what I think litigation is.

723
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:52,025
Litigation is war.

724
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:54,275
It's a battle, a battle to the death.

725
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,155
And I'm not talking about
no bullshit, either;

726
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:59,585
I'm talking about some
Jean-Claude Van Damme ass-kicking shit.

727
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:03,085
Now I know y'all looking at me crazy,
but that's how I like to get.

728
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,655
And if we don't get crazy
with these motherfuckers,

729
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,235
I'm telling you, this Loewen Group?

730
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:09,605
They're powerful.

731
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:11,735
Got a lot of money,
got a lot of influence.

732
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,985
They have everything that we don't.

733
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:16,655
But we not gonna let them intimidate us.

734
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:18,625
'Cause I'm not intimidated.

735
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,025
Now, it ain't no secret.

736
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:24,445
For the past 12 years,
I have not lost a case.

737
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:25,855
And why is that?

738
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:27,065
Can you tell me why?

739
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:28,605
'Cause I hate to lose.

740
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:31,835
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it!

741
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,195
I'd rather somebody pull a gun on me
and blow my head off

742
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:36,205
than to lose a case.

743
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,335
Now, that being said...

744
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:43,735
...there's one thing I'm-a tell you
I'm not gonna bend on.

745
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:48,065
I do not plan on settling this case.

746
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,065
- We don't do that, no.
- MIKE: Excuse me.

747
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,565
Anyone mind if I say something here?

748
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:54,485
- Go ahead, Mike.
- Mr. Gary,

749
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,605
when it comes to the matter of settling,
I'm afraid that's not at all

750
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,405
the strategy we've developed here.

751
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:03,695
In fact, I've already drafted
a letter to Mr. Loewen

752
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,655
offering to settle at $8 million.

753
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:08,525
Though, just between us here in this room,

754
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:11,105
we'd probably be willing to drop
to seven if need be.

755
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,405
WILLIE:
Well, Mike, thank you for the update--

756
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:15,605
appreciate that--
but, unfortunately, things have changed.

757
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:17,605
We're not settling.

758
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:19,355
No matter what you said,

759
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:21,485
the discussion is still on the table

760
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:24,955
and will remain so until I've decided
what the best course is.

761
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,025
Huh.

762
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,955
Till you decided, huh?

763
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,695
What's going on here, Mike?

764
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:35,795
Hmm? Who's in charge?

765
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,815
No, seriously, who's in charge?

766
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:41,235
'Cause you done have Willie Gary
come down here to take over the case

767
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:43,315
and now here you're telling me
what you're gonna do.

768
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:46,405
I said we're not settling the case
and that comes from the lead attorney.

769
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:47,565
- Come again?
- Come again what?

770
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,155
What's the matter?
You need your ears checked or something?

771
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,485
Excuse me, sir.

772
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:52,735
- No, you're not.
- Mike, you raise a finger to me,

773
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:54,155
- you'll get your ass whupped in here.
- Boss, calm down.

774
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,695
- MIKE: Believe me, Mr. Gary, you are not
lead attorney. -AL: Come on, settle down.

775
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:57,945
- Then what am I, then?
- May I remind you

776
00:31:58,145 --> 00:31:59,565
- you are in my town...
- Your town?

777
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:01,485
- ...sitting at my conference table...
- Every town I go to, Mike, is my town.

778
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:03,155
- ...across the table from my client.
- Evidently it ain't your town,

779
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:04,945
- or they wouldn't have called me.
- JEREMIAH: Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

780
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:08,705
Gentlemen, could y'all
let the temperature down a little bit?

781
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,355
WILLIE:
I didn't come here to fight you, Mike.

782
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:15,945
- MIKE: What?
- I said, I didn't come here to fight you.

783
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,295
I came here to get a job done.

784
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,815
Now, Mr. O'Keefe...

785
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,485
Last I checked, he wants to win this case.

786
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:27,755
Not toot his ass up in the air
for a funky little $8 million.

787
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,795
Like a bitch.

788
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:35,355
MIKE:
<i>Jesus Christ, Jerry. What's going on?</i>

789
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:37,355
I think we ought to give him a chance.

790
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,775
Did you hear that speech he just gave?

791
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:40,025
He has no idea what he's doing.

792
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,315
He hasn't lost a case in 12 years.

793
00:32:42,515 --> 00:32:43,985
For personal injury cases.

794
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:46,835
He clearly has no idea about real law,
about contract law.

795
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:50,605
What about lead attorney?

796
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:52,905
You're not considering
giving him lead attorney.

797
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:54,375
Yeah.

798
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:57,125
I am.

799
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:06,525
We good?

800
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:08,775
(sighs) Yeah.

801
00:33:08,975 --> 00:33:10,405
Mike, you good?

802
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,445
All right, since we're all good,

803
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:16,655
uh, does anybody here mind, uh,
taking some dictation?

804
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:19,655
Cynthia, would you mind
taking dictation for Mr. Gary?

805
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:22,695
WILLIE:
All right, Cynthia. I sure appreciate it.

806
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:24,195
All right.

807
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,775
Address to Mr. Ray Loewen,

808
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:29,025
Chairman, Loewen Group.

809
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:31,315
Dear Mr. Loewen,
my name is Willie E. Gary.

810
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:34,195
I've just been appointed lead counsel

811
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:38,565
in the suit brought against you
by Jeremiah O'Keefe.

812
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,525
In regards to the prior settlement,

813
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:46,025
the offer you received of $8 million,

814
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:49,195
I hereby rescind that offer.

815
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:52,155
As of the date of this new letter we have,

816
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:57,735
the new offer is
in the amount of $100 million.

817
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,815
- Whoo. That's what I'm talking about.
- (scattered laughter)

818
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:01,525
Did he just say $100 million?

819
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,355
- As in eight zeros?
- $100 million.

820
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:05,355
Why don't y'all just relax?
Hear what I'm saying?

821
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:08,105
It's literally $94 million more
than our original claim.

822
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:11,065
Sounds to me like your original claim
was about $94 million short.

823
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:12,405
Uh, yeah, Mr. Gary, perhaps you could

824
00:34:12,595 --> 00:34:13,905
- help us understand...
- MIKE: $100 million?

825
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,235
It's absurd and you know it.

826
00:34:15,435 --> 00:34:17,195
What you trying to do, destroy this case?

827
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:20,485
Mike, anybody ever tell you
you got balls the size of a garden slug?

828
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:23,605
W-Willie, I'm afraid that I agree
with everybody's concerns.

829
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,655
That's a hell of a lot of money.

830
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:29,155
We throw out a number like that,
we're gonna humiliate ourselves.

831
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:30,855
WILLIE:
Listen, I understand how you feel, Jerry.

832
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:32,525
But you got to trust me, okay?

833
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:34,565
- Mm-hmm. Trust him.
- Okay?

834
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:36,275
Everybody's got to trust me.

835
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,945
- All right?
- REGGIE: Amen.

836
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:39,875
Now, Cynthia, where were we?

837
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,405
MAN:

842

- MAN: Eight zeros, did you count that?

844
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:55,235
- Eight zeros.
- There's no way that is not a joke.

845
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:57,775
- That is a joke.
- It looks like a fucking dozen eggs.

846
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:58,855
(laughter)

847
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,705
No joke.

848
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:04,235
Jesus Christ, this O'Keefe guy,
he's a piece of work, no?

849
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,065
Yeah.

850
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:08,065
Who is this clown he's hired as a lawyer?

851
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:11,155
Apparently, some guy
by the name of William Gary.

852
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:14,065
Thank you, Bob, I also read the letter.

853
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:16,235
But my question is,

854
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:17,655
who is he?

855
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:18,985
What's his story?

856
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,695
Where did O'Keefe find him?

857
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:23,195
From what we could dig up,

858
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:26,355
he's this kind of flashy
personal injury lawyer,

859
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:28,065
uh, out of Florida.

860
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:29,605
- Ambulance-chaser type.
- Personal injury?

861
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,235
This is a contract dispute.

862
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:34,235
Why the hell would he hire
a personal injury lawyer

863
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:36,235
for a contract dispute?

864
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,275
Maybe they don't have any regular lawyers

865
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:40,235
(Southern accent):
down in backwater Mississippi.

866
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:42,315
You should talk like that more.

867
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,605
Turns out, the case was filed
in some remote county

868
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:47,105
in the lower region of the state,
called Hinds County.

869
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:48,735
RAY:
Yeah? So?

870
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:51,775
So, Hinds County also happens to be

871
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:55,455
one of the poorest, and about 70%, uh...

872
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,065
...Black.

873
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:00,065
Oh.

874
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,665
So that's why he was hired.

875
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,375
Because he's Black.

876
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:09,665
Gary's Black.

877
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,195
He's an African American man.

00:38:35,305 --> 00:38:38,565
Annie, those insurance regulators
came by again the other day.

934
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:41,485
They suspended my license this time.

935
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,815
I'm gonna have to shut the business
down for a while.

936
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:46,255
What?

937
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,695
What are you talking about?

938
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,695
It's only temporary.

939
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,405
Soon as we get this trial over with,
Loewen makes his restitution,

940
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:55,275
- we gonna be up and...
- Jerry. Jerry.

941
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:56,855
You hear yourself?

942
00:38:57,055 --> 00:39:00,085
As soon as Ray Loewen makes restitution?

943
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,915
Do you really know for sure
that's even gonna happen?

944
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:12,585
I mean, you still haven't told me
how we're paying for all this.

945
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:16,945
That fancy new lawyer
you just brought in from Florida.

946
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,605
You don't have to worry about him.

947
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:21,815
(soft chuckle)

948
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:27,065
Well, I just don't understand why you're
continuing with this ridiculous lawsuit.

949
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,155
You can find another buyer

950
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:30,905
for those three homes.

951
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:32,505
You know that.

952
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:35,525
Clearly, this is about
something else for you.

953
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:36,855
Maybe it is.

954
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:39,105
Maybe I just don't want
to see him get away with it.

955
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,705
Who? Ray Loewen?

956
00:39:42,835 --> 00:39:45,155
My God, Jerry.

957
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:49,195
What is your obsession with this man?

958
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:51,445
What do you expect me to do, Annie,

959
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:53,985
just lay back
and let him walk all over me?

960
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:57,445
Let him walk all over our family?

961
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,775
What I expect you to do

962
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:03,275
is to think of me,

963
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:04,855
at some point.

964
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:06,275
Hmm.

965
00:40:06,475 --> 00:40:09,375
You don't think we can win.

966
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,905
If you want to know how I'm paying for it,

967
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,955
I took out a third mortgage on this house.

968
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:28,415
(indistinct chatter)

969
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:31,085
How you doing?

970
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:34,455
JEREMIAH: Tell me, Willie,
how'd you wind up being a lawyer?

971
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,255
Mm. (chuckles)

972
00:40:38,415 --> 00:40:39,985
Well, that depends.

973
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:43,485
You want the, um, long or the short story?

974
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:44,945
That's up to you.

975
00:40:45,145 --> 00:40:46,655
- (chuckles)
- Well,

976
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,235
when I was a young husband,

977
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:51,655
young father,

978
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:53,445
me and my wife, we had,
you know, we had a little money,

979
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,605
so we had a little landscaping business.

980
00:40:55,805 --> 00:40:57,485
Real nice, too.

981
00:40:57,685 --> 00:41:00,105
You know, kept-kept all the yards...

982
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,855
fantastic.

983
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:03,775
But then my wife was like,
"You know what?

984
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,195
I want to move into a bigger place."

985
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:06,855
I said, "Well, all right.
Let's do that, then."

986
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,775
And so... (inhales)

987
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:10,905
...got the paper, saw this ad.

988
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:14,565
Three-bedroom apartment, man.
Real nice.

989
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,855
Uh, nice new complex.

990
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:20,195
Over there in a white neighborhood
at, uh, Raintree.

991
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,315
So I said, "Yeah, that's what,
that's what we need."

992
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,065
So I called the owner, I said, "Hey, man.

993
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:27,525
"Me and my family are looking
for a new place.

994
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:29,235
We want to come to where you are."

995
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:31,315
I said, "Do you have any vacancies?"

996
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:34,105
And he says, "Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I got plenty of vacancies, you know?

997
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:37,155
"Matter of fact, uh, at the end
of the month, you can move in.

998
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:38,315
Get your lease."

999
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,155
We all looking forward to that day, man.

1000
00:41:40,345 --> 00:41:41,485
I mean, we just excited.

1001
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:43,565
You know, just brand-new beginnings,
if you would.

1002
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:45,195
So when the day comes,

1003
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:46,605
I pack everybody in the car.

1004
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,065
I got the-the-the, the boys in there,

1005
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,815
I got my-my wife,
I even got my dog in there, man.

1006
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:54,315
And we just happy, man. We happy.

1007
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,525
Uh, and we listening to gospel music.

1008
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,485
You know, singing, rocking and rolling.

1009
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,025
(sighs)

1010
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,855
But, um...

1011
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:05,025
when we get there, guy comes out.

1012
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:07,025
I said, "How you doing?" He barely speaks.

1013
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,525
He says, "What do you need?"

1014
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,155
I said, "I'm the one that, uh,
called you about the vacancies."

1015
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:11,945
He said, "What vacancies?"

1016
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:15,985
I said, "I'm Willie Gary.
I called you about the... the vacancies."

1017
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:17,775
He says, "Oh.

1018
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:19,755
We don't have no more vacancies."

1019
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,665
What'd you do?

1020
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:27,455
Tell you what I wanted to do.

1021
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:30,505
Wanted to hurt him.

1022
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:32,985
I mean...

1023
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:35,795
disrespecting me like that
in front of my boys, man.

1024
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,815
My boys look up to me.

1025
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,235
I'm their everything.

1026
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:41,655
What-what do I tell 'em?

1027
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:43,105
That...

1028
00:42:43,305 --> 00:42:45,665
they daddy ain't good enough
to be in an apartment?

1029
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:48,875
What I tell my queen?

1030
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,505
That we not good enough?

1031
00:42:56,665 --> 00:42:59,445
But I didn't act out.

1032
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:01,485
What I did was,

1033
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:03,315
I went back to that hotel,

1034
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,525
and I opened up the phone book.

1035
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:08,815
Now, I hadn't even thought about
being a lawyer until this happened.

1036
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:10,405
I opened it up and I...

1037
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:13,165
First law school I saw,
I said, "Mm. I'm going right there."

1038
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:15,405
And I did it.

1039
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,195
I enrolled, worked hard,

1040
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,835
I graduated, I passed the bar.

1041
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:22,125
And I got my own practice.

1042
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,275
And the first thing I did was

1043
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:27,775
went down to Raintree Apartments

1044
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:32,855
and bitch-slapped him with a five-count
discriminatory practices lawsuit.

1045
00:43:33,055 --> 00:43:35,275
(chuckles)

1046
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:38,065
Take that for your vacancies.

1047
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,335
You a fighter.

1048
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,985
Yeah.

1049
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,525
Oh, I'm a fighter.

1050
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:46,695
You are, too, Jerry.
You're a fighter, man.

1051
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:48,355
You know why I say you're a fighter?

1052
00:43:48,555 --> 00:43:52,275
Going up against
this big Loewen Group, man--

1053
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,655
small business owner, man,
that's something, doc.

1054
00:43:54,845 --> 00:43:56,445
That's why we connect.

1055
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:58,415
What made you want to do it?

1056
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:03,985
'Cause he tried to mess with the one thing
that means the most to me in life:

1057
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,695
being able to leave something behind
for my children

1058
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,165
and my grandchildren when I go.

1059
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:12,455
They have a legacy, Willie.

1060
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,125
And I do mean to pass it on to 'em.

1061
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:22,905
- Let's play some music.
- I like music, Willie.

1062
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,275
(laughs) Good.

1063
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:26,445
Steve, look, why don't you go up there
and turn on some music?

1064
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:29,065
Sure thing, boss.
Anything particular you want to hear?

1065
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:31,355
You know what my jam is, man.
Tony! Toni! Toné!

1066
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:33,355
- Wise choice, my brother.
- I like that. Like that.

1067
00:44:33,555 --> 00:44:34,905
You know what's crazy about
Tony! Toni! Toné!?

1068
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:37,025
Ain't none of 'em named Tony. (laughs)

Welcome to Hotel Intercontinental.

1089
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:15,235
Well, thank you. I have a reservation
for Gary, Willie Gary.

1090
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:16,815
Absolutely.

1091
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,525
- And welcome to Jackson, Mr. Gary.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

1092
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:20,315
If you have a credit card
you'd like me to run,

1093
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,195
I can go ahead and get you all settled in.

1094
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:23,525
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1095
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:26,315
Hey, hey, so don't look now, but that's,
over there, that's Loewen's legal team.

1096
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,565
Where-where's that? Hmm.

1097
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:31,605
(indistinct conversation)

1098
00:45:31,805 --> 00:45:33,775
HAL:
Jesus Christ.

1099
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:36,815
It's like a who's who of every prominent
Black lawyer in the country.

1100
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:38,525
You actually recognize all of them?

1101
00:45:38,725 --> 00:45:41,195
HAL: Okay, so, that guy over there,
that's Howard Pfieffer.

1102
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:43,445
- Mm.
- He's a former state representative

1103
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:46,155
- and current president
of the DC bar association. -Mm.

1104
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:48,485
That gentleman there,
that's Richard Mayfield.

1105
00:45:48,685 --> 00:45:50,655
He's one of the leading experts
on antitrust

1106
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:52,775
and complex business litigation.

1107
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:55,775
And that gentleman, right over there,
that-that's Walter Bell.

1108
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:58,065
He's a former
Supreme Court Justice of Mississippi.

1109
00:45:58,265 --> 00:45:59,445
Fuck.

1110
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:01,605
Man, Loewen must have spent
a fortune on these dudes.

1111
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:04,025
You know what? She don't actually look
as bad as I thought she was gonna look.

1112
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:06,565
What's her name?
Uh, uh, Mammy, May, Mame?

1113
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:07,855
Mammy, Mammy Downes?

1114
00:46:08,055 --> 00:46:09,815
- Seriously? Is that all you have to say?
- Yeah.

1115
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:12,505
That's all I got to say
'cause they all look like chumps to me.

1116
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,025
Matter of fact, could you do me a favor?

1117
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:18,695
Could you send your finest bottle of, uh,
champagne over there to that table?

1118
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:20,485
Certainly. Do you have a preference?

1119
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:22,815
- What you got?
- We have Dom, Moët,

1120
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:24,065
- Cristal...
- Cristal.

1121
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:25,195
- Cristal.
- That's what we need.

1122
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:26,315
Send some Cristal over there.

1123
00:46:26,515 --> 00:46:29,235
Make sure that you say that it's, uh,
compliments of Mr. Willie Gary.

1124
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:30,985
Hey. Seriously, man?

1125
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:33,025
- Please don't do that.
- Oh, seriously, Hal.

1126
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:34,525
- Shut up.
- Uh...

1127
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,605
Listen, I always say this:

1128
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:39,815
You see me fighting a bear?
Pour honey on me.

1129
00:46:40,015 --> 00:46:42,605
We're just gonna pour a little honey.

1130
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:44,195
(horn honking in distance)

1131
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:46,105
WENDELL:
<i>Well, we keep the strategy simple.</i>

1132
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,405
<i>Firmly cementing</i>
<i>the validity of the document</i>

1133
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:50,565
as a contract in the jury's mind.

1134
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:52,775
That's definitely gonna be
the defense strategy, too.

1135
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:55,275
Except they'll be focused on proving
how it's not a contract.

1136
00:46:55,475 --> 00:46:56,775
Okay, look,
we got to be honest about this.

1137
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:58,985
They're likely gonna be
a lot better at this than we are,

1138
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:01,525
considering this is
their area of expertise.

1139
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:05,195
REGGIE: I-I say we just forget
about all that contract mumbo jumbo.

1140
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:07,815
Bog the jury down
with a whole bunch of information

1141
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:08,945
that we know they ain't interested in.

1142
00:47:09,145 --> 00:47:10,985
CHRIS:
Personally, what I think we gotta do--

1143
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:12,735
what we gotta prove, rather--

1144
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:14,155
is motive.

1145
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:16,195
We center our argument
squarely on the issue

1146
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:18,695
of Loewen Group stalling on closing.

1147
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:20,315
And show what they had to gain from it.

1148
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:22,945
- Uh, I'm not so sure.
- What? What, Hal?

1149
00:47:23,145 --> 00:47:24,445
- What-what you ain't sure about?
- DASHAAN: What? Hal?

1150
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:26,155
HAL: What I mean is,
I'm not so sure we can actually prove

1151
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:28,355
that the Loewen Group had motive.

1152
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:30,605
Right? Unless we have
some kind of internal company memo.

1153
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,985
Or someone just openly admits it.

1154
00:47:33,185 --> 00:47:34,945
Like, how do you actually prove

1155
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:36,775
that the stalling was intentional?

1156
00:47:36,975 --> 00:47:39,955
Well, we're obviously never
going to be able to prove that.

1157
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:45,735
Truth is, we don't have a snowball's
chance in hell of winning this case.

00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,565
Where you leaning?

1241
00:50:57,765 --> 00:51:00,315
Is... is he innocent? Or is he guilty?

1242
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:02,235
Doesn't matter.

1243
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,905
'Cause O.J.'s not the one
that's on trial right now.

1244
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,065
White frontier justice,

1245
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:08,945
- that's what's on trial.
- Mm.

1246
00:51:09,145 --> 00:51:11,195
I hear that.

1247
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:12,905
Gun to your head, though.

1248
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:14,315
- Gun to my head?
- Gun to your head.

1249
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:15,565
- I don't know now.
- Gun to your head,

1250
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:17,565
- Ms. Downes, gun to your head.
- Come on, trying to put a gun to my head.

1251
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:18,945
- Does anyone hear this?
- Got a gun... gun to your head now.

1252
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:20,695
Oh, hell nah.

1253
00:51:20,895 --> 00:51:22,605
Opportunity to be the lead counsel
on the defense

1254
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,065
or a opportunity to be
the lead prosecutor,

1255
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,105
which one do you choose?

1256
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:29,105
Oh, that's... that's a tricky one.

1257
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:31,085
- Yeah, I know. It's tough, it's tough.
- Defense.

1258
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,065
His ass is guilty.

1259
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:37,355
And I've never defended someone
who I knew was guilty before.

1260
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:39,355
You know what they say:

1261
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,445
Lawyer's got to try that at least once.

1262
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:42,985
Remember these words:

1263
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:44,855
- if it doesn't fit...
- WILLIE: Hmm.

1264
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:46,485
...you must acquit.

1265
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:48,695
(Cochran continues indistinctly)

1266
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:49,905
Prosecution.

1267
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,195
(laughs) Yeah?

1268
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:53,315
I have this reoccurring dream

1269
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:55,655
that I'm prosecuting a case

1270
00:51:55,845 --> 00:51:59,065
against that slick-ass Johnnie Cochran.

1271
00:51:59,265 --> 00:52:01,235
- (chuckles) Mm.
- Him in all them fancy suits and shit...

1272
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:03,525
Okay. Well, how does this dream end?

1273
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:05,625
I wipe the floor with him.

1274
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,735
- (laughs)
- I wipe the floor with his ass.

1275
00:52:08,935 --> 00:52:10,835
(both laughing)

1276
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:13,105
Oh.

1277
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:14,565
Let me get that.

1278
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:15,915
Oh, absolutely not.

1279
00:52:17,415 --> 00:52:19,485
You were so, uh,

1280
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:22,485
you were so kind and generous to send me

1281
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:23,775
a bottle of...

1282
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,295
- What was that called?
- Cristal.

1283
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:28,945
Allow me to return the favor,
just this once.

1284
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,605
(chuckles)
Although, I wouldn't get too used

1285
00:52:31,805 --> 00:52:34,255
to me being kind to you, Mr. Gary.

1286
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:38,155
Once we begin that... trial...

1287
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,085
nigga, I will destroy you.

1288
00:52:42,795 --> 00:52:44,455

circuit county judge
for the First Judicial District

1331

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

How y'all doing?

1334
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,695
Thank you for being here.

1335
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:49,195
This case here is really about
the oldest sin known to man.

1336
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:50,405
MAME:
<i>Contracts.</i>

1337
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:51,945
Plain and simple.

1338
00:54:52,145 --> 00:54:54,445
Now, Mr. Gary would have you believe

1339
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,275
that this case is about...

1340
00:54:56,475 --> 00:54:57,565
- Greed.
<i>- And while that sounds,</i>

1341
00:54:57,765 --> 00:55:01,655
uh, entertaining and a bit dramatic...

1342
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:03,855
We know for a fact
that the deal had already been approved

1343
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:05,315
by Loewen and his board.

1344
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,485
They crafted every single aspect,
outlined it,

1345
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:10,085
and put it down in writing.

1346
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,315
That's a contract.

1347
00:55:11,515 --> 00:55:13,525
How can it be a binding contract

1348
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:14,855
between two parties

1349
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:17,275
if one of the parties
didn't sign the contract?

1350
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:19,415
Y'all, these people lie.

1351
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:23,445
That's what it boils down to.

1352
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:27,355
So why did Mr. O'Keefe
have such a-a-a panic,

1353
00:55:27,555 --> 00:55:29,525
such an urgency,

1354
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,355
such a desperation

1355
00:55:31,555 --> 00:55:33,315
for this deal to close?

1356
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:34,905
Why?

1357
00:55:35,095 --> 00:55:38,195
Well, because everything in his life

1358
00:55:38,395 --> 00:55:39,855
hinged on this deal.

1359
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:41,405
Everything.

1360
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:43,195
For the Loewen Group, not so much.

1361
00:55:43,395 --> 00:55:45,835
They had one goal in mind.

1362
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:48,625
Stall him out.

1363
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:51,255
Stall him out.

1364
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:53,815
It wasn't personal.

1365
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,565
He just got impatient.

1366
00:55:55,765 --> 00:55:57,415
(whispering)

1367
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:02,205
<i>(bell tolling)</i>

1368
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:07,105

1369
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,775
MAN:
<i>In fact, there is such a thing</i>

1370
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:14,525
uh, as an anticipatory breach of contract.

1371
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:16,275
And this is when,

1372
00:56:16,475 --> 00:56:19,985
though the actual breach
has not yet occurred,

1373
00:56:20,185 --> 00:56:22,275
one of the involved parties,

1374
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:27,195
heretofore referred to
as the "soon to be breaching party,"

1375
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:29,445
will not fulfill their obligations

1376
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:32,905
set forth by the terms of the agreement.

1377
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,985
When a situation like this arises,

1378
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,405
- it is my opinion that...
- (sighs)

1379
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:44,985
...it is well within the means of dispute

1380
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,815
for this contract.

1381
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:47,905
- Wake your ass up!
- Whoa!

1382
00:56:48,095 --> 00:56:48,985
- Whoa.
- Jesus Christ.

1383
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:50,275
Wake up!

1384
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,815
What are we doing?
We sit up in these books,

1385
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:53,905
talking about contracts every single day.

1386
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:55,235
For what?

1387
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:57,775
We putting 'em to sleep.

1388
00:56:57,975 --> 00:57:00,405
We done lost our connection,
lost our edge.

1389
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:02,625
And what do I get from y'all? Nothing.

1390
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:06,755
I gotta make the decision.

1391
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:08,695
I'm-a put Jerry on.

1392
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:10,485
(overlapping arguing)

1393
00:57:10,685 --> 00:57:12,445
- No, no, no.
- You can't do that.

1394
00:57:12,645 --> 00:57:14,065
- WILLIE: We put him on next week.
- (overlapping arguing)

1395
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,815
WILLIE: You hard of hearing?
I'm putting him on.

1396
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,855
We got to shake it up.
And plus, he's a great witness.

1397
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:21,065
You said it yourself. He's a good witness,
he's honest, he's-he's-he's,

1398
00:57:21,265 --> 00:57:22,655

having just listened to the testimony
you gave,

1456
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:58,405
I think it's fair to say
that the real, material substance

1457
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,235
centered on character.
Would you agree?

1458

Yes. I-I agree.

1459
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:06,815
I couldn't hear that. Can you speak up?

01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:15,605
The overall insinuation
being made is that,

1464
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,905
while you are a man of honor,

1465
01:00:18,095 --> 01:00:20,605
of strong moral principles,

1466
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:24,005
according to you, my client is not.

1467
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:28,605
I think Mr. Loewen and I have
very different approaches to--

as to how to deal with people in business.

Ah. "In business."

1470

How did you end up needing to sell
those funeral homes to Mr. Loewen?

1473
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:45,195
Well, I had run into a little bit
of financial trouble.

1474
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:47,585
What kind of financial trouble?

1475
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,355
Huh?

1476
01:00:52,555 --> 01:00:55,195
Because I'm, uh, pretty sure

1477
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:59,695
the actual reason you so desperately
needed to sell at the time that you did

1478
01:00:59,895 --> 01:01:02,815
is because the Mississippi
state insurance commission

1479
01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:04,735
was about to revoke your license.

1480
01:01:04,935 --> 01:01:05,945
Is that correct?

1481
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:08,155
As a matter of fact, your license

1482
01:01:08,345 --> 01:01:11,195
to sell insurance
in the state of Mississippi

1483

is currently under suspension.

1484

that is a true statement,

That's not fair, Jerry.

I'm gonna replace you as lead attorney.

1632
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:57,755
would you be willing to testify?

MIKE:
That's fine. That's just fine.

1637
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,695
Mrs. McGrath, would you mind telling us

1638
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:19,405
how long you worked as an employee

1639
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,525
for the Durbin and Sons Funeral Home
in Southaven, Mississippi?

1640
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:24,565
LORRAINE:
Um, I worked at that funeral home

1641
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,945
for about 13 years before I quit.

1642
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,355
MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

1643
01:08:28,555 --> 01:08:32,445
And did you witness any transfer
of ownership during this time period?

1644
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:33,815
LORRAINE:
Um...

1645
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,485
(clears throat)

1646
01:08:35,685 --> 01:08:39,315
Uh, uh, Durbin and Sons was bought
by the Loewen Group

1647
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,025
sometime around 1990.

1648
01:08:42,225 --> 01:08:44,255
And I was there during that time.

1649
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,735
And did you notice any changes

1650
01:08:47,935 --> 01:08:49,655
in the way the company was run

1651
01:08:49,845 --> 01:08:52,405
after the Loewen Group took over?

1652
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,025
Uh, the most significant was, uh,

1653
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:56,655
how they implemented this,

1654
01:08:56,845 --> 01:09:00,905
this policy of-of raising prices
on certain items

1655
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,585
in areas where they, uh,
didn't have any, any competition.

1656
01:09:06,045 --> 01:09:08,985
Mostly, this turned out to be, um,

1657
01:09:09,185 --> 01:09:14,105
poor areas,
where there was a lot of-of poverty.

1658
01:09:14,305 --> 01:09:18,045
Could you give us an example
of this type of selective pricing?

1659
01:09:19,085 --> 01:09:23,315
There was this one, uh,
casket in particular I remember.

1660
01:09:23,515 --> 01:09:26,355
The, um, the Wilbert Copper Trubune.

1661
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:31,815
It, uh, was supposed to retail for $750.

1662
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:35,065
Uh, which it did in-in some places,

1663
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:36,985
like, say, Madison.

1664
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:40,735
Uh, but then in other places,
like Corinth,

1665
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:43,485
which, as you know, is-is very poor...

1666
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:44,775
Yes, of course.

1667
01:09:44,975 --> 01:09:48,355
Over there, they hiked the price up
to something crazy.

1668
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:51,545
Like three times
what it was supposed to cost.

1669
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:53,755
Just because they could.

1670
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:57,445
They knew customers didn't have
anywhere else to go.

1671
01:09:57,645 --> 01:09:59,445
So, basically,

1672
01:09:59,645 --> 01:10:02,445
if I understand you,

1673
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:07,065
the Loewen Group was involved in
a form of selective price gouging.

1674
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:08,525
Of what?

1675
01:10:08,725 --> 01:10:11,485

All right, then.

Let me ask you this.

1680
01:10:18,435 --> 01:10:21,445
In your time at Durbin and Sons,
were you ever left

1681

with the impression that the Loewen Group

1682
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:26,695
might have been specifically targeting

1683
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,105
- minority communities...
- MAME: Objection.

1684
01:10:28,305 --> 01:10:29,735
- Your Honor.
- Wow! Really?

1685
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:31,905
- My God.
- MAME: Speculation.

1686
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:35,445
Mr. Allred, what is the basis
for this line of questioning?

1687
01:10:35,645 --> 01:10:37,485
Mr. Allred?

1688
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:39,485
You know what?

1689
01:10:39,685 --> 01:10:40,985
I apologize.

1690
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:44,695
No basis. It was just speculation, is all.

1691
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:47,415
Please, consider it stricken.

1692
01:10:48,795 --> 01:10:51,775
But Your Honor, I do take exception
to Ms. Downes' tone.

1693
01:10:51,975 --> 01:10:53,945

and, uh, I just want to say I'm sorry,
and I...

1708
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:42,155
I apologize.

1709
01:11:42,345 --> 01:11:43,945
Very well.

1710
01:11:44,145 --> 01:11:46,085
Apology accepted.

1711
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:51,665
Good. We got that over.

1712
01:11:53,665 --> 01:11:56,665
Is this the first time
you ever apologized to somebody like that?

1713
01:11:57,255 --> 01:11:58,565
Mm.

1714
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:01,025
Huh. Be honest with you, my wife, uh,

1715
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:03,205
- she helped me with the phrasing.
- Mm-hmm.

1716
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:08,485
Well, she did a very nice job.
I want you to thank her for me.

1717
01:12:08,685 --> 01:12:10,165
All right.

1718
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:17,755
(siren wails in distance)

1719
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:22,445
And you know what I can't stand
about that man?

1720
01:12:22,645 --> 01:12:23,525
What?

1721
01:12:23,725 --> 01:12:27,025
(overlapping chatter)

1722
01:12:27,225 --> 01:12:29,045
- His face.
- (laughter)

1723
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,275
(laughter)

1724
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,315
I know what you mean. It's, uh...

1725
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:36,565
You know what I'm talking about.

1726
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:37,985
...in the expression.

1727
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:39,315
- Mm-hmm.
- RICHARD: No,

1728
01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:42,155
it's generation upon generation
of white entitlement

1729
01:12:42,345 --> 01:12:45,905
<i>and privilege all encapsulated</i>
<i>in one, single,</i>

1730
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,525
simpering grin.

1731
01:12:47,725 --> 01:12:48,775
(laughter)

1732
01:12:48,975 --> 01:12:50,945
But him with that woman on stand today,

1733
01:12:51,145 --> 01:12:53,065
posturing and pretending like

1734
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:55,945
he's some sort of
savior for our people... Ooh!

1735
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:58,105
- (laughs)
- RICHARD<i>: Unfortunately,</i>

1736
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:00,335
the jury did seem to eat it up.

1737
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,585
(sighs)
Yeah. That is a problem, isn't it?

1738
01:13:12,915 --> 01:13:15,155
Didn't I see his name

1739
01:13:15,345 --> 01:13:17,655
on the witness list at some point?

1740
01:13:17,845 --> 01:13:20,695
WALTER:
Supposedly, Gary was planning on

1741
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,705
calling him a...

1742
01:13:25,755 --> 01:13:30,065
Calling him as a material witness to
the agreement between O'Keefe and Loewen.

1743
01:13:30,265 --> 01:13:34,605
Which means I will have him on cross.

1744
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:37,875
Which means
you're gonna have him on cross.

1745
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:43,455
(printer whirring)

1746
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:59,065
PETER: Hey, have any of you guys
read about this deal

1747
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:01,485
that the Loewen Group made
with something called

1748
01:14:01,685 --> 01:14:03,565
the "National Baptist Convention"?

1749
01:14:03,765 --> 01:14:05,655
The National Baptist Convention?

1750
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:07,695
What... What is that?

1751
01:14:07,895 --> 01:14:10,315
It's like, um, you know, like...

1752
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:11,905
an arm of the Black church.

1753
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,735
But a really big one.

1754
01:14:13,935 --> 01:14:15,945
Probably the biggest, actually.

1755
01:14:16,145 --> 01:14:17,605
Sorry, did you-- did you just say

1756
01:14:17,805 --> 01:14:20,355
that the Loewen Group has a deal
with the Black church?

1757
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:24,105
The, uh, National Baptist Convention.
But yeah.

1758
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:27,105
Yeah, how? How does that make any sense?

1759
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:28,735
I don't know.

1760
01:14:28,935 --> 01:14:30,755
But it's all right here.

1761
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:34,855
Apparently, they created
some sort of partnership

1762
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:36,655
about a year ago.

1763
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:38,625
Hard to say why, though.

1764
01:14:42,455 --> 01:14:44,835
Okay, can you get me
some more information about this?

1765
01:14:45,835 --> 01:14:47,065
PETER:
Yes, sir.

1766
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,815
GRAVES: Are the plaintiffs ready
to call their next witness?

1767
01:14:50,015 --> 01:14:52,985
REGGIE: Yes.
Actually, Your Honor, we'd like to call

1768
01:14:53,185 --> 01:14:56,565
Mr. O'Keefe's longtime attorney,
Michael Allred, to the stand.

1769
01:14:56,765 --> 01:14:57,985
MAME:
Your Honor.

1770
01:14:58,185 --> 01:15:00,405
Seriously?

1771
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,605
Where are you going with this,
Mr. Douglas?

1772
01:15:02,805 --> 01:15:05,485
Your Honor, we-we recognize
how this might seem a little unusual.

1773
01:15:05,685 --> 01:15:08,985
However, Mr. Allred was with Mr. O'Keefe,

1774
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:12,025
as his attorney, the entire time
he was dealing with Loewen.

1775
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:14,505
And, uh, we feel like his-his testimony
will be essential.

1776
01:15:19,585 --> 01:15:21,775
REGGIE:
Michael Allred.

1777
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,985
Oh, hell, we friends. I'm-a call you Mike.

1778
01:15:24,185 --> 01:15:26,105
- You bet, Reggie.
- (chuckles)

1779
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:28,155
So, Mike,

1780
01:15:28,345 --> 01:15:31,235
in your 30 years of practicing law,

1781
01:15:31,435 --> 01:15:33,985
specializing in contract law,

1782
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:37,315
did it ever occur to you,
when you were drawing up the contract

1783
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:40,525
between Mr. O'Keefe and Mr. Loewen,
that there could be

1784
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:44,195
any kind of misunderstanding as to what
that document actually was?

1785
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:45,655
MIKE:
No, sir.

1786
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:48,315
It was extremely clear to everyone
exactly what it was.

1787
01:15:48,515 --> 01:15:49,855
It was a contract.

1788
01:15:50,055 --> 01:15:52,065
Contract. It's a contract.

1789
01:15:52,265 --> 01:15:54,655
Now, was there anything that suggested,
in the language,

1790
01:15:54,845 --> 01:15:57,355
that the, uh,
agreed-upon time for the deal to close

1791
01:15:57,555 --> 01:15:59,855
would be... open-ended?

1792
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,875
How's it feel to be sitting in that chair?

1793
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:07,085
- It's a little uncomfortable, yeah.
- MAME: Mm.

1794
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,915
Imagine, we haven't even
gotten started yet.

1795
01:16:14,915 --> 01:16:18,695
You've been Mr. O'Keefe's attorney
quite some time now, yes?

1796
01:16:18,895 --> 01:16:20,275
MIKE:
I have.

1797
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,985
For 30 years-- nearly 30 years.

1798
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:23,195
MAME:
Mm.

1799
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,375
And would you say you
and Mr. O'Keefe are good friends?

1800
01:16:26,455 --> 01:16:28,025
- Sure. He's one of my closest friends.
- Hmm.

1801
01:16:28,225 --> 01:16:30,235
Yeah, we share a lot in common.

1802
01:16:30,435 --> 01:16:32,085
I admire him.

1803
01:16:38,005 --> 01:16:39,905
Mr. Allred, would you say
this is a case about race?

1804
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,065
- (quietly): Objection. Objection.
- Objection.

1805
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,335
Overruled.

1806
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,105
Would I say this is a case about race?

1807
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:49,735
No, I would not say
this is a case about race.

1808
01:16:49,935 --> 01:16:51,195
(exhales)

1809
01:16:51,395 --> 01:16:52,955
Really?

1810
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:58,735
Okay, well, the subject of race does seem
to keep coming up, doesn't it?

1811
01:16:58,935 --> 01:17:00,775
Almost exclusively from your side.

1812
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:04,445
Uh, for instance,
this whole heroic narrative

1813
01:17:04,645 --> 01:17:08,775
about, uh, Mr. O'Keefe supposedly
having some sort of civil rights record

1814
01:17:08,975 --> 01:17:11,905
and denying the KKK a permit...

1815
01:17:12,095 --> 01:17:15,025
Uh, explain to me what relevance that has
to a case about contracts.

1816
01:17:15,225 --> 01:17:17,565
Uh, about Jerry's character.

1817
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:19,065
It's more about his integrity

1818
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,525
- and his decency.
- MAME: 'Cause he does

1819
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:21,605
such great things for Black people, huh?

1820
01:17:21,805 --> 01:17:23,565
- Object-Objection.
- REGGIE: Objection, Your Honor.

1821
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:24,815
- WILLIE: Stand up.
- Objection. I'm not standing up.

1822
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:25,945
- I said "objection."
- GRAVES: I will not allow

1823
01:17:26,145 --> 01:17:27,235
this line of questioning, Ms. Downes.

1824
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:28,315
- Sustained.
- REGGIE: I'm-I'm objecting.

1825
01:17:28,515 --> 01:17:31,405
MAME: Another thing that has been
made quite clear in this case is

1826
01:17:31,595 --> 01:17:34,405
how important family, family legacy,

1827
01:17:34,595 --> 01:17:36,235
is to Mr. O'Keefe.

1828
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:38,025
Is that something you share?

1829
01:17:38,225 --> 01:17:39,815
Family important to you as well?

1830
01:17:40,015 --> 01:17:42,565
Well, it's not just important to me,
it's everything to me.

1831
01:17:42,765 --> 01:17:45,275
It's everything. Well, that's something
you and Mr. O'Keefe have in common.

1832
01:17:45,475 --> 01:17:46,405
- Objection.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1833
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,025
- (arguing over each other)
- MAME: Because you're best friends, yeah?

1834
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:50,025
GRAVES: Overruled.
The witness can answer the question,

1835
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:51,355
but let's try and get to the point.

1836
01:17:51,555 --> 01:17:53,655
Absolutely, it's something
that we share in common.

1837
01:17:53,845 --> 01:17:55,815
I-Is this really what you want
to be asking me, Ms. Downes?

1838
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:57,525
It is.

1839
01:17:57,725 --> 01:17:58,735
Actually.

1840
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:00,125
But thank you.

1841
01:18:01,205 --> 01:18:02,525
You love your family.

1842
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:03,655
Yeah?

1843
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,355
Your extended family,
your immediate family--

1844
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:08,105
you love all of your family, yes?

1845
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:09,405
Every member of my family.

1846
01:18:09,595 --> 01:18:10,545
MAME:
Yeah?

1847
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:16,025
So, there-there's no one
that you secretly wish you could disown?

1848
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,315
- MAME: Someone that you're maybe
- Objection, Your Honor.

1849
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:18,735
- a little ashamed...
- It doesn't matter what he feels.

1850
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:19,985
- MIKE: Disown?
- She doesn't know what...

1851
01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:21,945
'Cause I know I have some family members
I would love to disown.

1852
01:18:22,145 --> 01:18:23,485
- But you don't.
- REGGIE: I'm-a take care of this.

1853
01:18:23,685 --> 01:18:24,565
- MIKE: No.
- No? You don't.

1854
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:25,775
No.

1855
01:18:25,975 --> 01:18:27,775
Say, for instance, your grandfather.

1856
01:18:27,975 --> 01:18:29,815
- My grandfather.
- MAME: Yes.

1857
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,625
Your grandfather.

1858
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:41,085
He was my grandfather.
What does that have to do with this case?

1859
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:47,235
Remind me:

1860
01:18:47,435 --> 01:18:50,205
how long was your grandfather
a member of the Ku Klux Klan?

1861
01:18:53,665 --> 01:18:54,605
(gallery murmuring)

1862
01:18:54,805 --> 01:18:55,985
- Objection. Objection.
- Objection. Objection.

1863
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:57,105
- Objection.
- (gavel pounding)

1864
01:18:57,305 --> 01:18:58,605
- We gonna stop this right now.
- WILLIE: Your Honor, I am gonna continue

1865
01:18:58,805 --> 01:18:59,815
- to say "objection."
- This is wrong.

1866
01:19:00,015 --> 01:19:00,905
- Objection.
- (gavel pounding)

1867

Objection. Objection.

1868
01:19:02,645 --> 01:19:04,525
- Did you bond with your grandfather
- (Willie continues)

1869
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:06,355
about the KKK?

1870
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:07,445
- Did you share some bond?
- What is the question?

1871
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:09,315
- What is the question?
- Did you share some love

1872
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,105
about the burning cross?

1873
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:14,405
You go to any, uh, KKK rallies
with your grandfather,

1874
01:19:14,595 --> 01:19:15,695
- Mr. Allred?
- WILLIE: Now, you know

1875
01:19:15,895 --> 01:19:17,815
this is out of line,
it has nothing to do with this case.

1876
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,025
Objection.

1877
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:20,195
- Overruled, Mr. Gary.
- How can you overrule that?

1878
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:21,315
Answer the question, Mr. Allred.

1879
01:19:21,515 --> 01:19:23,275
With all due respect, Your Honor,
this has nothing to do with the case.

1880
01:19:23,475 --> 01:19:25,195
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?

1881
01:19:25,395 --> 01:19:28,695
Are you asking me was I aware that my
grandfather was once a member of the KKK?

1882
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:30,985
Mike, you don't have
to answer that question.

1883
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:32,355
Objection.

1884
01:19:32,555 --> 01:19:34,405
I heard you the first time, Mr. Gary.

1885
01:19:34,595 --> 01:19:35,945
Yes, I was asking that question.

1886
01:19:36,145 --> 01:19:37,235
I am no longer asking that question.

1887
01:19:37,435 --> 01:19:38,905
- No further questions.
- (gavel pounds)

1888
01:19:39,095 --> 01:19:41,445
- WILLIE: What his grandfather has done...
- MIKE: You know, lawyer to lawyer,

1889
01:19:41,645 --> 01:19:43,235
that was completely out of line,
Ms. Downes.

1890
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:44,905
Oh, the hypocrisy.

1891
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,405
The hypocrisy.

1892
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:49,235
- It's quite outrageous, Your Honor.
- (whispering)

REGGIE:
Room full of brothers right now.

1894
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:53,695
- Denounce your granddaddy.
- CHRIS: Yeah.

1895
01:19:53,895 --> 01:19:56,155
Say it, Mike. Say it.

1896
01:19:56,345 --> 01:19:58,105
Go on. It's easy.

1897
01:19:58,305 --> 01:19:59,605
- Come on, Mike. Denounce him.
- Yeah.

1898
01:19:59,805 --> 01:20:01,025
You know what?

1899
01:20:01,225 --> 01:20:02,315
I'm sorry.

1900
01:20:02,515 --> 01:20:03,695
All right?

1901
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:05,065
I'm sorry.

1902
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,525
Her behavior was unconscionable.

1903
01:20:06,725 --> 01:20:08,235
You cannot hold someone responsible

1904
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:10,315
for the mistakes of their ancestors.

1905
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:14,025
Mike, your granddaddy is a racist,

1906
01:20:14,225 --> 01:20:16,605
land-stealing, slave-raping

1907
01:20:16,805 --> 01:20:19,235
- piece of shit. -Oh, come on now,
Reggie Douglas, that's not right!

1908
01:20:19,435 --> 01:20:20,735
That's not right.
He's still my granddaddy.

1909
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:21,815
- I wouldn't say that about...
- Don't you bring...

1910
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:23,195
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Don't you bring up on me!

1911
01:20:23,395 --> 01:20:24,695
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Stop all this.

1912
01:20:24,895 --> 01:20:26,665
Stop it right now. Stop it.

1913
01:20:28,085 --> 01:20:30,525
Reg, you stop. All of y'all.

1914
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,605
Mike, we not fixin' to crucify you...

1915
01:20:33,805 --> 01:20:35,565
about what happened in the past.

1916
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,905
He can't fix his grandfather
or anything else.

1917
01:20:38,095 --> 01:20:39,855
But you know what we can fix?

1918
01:20:40,055 --> 01:20:41,155
This case.

1919
01:20:41,345 --> 01:20:42,565
REGGIE:
Hold on.

1920
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:43,735
Hold on, man.

1921
01:20:43,935 --> 01:20:45,985
So you-you fixin' to give him a pass?

1922
01:20:46,185 --> 01:20:47,355
- That was this is?
- I'm-a give him a pass

1923
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:48,985
because you didn't know enough
about his past

1924
01:20:49,185 --> 01:20:50,705
and that's why you got your ass kicked.

1925
01:20:52,705 --> 01:20:54,235
- Fuck this case, man.
- I think we can win.

1926
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:56,735
No, man, I'm going back to Florida. Nah.

1927
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,155
- Doing exactly what we should've did
in the beginning. -Come on, man.

1928
01:20:58,345 --> 01:21:00,315
WILLIE:
I got a question for you, Reggie:

1929
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:02,405
What's taking you so long
to get out the door?

1930

Wow.

- You don't have to tell me twice.

01:21:05,395 --> 01:21:06,835
Have fun with these white folks.

1933
01:21:08,045 --> 01:21:08,985
- Reg.
- Hey, Reggie.

1934
01:21:09,185 --> 01:21:10,295
Reg!

1935
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,735
You want to go, too?

1936
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,105
You know what?

1937
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:17,235
I'm out.

01:21:17,435 --> 01:21:18,445
I'm tired of this shit.

I'm out, too.

1940

I miss home, anyway.

1941
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:24,045
Willie, I'm gettin' too old
for this shit, man.

1942
01:21:25,455 --> 01:21:27,195
Mike, I'm sorry.

1943
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:29,565
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1944
01:21:29,765 --> 01:21:30,795
Me, too.

1945
01:21:34,205 --> 01:21:35,735
MIKE:
Can't have this.

1946
01:21:35,935 --> 01:21:37,235
Have what?

1947
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:38,755
We got a case.

1948
01:21:39,755 --> 01:21:41,045
To win.

1949
01:21:48,165 --> 01:21:50,165
I should probably...

1950
01:21:52,005 --> 01:21:54,025
- I should probably recuse myself.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1951
01:21:54,225 --> 01:21:55,525
- Mike, no, you can't do that.
- Yeah, I probably should.

1952
01:21:55,725 --> 01:21:56,985
- No, Mike, you can't do that.
- I should, shouldn't I?

1953
01:21:57,185 --> 01:21:58,355
Now, we got a long way to go,
but we can win this case.

1954
01:21:58,555 --> 01:22:00,775
MIKE: If I even dare to step foot
in that courtroom again,

1955
01:22:00,975 --> 01:22:02,405
the jury's never gonna see me,

1956
01:22:02,595 --> 01:22:04,025
they're just gonna see
a guy with a sheet on his head.

1957
01:22:04,225 --> 01:22:05,275
Listen, listen. We dug a hole.

1958
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:07,525
We dug a hole, but we can dig out of it.

1959
01:22:07,725 --> 01:22:10,605
I'm sorry, Willie, I can't do it,
'cause we both know if I stay on,

1960
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:12,695
my presence is just gonna
hurt the case more,

1961
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:15,195
and I can't do that to you
and I sure can't do that to Jerry.

1962
01:22:15,395 --> 01:22:17,085
Mm-hmm.

1963
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:23,755
MIKE:
All right.

1964
01:22:24,755 --> 01:22:26,445
We'll have to win it without you.

1965

This trial's not going

I feel like I made a bad mistake.

01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,705
And I ought to be cutting my losses.

1974
01:23:13,295 --> 01:23:16,275
I thought justice was blind.

I think he goes home to Florida
on the weekends.

1983
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:55,565
Feel like I ought to tell him in person.

I think that would be
the right thing to do.

deal with the National Baptist Convention.

we can win this case,

what they said when I bought the policy.

2170
01:33:45,595 --> 01:33:50,105
When I told them
that I didn't have the extra money,

2171
01:33:50,305 --> 01:33:54,445
and I didn't know how long
it would take me to get it,

2172
01:33:54,645 --> 01:33:58,985
they happily said
they'd keep the body on ice.

2173
01:33:59,185 --> 01:34:00,905
Rather than give me any comfort,

2174
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:02,695
the deacon assigned to be counselor

2175
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:06,735
used it as an opportunity to shove
a bunch of brochures in my face

2176
01:34:06,935 --> 01:34:09,445
and try and recruit me
as a Loewen sales rep.

2177
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:11,605
Then, suddenly,
this man from the NBC shows up,

2178
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:14,695
asking if I've made
funeral arrangements and...

2179
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:17,505
if I'd be interested
in a Loewen burial package.

2180
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,655
He said I'd get a much better deal
if I paid upfront.

2181
01:34:22,845 --> 01:34:24,605
Before my son died.

2182
01:34:24,805 --> 01:34:27,445
Once my husband finally passed,

2183
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:30,525
that's when they said
that the package that I bought

2184
01:34:30,725 --> 01:34:34,655
didn't cover the cost of embalming
or moving the body.

2185
01:34:34,845 --> 01:34:36,355
The coffin I bought for my mom

2186
01:34:36,555 --> 01:34:38,585
was the least expensive one.

2187
01:34:39,835 --> 01:34:42,065
Come to find out

2188
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:45,085
the one they sold me was
three times more than average.

2189
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:50,485
Your own preacher come to you,
telling you you need something,

2190
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,125
and you religious, you believe it.

2191
01:34:55,915 --> 01:34:57,445
WILLIE:
Now, I understand that you are

2192
01:34:57,645 --> 01:34:59,855
one of the analysts for the Loewen Group.

2193
01:35:00,055 --> 01:35:01,945
You deal with
some of the high-level deals.

2194
01:35:02,145 --> 01:35:03,655
Is that correct?

2195
01:35:03,845 --> 01:35:05,155
- Yes, that's correct.
- WILLIE: Mm-hmm.

2196
01:35:05,345 --> 01:35:07,605
Also that you were, uh,

2197
01:35:07,805 --> 01:35:09,315
one of the architects of this latest deal

2198
01:35:09,515 --> 01:35:11,275
that you had between the Loewen Group

2199
01:35:11,475 --> 01:35:13,195
and the National Baptist Convention.

2200
01:35:13,395 --> 01:35:15,195
- Is that right?
- Yes, I was.

2201
01:35:15,395 --> 01:35:17,105
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You Baptist?

2202
01:35:17,305 --> 01:35:18,905
- No, not Baptist.
- No.

2203
01:35:19,095 --> 01:35:20,195
- Christian, though, right?
- Yes.

2204
01:35:20,395 --> 01:35:21,735
Yeah, yeah. We all Christian, right?

2205
01:35:21,935 --> 01:35:23,195
We all believe in God. Amen?

2206
01:35:23,395 --> 01:35:24,565
Amen.

2207
01:35:24,765 --> 01:35:26,195
(Willie exhales)

2208
01:35:26,395 --> 01:35:28,155
Here's the question, though.

2209
01:35:28,345 --> 01:35:32,105
How much money did the Loewen Group

2210
01:35:32,305 --> 01:35:35,985
project to make from this deal

2211
01:35:36,185 --> 01:35:38,655
of them and the NBC?

2212
01:35:38,845 --> 01:35:41,235
And remember...

2213
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:43,085
you're under oath.

2214
01:35:44,795 --> 01:35:49,485
Uh, our original long-term projections
for that deal were somewhere around

2215
01:35:49,685 --> 01:35:52,105
1... maybe $1.2 billion.

2216
01:35:52,305 --> 01:35:54,605
$1.2 million?

2217
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:56,275
- $1.2 billion.
- $1.2...

2218
01:35:56,475 --> 01:35:58,165
$1.2 billion?

2219
01:35:59,835 --> 01:36:01,445
$1.2 billion, that's-that's good money.

2220
01:36:01,645 --> 01:36:03,655
That's good money
for the Loewen Group, correct?

2221
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:04,985
- Yes.
- That's good money.

2222
01:36:05,185 --> 01:36:07,815
That's good money. $1.2 billion.

2223
01:36:08,015 --> 01:36:11,105
I thought you said "million,"
but you said "billion dollars."

2224
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:13,195
Uh...

2225
01:36:13,395 --> 01:36:15,165
How much did you pay 'em?

2226
01:36:16,255 --> 01:36:17,955
I'm sorry?

2227
01:36:19,005 --> 01:36:20,485
I said, how much did you pay 'em?

2228
01:36:20,685 --> 01:36:23,315
How much did the Loewen Group

2229
01:36:23,515 --> 01:36:25,605
pay the National Baptist Convention

2230
01:36:25,805 --> 01:36:28,335
as compensation as a result of the deal?

2231
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:36,205
I believe we made
about a $200,000 donation.

2232
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:41,855
The jury heard it.

2233
01:36:42,055 --> 01:36:44,155
We didn't have a defense for it.

2234
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:46,875
Oh, what a fucking mess.

2235
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:51,545
I'm gonna have to call Loewen.

I want to know, from your perspective...

2256
01:38:06,095 --> 01:38:07,315
(clears throat)

2257
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:10,445
...what was the deal that you had
between you and Mr. O'Keefe?

2258
01:38:10,645 --> 01:38:15,355
I believe it was roughly a year ago

2259
01:38:15,555 --> 01:38:17,905
when we received an enquiry

2260
01:38:18,095 --> 01:38:21,315
from a representative of Mr. O'Keefe's.

2261
01:38:21,515 --> 01:38:23,815
In fact,

2262
01:38:24,015 --> 01:38:28,195
I'm pretty sure it was his lawyer,
Mr. Allred, who contacted us.

2263
01:38:28,395 --> 01:38:30,605
My understanding is

2264
01:38:30,805 --> 01:38:33,105
they were very anxious to sell.

2265
01:38:33,305 --> 01:38:36,235
So we started looking into the deal.

2266
01:38:36,435 --> 01:38:37,945
Sussing it out.

2267
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:41,855
Trying to determine if it was something

2268
01:38:42,055 --> 01:38:44,815
that would be a good fit for our business.

2269
01:38:45,015 --> 01:38:49,105
Sometime after that,
I invited Mr. O'Keefe and his associates

2270
01:38:49,305 --> 01:38:50,815
up to Vancouver.

2271
01:38:51,015 --> 01:38:54,105
If I recall, they came for dinner,

2272
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:57,045
at my boat, and we discussed things.

2273
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:01,735
After that, uh, hard to say.

2274
01:39:01,935 --> 01:39:05,705
Normally, at that stage, I turn things
over to my acquisitions team.

01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:09,065
Well, that's pleasant.

I mean, that really is.

2277
01:39:11,095 --> 01:39:12,315
And... (clears throat)

2278
01:39:12,515 --> 01:39:13,655
...lucky for you,

2279
01:39:13,845 --> 01:39:17,195
uh, Mr. Loewen, I don't have
a lot of follow-up questions.

2280
01:39:17,395 --> 01:39:20,835
I just have, uh, one thing
I want to ask you. Uh...

2281
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,735
What kind of boat?

2282
01:39:23,935 --> 01:39:25,735
Come again?

2283
01:39:25,935 --> 01:39:27,665
Oh, I said: "What kind of boat?"

2284
01:39:28,665 --> 01:39:31,195
You-you said earlier that you guys
were all on the boat together,

2285
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:32,695
and y'all was eating
and having a good time,

2286
01:39:32,895 --> 01:39:34,445
having the best fish,

2287
01:39:34,645 --> 01:39:36,315
and I just wanted to know,
what kind of boat is it?

2288
01:39:36,515 --> 01:39:37,815
I don't understand.

2289
01:39:38,015 --> 01:39:40,505
Are you asking
about the particular make, or...

2290
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:44,025
Matter of fact, I was asking...

2291
01:39:44,225 --> 01:39:48,355
Can I read from this?
It says, "Nine sunning decks."

2292
01:39:48,555 --> 01:39:50,695
Mm. "Six elegant staterooms."

- Uh...
- Objection, Your Honor.

2294
01:39:52,305 --> 01:39:53,195

- "Five luxury guest cabins."

2295
01:39:53,395 --> 01:39:54,445
- ...of the witnesses' boat?
- Overruled.

2296
01:39:54,645 --> 01:39:55,525
Your Honor,
can I just read what the boat is?

2297
01:39:55,725 --> 01:39:56,985
- Overruled, Ms. Downes.
- It's a nice boat.

2298
01:39:57,185 --> 01:39:58,815
- Overruled.
- I just want to recognize

2299
01:39:59,015 --> 01:40:01,565
and let everybody see
that it's a very nice boat.

2300
01:40:01,765 --> 01:40:04,405
You got, uh, helicopter, helicopter pad.

2301
01:40:04,595 --> 01:40:05,565
You can land a helicopter

2302
01:40:05,765 --> 01:40:06,855
- on that thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

2303
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:07,985
That's something else right there.

2304

That's high grass.

01:40:35,225 --> 01:40:37,315
How much you pay for your plane? Huh?

2318
01:40:37,515 --> 01:40:39,355
Since you can remember some things
and you forget other things,

2319
01:40:39,555 --> 01:40:40,605
how much you pay for your plane?

2320
01:40:40,805 --> 01:40:43,105
How much did you pay
for your plane, Mr. Gary?

2321
01:40:43,305 --> 01:40:44,405
I saw it on the runway.

Oh. You know what?

2323
01:40:45,725 --> 01:40:47,195
We could talk about how much
I paid for my plane,

2324
01:40:47,395 --> 01:40:48,815
'cause I know exactly how much it was,

2325
01:40:49,015 --> 01:40:50,315
but we not talking
about my plane right now.

2326
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:51,985
We talking about your boat.

2327
01:40:52,185 --> 01:40:54,195
So, let me ask one more time,

2328
01:40:54,395 --> 01:40:56,275
so everybody can hear
and understand what I'm saying

2329
01:40:56,475 --> 01:40:58,445
to Mr. Loewen, the billionaire

2330
01:40:58,645 --> 01:41:00,855
who doesn't know the price of his own boat

2331
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,025
that he had dinner on with his colleagues.

2332
01:41:03,225 --> 01:41:06,485
I want to ask you again:
how much did you pay

2333
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:08,005
for your boat?

2334
01:41:09,415 --> 01:41:11,085
I don't know.

2335
01:41:13,085 --> 01:41:14,775
I think he's not hearing what I'm saying.

2336
01:41:14,975 --> 01:41:16,275
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
Mr. Loewen.

2337
01:41:16,475 --> 01:41:18,005
How much did your boat cost?

2338
01:41:20,165 --> 01:41:21,195
What is your point?

2339
01:41:21,395 --> 01:41:22,445
What's my point?

2340
01:41:22,645 --> 01:41:23,565
What is my point?

2341
01:41:23,765 --> 01:41:27,485
While you were sitting there sunning
on that $25 million boat,

2342
01:41:27,685 --> 01:41:31,155
eating your $30 a head lobster,

2343
01:41:31,345 --> 01:41:33,445
did it ever bother you
that it was all being paid for

2344
01:41:33,645 --> 01:41:35,695
by all the poor people
and destitute people

2345
01:41:35,895 --> 01:41:39,155
that your company was
systematically taking advantage of

2346
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:40,985
and profiting from every single day?

2347
01:41:41,185 --> 01:41:42,735
- MAME: Objection! Counsel is testifying.
- Huh? Not only that,

2348
01:41:42,935 --> 01:41:45,605
they were taking advantage of 'em
at their worst time,

2349
01:41:45,805 --> 01:41:48,235
when they're downtrodden,
when they lost somebody,

2350
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:49,905
when they're mourning somebody.

2351
01:41:50,095 --> 01:41:51,655
And now, who has to pay for it?

2352
01:41:51,845 --> 01:41:54,405
The small businessman
like Jeremiah O'Keefe.

2353
01:41:54,595 --> 01:41:56,275
The small businessman in this country,

2354
01:41:56,475 --> 01:41:58,565
who worked so hard to pay for everything

2355
01:41:58,765 --> 01:42:00,195
and stay on top and keep afloat

2356
01:42:00,395 --> 01:42:02,985
while these greedy corporations

2357
01:42:03,185 --> 01:42:04,945
do everything they can and...

2358
01:42:05,145 --> 01:42:06,235
Objection, Your Honor!

2359
01:42:06,435 --> 01:42:08,445
I think I've had quite enough of this.

2360
01:42:08,645 --> 01:42:09,525
Sit your ass down!

2361
01:42:09,725 --> 01:42:11,235
- (gavel pounding)
- You sit your ass down

2362
01:42:11,435 --> 01:42:13,585
until I finish what I'm saying,
because I'm not done.

2363
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,405
- I'm not done with my question
by a long shot. -Mr. Gary!

2364
01:42:16,595 --> 01:42:20,415
Language of that nature
will not be tolerated in my court.

2365
01:42:22,205 --> 01:42:25,065
Mr. Loewen, you may not leave
the witness stand

2366
01:42:25,265 --> 01:42:27,275
unless you're excused by me.

2367
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,205
Do you understand?

2368
01:42:41,295 --> 01:42:42,815
You may continue, Mr. Gary,

2369
01:42:43,015 --> 01:42:45,085
but I warn you to tread lightly.

2370
01:43:08,505 --> 01:43:10,545
I just want to know one thing.

2371
01:43:13,165 --> 01:43:15,545
Did it ever bother you at all?

2372
01:43:18,505 --> 01:43:20,005
No.

2373
01:43:23,915 --> 01:43:25,915
(gallery murmuring quietly)

2374
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,445
- (lightly slaps stand)
- That's all I need.

2375
01:43:30,645 --> 01:43:32,835
(murmuring increases)

2376
01:43:35,205 --> 01:43:37,165
You're dismissed.

2377
01:43:46,955 --> 01:43:48,445
RAY:
Motherfucker!

2378
01:43:48,645 --> 01:43:50,275
Motherfucker!

2379
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:53,025
What was that? What was that?!

2380
01:43:53,225 --> 01:43:55,165
I was skewered out there!

2381
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:06,025
Well, Sister Souljah, what you got for me?

2382
01:44:06,225 --> 01:44:08,695
Well, came to let you know
we've come to a decision.

2383
01:44:08,895 --> 01:44:11,155
Mm. We have? And what have we decided?

2384
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:13,445
Well, in light of recent events,

2385
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:16,025
it does feel that it would be best
for all parties involved...

2386
01:44:16,225 --> 01:44:18,375
- Oh.
- ...to reopen a settlement discussion.

2387
01:44:19,915 --> 01:44:23,315
In other words, we are...

2388
01:44:23,515 --> 01:44:25,565
we are prepared to make your client

2389
01:44:25,765 --> 01:44:28,195
- a very generous offer.
- (chuckling)

2390
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:32,065
I know that's hard for you to, uh,
get out, but how generous are we talking?

2391
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:34,445
I mean, work with me, Willie.
It's not gonna be $100 million.

2392
01:44:34,645 --> 01:44:35,855
Work with you? What are you talking about?

2393
01:44:36,055 --> 01:44:37,405
I mean, needless to say,

2394
01:44:37,595 --> 01:44:39,815
- it's gonna be in the range
in which neither Jerry... -Uh-huh.

2395
01:44:40,015 --> 01:44:41,315
...nor his kids
nor his grandkids would ever

2396
01:44:41,515 --> 01:44:42,695
- have to worry about anything again.
- Okay.

2397
01:44:42,895 --> 01:44:44,985
- That sound good. That sound good.
- Yes.

2398
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:46,985
I'll tell you what.

2399
01:44:47,185 --> 01:44:49,205
Why don't we meet in your room
in a couple hours?

2400
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:53,375
And make sure you get
your best negotiator. You know why?

2401
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:57,125
Your ass gonna need it.

2402
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:02,405
NEGOTIATOR:
Generally, damages in tort are awarded

2403
01:45:02,595 --> 01:45:04,605
simply to restore the plaintiff
back to the position

2404
01:45:04,805 --> 01:45:06,605
he or she was in before tort occurred.

2405
01:45:06,805 --> 01:45:11,275
However, given how protracted
this whole matter has become,

2406
01:45:11,475 --> 01:45:13,565
we believe that it is
in all our best interests

2407
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,565
just to resolve this once and for all.

2408
01:45:15,765 --> 01:45:18,025
We'd like to make you what we consider

2409
01:45:18,225 --> 01:45:19,905
a very generous offer.

2410
01:45:20,095 --> 01:45:22,025
Obviously,
should you decide not to take it,

2411
01:45:22,225 --> 01:45:24,195
we can all go back into court tomorrow.

2412
01:45:24,395 --> 01:45:26,105
You can roll the dice with the jury.

2413
01:45:26,305 --> 01:45:29,275
But, frankly, uh,
the chances that you will win

2414
01:45:29,475 --> 01:45:31,695
or come anywhere close to this number,

2415
01:45:31,895 --> 01:45:34,005
is a risk I doubt you want to take.

2416
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,315
Okay.

2417
01:45:46,515 --> 01:45:47,915
Here's our offer.

2418
01:46:08,455 --> 01:46:10,375
The answer's no.

2419
01:46:11,415 --> 01:46:13,485
MAME:
Are you serious?

2420
01:46:13,685 --> 01:46:14,775
He's serious?

2421
01:46:14,975 --> 01:46:16,355
JEREMIAH:
I said the answer's no.

2422
01:46:16,555 --> 01:46:19,735
RAY: You mean to tell me you are
really going to turn that down?

2423
01:46:19,935 --> 01:46:22,855
You sure you don't maybe want
a little more time to think it over?

2424
01:46:23,055 --> 01:46:25,605
- JEREMIAH: I've thought it over enough.
- RAY: Have you?

2425
01:46:25,805 --> 01:46:28,985
I think we both know that's more money
than you'll ever see in your lifetime.

2426
01:46:29,185 --> 01:46:31,445
We gonna get down to business
or y'all gonna keep wasting our time?

2427
01:46:31,645 --> 01:46:33,695
- (Ray sighs)
- The man said no.

2428
01:46:33,895 --> 01:46:34,775
Hmm?

2429
01:46:34,975 --> 01:46:36,605
(Ray clears throat)

2430
01:46:36,805 --> 01:46:38,545
- (whispering)
- Mm. Okay.

2431
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:42,625
- You sure?
- Yes.

2432
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:45,915
(pen scratching)

2433
01:46:54,455 --> 01:46:56,625
- MAME: Best and final.
- WILLIE: Mm-hmm.

2434
01:47:05,165 --> 01:47:06,795
(soft grunt)

2435
01:47:30,295 --> 01:47:32,235
Answer's still no.

2436
01:47:32,435 --> 01:47:33,525
(coughs)

2437
01:47:33,725 --> 01:47:36,195
Well, this is just fucking unbelievable.

2438
01:47:36,395 --> 01:47:38,315
What the hell's your problem, O'Keefe?

2439
01:47:38,515 --> 01:47:40,985
You can't honestly tell me
that is not enough.

2440
01:47:41,185 --> 01:47:42,525
It's more than enough for me.

2441
01:47:42,725 --> 01:47:44,065
It's just not enough for you.

2442
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:45,655
For me?

2443
01:47:45,845 --> 01:47:47,445
As in enough to put you out of business.

2444
01:47:47,645 --> 01:47:48,945
Ah. (scoffs)

2445
01:47:49,145 --> 01:47:50,565
Come on.

2446
01:47:50,765 --> 01:47:52,405
Let me tell you something, pal.

2447
01:47:52,595 --> 01:47:55,815
The amount of money it would take
to put me out of business--

2448
01:47:56,015 --> 01:47:58,655
the real, actual amount--

2449
01:47:58,845 --> 01:48:00,815
is a number you can't even calculate.

2450
01:48:01,015 --> 01:48:02,565
Take the money, Jerry.

2451
01:48:02,765 --> 01:48:04,275
You're 80 years old.

2452
01:48:04,475 --> 01:48:06,605
- Seventy-five.
- Can you please talk to your client?

2453
01:48:06,805 --> 01:48:07,945
WILLIE:
Talk to him about what?

2454
01:48:08,145 --> 01:48:09,605
- About the fact he just turned down...
- Oh, he said no.

2455
01:48:09,805 --> 01:48:11,315
Last I checked, "no" means "no," right?

2456
01:48:11,515 --> 01:48:13,155
RAY:
What does it feel like

2457
01:48:13,345 --> 01:48:16,855
to be some small-time, nobody
funeral director

2458
01:48:17,055 --> 01:48:18,855
on the verge of bankruptcy

2459
01:48:19,055 --> 01:48:22,485
who just passed on
his one and only chance

2460
01:48:22,685 --> 01:48:25,445
at $75 million?

2461
01:48:25,645 --> 01:48:27,485
- What's it feel like?
- RAY: Mm.

2462
01:48:27,685 --> 01:48:29,415

01:48:51,555 --> 01:48:52,695
Okay, you can leave now. Thank you.
