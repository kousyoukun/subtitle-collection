2
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,550
You know, there's one thing
I'll never make it.

3
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,958
I'd love to take you from
behind like a man would.

4
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,476
I get fed up with
rooms by the hour.

5
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,829
People will think I'm a
cheap whore, right?

6
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,117
Go on, do it again.

7
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,914
Would you let me
play the man, Berto?

8
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,592
I love you, Miranda.
I love you.

9
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,512
You are not the only one.

10
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,838
- The old man again, right?
- Sure, he loves me too.

11
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,235
Look, pretty nice ring.

12
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,994
- Get rid of it, you hear?
- You're crazy?

13
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,599
It's mine.

14
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,512
- You are a...
- Say it, go on.

15
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,797
It gets me all excited.

16
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,877
Slut, whore, bitch.

17
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,550
Why don't we live together,
Miranda?

18
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,632
Do you think that if I were a man
and you were someone I dig

19
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,274
that I would want to live with you?

20
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,597
And besides there's Gino.

21
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,676
But you know very well
your husband is lost.

22
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,434
I don't think so.

23
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,951
They only said he was missing.
They might be right.

24
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,674
Stop the car!

25
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,435
Are you out of your mind?
We don't want any trouble.

26
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,995
GINO'S

27
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,159
I'm starving.

28
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,714
Bring me a little wine
and some cheese, Tony.

29
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,359
So there you are.

30
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,432
I was worried.

31
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,755
Sit down, have a drink.

32
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,314
Hey, is something wrong?

33
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,829
I thought you'd sleep here together.

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,997
I never brought anyone here
for anything like that.

35
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,550
Besides, I don't have to
answer to anyone. Including you.

36
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,239
Here's this weeks' money.

37
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,594
What am I going to do about
all the bills this month?

38
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,033
- I've got a pretty good idea.
- You?

39
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,193
- What do you mean?
- I know a guy who'd buy that ring.

40
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,555
But I can't sell it.
If I do...

41
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,312
...then what do
I tell the consul?

42
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,756
I'd make sure that the guy
gives you a copy of that one

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,313
that looks just the same.

44
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,032
Well... sell to him...
but fast, eh?

45
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,032
Before the consul notices
it's gone.

46
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,393
Is Leda in yet?

47
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,595
No.

48
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,960
All right. Make sure to clear
all the tables and lock up.

49
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,190
No one's gonna show up
in this weather.

50
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,509
Tony! What do you like most
in a woman? Tell me.

51
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,349
Generosity.

52
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,838
In other words,
I should take you to bed.

53
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,711
- Good idea.
- Stop right there!

54
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,349
I only wanted to give
you the money.

55
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,268
Now you've turned chicken?
Hypocrite.

56
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,436
You should never
mix sex and money.

57
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,391
I think they go very well together.

58
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,478
Not for me.
I'm only an employee.

59
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,669
And so what?

60
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,830
Well, I'm waiting for my orders.

61
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,040
Go on, very, very funny.

62
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,598
Good night, boss.
Pleasant dreams.

63
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,789
Jack's been killed. It's terrible.

64
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,319
I'm never gonna see him anymore.

65
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,273
They never gave him a chance,
they just shot him down.

66
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,834
Near the river bank.

67
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,558
Look, how about us taking a
trip to Rimini, just you and me?

68
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,395
You've got to forget about Jack and
you will a lot sooner than you think.

69
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,956
You'll feel guilty
that you've forgotten, I know.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,640
But that's life, Leda.

71
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,029
And you are the one
who has to go on living.

72
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,111
It makes no sense to suffer.

73
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,279
I know, I don't want to suffer.

74
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,519
But I can't stop crying
I'm so unhappy I want to bawl.

75
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,200
This may not console you

76
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,919
but in everyone's life
there are lots of broken lines

77
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,269
and maybe a straight line,
if you're lucky.

78
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,917
I'm still stuck with broken lines.

79
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,233
But still I go on looking for
the guy who's right for me

80
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,872
hoping he'll straighten me out.

81
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,520
There, there.
Why don't you smile, Leda?

82
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,279
Look out there, even
the sky's trying to smile.

83
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,039
It's hardly snowing anymore.

84
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,471
Maybe winter's finally over.

85
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,195
I finished working at
the Ferrara Fair at 2 a. M.

86
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,076
It took all night to peddle here.

87
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,750
Can't wait to hit the sack.

88
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,916
I think it's about time
you bought a motor scooter.

89
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,750
First I'll buy a wife
and then I'll buy a motor scooter.

90
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,478
Come on, who'd wanna marry you?
You're too black.

91
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,315
Drink your coffee and
go straight up to sleep.

92
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,517
I'll put your bike away for you.

93
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,192
Here comes the boss.

94
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,229
I'm with the team
working on the gas pipeline.

95
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,955
I'm American. We'll be
here for about 5 or 6 months.

96
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,069
Got any rooms to rent?

97
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
I got four, but two
are already occupied.

98
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,392
Let me have the two that aren't.

99
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,316
Would you like to
have a look at them?

100
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,999
I'll take your word for it.

101
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,995
- Thank you, madam.
- Miranda. And you?

102
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,709
Norman.

103
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,154
Here, boss. The consul
asked me to give you this.

104
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,673
Ciao, Miranda.

105
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,839
Well, thanks!

106
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,753
THIS AFTERNOON
AT THE USUAL PLACE

107
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,910
There's something
for you in my pocket.

108
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,828
Your hand's like a man
who's very old

109
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,598
and still a baby too.

110
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,794
I admire the way fish make love.

111
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,308
They leave a stream of semen
behind them in the current

112
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,236
without even coupling with
their mate. Anonymous, mute...

113
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,071
Like your hand in me now.

114
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,758
Why don't you
go away with me?

115
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,276
I've nearly completed
my term of exile.

116
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,311
They're bound to give
me amnesty soon.

117
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,432
I'm very old and rich,
isn't that guarantee enough?

118
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,235
Baby, it's your skin
I like best, it's tired.

119
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,032
I adore your white hairs.

120
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,148
It's all like a second
opportunity for you, darling.

121
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,430
Now I could change that.

122
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,519
Come inside me, Carlo.
Tell me why you never do, please.

123
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,910
I'm afraid you might
get pregnant.

124
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,589
It's ridiculous at my age,
don't you think?

125
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,158
Afraid for me or
of being a father?

126
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,591
You don't have to worry, darling.

127
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,991
Is Tony aware
that we come here?

128
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,198
Of course. I always
tell him who I'm with.

129
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,993
I might have known,
women are all the same.

130
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,989
The necklace you gave me
looks pretty, doesn't it?

131
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,752
I'll buy a hundred for you.

132
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,553
I'll give you anything you like,
my family has money.

133
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,391
In Naples, I have a palace
just waiting for us.

134
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,635
I lived there with my wife
'til she died.

135
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,635
Anonymous, mute...
The fish are better.

136
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,113
- I've grown jealous, you know.
- Of Berto?

137
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,075
You seem to forget you told me you
like the idea of us two making love.

138
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,199
What does that mean?

139
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,160
It's my heart that cannot bear
your having lovers.

140
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,718
My balls don't care.

141
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,115
I like it better when
you talk French to me.

142
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,151
It reminds me of the Sacred Heart
nuns when I went to school.

143
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,078
In other countries, everybody
speaks a little bit of French,

144
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,792
particularly the whores.

145
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,159
Tony!

146
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,316
- Leda!
- Okay, okay!

147
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,469
- Is the meat ready?
- Hold on, I can't serve it raw.

148
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,233
- I'd call that "well-done".
- What was that, Tony?

149
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,239
I said your dress looks very nice.

150
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,191
- You think so?
- Oh, yes and how,

151
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,755
- it shows off all that nice flesh.
- What does it show off?

152
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,394
I meant that it looks nice and fresh

153
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,919
and not hot and stuffy.

154
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,271
I'll bet it turns you on.

155
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,032
- A paradise of erotic beauty.
- Now you're a poet too.

156
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,595
Oh, all it takes is a bit of nerve
and anybody can be a poet.

157
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,790
Marvellous, how did I end up
trusting him?

158
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,549
- Meat!
- I love women!

159
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,551
Another one!
What are you waiting for!

160
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,670
This card wins.
This card loses.

161
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,760
This card wins.
This card loses.

162
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,958
This one's the winner,
this one's the loser...

163
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,749
- Are you gonna screw me again?
- You never know.

164
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,597
Luck's blind, as they say.

165
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,916
This one wins and this one loses.

166
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,076
This one loses, this one loses.

167
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,834
This one loses...

168
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,392
Which do you choose?

169
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,714
Bravo.

170
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,028
Now I play.

171
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,839
Are you ready, Mr. Consul?

172
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,633
This card wins, this one loses.
This one loses, this one wins.

173
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,432
This card wins, this card loses.

174
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,396
Keep watching. Once again.

175
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,631
- Which is the winner?
- This one.

176
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,318
I'm sorry, Mr. Consul, you lose.

177
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,113
That's all right.
Luck's fickle like a woman,

178
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,200
which is why it likes young men.

179
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,953
So if she's a woman, I imagine
she'd like any old man

180
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,479
who paid for her.

181
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,709
These two friends of mine
will take the other room.

182
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,870
They're French,
they're studying music in Parma.

183
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,356
Juliette, Gabrielle.

184
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,353
You don't mind do you, Miranda?

185
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,391
Why don't you ask your friends
to give us a song then?

186
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,839
She no sing...

187
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,477
- And do you sing?
- I sing and dance.

188
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,554
Ciao, Italo.

189
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,956
Enchanted, Miss Juliette.

190
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,149
My name is Carlo,
I worked in France.

191
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,158
- Oh, in the mines?
- No! As a diplomat.

192
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,353
I'll leave him to you.

193
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,313
Ok, don't worry. I'll see
that they're well-taken care.

194
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,759
Thanks, Miranda.

195
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,837
Marvellous that you say
my name so nicely.

196
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,393
Is this a party or something?

197
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,590
A dead man is paying
for our drinks.

198
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,870
- A dead man?
- Iride.

199
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,636
He left us 10.000 lire
to celebrate after his funeral.

200
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,316
Great. Let's celebrate then, ok?

201
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,475
Cheers!

202
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,514
What do you think?

203
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,198
It looks like a battleship.

204
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,915
Thank you.

205
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,956
I might make the letters bigger.

206
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,753
Bigger than they are now?

207
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,557
Berto transports
anything anywhere.

208
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,390
Come on, come on, get in.

209
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,194
- Where are we going?
- I wanna show the depo.

210
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,315
Who was that guy
with the two girls?

211
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Norman? A technician
with the gasline team.

212
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,878
He's American, you know.

213
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,594
- He's a son of a bitch.
- Why is that?

214
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,992
He had no right
to call you Miranda.

215
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,349
- But Americans always do that.
- Italians don't!

216
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,876
I wanted to show you the work
they've done on the garage.

217
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,395
Look.

218
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,516
That's where our house
will be, right there.

219
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,594
Selling watches?

220
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,310
That one's for you.
Put it on.

221
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,199
Oh, Berto.

222
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,879
Darling.

223
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,190
Just a minute. There's
something I want you to see.

224
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,109
Come on.

225
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,393
Where did you get all this stuff?

226
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,035
I got it all with 50% off from
that furniture company I work for.

227
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,232
And look what else I've got?

228
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,236
I delivered truckloads
of these to Bologna.

229
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,794
I don't think they'll miss
the case I stole for us.

230
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,399
Cheers.

231
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,756
Stop it, would you, that tickles.

232
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,632
I want to marry you, Miranda.
I want to marry you...

233
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,310
Do you know that men
with socks on really turn me off,

234
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,476
especially when
they're wearing boxer shorts?

235
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,030
And besides didn't you tell me
you love me

236
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,877
because with me
you had freedom?

237
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,470
I must have a woman who
will stand behind me.

238
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,239
Well, look around!
Where do you think I am?

239
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,394
Pretty funny, except when
I make love I do it front!

240
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,392
You know I'm never going
to marry you.

241
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,634
You'll marry the old man, huh!

242
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,999
Or maybe you fell in love
with your American friend.

243
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,713
How can I make love to someone
who doesn't understand

244
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,273
the woman
he says he's in love with?

245
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,114
- Women are all alike!
- And you're useless!

246
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,039
No! I'm sorry!
You made me angry.

247
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,753
You don't even know
how to get angry!

248
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,074
I like your arse Berto,
that's all!

249
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,031
Put it in the closet for all I care!

250
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,868
No, Miranda don't go!

251
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,792
Please, come back!

252
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,075
Go on, Gabrielle,
give your seat to Miranda.

253
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,960
Why does it have to be me?

254
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,518
He'll take you back in the truck.

255
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,395
Oh, shit!

256
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,318
Goodbye, Gabrielle.

257
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,999
Goodbye. See you later!

258
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,196
Goodbye.

259
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,834
Who the hell does she
think she is! Bitch.

260
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,916
There's hundreds like her
and better.

261
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,718
And all of them piss
the same way.

262
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,677
Great! Let's hurry up,
I want to have fun.

263
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,439
HOTEL CONTINENTAL

264
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,989
What's that?

265
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,880
It's Turkish gum.
Makes you high.

266
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,472
I want some too.

267
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,679
Here they are!

268
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,551
I really like women who
get wet right away.

269
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,794
No, no, it's only sweat.

270
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,992
Besides I have to pee.

271
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,313
- Want me to leave?
- Why are you ashamed?

272
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,319
Is it true that where you're from
they don't kiss girls here?

273
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,874
Who taught you to drive
me crazy like you do?

274
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,078
I learn fast on my own.

275
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,597
Com'on, kiss me.

276
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,429
No, not here.

277
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,359
You know where I mean!

278
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,636
Do men always do what you want?

279
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,233
Ice-cream.

280
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,232
What about Norman?
Do you like him?

281
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,468
He's handsome.
A bit strange though.

282
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,919
Strange, how?

283
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,919
It's hard to say.
Different.

284
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,597
Italo would like us to go
to Africa together.

285
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,080
Africa?

286
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,991
Yeah. His folks are in Somalia.
He wants to live there,

287
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,076
work selling new trucks for Berto.

288
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,348
And you?

289
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,196
I don't know.
I miss Jack.

290
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,352
- We were so in love.
- And I was in love with Gino.

291
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,160
- It's nice to love only one man.
- One at a time.

292
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,199
No, one forever.

293
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,920
But I guess you were right.

294
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,512
- About what?
- Love.

295
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,911
You do forget.
And life goes on.

296
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,313
Let's run, come on, Damiano!

297
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,838
I like new men in my life.

298
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,828
It's not true that all men
are alike, you know?

299
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,311
Did you and Italo
go to bed yet?

300
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,239
Before he sleeps with me
he insists I say

301
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,713
I'm in love with him.

302
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,034
I wish you had,

303
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,230
'cause I'm dying to know
if black eyes are good or not!

304
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,318
- Do you think Tony has a girl?
- He does okay in Ferrara.

305
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,195
- Did he tell you that?
- He never mentions it.

306
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,269
But Italo told me he's famous
in every whore house in Ferrara.

307
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,709
- He's famous?
- Whore's like him a lot.

308
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,268
It appears he can give
any old hag a great time...

309
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,029
No! That's incredible isn't it!
Not our Tony!

310
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,113
He's got something but it's hard
to tell just what it is.

311
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,993
- What, what is?
- He's got...

312
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,311
Well, I don't know what he's got.

313
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,152
You and I ought to go
to a whore house too!

314
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,838
- What!
- I mean it.

315
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,348
There ought to be
whore houses also for ladies.

316
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,880
Tell me, doing it in bed...
do you like it?

317
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,869
Why don't you?

318
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,595
I get more worked up doing it
in the country or in a car,

319
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,550
in the movies.

320
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,273
In bed, I can come only by
squeezing my legs together.

321
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,395
Well, then let the guys spread.
Just as long as you both agree on it.

322
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,190
There are men who say
that a lot of girls are frigid.

323
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
That's stupid, no girl is frigid,
they don't exist.

324
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,838
Only guys who don't
know how to do it.

325
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,879
- For example, that one.
- With the robe on?

326
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,638
- I can see him nude!
- Nude, no!

327
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,157
Sure, look at all those hairs
going down his belly

328
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,792
all the way to his donger.

329
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,351
His is timid look.
It's all shrivelled up.

330
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,869
He's got no arse at all!

331
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,436
I think all men should be
looked at arse first.

332
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,278
Right, it gives you
the whole picture.

333
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,679
Look at that one!

334
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,118
There's a bummer.

335
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,439
A professor.

336
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,559
Lawyer!

337
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,039
A mechanic.

338
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,319
We don't understand.
We are French.

339
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,793
Wanna dance?

340
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,597
We have a car too.

341
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,317
Okay, just one dance
but that's all.

342
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,436
Our husbands are very jealous.

343
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,798
- Good evening, boss.
- Hi.

344
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,431
Did they tire you out
in Ferrara?

345
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,315
Not in the least.
Would you like to see?

346
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,518
- Were they pretty?
- I'm not complaining.

347
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,990
Is that the way you get them
excited, those bitches?

348
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,000
You bet, I know plenty of ways
to get them going.

349
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,392
Think there should be whore houses
for women just the same as for men,

350
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,908
don't you think so? Eh, Tony?

351
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,598
There are plenty of
very good places

352
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,232
where men come and go
as they please

353
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,038
and a woman like you
can take her pick.

354
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,156
Like this inn,
for example, big boy...

355
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,031
Oh, I wouldn't even imagine...
It's up to you...

356
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,115
Stop right there.

357
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,713
But why should I stop
if the others don't?

358
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,954
Stop I said!

359
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,753
- But look... - Don't forget
you're an employee here!

360
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,279
And you're my boss.

361
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,320
Bravo. You've managed to keep
your thoughts together

362
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,629
no thanks to all those whores
you satisfied.

363
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Stop it now, Tony,
you're finished, you hear.

364
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,838
I only wanted to give you
the cash for the ring I sold.

365
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,189
That's what I like about you.
You're useful, I can rely on you.

366
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,350
- Oh, and the copy, have you
got it yet? - There is no copy.

367
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,879
One of my lady friends
bought the ring.

368
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,037
Dirty bastard, you put my nice ring
on one of your whore's hands.

369
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,351
Well, look what I sold
it for. Count it.

370
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,992
She paid twice as much
as any one else would've.

371
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,917
She gave me a lot.
Gave you a lot, huh?

372
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,114
Cash or trade?

373
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,073
Cash, of course. You know
nobody looks at me, right boss?

374
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,320
It's all for you anyhow.
It's enough, I hope, to pay

375
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,880
whatever new bills I get.
For as long as I'm away.

376
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,555
- Where?
- Don't I have the right to go away?

377
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,831
Yeah, you're the boss.
You can do whatever you want.

378
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,552
You approve, do you?

379
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,669
I depend on you, Tony.
The inn is in your hands.

380
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,513
Don't worry, I'll look after
your interests for you.

381
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,909
You're a guy who
knows what he's doing.

382
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
Why, don't you?

383
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,799
- Do you like it?
- It makes me cry a little.

384
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,831
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

385
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,510
Sit down.
How'd you like an ice-cream.

386
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,076
More drills shipped,
they were unloaded this morning.

387
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,588
- Work's finished.
- Well?

388
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,315
No!

389
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,559
Norman, Norman, no!

390
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,796
Come over here.

391
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,790
Come here.

392
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,676
A dog.
He caught a dog.

393
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,757
Hey you, leave that dog alone.

394
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,314
I'm a civil servant
and you're interfering with the law.

395
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,956
- How much for the dog?
- Not a penny!

396
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,389
I have my dignity as
official dog catcher, you know.

397
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,873
Here's dollars, American
dollars. You can have them.

398
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,712
Oh, he's cute.

399
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,829
Go away.

400
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,759
Go on, go away!

401
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,311
Please, go away!

402
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,273
Don't you know how lucky
you've been today.

403
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,831
BOARDING FORBIDDEN
BEWARE OF THE DOG

404
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,230
Hey, the war's over.
Slow the jeep down, will you.

405
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,430
- You're a 'mascalzona'.
- Go on say it again.

406
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,792
Ma-scal-zo-na!

407
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,353
Hey, would you watch that!
You some kind of nut?

408
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,474
But...

409
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,232
This spot is
where the Nazi's got me.

410
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,189
April 13th 1944.

411
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,752
It was night, I was lucky.

412
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,236
There were only a few,
they were afraid to come down.

413
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,597
I spent the whole night
looking up at those two trees.

414
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:22,993
Grass, blood, money
and shit.

415
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,588
A monument.

416
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,993
C'mon, let's go.

417
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,390
I want something to drink,
then I want you.

418
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,556
Let's stop at the first village.

419
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,993
I'm starving.
I'm goin' to eat.

420
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,468
It's there.

421
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,839
Right between the thighs
of all women.

422
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,639
Tender clouds,
I wanna die there.

423
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,113
Miranda!

424
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,629
Get over here.

425
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,598
But not on a chamber pot.

426
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,552
I wanna die...

427
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,478
I wanna die on top of you, Miranda.

428
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,354
On top of you.

429
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,994
Come on then.
Oh, my love.

430
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,591
I want your thigh.

431
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,594
Darling, come on.

432
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,751
A hole here...

433
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,116
I wanna make a hole in you

434
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,116
and take you in that hole.

435
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,519
Yeah, do it.
You can do it if you want.

436
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,793
- Just me, mine, forever.
- Yours.

437
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,032
Norman? You hear me, darling?

438
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,517
Please, Norman.

439
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,038
Wine, wine!
Long live Bacchus and love!

440
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,676
Both console us.

441
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,234
One passes through
our lips to our heads

442
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,794
and the other from our eyes
to our hearts.

443
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,433
So I drink this wine, with my eyes
and then I do the same as you.

444
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,675
Just a minute, quiet
please, everyone.

445
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,389
I shall miss you all a great deal.
I asked for my old post in Damascus.

446
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,510
That's where I started my career.

447
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,635
So at long last they put you
back on the road.

448
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,799
Yes, the purge is finally over,
my exile has come to an end

449
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,230
and you might say I'm back
in the government's good graces.

450
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,955
Long live the Consul Carlo!

451
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,079
It was very nice of you
to invite us all here.

452
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,710
So now you're gonna leave us?

453
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,197
- Wanna dance?
- Will do.

454
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,350
Will ya?

455
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,873
Wanna dance, honey?

456
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,230
What kind of music is that, Tony?

457
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,430
Play one of those records
that I brought, will ya?

458
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,589
- This one, okay? - That's the one
I'm on, go right ahead.

459
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,553
- But I can't, Leda.
- Sure you can.

460
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,319
Look at him.

461
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,716
- No, Miranda, ask somebody else.
- Ah. Carlo, come.

462
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,555
- Isn't he wonderful?
- He's American.

463
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,039
Stop it, Leda.

464
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,120
Until the end I never stopped hoping
that one day you might reconsider.

465
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,835
I can't Carlo.
You know that.

466
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,515
I can't help it.
But I still feel bound to Gino.

467
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,720
I can't get him out of my heart.

468
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,200
Liar, you know there's no
possibility of him ever returning.

469
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,476
But besides it was you who said
that nothing mattered except this.

470
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,797
I didn't know you that well then.

471
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,238
Hey, Carlo!
What are you trying to say?

472
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,555
Just that now other things
mean a lot more to me.

473
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,955
At this moment there's one
and only one thing.

474
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,552
Miranda, Miranda!
Why do you always avoid me?

475
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,319
Avoid? I'm here holding you,
can't you feel it, Carlo?

476
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,033
You've got such lovely thighs.
I dream about them.

477
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,878
About your aroma.
Your impudent eyes.

478
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,516
That's what I like to hear.
Pretend I'm not Miranda.

479
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,312
Another woman.

480
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,636
Someone young and fresh
and completely devoted to you.

481
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,398
No-one else interests me.

482
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,273
Juliette. Did you see her?

483
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,437
I've seen her all naked.

484
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,391
She'd follow you like a little
orphan girl.

485
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,360
She's looking for someone
to settle down with.

486
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,397
Close your eyes and think about her.

487
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:38,232
Her thighs, her hand.
Imagine it's Juliette's caresses...

488
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,792
- You, no you!
- Me!

489
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,192
Do you know
what I've done, Carlo?

490
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,674
I even sold the ring you bought
me to pay some bills.

491
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:54,713
Yes, yes. That's one more
reason for loving you.

492
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,280
It's a downpour.
Come on, please.

493
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,192
- You've pissed me off!
- That's a rotten son of a bitch!

494
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,800
No! Not the phonograph, no!

495
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,949
Stop fighting!

496
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,956
Oh, stop it!

497
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,197
About time there was some rain.

498
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,712
Sing, go on, sing.

499
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,071
Stop fighting!
Oh, stop it! Norman!

500
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,075
Norman!

501
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,396
That son of a bitch started it!

502
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,954
- He did?
- Yes and it's your fault!

503
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,953
Can't any of you see it's raining?
Let's go!

504
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,270
Everyone back home. C'mon.

505
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,472
Come on, Juliette.

506
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,470
Come on, move it.

507
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,118
MINISTRY OF DEFENCE
GENERAL DEPARTMENT VENICE

508
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,872
MR. ROSTAGNI GINO, BORN IN
SCARDOVARI, RESIDENT IN FICONARA,

509
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,359
LISTED AS MISSING,
MUST BE PRESUMED DEAD

510
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:28,989
"Listed as missing must
be presumed dead."

511
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:03,357
Don't go, Gino, don't go.

512
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,396
Take it,
I leave it to you, it's yours.

513
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,794
Turn around.

514
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,235
I don't believe you never
done that before.

515
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,236
I don't care what you believe.

516
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:42,998
- Gino, tell me I didn't hurt you.
- No, you were great.

517
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,879
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing, just laughing.

518
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,516
- What was your husband like?
- Nothing at all like you!

519
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,428
- You just like to switch around?
- Why not?

520
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,119
You like one man because
he's got something special,

521
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,276
then you find something else
in another.

522
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,912
What have I got?

523
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,273
Your smell.

524
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,837
I'm crazy about it.

525
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,718
- Let's go away together!
- Go where?

526
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,794
- Far, to where everyone's different.
- They're not all the same here.

527
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,796
- You, for example.
- I'm only passing through.

528
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:58,352
- I take what I find that's all.
- And I made myself easy to find.

529
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,876
Miranda, ask me for anything.

530
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,395
Keep me running
all night long, okay?

531
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,873
What are you thinking about?

532
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,959
Not a thing!
I feel the music in the air!

533
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,633
I can feel it too!

534
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,714
Sure you can work here.
We've got a room for you.

535
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,239
Right, dad?

536
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,350
CARLO GOLDONI
THE MISTRESS OF THE INN

537
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,232
Get me a grappa.

538
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,038
Is anyone upstairs?

539
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,154
Only Leda, no one else
came home last night.

540
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,235
They're completely through
with the gas line.

541
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,110
- Even Norman gave up his room.
- That's because he was all alone.

542
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,958
Juliette went with the Consul
and Gabrielle with Berto.

543
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,478
Looks like we'll be all alone, uh?

544
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,511
Well, there'll be lots of others,
you'll see.

545
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,115
Not today.
Put the closed sign up, will you?

546
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,799
Tell Leda we don't need her today.

547
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,995
And you get all clean and after come
and see me and we'll talk a little.

548
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,789
And stop drinking.

549
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,308
Well, I'm celebrating.
I don't have to work today.

550
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,033
CLOSED TODAY

551
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,748
You didn't have to bring coffee.
It wasn't necessary.

552
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,478
Well, I could leave it here.
But if it's not necessary...

553
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,718
we could forget about it.

554
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,198
Get under the covers.

555
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,475
Stop right there.

556
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,037
- I'd like us to be married.
- Wait, I haven't tested you.

557
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,232
Let's not forget I haven't either.

558
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,554
Well, I'd like to begin by
discussing some business matters.

559
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,239
Business and bed.
I'm giving you the choice.

560
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,874
We can be married or
you can be a peasant again.

561
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,396
And if I marry you,
what am I then?

562
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,919
Part owner of the inn, alright!

563
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,749
But 'Gino's' what
this place is called.

564
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,231
Well, put a sign up
calling it 'Miranda's'.

565
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:32,992
- Everybody'll be delighted.
- The men will, I know that.

566
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,354
Well, so what?

567
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,434
If I marry I suppose...
well then what?

568
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:54,478
You can begin by learning to love me
and stop calling me "Boss".

569
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,513
It's mine, Tony.

570
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,793
Yeah, it's yours.

571
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,994
No, what I mean is
that it's mine.

572
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,439
Oh Dio!

573
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,359
Oh, please, Miranda!
I can't stand it anymore!

574
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,794
Do you still want to
discuss finances?

575
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,359
Tony! Oh, Tony!

576
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,958
Tony, what are you doing?

577
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,794
Hurrah for the couple!

578
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:41,990
Yes, isn't she beautiful.
Hurrah for the couple!

579
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,515
I think I'll hate these
photos forever.

580
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,712
It's beautiful!

581
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,070
Carlo and Juliette from Naples,
you simply showered me with gifts!

582
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,190
Have you had any news
from the American?

583
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,158
Norman's just not the sort to go
back to the same place.

584
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,233
In person, with a letter
or anything.

585
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,437
Italo and I are going
to get married in Africa.

586
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,869
I don't know what kind of a
ceremony they have there.

587
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,391
And now off we all go to Bologna.
I've reserved at "Le due torri".

588
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,593
Oh Berto! That's wonderful!
Thank you!

589
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,198
I've rented the car from
an earl in Mirandola,

590
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,912
any complaints?

591
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,518
Hurry!
C'mon, get in.

592
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,475
Wait a minute, Berto.
Just a minute.

593
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,999
Where's Miranda gone?

594
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,473
Where's she going?

595
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,116
How patriotic she is.
What's she doing?

596
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,479
What's she doing?

597
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,070
You know, her first husband
died during the war.

598
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,919
Hurry up!

599
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,235
- Goodbye!
- Get in, everyone's waiting for you.

600
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,795
Goodbye! Good luck.
Have a good journey!

601
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,759
Bye, bye!

602
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,995
It's wonderful to get into a bed
with new sheets and a new cover.

603
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:10,272
- But I'd rather look at you.
- What do you want to look at?

604
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,753
Everything!

605
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,076
Light the fire if you want
to see more.

606
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,795
Jumps right up.

607
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,913
- What's so funny?
- Don't you get it?

608
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,230
You're terrible,
you know that!

609
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:13,029
Here.

610
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,719
You finish it.

611
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,994
Lie down.

612
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,232
That thing, pull it up.

613
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:12,394
Very hot, a little bit cold,
hot, cold, hot.

614
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:19,710
Cool, very hot.
A little bit hot.

615
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:26,353
Cold, hot.
Cool, warmer.

616
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,631
- Cold, warmer.
- I beg you Miranda,

617
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:35,198
- I beg you please! I beg you!
- Warmer, and warmer, not that.

618
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,912
A paradise of erotic
beauty, huh?

619
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,274
I beg you, Miranda. I beg you.
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you!

620
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,356
I beg you! Is that all you can say?

621
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,436
This is the second time
you've begged me.

622
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,914
It's funny, I wonder if someday
I'll have to beg you.

623
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,030
I like your natural colour
