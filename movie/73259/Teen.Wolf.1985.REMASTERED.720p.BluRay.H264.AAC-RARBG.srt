1
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,616
C'mon, ref,
that's a foul.

2
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,006
- Time.
- C'mon!

3
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,974
You guys suck.

4
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,644
No, really?

5
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,063
C'mon, let's go.

6
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,023
You're looking good.
Way to go.

7
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,651
Nothing to worry about.
It's fine. No problem.

8
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:13,778
Hot out there, isn't it?

9
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,487
Shouldn't have gotten
in his way, Scottie.

10
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,030
Hey, Scott,
looking good out there, babe.

11
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,741
Yeah, how would
you know, Stiles?

12
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,538
- You want to forfeit the game?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

13
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,122
- No.
- No?

14
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,541
My players have
league scoring records at stake.

15
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,751
- It wouldn't be fair to them.
- Just thought if we quit now

16
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,171
you could beat
the five o' clock traffic.

17
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,256
There's a lot
to learn from losing.

18
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,675
Hey, we'll play
if it's that big a deal to ya.

19
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,019
- Me, I got it.
- Over here!

20
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,104
Push it up.
All right, set it up!

21
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,983
- It's not going too well, is it?
- What do you expect, Thorne?

22
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,568
Look at the sneakers
those guys are wearing.

23
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,195
If our guys
had sneakers like that

24
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:57,739
there's no telling
what they could do.

25
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,407
Shoot!

26
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,577
We're all open.

27
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:03,953
Jump it!

28
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,539
That fat kid's got a great arm.

29
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,002
Over here. Pass it.

30
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:16,674
Forget it, dork.

31
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,293
Nice try.

32
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,506
I wanna
get out of here.

33
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,925
Hey, c'mon.
It's not that bad.

34
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,302
First game of the season,
eleven more to go.

35
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,763
Hey,
it's just a game.

36
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,722
You bozzo's better
shape up out there.

37
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,141
I can't do this all by myself.

38
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,519
What is that? Liverwurst?

39
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,145
What?

40
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,606
I thought you were
supposed to be on a diet, Chub?

41
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,608
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,903
Chub, look at this.

43
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:27,578
Give me that!

44
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,539
Stop snooping around
in my locker.

45
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:34,001
Look, Chub, big guy, I can smell
that liverwurst from over there.

46
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,337
Oh, yeah, right.
Underneath these?

47
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:40,966
Woo-hoo, all right.
Yeah, great game, guys.

48
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,801
- We showed them.
- We lost, Stiles.

49
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,095
The umpire needed glasses.
Terrific, Brad.

50
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,388
- Cheeseball!
- Hey, Scott,

51
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,932
you know that
seven bucks you owe me?

52
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,433
- You owe me.
- Listen, Scott,

53
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,518
this is important. If I don't
come up with a keg for tonight,

54
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,728
they won't let me
into that party.

55
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,187
Look, even if you
come up with the cash,

56
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,690
- Where are you gonna buy it?
- Lend me five.

57
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,233
- Later. Later.
- Two.

58
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:58,985
Hey, Chub, how's the diet?

59
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,820
Hey, Lemonade,
give me five, man.

60
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,532
You were terrific
out there, Lemonade.

61
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,409
What the hell is that?

62
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,875
Hey, hey, Lemonade,
my man. What it is?

63
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,543
Listen, uh,
I'm raising some cash

64
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,130
for our school's Afro-American
festival and I thought maybe....

65
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,715
Mick, can we talk?

66
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,019
Hey, Scottie, come on in.

67
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,104
Great game out there, today.

68
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,898
You want a thigh
or wing or something?

69
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,776
No, that's not necessary, coach.

70
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:41,569
Listen,

71
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,487
you know,
you know how you always said

72
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,155
if any of us guys
have any problems,

73
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,408
I mean, even personal ones,
that we should come and see you?

74
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,701
Hey, that's what I'm here for.

75
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,622
Great, because, uh,
I got a problem.

76
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,917
Oh, yeah? What kind of problem?

77
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,628
As you can see,
I'm a very busy man here.

78
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,297
Ah, yeah well, it's,
it's kind of complicated.

79
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:06,386
Oh, those kinds of problems.
Yeah. What is it? Drugs? Girls?

80
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,136
Boy, I'd sure like to help you,

81
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,639
but I'm really
tapped out this month.

82
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,557
The IRS is breathing down
my neck like it's some kind

83
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,644
of personal vendetta
against Bobby Finstock.

84
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,895
No, coach.

85
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,606
How can I put this?

86
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,734
I'm going through changes.

87
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,486
Oh, that.
Don't worry about that.

88
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,571
We all go through that.

89
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,657
Some a little bit
later than others.

90
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,283
I'm sorry I didn't notice,
but I haven't been

91
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,452
hanging around
the locker room all that much.

92
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,414
No, you see,

93
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,748
Coach, I just don't
think it's gonna be possible

94
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,418
for me to play
on the team anymore.

95
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,795
Oh yeah, well...

96
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:42,671
Look, uh,

97
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,257
Scottie, I know what
you're going through.

98
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,716
A couple years back
a kid came to me

99
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,469
much the same way
you're coming to me now.

100
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,681
Saying to me pretty much the
same thing that you're saying.

101
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,891
He wanted to drop off the team.

102
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,268
His mother was a, a widow,

103
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,186
all crippled up.
She was scrubbing floors.

104
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,314
She had, uh,
had this pin in her hip.

105
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,651
So, he wanted to drop
basketball and get a job.

106
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:05,902
Now these were poor people.

107
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,781
These were, these were hungry
people with real problems.

108
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,533
Understand what I'm saying?

109
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,745
What happened to the kid?

110
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,665
I don't know. He quit.

111
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,584
Just a third stringer,
I didn't need him.

112
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,086
Yeah, Coach,
I'm a first stringer.

113
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,048
Yeah, and you already got
a job working for your old man.

114
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,549
Fact of the matter is,

115
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,343
I should be coming
to you when I need money.

116
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,599
Fine. Uh... thanks a lot, Coach.

117
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:35,892
Hey, don't mention it.

118
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,728
Like I said before,
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

119
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,856
Thanks.

120
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,616
- Scott!
- Oh, hi, Boof.

121
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:53,909
- Hi. You going to work?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,702
- Will you walk with me?
- Catch you later, Boof.

123
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,705
- At the party.
- Bye, Tina... Sheena..?

124
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:58,872
- Tina?
- Tina, Tina.

125
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:02,251
I had the strangest dream last
night, Boof. It was bizarre.

126
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,586
Was I in this one?

127
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,213
Yeah. Yeah, you,
and, and, and Pamela

128
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:07,215
and a bunch of chickens.

129
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,673
Boof, how the hell are ya?

130
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,758
- Say no.
- No!

131
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,885
Great talking to you.

132
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,886
- Chickens?
- Yeah, big chickens.

133
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,805
Giant chickens.
Like fryers, you know?

134
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,141
You know, that guy
was right. We do suck.

135
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,434
No news there.

136
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,313
71-12. I don't even
know what I'm doing out there.

137
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,357
I'm sick of it, Boof.

138
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,568
I'm sick of being so average.

139
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,405
And it's not just basketball.
It's the school...

140
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,616
it's this town, it's everything.

141
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,284
I like Beacontown.

142
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,663
I'd just like my life to change,
you know, I don't wanna end up

143
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,666
working for my dad
at the hardware store.

144
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,417
Your father is a terrific guy.

145
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,337
Boof, look at me.

146
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,382
Now try and be objective.

147
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,384
Am I all right?

148
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,261
I mean,
is anything wrong with me?

149
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,931
You should shower
after basketball.

150
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,057
- I do.
- Then, no.

151
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,101
There's nothing wrong with you.

152
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,935
Well then, uh,

153
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,564
why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

154
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,900
You can do a lot better
than Pamela Wells.

155
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,361
- Like who?
- Don't you have to be at work?

156
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,113
Hey, hey. Did I
say something wrong?

157
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,032
No, no. See you
at the party, okay?

158
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,205
- Hey, Angela.
- Hi Scottie,

159
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,666
how are you doing?
What was the score?

160
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:24,874
Very funny.

161
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,753
...fifty-three, fifty--
What was the score?

162
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,753
Seventy one--

163
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,172
Don't tell me,
I'll lose my count.

164
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,341
Well, down to our
last waffle iron.

165
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,342
You know these
wrenches are made in India?

166
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,511
How do they expect me
to compete with the big boys,

167
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,179
- I'm not Sears and Roebuck.
- I'm not Sears and Roebuck.

168
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,140
Well, I'm not.

169
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,183
You look a little
tired today, Scott.

170
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,020
The coach is not giving
you boy steroids or anything?

171
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:48,774
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

172
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,485
You know, Beacontown
hasn't won a ball game in...

173
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,654
It must be three years.

174
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,113
Ow!

175
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,325
You know, don't take
it personally, Scott.

176
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,577
It's all part of growing up.

177
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,830
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I guess so.

178
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,291
Uh, any deliveries?

179
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,958
Ow!

180
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,335
Yeah.
A teacher at the high school.

181
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:10,003
Some strange
sounding guy called.

182
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,964
Sounded like he was
in a big hurry.

183
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:13,298
Today?

184
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,549
I'm not sure
what I wrote down,

185
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,261
but check the clipboard,
that's what it's there for.

186
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:19,847
Well, it is.

187
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,030
It's broken.

188
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,746
A dog whistle?

189
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,654
Hi, Mr. Thorne.
How are you, sir?

190
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,114
Whoa!

191
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,325
Thanks.

192
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,789
Whoa! What an arm.

193
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,043
Thanks, Mr. Thorne.
I appreciate it.

194
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,045
Oh, hell.

195
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,923
I knew he was out there.

196
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:40,052
I didn't actually hear him,
but I knew he was there.

197
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:43,723
I could only see
a thin white crack of light

198
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,725
which set my bedroom apart...

199
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,225
More sensual,
darling.

200
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,769
We need to feel you,
want to smell you.

201
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,020
Hurt me, hurt me.

202
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,440
...from the dense
and heavy darkness.

203
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,650
But surely
I could feel him.

204
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,860
It was Nick.

205
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,114
What was that?

206
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,742
Sorry, sorry sir.
That, that was me.

207
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:04,826
What do you want from me?

208
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:08,539
Hmm? What do people
want from me?

209
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,999
I am merely trying
to rehearse. Hmm?

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,878
Ah, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

211
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,630
I've got the stuff
that you ordered.

212
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,216
Wait. Are you from
the hardware store?

213
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,426
Uh, yeah.

214
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,386
- Uh.
- Ah!

215
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,516
Uh... Pamela? Excuse me. Um,

216
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,476
are you going
to the party tonight,

217
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,480
because if you are
I'd like to give you a ride.

218
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,523
The paint. My paint.

219
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,735
A can of cocoa,
a can of mauve. Am I right?

220
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,028
Uh, right.

221
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,031
Kirk,
how was my reading?

222
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:46,367
Beautiful, darling.
Very sensual. I'm still in pain.

223
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,953
- Thank you
- Uh, you're welcome.

224
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,581
Listen, about tonight...
I, I mean, I'm serious.

225
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,877
I'd like to take you.
Uh... I've got a van.

226
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,881
Hope your acting's better
than your hook shot, boy.

227
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:00,508
I already have a ride.

228
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,136
Or maybe you were just
acting like a basketball player.

229
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,806
He just
delivers hardware, Mick.

230
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,057
Well, then maybe he should
get back to delivering it.

231
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:09,809
C'mon.

232
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,492
<i>I said mauve.
Not turquoise!</i>

233
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,246
Mr., Mr. Lolley?

234
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,547
Huh, the boss says
I'm to pick up a keg of beer.

235
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,590
- Is that right?
- The boss called you, right?

236
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,760
- Can't say he did.
- Well, hot damn.

237
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,678
The boss is throwing a big bash

238
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,889
for one of the boys
down at the gravel pit.

239
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,809
He just got paroled.

240
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,734
Well, I've got,
uh, plenty of bread.

241
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,449
Here. There's a little
extra for you.

242
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,583
Got to see your ID... sport.

243
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,191
- I don't even like beer.
- Never... say... die.

244
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:49,825
Dad?

245
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,953
Uh... What would
you say if I said

246
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,748
I was thinking
of quitting the basketball team?

247
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,918
- Quit the team?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,210
That's pretty drastic, isn't it?

249
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,254
I mean, you're not
the worst player they've got.

250
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,713
You know,
your mother always said

251
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:04,882
you could do
anything you wanted to.

252
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,508
Yeah, I know.

253
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,720
Was just thinking
of doing something else.

254
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,096
Like what?

255
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,474
School play?

256
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:16,810
Well... Theatre has
its place, I suppose.

257
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,104
What about your commitment
to the team? To the School?

258
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:20,981
Dad?

259
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:26,070
Has anything ever happened
to you that was so weird?

260
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,113
Maybe it's time
you and I had a little chat.

261
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey Mr. Howard. How's
the king of nuts and bolts?

262
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,870
- Stiles, nice shirt.
- Hey thanks. C'mon, we're late.

263
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,331
Boof going with you?

264
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,541
Oh, yeah. I don't know
how she's getting there.

265
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,878
- Uh, is this okay?
- No, don't worry, I'll get it.

266
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,420
- All right, have a good time.
- Yeah.

267
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,255
Be careful.

268
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,010
Come on.

269
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,846
Hey, hey listen, Stiles?

270
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,891
Do you know anything about
a rash that's going around?

271
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,433
Why, you looking
to catch something?

272
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,894
No, but I'm serious.

273
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:03,691
No... but I heard Mr. Murphy,
you know, the shop teacher?

274
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:04,692
Yeah.

275
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,777
Got his dick caught
in the vacuum cleaner.

276
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,948
Forget I asked.

277
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,542
Stiles, you're crazy.

278
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,085
No, it's not crazy.

279
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,253
It's perfect.

280
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,464
Now you just stick this
in your pocket like this.

281
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,050
All right? You go in there,
you don't say anything except...

282
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,594
"Give me a keg, buddy."
And you pay for it.

283
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,722
That way he can't
say you robbed him.

284
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,347
You know I'd do this myself,

285
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,308
but that old guy in there
already kicked me out.

286
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,981
Give me the gun.
Give me the money.

287
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,151
I'm gonna try

288
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,068
and buy it. That's it.

289
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,403
- No, no, Scott,
- That's it, Stiles.

290
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,864
This guys is a ball buster
and it won't work.

291
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,075
- It won't work.
- That's it.

292
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:08,422
Never... say... die.

293
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,674
No, no, no,
no, no not that.

294
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,010
Yeah. No, no I,
I think I'll leave it.

295
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,553
No, no, no, no.
Thanks a lot, anyways.

296
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,972
Bye.

297
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,641
Do you have
any more of that melon liqueur?

298
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,477
My sister really liked that.

299
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,105
That's all. Yes, thank you.

300
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,484
Hey, Debbie,
are you coming?

301
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,862
Yes, listen, I would...

302
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,199
Hi.

303
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,327
Hi.

304
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,623
Uh, I'd like
a keg of beer, please?

305
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,084
You don't say?

306
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,045
Yeah. Uh, how much is that?

307
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,380
Do you have any ID, sonny?

308
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,384
You little bastards
just won't give up, will you?

309
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,178
Listen, no ID, no goddamn beer.

310
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,056
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

311
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:08,732
Give me a keg of beer.

312
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,284
And these.

313
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,288
<i>♪  Finding my way ♪</i>

314
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,543
<i>♪ Ooh ooh ooh yeah ♪</i>

315
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,175
What did you say
to that guy in the store?

316
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,012
Just, uh, "Give me a keg."

317
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,682
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

318
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,894
Well, Lewis. This is it.
Tonight's the night.

319
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,354
Pamela Wells is gonna
be there and so am I.

320
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,607
- And so is Mick.
- He's not going to be there.

321
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,899
Of course he's
going to be there.

322
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,984
They're going together,
aren't they?

323
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,402
No, they're not,
they're not going together.

324
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,363
Mick is like
20 years old.

325
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,280
Lewis.

326
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,531
The only reason
he's still in high school

327
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,824
- is cause he did time!
- I'm telling ya.

328
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,325
- Time! Jail!
- Lewis, I'm telling ya.

329
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,410
They're
not going together.

330
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,452
Forget Pamela Wells.

331
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,745
They're
not going together.

332
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,956
He's a total psycho.

333
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,958
Why don't you go for Boof?

334
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,003
- She likes you.
- You sound like my dad.

335
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,421
Pull over.

336
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,214
Pull over!

337
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,009
- Trust me.
- Okay, all right.

338
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:17,967
Together.

339
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,343
I'm not
even listening anymore. I--

340
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,262
Would you just--

341
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,597
Lewis, man,
once and for all,

342
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,308
once and for all
they are not going out.

343
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,766
- Yes, they are.
- Not.

344
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,226
- You're mistaken.
- They are too. You're crazy.

345
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,146
Lewis? Lewis? Lewis?
Take my wheels.

346
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,813
I don't
even have my license yet.

347
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,191
Oh, c'mon. Just do it.

348
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,150
Look Stiles,
let's just go to the party,

349
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,611
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

350
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:36,820
Surf's up.

351
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,908
- Drive out in front of us.
- Yeah, not too close.

352
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,203
- What are you guys gonna do?
- Lewis! Will you just do it?

353
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:47,873
Kids.

354
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,500
All right, okay, listen.
I'm gonna go slow, all right?

355
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
don't worry about a thing.

356
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,964
We've got everything
under control.

357
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,635

You got some kind of rash?

423
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,084
Matchmaker lady, the hat.
All right!

424
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:09,925

Whoa, help me Rhonda!

425
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,432
Okay, what do I have to do?

426
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,684
Just read out a little name
on a little piece of paper,

427
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,728
will yea, beauty?

428
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,730
- It says "Chubby".
- Whoa!

429
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,073
Yay!

430
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,581
All right, Chubby baby.

431
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:45,128
You have to eat
this whole bowl of Jell-O.

432
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,716
- Well, what do I have to do?
- Hold the Jell-O.

433
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,785
All right, next up is...

434
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,168
- Boof!
- Boof! Boof! Boof!

435
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:31,007
It's, uh, Scott.

436
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:35,262
Whoa!

437
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:40,266
Booferino gets the Howard boy.

438
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,893
I don't know if this
is such a good idea, you know?

439
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,229
You're gonna love it. In fact,
it's the grand prize, okay?

440
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,483
Hubbaba-ba-ba-ba.

441
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:54,530
Two minutes. Anything goes,
baby. And don't disappoint us.

442
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:14,551
It's, uh,
kinda funny that you got me.

443
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,511
I lied. I got Malcolm.

444
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,514
Uh,
Malcolm's a good guy.

445
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,977
You can come a little closer.
I promise I won't bite.

446
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,648
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

447
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,988
All right, Matchmaker Lady.

448
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,294
Now, all you have to do is
take this cup to Thorne's house,

449
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,587
tell him you're
from the Board of Health

450
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,257
and you just wanna check
his, uh, blood sugar.

451
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:01,181
Boof, uh,
I feel kinda weird.

452
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,266
How do I feel?

453
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:29,792
- What is this?
- Mick, you gotta see this.

454
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,378
See what?
I don't see anything. Come on.

455
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,593
Scott, aren't you
getting a little bit rough?

456
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,806
Hey, your fingernails!

457
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,981
- It's awful quiet in there.
- Ooh!

458
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,402
You guys think they're dead?

459
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,528
Yes!

460
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,365
Hey, there's only
one way to find out.

461
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,502
So, tell us. What's it like
coming out of the closet?

462
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:20,635
- It was unexpected.
- Ooh!

463
00:29:58,715 --> 00:29:59,507
Scott?

464
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,392
Scott?

465
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,173
Jeez Louise.

466
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,677
- <i>Scott? Can I come in?</i>
- Ah!

467
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,303
Uh, no, Dad.

468
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,558
Uh, no. I'm, uh,
I am doing something in here.

469
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,979
- I'll say.
<i>- You may be surprised.</i>

470
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,106
<i>Whatever it is, son,
you can tell me.</i>

471
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,357
<i>I'll understand.</i>

472
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,819
No, Dad.

473
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,780
Ah! No, not this time.

474
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,949
<i>Scott Howard,
this is your father speaking.</i>

475
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,743
<i>Now open this door
right this minute!</i>

476
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,662
Okay, Dad.

477
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,416
You asked for it.

478
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,354
An explanation is
probably long overdue.

479
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,523
An explanation?

480
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:25,028
Jesus Christ, Dad!
An explanation? Look at me.

481
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:26,738
Look at you.

482
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,280
It's not as bad as it looks.

483
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:29,741
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, Dad.

484
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,035
You knew about this?

485
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:35,246
You knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

486
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,373
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.

487
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,626
Sometimes it skips a generation.

488
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,295
I was hoping
it would pass you by.

489
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,547
Well, Dad, it didn't pass me by.

490
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,717
It landed on my face.

491
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,094
What the hell am I gonna do?

492
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,853
Scott, we really need
to talk about this.

493
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,773
<i>Forget it, Dad.
I don't wanna talk. Go away.</i>

494
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,431
Tough night, huh?

495
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,142
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

496
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,268
On top of everything else,

497
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,771
there was
a full moon last night.

498
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,148
Well, I, uh, meant to talk
to you about that last evening,

499
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:48,152
but you were kinda upset.

500
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,573
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.

501
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,492
Looks like you can use it.

502
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,285
That'll help.

503
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:03,709
Look Scott, being what we are
is not without its problems,

504
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,086
but it's not all bad either.

505
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,878
Tell me about it.

506
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,964
Well, for one thing, you're
going to be able to do a lot

507
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,048
of things the other guys aren't.

508
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:14,053
Oh, uh, like chase cars
and bite the mailman?

509
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,181
When you want it,
you're gonna have great power.

510
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,394
And with great power
goes a greater responsibility.

511
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,520
Your mother and I learned
to live with this thing

512
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,481
- and so can you.
- And what if I can't?

513
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:27,816
I can look forward

514
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:30,570
to a life of stealing babies
in the middle of the night.

515
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,613
And, uh, killing chickens.

516
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:35,866
Fearing full moons,
dodging silver bullets.

517
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,660
Well, thank you, Dad,
but no thanks.

518
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,620
Don't believe all that
stuff you see in the movies.

519
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,832
With certain
obvious exceptions...

520
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,418
werewolves are people
just like anyone else.

521
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,338
What I'm trying to say is...

522
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,175
the werewolf is a part of you...

523
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,469
but that doesn't change
what you have inside.

524
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,179
Look, Dad, I've got
a bad outside hook shot.

525
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,638
I'm allergic to eggs.

526
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,601
I've got a six-dollar haircut.
I mean, I have problems.

527
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,853
I don't need this one!

528
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,690
I gotta get to school.

529
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:14,405
That went well.

530
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:33,925
- Hello.
- Hi.

531
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,514
There's something
different about you.

532
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:41,516
That's nice.

533
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,684
Did you change your hair?

534
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,814
Missed you
at lunch today, Scott.

535
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:52,860
Oh, yeah. Hi, Boof.
Uh, sorry, I forgot. I forgot.

536
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,986
Well, I have to go
study my lines.

537
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,658
Kirk... Mr. Lolley...
he's so demanding.

538
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

539
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,507
How's it going, Stiles?

540
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,677
The twins were abandoned

541
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,679
and surely would
have died in the wilderness

542
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,057
if they hadn't been
saved by a, by a what?

543
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,309
A miracle?

544
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,395
Yes, I suppose, but...

545
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,565
what form did this
particular miracle take?

546
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:32,066
Scott Howard?

547
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,823
Um...

548
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:46,247
Very amusing Scott,
but you are correct.

549
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,168
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf.

550
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:53,963
A she wolf. Wolf. Wolf. Wolf.

551
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,006
Wolfe!

552
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,967
Ah!... choo!

553
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,011
Thomas Wolfe.

554
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,054
Don't you people
ever read what I assign you?

555
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,974
"Look Homeward Angel". Scott,

556
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,644
it's a book. By Thomas Wolfe.

557
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,980
Wolfe. Wolfe.

558
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:12,899
Scott?

559
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:16,819
Oh, come on, Scott.

560
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,197
It's a lot simpler
than it looks.

561
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:20,907
Uh, uh!

562
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,160
Okay.

563
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:32,793
Hmm!

564
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,760
Just try, Scott.

565
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,542
Ah, it's wet. You can't go in.

566
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,255
Oh,
that's wet, too!

567
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:53,207
Don't change, don't change.
Oh, stay calm, stay calm.

568
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,542
Stay calm.

569
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,216
Little far from
your side of the building,

570
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:04,802
- aren't you, Howard?
- No.

571
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:08,139
I mean, yeah, yes, Sir,
but the halls were wet.

572
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,516
- Let me see your hands.
- Sir?

573
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,312
Let me see your hands now.

574
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:25,031
You wouldn't happen to have
a marker on you, would you?

575
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,414
No. Uh, no, no, no, Sir.

576
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,166
I've got my eyes on you

577
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,376
and if you ever
get out of line...

578
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,922
Uh, Yeah, uh, I gotta go.

579
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:02,943
Hey, what are you doing?

580
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,822
Hey, big brother keeps a stash
out here for emergencies.

581
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:08,824
Are you listening?

582
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,243
Listen, Stiles, uh, I,

583
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:12,786
I gotta talk
to you about something,

584
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:13,912
cause it's making me nuts.

585
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,414
Yeah, well, I knew you
But if it's that intense,

586
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:17,541
I'll need a solid buzz
to think clearly.

587
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:21,629
Well, look, I, I,
I wouldn't even, uh...

588
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,214
I wouldn't even
mention it to you,

589
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,050
except that I
gotta talk to someone.

590
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,009
Wait a minute, are you
gonna tell me you're a fag?

591
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,595
I mean, if you're gonna
tell me you're a fag...

592
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,263
I don't think I can handle it.

593
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,100
No... I'm not a fag.

594
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,603
I'm, uh, a werewolf.

595
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,149
Where would that
scumbag keep it?

596
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,245
Scott?

597
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,543
- Scottie?
- Stiles, it's me.

598
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,805
What do you,
what do you think?

599
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:18,436
Can you do that...
anytime you want?

600
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:23,065
Uh... Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, I just did.

601
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:25,108
But, you see, sometimes,

602
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:27,153
it happens
when I don't want it to.

603
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:30,656
What can I say?

604
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,619
You're beautiful.

605
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,292
Hey, uh...

606
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:45,463
What can a teen wolf do?

607
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,257
I can smell
what you're looking for.

608
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:50,092
The stash?

609
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:55,097
No, I checked there.

610
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,775
Stiles.

611
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,320
Stiles! This is just
between you and me, okay?

612
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah. TW.

613
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,244
Look at you.

614
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,246
Tw, you're gonna be glad
that you came to me with this.

615
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,916
Yes, because
with the right angles,

616
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,335
man, we're gonna
turn this into something...

617
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:27,796
- Monstrous.
- Stiles.

618
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,132
Stiles.

619
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,011
Shoot it, shoot it.

620
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:36,679
No way, no way, no way.

621
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,056
Don't foul me,
don't foul me now.

622
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:40,809
- No, no, no.
- Here we go, woo-hoo.

623
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:43,646
- That--Yeah!
- Knock them down.

624
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,111
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi.

625
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,197
Boof came over
for a little one on one.

626
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,240
She's killing me.

627
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,743
What?

628
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,328
What's so funny?

629
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,540
Nothing. We were just chatting.
Do you mind?

630
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,792
No, no. Hey, why should I mind?

631
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:09,296
Well, I gotta get going.
Would you like to walk me home?

632
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:12,675
Uh, Boof, I just got here.

633
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:14,760
Scott!

634
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:17,137
Yeah.

635
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,805
Thanks, Harold,
thanks for the game.

636
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:19,764
Thanks for everything.

637
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,100
You better work
on that jump-shot.

638
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,351
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

639
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,941
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

640
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:38,909
Ha! Get in!

641
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,039
So, you guys
were chatting?

642
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,084
Harold Howard
and his famous chats.

643
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,211
Uh... What did he say?

644
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,338
Hmm, he
just mentioned that...

645
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,465
you were thinking
of quitting basketball

646
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,092
to work on a school play.

647
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,220
- Yeah.
- I can see why.

648
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:00,347
She's very pretty, Scott.

649
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:05,769
But she has a boyfriend.
A very large boyfriend.

650
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:08,438
Look,
it doesn't matter anyway.

651
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:09,647
Cause the way
things are going now,

652
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,692
it would be better if I
just stayed away from everyone.

653
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:12,901
Even me?

654
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,281
I couldn't get rid
of you if I tried.

655
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,410
- What?
- Do you remember?

656
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:23,912
How old were we? Six?

657
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:26,164
- Ha, five.
- I wanted to run away from home

658
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,541
but you wouldn't
let me go alone.

659
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,460
- I was afraid you'd get lost.
- Yeah, but I didn't get lost.

660
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,378
We just walked
around the block because

661
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,590
our parents wouldn't
let us cross the street.

662
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:36,966
God, I thought they were
gonna kill us when we got home.

663
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,928
I know, but then when we did
nobody even knew we were gone.

664
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,847
- Did you ever tell anybody?
- Nope.

665
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,182
Me neither.

666
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:50,856
Scott...

667
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,984
if you ever need
someone to talk to...

668
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:55,819
if something's bothering you...

669
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,655
I'll understand.

670
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,785
Uh, not this time, Boof.

671
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,204
You wouldn't understand.

672
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,625
- I've gotta go.
- Yeah. Bye.

673
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,565
Okay, now, here's the drill.

674
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,275
Play 'em man for man.

675
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,528
- You know who you've got.
- Hey baby, ten hut.

676
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:40,321
Nice haircut over there.
Be all that you could be.

677
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:41,782
How was grenade, man?
Hey, Lewy?

678
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,032
Lewy, what's going on here?

679
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,743
Is the president
here today or something?

680
00:45:46,245 --> 00:45:49,373
- Good luck, Scott.
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.

681
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:58,756
Hey, look at it this way, guys,

682
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,342
it'll all be over
in less than hour.

683
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:02,302
Any strategy
against Meechum, Coach?

684
00:46:03,137 --> 00:46:04,053
Hey, you guys are great,

685
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:05,264
you've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

686
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,350
Now, go out there
and give them hell.

687
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:09,601
Go!

688
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,069
I'd say that's a foul.
Let's go.

689
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:21,989
Come on, set it up.

690
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,409
C'mon, Scottie,
up the line, boy. You can do it.

691
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:40,549
Go and get me some salt.

692
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:43,510
Salt!

693
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,431
Flick the ball back to him.
Easy, easy. Come on.

694
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,142
Scottie, Scottie.

695
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:53,145
Easy!

696
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:54,813
Easy.

697
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:02,237
Yeah!

698
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:13,290
C'mon, let's go!

699
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,982
- All right, guys?
- All right,

700
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:03,609

Hey, I didn't know.

719
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:37,535

- Well, Scott Howard.
- Hey, Boof.

763
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,834
Aren't you afraid
of disappointing all your fans?

764
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:14,335
Look, Boof, I can't help it

765
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:16,046
if the whole town
has gone wolf crazy.

766
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:18,089
I mean, uh,
this wasn't my idea.

767
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,051
- There are some advantages.
- None!

768
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:23,469
All sizes. No waiting,
everybody. Check it out.

769
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,596
Right over here. Check it out.

770
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:28,058
Hey Scotto, tip of the iceberg,
baby. We are cleaning up!

771
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:30,851
Boof! I got something for you.
There you go, honey.

772
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:33,396
Here we go. Check it out.
All sizes, no waiting.

773
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:37,192
- Elegant.
- Scott! Scott!

774
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,318
Listen to this.

775
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,320
Kirk wants you
to be in the play.

776
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:45,199
He does? Wait a minute, Pamela.
What about basketball?

777
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,702
It won't interfere.
It's a small part.

778
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:48,703
Just for you.

779
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:52,082
Here, Pamela, this is for you.

780
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:53,541
It's too big for me.

781
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,753
There are some advantages,
Scott, admit it.

782
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:07,138
You can murder my family.

783
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,599
You can ravish my body.

784
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,309
But I beg you

785
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,145
with all that
is decent and holy,

786
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:16,773
don't destroy my plantation.

787
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:25,282
Sergeant! Burn the fields.

788
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,702
And when you're done
with that, burn the house.

789
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:33,623
Ah, yeah! Uh, wolf, wolf,

790
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,667
wolf person,
whatever your name is.

791
00:55:36,293 --> 00:55:38,003
That was really...

792
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:39,212
Thanks, babe, I love ya.

793
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:40,463
...something.

794
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:44,759
Come in.

795
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:48,638
Hi.

796
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:50,724
Close the door please.

797
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,183
Uh, yeah.

798
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:05,613
Relax... We're just one
big happy family in the theatre.

799
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:08,616
Yep.

800
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:14,456
What happened
to the wolf?

801
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,083
Do you just change
back and forth...

802
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,002
whenever you feel like it?

803
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,755
Uh, sure.

804
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:25,090
Well, uh, sometimes I,
I have to get kinda worked up

805
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:28,511
to be the wolf, but, uh,
it's not too hard.

806
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,891
What do you think about
to get worked up?

807
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,978
Ah, different things.

808
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:44,361
Wolves aren't
supposed to be shy.

809
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:51,993
Uh, Pamela? What are you doing?

810
00:56:54,788 --> 00:56:58,124
Oh, you are an animal.

811
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,271
Strike!

812
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:23,400
Five in a row.

813
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,246
Okay.

814
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,250
Did you know
he was gonna be here?

815
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,132
We had such a nice day today.
Don't spoil it.

816
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,347
Okay. Got it.

817
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:57,684
Nice. Good, okay.
Good form.

818
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,060
Nice approach.

819
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,067
Oh, poo!

820
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,319
Boy, that was nice and warm.

821
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:12,157
Okay.

822
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:14,576
Address the ball.

823
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,412
Okay, tuck in your tummy.

824
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,374
That's good. Okay.
Pamela, Pamela, Pamela.

825
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,544
Here we go.
Are you ready? Okay.

826
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:26,629
Hey, creep, that's my girl.

827
00:58:26,796 --> 00:58:28,173
Don't touch her again.

828
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:30,341
She's
my date tonight, Pal.

829
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,011
You don't scare me, freak.

830
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:37,056
Underneath all that hair
you're still a dork, Scott.

831
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,351
I've handled your kind before.

832
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,937
Your mommy used to steal
chickens out of the backyard,

833
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:44,856
till I blew her
head off with the shotgun.

834
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,191
Right, Scott?

835
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,208
So, does, uh...

836
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,877
does that guy Mick
always act like that?

837
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:09,214
You could hardly
blame him. He is my boyfriend.

838
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,674
You mean
was your boyfriend?

839
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,759
Is my boyfriend.

840
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,012
But, uh, what about us?

841
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:17,805
What about us?

842
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:22,977
Uh, well, this afternoon.
In your dressing room.

843
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:24,270
Yeah?

844
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:26,856
Yeah.

845
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:30,360
Well, you see the spring dance
is coming up and I--

846
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:31,903
And I already told you,

847
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,738
I'm going
to the dance with Mick.

848
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,117
Hey, Chubaroo,
nice game, guy.

849
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:20,118
Yeah.

850
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,080
- At least we're winning.
- You mean he's winning.

851
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,000
When do the rest of us
get hands on the ball?

852
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,834
What good is being
in the championship

853
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:30,253
if none of us get to play?

854
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:32,296
It doesn't matter
how you play the game,

855
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:33,506
it's whether you win or lose.

856
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:35,883
And even that doesn't make
all that much difference.

857
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:37,927
Hey, guys.
How about a celebration, huh?

858
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,511
Chubby, ice cream sundae--

859
01:00:39,512 --> 01:00:41,889
Ah, I'm on a diet,
Scott, remember?

860
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:44,434
Brad? Glass of milk?

861
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,771
I don't get it, coach.
What's their problem?

862
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:50,940
Let me give you a little advice.

863
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,900
There's three rules
that I live by.

864
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,028
Never get less than
12 hours sleep,

865
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,403
Never play cards with a guy

866
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:58,239
who's got the same
first name as a city,

867
01:00:58,656 --> 01:00:59,656
and never go near a lady

868
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,784
who's got a tattoo
of a dagger on her body.

869
01:01:02,285 --> 01:01:05,371
Now, you stick with that,
everything else is cream cheese.

870
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:07,415
Great game there, Scottie.

871
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:11,794
Thanks, Coach!

872
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,346
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

873
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:23,931
Stiles?

874
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,559
Stiles, where the hell
did you get this?

875
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,019
Hey, Harry's Used Cars, man,

876
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,064
we traded in the
Nova, even swap.

877
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:32,981
Even swap, get out of here.

878
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:34,441
How much extra
did you pay for this?

879
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:35,777
It's an even swap.

880
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:39,321
For certain considerations.

881
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:40,864
- What?
- Lookey here!

882
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:44,077
- Ah, Stiles.
- Hey, surf's up?

883
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:47,288
Yeah, yeah,
surf is definitely up.

884
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:49,540
Why, let's go
pick up Lewis, okay?

885
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:52,627
What?

886
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,546
Stiles, come on, what is it with
Lewis? He's avoiding me right?

887
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:57,340
He's scared of me.

888
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:02,845
Look, man, we've got fine new
wheels, we got some good tunes

889
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:06,224
and a total disregard
for public safety.

890
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:08,475
You're right. Okay, let's go.

891
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:09,560
- All right, baby.
- Surf's up.

892
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:10,687
Wait a minute.

893
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,648

909
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,394
Missed you at the hardware store
the last few days.

910
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,522
Uh, yeah. Sorry, uh,

911
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:38,941
I was with Stiles
this afternoon.

912
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:40,985
I know.

913
01:03:42,904 --> 01:03:43,696
You saw?

914
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:45,740
Yeah, I saw.

915
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:48,575
Unless that was another
werewolf doing a handstand

916
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:51,454
on top of Stiles' wolf mobile.
And making a fool of himself?

917
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:55,082
Look, Dad.

918
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:59,879
I'm trying to get
a grip on this. I really am.

919
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:02,799
Is Thorne still on your back?

920
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,675
Yeah, Thorne...

921
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:08,930
some Neanderthal named Mick
and the entire basketball team.

922
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:11,974
Well, you've dug your own hole
with those fella's, but, uh...

923
01:04:12,475 --> 01:04:13,976
this Thorne business
is my fault.

924
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,730
What, uh,
what do you mean your fault?

925
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:20,566
Goes back a few years.

926
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:21,984
As you know...

927
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,362
I loved your mother
since we were kids.

928
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:26,906
We always knew
we were meant for each other.

929
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:30,785
But for some reason Rusty Thorne
set his cap for her too.

930
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,329
And no matter what we tried,
he just wouldn't go away.

931
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:35,456
One night...

932
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,208
things got
a little physical and--

933
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,168
And you turned into a werewolf.

934
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:41,462
Out of anger, Scott.

935
01:04:41,963 --> 01:04:43,923
I turned into
the werewolf out of anger.

936
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:46,843
Right in front of
his beady little eyes.

937
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,636
Was he scared?

938
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:49,929
Scared?

939
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:53,683
He lost control
of his bodily functions.

940
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:56,435
Ah. I wish I could've seen that.

941
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,771
It wasn't a very
nice thing to do.

942
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,439
But it worked.

943
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,901
After that, he never bothered
your mother and me....

944
01:05:05,987 --> 01:05:06,904
But to this day...

945
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:10,199
I don't know who was
the most frightened that night.

946
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,578
Rusty Thorne... or me.

947
01:05:15,538 --> 01:05:17,039
You gotta get a hold of it, son.

948
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,728
- Morning.
- Boof.

949
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:41,564
Uh, what's up?

950
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:42,982
Nothing.

951
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,360
Why does anything have to be up?

952
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:48,738
I just thought I'd walk
to school with you.

953
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:49,864
Ah.

954
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,332
Got any plans
for the spring dance?

955
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,336
No, uh,
hadn't given it much thought.

956
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,421
I'm surprised
they haven't decided to call it

957
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:07,590
"Teen Wolf Ball".

958
01:06:11,636 --> 01:06:14,055
Will you, uh,
go with me to the dance?

959
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,557
I'll think about it.

960
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:18,601
Is that a yes?

961
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:21,687
Yes. On one condition.

962
01:06:22,146 --> 01:06:24,774
You take me to the dance.

963
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,775
I thought we just established--

964
01:06:26,776 --> 01:06:28,527
You, Scott Howard.

965
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:30,446
Not the wolf.

966
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:33,658
No, no.

967
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,409
Look, I gotta be the wolf,

968
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,037
I mean,
that's what everyone expects.

969
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:39,246
Is that what you want?

970
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,332
Everybody likes the wolf.

971
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,710
All right, almost everybody.

972
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:46,419
You said it yourself.

973
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,966
I mean, if I go as Scott Howard
I'm gonna be average.

974
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,344
And dammit! Why do I have
to be like everybody else?

975
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,513
That's not a problem
for you anymore.

976
01:06:57,515 --> 01:06:59,350
And I guess, I don't have
a date for the dance.

977
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:01,894
Look, Boof.

978
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,564
I'm sorry... I can't.

979
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:09,485
Hey, listen, uh...

980
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:11,904
You'll till dance
with me, won't ya?

981
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:15,074
Even if I'm a werewolf?

982
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,704
Yeah, I'll still dance with you.

983
01:07:21,414 --> 01:07:23,624
- And feed me grapes?
- Don't push your luck!

984
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:25,001
Tickle my paws?

985
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:00,536

Hey, Boof, I am what I am.

1032
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:05,846
Whoa, Boof.

1033
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:10,726
All I said was
"I might wanna dance with him."

1034
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:13,145
You can't possibly
take him seriously.

1035
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,356
Not unless you're planning
on having his puppies.

1036
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:27,660
I want Scott for just a half
hour, I really missed him.

1037
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:50,140
<i>♪ Ow! ♪</i>

1038
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:08,075

1039
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:12,913
Stay away from Pamela,
she's mine.

1040
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:17,041
Stick with your own kind freak.
Like that little tramp.

1041
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:21,255
Mick, watch out!

1042
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:30,306
What are you all laughing at?

1043
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:33,224
Get back here!
I'm not done with you!

1044
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:34,768
Your just some kind of animal.

1045
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:37,271
Freak! Come on, freak.

1046
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:39,648
Get back here. Let go of me.

1047
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,941
Let go!

1048
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:44,028
Get back I'm gonna rip your
head right off. Get back here.

1049
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:45,362
Come on, freak.

1050
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,364
I'm not through with you yet.

1051
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:51,618
Come back here freak.
This isn't done by a long shot.

1052
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:53,704
Get back in here, freak.

1053
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:58,792
Come back here, freak.
We haven't settled this yet!

1054
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:10,346
Hold it!

1055
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:18,312
Now you've done it.

1056
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:22,691
You don't know
how long I have waited...

1057
01:13:23,817 --> 01:13:26,362
to get you right
where I have you.

1058
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:32,493
You're never going
to play basketball again!

1059
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:34,161
You know why?

1060
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:37,581
Because you're not going
to be here anymore, that's why.

1061
01:13:38,749 --> 01:13:41,584
You're out of here Mr. Howard.
And don't you try--

1062
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:44,880
Thorne, go home, son.

1063
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:46,632
Go ahead.

1064
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:48,384
I'll handle this.

1065
01:13:58,936 --> 01:14:01,563
You, uh, never learn,
do you, Rusty?

1066
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:02,940
You stay away from me.

1067
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:08,153
I want you
to leave my son alone.

1068
01:14:09,113 --> 01:14:13,158
He's a good kid. He's just
having a tough time right now.

1069
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:18,122
Okay?

1070
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,008
I knew I could
count on you, Rusty.

1071
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:38,267
You can murder my family.

1072
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:40,519
You can ravish my body.

1073
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:44,356
But I beg you with all
that is decent and holy,

1074
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:47,151
don't destroy my plantation.

1075
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,698
Sergeant? Burn the fields...

1076
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,950
Hold it, hold it, hold it,
hold it. Hold it, baby.

1077
01:14:55,951 --> 01:14:57,201
- ...down the house.
- Whoa!

1078
01:14:57,202 --> 01:14:59,328
Hey! Hold it, uh,
hold it right there, babe.

1079
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:02,249
Listen.

1080
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,918
This is a,
a full-dress rehearsal.

1081
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,463
We need to see the wolf.
So wolf out, huh,

1082
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:09,923
wolf up, wolf it.
Whatever you do.

1083
01:15:10,132 --> 01:15:11,133
Uh, <i>pronto amigo.</i>

1084
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:13,635
Mr. Lolley, uh...

1085
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,847
I've been doing some thinking
and I decided that I'd...

1086
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:18,806
rather play the part as me.

1087
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:20,642
- Whoa.
- Well, play it.

1088
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:22,978
- Play it as myself.
- Well, that...

1089
01:15:23,854 --> 01:15:25,272
That wouldn't
be theatre, would it?

1090
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,025
See, no one wants to see you.

1091
01:15:30,486 --> 01:15:33,906
Well, like I said,
I'd rather play it like this.

1092
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:36,074
Okay, I see.

1093
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:38,911
How am I
gonna put this to you? Uh...

1094
01:15:40,245 --> 01:15:43,624
Look at it this
way no wolf, hmm, no wolf,

1095
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,877
uh, no part. What do you think?

1096
01:15:58,263 --> 01:15:59,848
Wow. Bummer, huh?

1097
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:03,977
Hey, Scottie.

1098
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:07,523
Well, look at it this way, Boof.

1099
01:16:07,898 --> 01:16:09,607
At least I'll have
my Friday nights free.

1100
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:11,401
Even if you're not
gonna be the wolf anymore,

1101
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:12,902
do you have to quit
the basketball team?

1102
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:14,655
Oh, c'mon, Boof,
are you kidding?

1103
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:17,574
Look, you've seen me
play basketball. I suck.

1104
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:21,035
They want the wolf,
I can't give it to them.

1105
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,495
Hey, wait a minute. Wait,
wait just a minute.

1106
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:23,413
What's going on here?

1107
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:25,082
What are you guys talking about?

1108
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,293
Talking about
the wolf, Stiles.

1109
01:16:28,919 --> 01:16:30,337
I can't do it anymore.

1110
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:31,713
You saw what happened.

1111
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:34,298
- Scott, are you crazy?
- Yeah, I think maybe I am.

1112
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,259
Scott, you've got
the championship basketball game

1113
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,761
coming up
in less than four hours.

1114
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:39,470
Man, you've got
everyone depending on you.

1115
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:40,721
- Yeah, Stiles--
- What are you gonna do?

1116
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:43,892
Let down your, your, your team?
Your school? This whole town?

1117
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:45,477
What about me?

1118
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:48,689
I've got a very large investment
going on over here, Scott...

1119
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:50,982
Hey, Scott, do it for me.

1120
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:54,778
I gotta go, man.

1121
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:56,697
Scott, help me out.

1122
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,949
Do the right thing.

1123
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:05,080
That's all I wanna do, Stiles.
That's all I wanna do.

1124
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,396
Boo!

1125
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:38,739
Boo!

1126
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:41,992
Time!

1127
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:45,370
Chubby! Chubby, get time.

1128
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:47,623
Come here.

1129
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:50,584
- See that?
- Boo!

1130
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:52,836
Come on.

1131
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:00,552
That's
a purple heart, kid.

1132
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:07,476
Smart basketball, Brad,
taking a charge like that.

1133
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:53,271
So where's the wolf?

1134
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:58,150
- Uh! Not today, coach. No wolf.
- Wolf, wolf, wolf.

1135
01:18:58,151 --> 01:18:59,569
Oh, good idea.
Wait until the second half.

1136
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,986
Build up their confidence.

1137
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:04,616
Coach.
Look, coach... no wolf!

1138
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:06,659
Not now, not ever.

1139
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,247
I wanna play,
but I gotta be myself.

1140
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:14,543
Okay, but we're gonna get
our brains beat in, you know?

1141
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:22,800
You sure you won't
change your mind?

1142
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:24,385
I don't wanna go back
out there. I've had it.

1143
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:25,971
Yeah, this is all
your fault, Howard.

1144
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:28,514
I think we can take these guys.

1145
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:29,515
That's terrific, Scott,

1146
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:30,809
now when do we
get to see the wolf?

1147
01:19:30,976 --> 01:19:32,310
No, Chub, I mean it.

1148
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:34,813
I think we can win this.

1149
01:19:35,689 --> 01:19:37,441
Look, this is the championship.

1150
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,819
Now, it doesn't matter how
we got here, we're here.

1151
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:43,404
If we're gonna win,
we gotta pull it off ourselves,

1152
01:19:43,405 --> 01:19:44,698
we don't need the wolf.

1153
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:58,336
You're dead!

1154
01:20:07,596 --> 01:20:08,388
Shoot.

1155
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:09,765
Shoot it.

1156
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:13,768
Shoot it. Shoot!

1157
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:15,020
Shoot it!

1158
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:17,856
Shoot it, fat boy!

1159
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:26,114
