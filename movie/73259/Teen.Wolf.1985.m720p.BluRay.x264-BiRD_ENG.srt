1
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,542
Time.

2
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,094
You guys suck.

3
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,215
No, really?

4
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,972
You're looking good.
Nothing to worry about. It's fine.

5
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,020
Hot, isn't it?
Shouldn't have gotten in his way, Scottie.

6
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,610
- Looking good out there, babe.
- How would you know, Stiles?

7
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:22,277
- You want to forfeit the game?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

8
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,651
- No.
- No?

9
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,198
My players have
league scoring records at stake.

10
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,830
If we quit now you can beat the traffic.

11
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:35,340
- There's a lot to learn from losing.
- We'll play if it's that big a deal to you.

12
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,965
Over here, over here!

13
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,885
Push it up.

14
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,933
- It's not going too well, is it?
- Look at their sneakers.

15
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,643
If our guys had sneakers like that
who knows what they could do.

16
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,694
Shoot.

17
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,617
We're all open.

18
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,986
That fat kid's got a great arm.

19
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,873
Over here. Pass it.

20
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,289
Forget it, dork.

21
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,159
Nice try.

22
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,994
I wanna get out of here.

23
00:04:55,671 --> 00:05:00,582
It's not that bad. First game
of the season, 11 more to go.

24
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,467
It's just a game.

25
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,803
You better shape up.
I can't do this all by myself.

26
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,638
- What is that? Liverwurst?
- What?

27
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,433
- I thought you were on a diet, Chub.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,359
Chub, look at this.

29
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,445
Give me that.
Stop snooping around in my locker.

30
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,369
Look, I can smell
that liverwurst from over there.

31
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,577
Oh, yeah, right. Underneath these?

32
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,964
All right. Great game, guys.
We showed them.

33
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:44,130
- We lost, Stiles.
- The umpire needed glasses.

34
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,339
- Remember that seven buck s?
- You owe me.

35
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,014
Without a keg,
they won't let me into the party.

36
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,351
- Where would you buy it anyway?
- Lend me five.

37
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,181
- Later.
- Two.

38
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:03,569
Hey, Chub, how's the diet?
Lemonade, you were terrific.

39
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,862
What the hell is that?

40
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,990
Lemonade, my man. What it is?

41
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,993
I'm raising some cash
for the Afro-American festival...

42
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,368
Can we talk?

43
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,348
Hey, Scottie, come on in.

44
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:39,017
- Great game. Want a thigh or a wing?
- That's not necessary, coach.

45
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:45,692
You said that if we had problems,
we should come to you.

46
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:52,448
- That's what I'm here for.
- Great, because I got a problem.

47
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,449
What kind of problem?
As you can see, I'm a very busy man.

48
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:02,751
- It's kind of complicated.
- Oh, those kinds of problems.

49
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:08,379
What is it? Drugs? Girls?
I'd like to help, but I'm tapped out.

50
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:13,180
The IRS is breathing down my neck
like it's a personal vendetta.

51
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,178
No, coach. How can I put this?

52
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,597
I'm going through changes.

53
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,475
Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

54
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,610
Some a bit later than others.

55
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,445
Sorry I didn't notice.
I haven't been in the locker room much.

56
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:37,949
I don't think it's gonna be possible
for me to play on the team anymore.

57
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:43,546
Oh, yeah? Well look,
I know what you're going through.

58
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,628
A couple years back
a kid came to me the same way.

59
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,506
Saying to me
the same thing you're saying.

60
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,885
He wanted to drop off the team.

61
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:57,350
His mother was a widow, all crippled up.
She was scrubbing floors.

62
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:03,143
She had a pin in her hip.
He wanted to drop basketball and get a job.

63
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,729
Now these were poor people.
Hungry people with real problems.

64
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,146
Understand what I'm saying?

65
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,904
What happened to the kid?

66
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,613
I don't know. He quit.
Third stringer, I didn't need him.

67
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:24,995
- I'm a first stringer.
- And you work for your old man.

68
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,300
I should be coming to you
when I need money.

69
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,256
Fine. Thank s a lot, coach.

70
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,891
Don't mention it.
Like I said before <i>Mi casa su casa</i>.

71
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,095
Thank s.

72
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,687
Are you going to work?
Will you walk with me?

73
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,160
- Catch you later, Boof.
- Bye, Tina... Sheena..?

74
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,864
I had the strangest dream.
It was bizarre.

75
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,750
- Was I in this one?
- You, Pamela and a bunch of chickens.

76
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,044
- How the hell are you?
- Say no.

77
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,042
- Great talking to you.
- Chickens?

78
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,550
Yeah, big chickens. Giant chickens.
Like fryers.

79
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,635
- That guy was right. We do suck.
- No news there.

80
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,592
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

81
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,728
I'm sick of it, Boof.
I'm sick of being so average.

82
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,440
And it's not just basketball.
It's school, this town, everything.

83
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,821
I like Beacontown.

84
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:40,234
I'd like my life to change. I don't
wanna end up working for my dad.

85
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:46,417
- You're father is a terrific guy.
- Boof, look at me.

86
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,912
Now try and be objective.

87
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,418
Am I all right?
Is there anything wrong with me?

88
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,045
- You should shower after basketball.
- I do.

89
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,892
Then there's nothing wrong with you.

90
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,593
Then why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

91
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,519
- You can do a lot better than her.
- Like who?

92
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,641
- Don't you have to be at work?
- Did I say something wrong?

93
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,145
No, no. See you at the party.

94
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,246
- Hey, Angela.
- What was the score?

95
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,454
Very funny.

96
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:29,201
What was the score?
Don't tell me, I'll lose my count.

97
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,123
Down to our last waffle iron.

98
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,916
How am I expected to compete
with wrenches made in India?

99
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,929
I'm not Sears and Roebuck.

100
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,723
You look a little tired today.
The coach isn't giving you steroids, is he?

101
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:47,769
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

102
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,518
Beacontown hasn't won a game in...
It must be three years.

103
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,023
Ow!

104
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:58,774
Don't take it personally.
It's all part of growing up.

105
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,154
Yeah, I guess so.

106
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,658
- Any deliveries?
- Down at the high school.

107
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:11,495
Some strange sounding guy called.
Sounded like he was in a hurry.

108
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm not sure what I wrote down.
That's what the clipboard is for.

109
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,462
Well, it is.

110
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,561
It's broken.

111
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,117
A dog whistle?

112
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,689
Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir?

113
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,401
Thank s.

114
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:30,078
What an arm.
Thank s, Mr. Thorne. I appreciate it.

115
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,619
I knew he was out there.

116
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:38,960
I didn't actually hear him,
but I knew he was there.

117
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:44,377
I could only see a thin white crack
of light which set my bedroom apart...

118
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,720
More sensual. We need to
feel you, want to smell you. Hurt me.

119
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,052
...from the dense and heavy darkness.

120
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,062
But surely I could feel him.
It was Nick.

121
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,273
What was that?

122
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,771
Sorry, sir. That was me.

123
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:07,323
What do you want from me?
What do people want from me?

124
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:12,573
- I am merely trying to rehearse.
- I'm sorry.

125
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,586
I've got the stuff that you ordered.

126
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:20,297
- Are you from the hardware store?
- Yeah.

127
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:29,005
Pamela? Excuse me.
Are you going to the party tonight?

128
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,478
- I'd like to give you a ride.
- The paint. My paint.

129
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,185
A can of cocoa, a can of mauve.
Am I right?

130
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,110
Right.

131
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,397
- Kirk, how was my reading?
- Beautiful, darling.

132
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,443
Very sensual. I'm still in pain.
Thank you.

133
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:52,119
You're welcome. Listen, about tonight...
I'm serious. I'd like to take you.

134
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,616
I've got a van.

135
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,913
Hope your acting's better
than your hook shot, boy.

136
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,582
I already have a ride.

137
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,125
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

138
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,259
He just delivers hardware, Mick.

139
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,714
Maybe he should get back
to delivering it. Come on.

140
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,275
I said mauve. Not turquoise!

141
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,989
Mr. Lolley?

142
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,325
- The boss says I'm to pick up a keg.
- Is that right?

143
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,209
- The boss called you, right?
- Can't say he did.

144
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:48,634
Hot damn. The boss is throwing a bash
for one of the boys at the gravel pit.

145
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,964
He just got paroled.

146
00:14:56,313 --> 00:15:00,180
Well, I've got plenty of bread.

147
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,316
Here. There's a little extra for you.

148
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,907
Got to see your ID... sport.

149
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:40,434
- I don't even like beer.
- Never... say... die.

150
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,525
Dad?

151
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,985
What would you say
if I wanted to quit the team?

152
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,405
- Quit the team?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,034
That's pretty drastic.
You're not the worst player they've got.

154
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,920
Your mother always said
you could do anything you wanted to.

155
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:10,255
- I was thinking of doing something else.
- Like what?

156
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,338
School play.

157
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,966
Theatre has its place, I suppose,

158
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,634
but what about
your commitment to the team?

159
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:25,894
Dad, has anything ever happened to you
that was so weird...

160
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:30,067
- Maybe we should have a chat.
- How's the king of nuts and bolts?

161
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,108
- Stiles, nice shirt.
- Thank s. Come on, we're late.

162
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:38,829
- Boof going with you?
- I don't know how she's getting there.

163
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,751
- Is this OK?
- Don't worry, I'll get it.

164
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,125
Have a good time. Be careful.

165
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:52,260
- Come on.
- Hey, listen. Stiles.

166
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,964
- Is there a rash going around?
- Why, you wanna catch one?

167
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,510
- I'm serious.
- No...

168
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,470
...but I heard Mr. Murphy,
the shop teacher...

169
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,650
...got his dick caught
in a vacuum cleaner.

170
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,277
Forget I asked.

171
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:23,041
- Stiles, you're crazy.
- No, not crazy. It's perfect.

172
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,330
Now you just stick this in your pocket like this.

173
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,838
You don't say anything except
"Give me a keg, buddy. "

174
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,175
Pay for it so he can't say you robbed him.

175
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:38,719
You know I'd do this myself,
but that old guy already kicked me out.

176
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,475
Give me the gun.
Give me the money.

177
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:51,568
- I'm gonna try and buy it. That's it.
- He's a ball buster and it won't work.

178
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,027
- It won't work.
- That's it.

179
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,658
Damn...

180
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,991
Never say...

181
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,712
...die.

182
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,840
No, not that. No, I think I'll leave it.
No, thanks a lot anyway. Bye.

183
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:22,431
Do you have any more of that liqueur?
My sister really liked that.

184
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,726
Yes, thank you.

185
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,770
Hey, Debbie, are you coming?

186
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,440
Hi.

187
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,779
Hi.

188
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:44,623
- I'd like a keg of beer, please.
- You don't say.

189
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,204
- Yeah, how much is that?
- Do you have any ID, sonny?

190
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,376
You little bastards
just won't give up, will you?

191
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,500
No ID, no goddamn beer. Can't you
get that through your thick skull?

192
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:08,434
Give me a keg of beer.

193
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,490
And these.

194
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,487
# Finding my way

195
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:25,866
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

196
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:37,634
- What did you say to that guy?
- Just, "Give me a keg. "

197
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,804
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

198
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,808
Well, Lewis. This is it.
Tonight's the night.

199
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,595
- Pamela is gonna be there and so am I.
- So is Mick.

200
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,346
- He won't be there.
- They're going together.

201
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:55,439
- They're not going together.
- Mick is like 20 years old.

202
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:00,607
He's still in high school
because he did time in jail.

203
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,026
- Forget Pamela Wells.
- They're not going together.

204
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,112
He's a total psycho.

205
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,124
Why don't you go for Boof?
She likes you.

206
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:13,666
- You sound like my dad.
- Pull over.

207
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,962
Trust me. We've got to stick together.

208
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:20,083
I'm not even listening anymore.

209
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,548
- Once and for all they're not going out.
- Yeah, they are.

210
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,096
- Not. You're mistaken.
- You're crazy.

211
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,103
- Lewis, take my wheels.
- I don't have my license yet.

212
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,895
Just do it.

213
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,433
Let's just go to the party.
This isn't a good idea.

214
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,234
Surf's up.

215
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,562
- Drive in front of us.
- Not too close.

216
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,784
- What are you gonna do?
- Will you just do it?

217
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,537
Kids.

218
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,707
- I'm gonna go slow, all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:54,624
Don't worry.
We've got everything under control.

220
00:20:54,796 --> 00:21:00,218
You do your thing and I will do mine.
Cowabunga!

221
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:01,650
What?

222
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:04,689
Whoa!

223
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,487
Ahh!

224
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,321
Wow!

225
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,995
- Wipe-out!
- You all right up there?

226
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,211
Yeah, no sweat.
But just watch those waves.

227
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,188
Hello, everybody. I have arrived.

228
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:40,853
You look great.

229
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,732
Yeah, nice hit, baby.

230
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,908
- You are a cheese ball.
- That's my middle name.

231
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,446
- You'd never catch me up there.
- You'd be the king of urban surfing.

232
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:56,039
No way, Louie. That's my baby.
Give me that.

233
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,141
Hi.

234
00:23:56,478 --> 00:24:00,772
- Looking for someone in particular?
- Not you.

235
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,775
There you go.
She said two words to you.

236
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:19,452
Just like I said. No dry throats tonight.
Did I come through or what?

237
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:24,169
OK, put it down over there.
If we don't get to it, take it home.

238
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:34,296
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

239
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:40,595
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30!

240
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,023
That's it.

241
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,321
You got some kind of rash?

242
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,374
Matchmaker lady, the hat. All right.

243
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:09,376
Next up is... Whoa, help me Rhonda!

244
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:18,471
- What do I have to do?
- Read the name on the paper.

245
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,601
It says, "Chubby".

246
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:30,144
Matchmaker lady.

247
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,699
All right.

248
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,527
All right, Chubby, baby.

249
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:44,534
You have to eat
this whole bowl of Jell-O.

250
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:50,048
- What do I have to do?
- Hold the Jell-O.

251
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,481
All right, next up is...

252
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,782
...Boof!

253
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,584
It's... Scott.

254
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,798
- Booferino gets the Howard boy.
- I don't know if this is a good idea.

255
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:45,804
You're gonna love it.
In fact, it's the grand prize.

256
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:53,727
Two minutes. Anything goes, baby.
And don't disappoint us.

257
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:16,417
- It's kinda funny that you got me.
- I lied. I got Malcolm.

258
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,504
Malcolm's a good guy.

259
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,341
You can come a little closer.
I promise I won't bite.

260
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,482
Go, go, go...

261
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:49,916
Take this cup to Thorne's house,
tell him you're from the Board of Health

262
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,420
and you want to check his... blood sugar.

263
00:27:56,844 --> 00:28:02,680
- Boof, I feel kind of weird.
- How do I feel?

264
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,072
- What is this?
- You gotta see this.

265
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,741
See what? I don't see anything.
Come on.

266
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,336
Aren't you getting a little bit rough?

267
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,136
Hey, your fingernails!

268
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,843
It's awful quiet in there.

269
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,060
Oooh!

270
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:58,320
Do you guys think they're dead?
There's only one way to find out.

271
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,997
So, tell us.
What's it like coming out of the closet?

272
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,625
It was unexpected.

273
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,500
Scott?

274
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,014
Scott?

275
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,945
Ahh!

276
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:22,080
Jeez Louise.

277
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:26,551
- Scott? Can I come in?
- No, Dad.

278
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,138
No, I'm doing something in here. I'll say.

279
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,055
You may be surprised. Whatever it is,
you can tell me. I'll understand.

280
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:44,227
No, Dad. No, not this time.

281
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:50,114
Scott Howard, this is your father.
Now open this door right this minute.

282
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,159
OK, Dad.

283
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,865
You asked for it.

284
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,471
An explanation is probably long overdue.

285
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:24,265
An explanation? Jesus Christ, Dad!
An explanation? Look at me.

286
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:26,651
- Look at you.
- It's not as bad as it look s.

287
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:29,111
Wait a minute, Dad.

288
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:34,324
You mean you knew about this
and you didn't tell me?

289
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:39,242
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

290
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:43,878
- I was hoping it would pass you by.
- Well, it didn't pass me by.

291
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:49,172
It landed on my face.
What the hell am I gonna do?

292
00:32:55,225 --> 00:33:01,762
- We really need to talk about this.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk. Go away.

293
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:37,638
- Tough night, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

294
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,225
And there was a full moon last night.

295
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:47,316
I meant to talk to you about that last evening,
but you were kind of upset.

296
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:53,900
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.
Look s like you can use it.

297
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,282
That'll help.

298
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:02,289
Look Scott, being what we are
is not without its problems,

299
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,495
- but it's not all bad either.
- Tell me about it.

300
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:08,506
You can do things the other guys can't.

301
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:12,718
Oh, like chase cars and bite the mail man?

302
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,801
When you want it,
you're gonna have great power.

303
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:20,390
And with great power
goes a greater responsibility.

304
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:25,057
- Your mom and I learned to live with it.
- And what if can't?

305
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:29,395
I can look forward to stealing babies
in the middle of the night.

306
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,108
And killing chickens.

307
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:36,278
Fearing full moons, dodging
silver bullets. Well, no thank s.

308
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:41,872
Don't believe all that stuff.
With certain obvious exceptions

309
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,413
werewolves are people like anyone else.

310
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:48,835
What I'm trying to say is

311
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:53,003
the werewolf is a part of you,
but that doesn't change the inside.

312
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:57,008
Look, I've got a bad outside hook shot.
I'm allergic to eggs.

313
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,965
I've got a six dollar haircut.
I mean, I have problems.

314
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,934
I don't need this one.

315
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:07,395
I gotta get to school.

316
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,856
That went well.

317
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,173
- Hello.
- Hi.

318
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:40,965
- There's something different about you.
- That's nice.

319
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,383
Did you change your hair?

320
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,184
Missed you at lunch today, Scott.

321
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:51,567
Oh, yeah. Hi, Boof. Sorry, I forgot.

322
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:58,023
Well, I have to go study my lines.
Kirk... Mr. Lolley... he's so demanding.

323
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,408
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:14,378
How's it going, Stiles?

325
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:22,890
The twins surely would have died
if they hadn't been saved by a... what?

326
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,549
- A miracle?
- Yes, I suppose.

327
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:31,517
But what form did this particular
miracle take? Scott Howard?

328
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:45,070
Very amusing Scott, but you are correct.

329
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,947
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf.

330
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,661
A she wolf. Wolf, wolf, wolf.

331
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:53,917
Wolfe!

332
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,125
Ahh!... tishoo.

333
00:36:57,301 --> 00:37:00,634
Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people
read what I assign you?

334
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:07,341
"Look Homeward Angel".
Scott, it's a book. By Thomas Wolfe.

335
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,599
- Wolfe. Wolfe.
- Scott.

336
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:18,564
Come on, Scott.
It's a lot simpler than it look s.

337
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:24,067
OK.

338
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,380
Just try, Scott.

339
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:12,866
It's wet. You can't go in.

340
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,376
That's wet, too!

341
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:53,656
Don't change, don't change.
Stay calm, stay calm.

342
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,751
- Little far from you side, aren't you?
- No.

343
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,759
I mean, yes, sir, but the halls were wet.

344
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,090
- Let me see your hands.
- Sir.

345
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,470
Let me see your hands now.

346
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:24,066
You don't have a marker on you,
do you?

347
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,536
No. No, sir.

348
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:36,157
I've got my eyes on you
and if you ever get out of line...

349
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,707
Yeah, I gotta go.

350
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:06,647
- What are you doing?
- Big brother keeps an emergency stash.

351
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:12,245
I got to talk to you about something,
because it's making me nuts.

352
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:16,540
If it's that intense,
I'll need a solid buzz to think clearly.

353
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:24,799
Look, I wouldn't even mention it to you,
but I got to talk to someone.

354
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:30,970
If you're gonna tell me you're a fag,
I don't think I can handle it.

355
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,809
I'm not a fag.

356
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:36,099
I'm... a werewolf.

357
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,643
Where would that scumbag keep it?

358
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,536
Scott.

359
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,000
- Scottie?
- Stiles, it's me.

360
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,005
What do you think?

361
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:19,475
Can you do that any time you want?

362
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:22,184
I guess so. I mean, I just did.

363
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:26,058
But sometimes it happens
when I don't want it to.

364
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,279
What can I say?

365
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,865
You're beautiful.

366
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,458
Hey, what can a teen wolf do?

367
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,920
- I can smell what you're looking for.
- The stash?

368
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,511
Oh no, I checked there.

369
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,944
Stiles, this is just between you and me, OK?

370
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,105
Yeah, yeah. TW.

371
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,529
Look at you.

372
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,867
You're gonna be glad you came to me,
because with the right angles

373
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:25,335
we're gonna turn this into something...
monstrous.

374
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:28,873
Stiles. Stiles.

375
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,960
Go ahead. Shoot it, shoot it.

376
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:38,474
No way, no way.
Don't foul me now. Here we go.

377
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,139
Yeah!

378
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:50,193
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi.

379
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,526
Boof came over for a little one on one.
She's killing me.

380
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,150
What? What's so funny?

381
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:04,248
- We were just chatting. Do you mind?
- No, why should I mind?

382
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:09,080
Well, I gotta get going.
Would you like to walk me home?

383
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:14,549
- Boof, I just got here.
- Scott.

384
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,385
- Yeah.
- Thank s for everything.

385
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,724
- You better work on that jumpshot.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,521
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

387
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,233
Ha!

388
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:37,818
Get in!

389
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,619
So, you guys were chatting.
Harold Howard and his famous chats.

390
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,204
What did he say?

391
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,246
He mentioned you were thinking
of quitting basketball

392
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:55,627
- to work on a school play.
- Yeah.

393
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:59,883
I can see why. She's very pretty, Scott.

394
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:05,513
But she has a boyfriend.
A very large boyfriend.

395
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:10,396
The way things are going now
I should just stay away from everyone.

396
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,939
Even me?

397
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,526
I couldn't get rid of you if I tried.

398
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,857
- What?
- Do you remember?

399
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,278
- How old were we? Six?
- Five.

400
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,906
I wanted to run away,
but you wouldn't let me go alone.

401
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:30,583
- I thought you'd get lost.
- We just walked around the block

402
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,541
because our parents
wouldn't let us cross the street.

403
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:38,840
- I thought they were gonna kill us.
- But nobody even knew we were gone.

404
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,381
Did you ever tell anybody?
Me neither.

405
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:52,857
Scott, if you ever
need someone to talk to,

406
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:56,941
if something is bothering you,
I'll understand.

407
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,697
Not this time, Boof.
You won't understand.

408
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:09,165
- I've gotta go.
- Yeah, bye.

409
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:34,150
OK, now here's the drill.
Play 'em man for man.

410
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,900
- You know who you've got.
- Hey baby, ten hut. Nice haircut.

411
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:43,446
"Be all that you can be. " What is this?
Is the president here or something?

412
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:48,736
- Good luck, Scott.
- Thank s. Thank you.

413
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:59,127
It'll all be over in less than an hour.

414
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,590
Any strategy against Meechum, coach?

415
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:05,047
You guys are great.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

416
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:08,260
Go out there and give 'em hell.

417
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:18,069
That's a foul. Let's go.

418
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,813
Come on, set it up.

419
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,825
Up to the line, Scottie. You can do it.

420
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,380
Ahh!

421
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:42,256
Go and get me some salt. Salt.

422
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,047
Flick the ball back to him.

423
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:49,307
Go, Scottie.

424
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:53,931
Easy, easy.

425
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:12,580
Come on. Let's go.

426
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,505
Come on.

427
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:03,481
- All right, guys.
- Let's play a little ball here.

428
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:31,405
- Hey Scott, did the coach know?
- Hey, I didn't know.

429
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,989
- How do you feel?
- He feels... like a winner!

430
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:47,586
- Boof, did you know?
- Are you kidding?

431
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,542
On the house, sonny.

432
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:54,817
Hey, Lewis.

433
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:02,280
- Whoa, Mr. T.
- You may think you're special,

434
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:05,872
but let me remind you
that I'm still the vice-principal.

435
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:09,661
Hey, I'm no different than anyone else.

436
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,334
That's nice. You look good in that.

437
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:09,324
- Well, Scott Howard.
- Hey, Boof.

438
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:11,658
Aren't you afraid you'll
disappoint your fans?

439
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:14,670
I can't help
that the town is wolf crazy.

440
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:17,460
This wasn't my idea.

441
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,921
- There are some advantages.
- None.

442
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:23,427
All sizes. No waiting, everybody.
Check it out. Right here.

443
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,847
Hey Scotto, tip of the iceberg, baby.
We are cleaning up.

444
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:29,473
Boof, I've got something for you.

445
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,811
Here we go. Check it out.
All sizes. No waiting.

446
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,935
- Elegant.
- Scott.

447
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:40,688
Listen to this.
Kirk wants you to be in the play.

448
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:43,818
He does? Wait a minute.
What about basketball?

449
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:48,453
It won't interfere.
It's a small part. Just for you.

450
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:52,869
Here, Pamela. This is for you.
It's too big for me.

451
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:56,127
There are some advantages, Scott.
Admit it.

452
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:08,381
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

453
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,055
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

454
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,147
don't destroy my plantation.

455
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:24,279
Sergeant, burn the fields.

456
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,115
And when you're done with that,
burn the house.

457
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:30,700
Yeah...

458
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:34,573
Wolf... wolf... wolf person.
Whatever your name is.

459
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,955
- That was really...
- Thank s, babe, I love you.

460
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:38,995
...something.

461
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,418
Come in.

462
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,466
- Hi.
- Close the door, please.

463
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:51,433
Yeah.

464
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:04,106
Relax. We're just
one big happy family in the theatre.

465
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:08,116
Yeah.

466
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:14,072
What happened to the wolf?

467
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:19,077
Can you just change back and forth
whenever you feel like it?

468
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:25,506
Sure. Sometimes I have to get
kind of worked up to be the wolf,

469
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,465
but it's not too hard.

470
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,008
What do you think about
to get worked up?

471
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:36,098
Different things.

472
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,944
Wolves aren't supposed to be shy.

473
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:51,197
Pamela, what are you doing?

474
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:56,664
You are an animal.

475
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,935
Strike.

476
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:22,514
Five in a row.

477
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,114
OK...

478
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,169
Did you know he was gonna be here?

479
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:46,667
We had such a nice day today.
Don't spoil it.

480
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,593
OK, you got it.

481
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:58,143
Nice. Good. OK.
Good form. Nice approach.

482
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:08,029
- Oh, poo.
- Boy, that was nice and warm.

483
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:15,282
OK, address the ball.

484
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:21,326
Tuck in your tummy.
That's good. OK.

485
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,660
Here we go. Are you ready?

486
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:27,621
Hey, that's my girl.
Don't touch her again.

487
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:32,461
- She's my date tonight, pal.
- You don't scare me, freak.

488
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,724
Underneath all that hair
you're still a dork, Scott.

489
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:42,354
I've handled your kind before.
Your mom used to steal chickens.

490
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,773
Till I blew her head off with a shotgun.
Right, Scott?

491
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:05,412
So, does Mick always act like that?

492
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,707
You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

493
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:12,714
- You mean was your boyfriend.
- Is my boyfriend.

494
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:18,047
- But what about us?
- What about us?

495
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:24,939
- This afternoon in your dressing room.
- Yeah?

496
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:29,021
Yeah... Well, you see
the spring dance is coming up...

497
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:33,441
And I already told you
I'm going to the dance with Mick.

498
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,616
- Hey, Chubaroo, nice game, guy.
- Yeah.

499
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:26,202
- At least we're winning.
- He is. When do we get the ball?

500
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,543
What good is the championship
if we don't get to play?

501
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,833
It's not how you play,
it's whether you win or lose.

502
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:37,088
- And even that's not important.
- How about a celebration?

503
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:41,212
- Chubby, ice cream sundae?
- I'm on a diet, remember?

504
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,100
Brad, glass of milk?

505
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:48,636
I don't get it. What's their problem?

506
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:52,184
Let me give you some advice.
I have three rules

507
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:57,486
Get 12 hours of sleep, don't play cards
with a guy whose name is also a city

508
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:01,109
and avoid ladies with dagger tattoos.

509
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:05,070
Stick with that
and everything else is cream cheese.

510
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,574
Great game there, Scottie.

511
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,752
Thank s, coach.

512
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,921
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

513
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:23,675
Stiles?

514
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:30,345
- Where did you get this?
- We traded in the Nova. Even swap.

515
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:35,233
- How much extra did you pay for this?
- Even swap.

516
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:41,276
For certain considerations.
Lookey here!

517
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:44,203
- Stiles.
- Hey, surf's up?

518
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:49,080
Yeah, surf is definitely up.
Let's go pick up Lewis, OK?

519
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,336
What? What is it with Lewis?
He's avoiding me, right?

520
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,547
He's scared of me.

521
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:06,385
We've got fine wheels, good tunes
and a total disregard for public safety.

522
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,849
You're right. OK, let's go. Surf's up.

523
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,812
Wait a minute.

524
01:02:10,981 --> 01:02:13,270
These waves are mine.

525
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,363
Unbelievable!

526
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:13,873
You know what?
You look great up there!

527
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:33,145
Missed you at the hardware store.

528
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:40,194
- Sorry. I was with Stiles this afternoon.
- I know.

529
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:44,901
- You saw?
- Yeah, I saw.

530
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:50,911
Unless that was another werewolf
doing a handstand on Stiles' wolfmobile.

531
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:55,622
Look, Dad.

532
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:58,961
I'm trying to get a grip on this. I really am.

533
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:04,291
- Is Thorne still on your back?
- Yeah, Thorne...

534
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:08,004
...some Neanderthal named Mick
and the entire basketball team.

535
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:11,348
You've dug your own hole
with those fellows, but...

536
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,641
...this Thorne business is my fault.

537
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,897
What do you mean your fault?

538
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,024
It goes back a few years.

539
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:24,061
As you know, I loved your mother
since we were kids.

540
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:26,564
We were meant for each other.

541
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:30,193
But for some reason Rusty
Thorne set his cap for her too.

542
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,537
No matter what we tried,
he wouldn't go away.

543
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:38,950
- One night, things got physical and...
- And you turned into the werewolf.

544
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:44,124
Out of anger, Scott.
I turned into the werewolf out of anger.

545
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:47,966
- In front of his beady, little eyes.
- Was he scared?

546
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,712
Scared?

547
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:56,134
- He lost control of his bodily functions.
- I wish I could have seen that.

548
01:04:56,313 --> 01:05:00,642
It wasn't a very nice thing to do.
But it worked.

549
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:03,522
After that he never
bothered your mother or me.

550
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:09,816
But to this day, I don't know
who was the most frightened that night.

551
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:13,409
Old Rusty Thorne... or me.

552
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:17,209
You gotta get a hold of it, son.

553
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:36,591
- Morning, Daisy.
- Morning.

554
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:43,058
- Boof. What's up?
- Nothing.

555
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:49,273
Why does anything have to be up?
I thought I'd walk to school with you.

556
01:05:56,832 --> 01:06:03,202
- Got any plans for the spring dance?
- Hadn't given it much thought.

557
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,876
I'm surprised they haven't decided
to call it "Teen Wolf Ball".

558
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:16,551
- Will you... go with me to the dance?
- I'll think about it.

559
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:22,183
- Is that a yes?
- Yes. On one condition.

560
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:25,726
- You take me to the dance.
- I thought we just established...

561
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:30,232
You, Scott Howard. Not the wolf.

562
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:37,406
No. Look, I've got to be the wolf.
That's what everyone expects.

563
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:40,665
- Is that what you want?
- Everybody likes the wolf.

564
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,120
All right, almost everybody.

565
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:49,587
You said it yourself. If I go as
Scott Howard, I'm gonna be average.

566
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,880
Why do I have to be like everybody else?

567
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,724
That's not a problem for you anymore.

568
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,260
And I guess
I don't have a date for the dance.

569
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:04,727
Look, Boof, I'm sorry. I can't.

570
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:11,945
Hey, listen.
You'll still dance with me, won't you?

571
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,941
Even if I'm a werewolf?

572
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,237
Yeah, I'll still dance with you.

573
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:22,871
- And feed me grapes?
- Don't push it.

574
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,323
Tickle my paws?

575
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:58,739
She's right. You are an animal.

576
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:31,314
There he is!

577
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,901
Oh, my God!

578
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,445
You look fabulous.
Absolutely gorgeous!

579
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:49,959
Nice to see you.
Thank you, thank you... How are you doing?

580
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:53,416
- Hey, save me a dance?
- You'll have to ask my escort.

581
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:56,048
Stay away from her tonight.
I'm warning you.

582
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:58,669
Hey, Stiles.

583
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:02,797
Thank you. Thank s.

584
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:06,061
Hi, how are you doing?

585
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,065
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf...

586
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:12,103
You still wanna dance with the wolf?

587
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:23,528
- Your public wants you.
- Do you mind?

588
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,755
- What?
- What am I gonna do about you?

589
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:03,378
Hey, Boof, I am what I am.

590
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:09,884
All I said was
I might wanna dance with him.

591
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:15,222
You can't possibly take it seriously.
Not unless you want to have his puppies.

592
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:27,237
I want Scott for just a half hour.
I really missed him.

593
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:14,665
Stay away from Pamela. She's mine.
Stick with your own kind, freak.

594
01:12:14,835 --> 01:12:17,456
Like that little tramp.

595
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:19,918
Mick, watch out!

596
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:29,763
What are you all laughing at?

597
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:34,180
- Get back here.
- You're just some kind of animal.

598
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:40,108
Come on, freak. Get back here.
Let go of me. Let go.

599
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:45,022
Get back. I'll rip your head right off.
Come on, freak.

600
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,532
I'm not through with you yet.
Come back, freak.

601
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:53,578
This isn't done by a long shot.
Get back in here, freak.

602
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:58,710
Come back here, freak.
We haven't settled this yet!

603
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:09,966
Hold it.

604
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,521
Now you've done it.

605
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:26,235
You don't know how long I have waited
to get you right where I have you.

606
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:33,821
You're never going to play
basketball again. You know why?

607
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:37,580
Because you're not going
to be here anymore, that's why.

608
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:40,503
You're out of here, Mr. Howard.
And don't you...

609
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:45,712
Thorne. Go on home, son. Go ahead.

610
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:48,043
I'll handle this.

611
01:13:57,855 --> 01:14:02,896
- You never learn, do you, Rusty?
- You stay away from me.

612
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:07,896
I want you to leave my son alone.

613
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:14,408
He's a good kid. He's just having
a tough time right now. OK?

614
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:30,218
I knew I could count on you, Rusty.

615
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:39,604
You can murder my family.
You can ravish my body.

616
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:43,935
But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy,

617
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:47,608
don't destroy my plantation.

618
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,985
- Sergeant, burn the fields...
- Hold it. Hold it, baby.

619
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:58,613
...down the house.
- Hold it right there, babe.

620
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:01,328
Listen...

621
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:05,998
...this is a full dress rehearsal.
We need to see the wolf.

622
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:10,253
So wolf out, wolf up, wolf it.
Whatever you do. <i>Pronto amigo</i>

623
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:16,263
Mr. Lolley. I've been doing
some thinking and I decided

624
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,556
I'd rather play the part as me.

625
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:24,267
- Well, play it. Play it as myself.
- That wouldn't be theatre, would it?

626
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,976
See, no one wants to see you.

627
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:33,532
Well, like I said, I'd rather play it like this.

628
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:39,039
OK, I see. How am I gonna put this to you?

629
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:43,204
Look at it this way no wolf...

630
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:45,915
...no part. What do you think?

631
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,549
Wow. Bummer, huh?

632
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,056
Hey, Scottie.

633
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:10,605
- I'll have Friday nights free.
- Even if you won't be the wolf,

634
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:13,946
- do you have to quit the team?
- Are you kidding?

635
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:19,988
You've seen me play basketball. I suck.
They want the wolf. I can't do it.

636
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:25,538
Wait a minute. What's going on?
What are you guys talking about?

637
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:31,132
We're talking about the wolf, Stiles. I can't
do it anymore. You saw what happened.

638
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,126
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe.

639
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:36,920
The championship is coming up
in less than four hours.

640
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:41,261
Everyone's depending on you.
Are you gonna let down your team?

641
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,641
Your school? This whole town?

642
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:48,225
What about me?
I've got a large investment going on over here.

643
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,025
Hey, Scott, do it for me.

644
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:54,528
I gotta go, man.

645
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:58,992
Scott, help me out. Do the right thing.

646
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:05,040
That's all I wanna do, Stiles.
That's all I wanna do.

647
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,985
Boo!

648
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:47,113
Chubby, get time. Come here.

649
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,249
See that?

650
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:52,587
Come on.

651
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:00,258
That's a purple heart, kid.

652
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:07,677
Smart basketball, Brad,
taking a charge like that.

653
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:22,986
Oh, man.

654
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:56,736
- So where's the wolf?
- Not today, coach. No wolf.

655
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:59,940
Wait until the second half.
Build up their confidence.

656
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:05,655
Look, coach, no wolf.
Not now, not ever.

657
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:10,290
I wanna play, but I gotta be myself.

658
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:14,622
OK, but we're gonna get
our brains beat in, you know.

659
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:23,262
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- I've had it.

660
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,510
- This is all your fault, Howard.
- I think we can take these guys.

661
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:34,186
- Terrific, now where's the wolf?
- No, I mean it. I think we can win.

662
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:40,063
This is the championship. It doesn't
matter how we got here. We're here.

663
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:44,699
If we're gonna win, we gotta do it
ourselves. We don't need the wolf.

664
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,241
Harold, your boy let us down.

665
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,922
You're dead.

666
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:09,303
Shoot. Shoot it.

667
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:15,227
Shoot it!

668
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,107
Shoot it, fat boy.

669
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:22,935
Yeah!

670
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:43,331
- How much more can you take, freak?
- As much as you can dish out.

671
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:46,021
What's so funny, dork?

672
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:51,274
That's four fouls.
One more and you're out of there.

673
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:26,411
Come on. Make your move.

674
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:43,638
Come on, fat boy. Try it.

675
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:14,162
You gotta get back. Get back.

676
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:17,461
You got two shots.
Get back. Off the court.

677
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:45,565
- Let's blow out of here.
- Drop dead.

678
01:28:55,993 --> 01:28:58,913
