1
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,040
Time.

2
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
You guys suck.

3
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
No... really?

4
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
You're looking good, way to go.

5
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Nothing to worry about.
That's fine, no problem.

6
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
It's hot out there, isn't it?

7
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
You shouldn't have gotten
in his way, Scottie.

8
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,520
Hey, Scotto,
looking good out there, babe.

9
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
Yeah, how would you know Stiles?

10
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,440
You want to forfeit the game?

11
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,880
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

12
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,080
-No.
-No?

13
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,480
My players have league
scoring records at stake...

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
...and it wouldn't be
fair to them.

15
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,120
I just thought if we quit now
you could beat the 5:00 traffic.

16
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
There's a lot to learn
from losing.

17
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
Okay, we'll play
if it's that big a deal to you.

18
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,960
-It's not going too well, is it?
-What do you expect, Thorne.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
Look at the sneakers
those guys are wearing.

20
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,040
If our guys had
sneakers like that...

21
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
...there's no telling
what they could do.

22
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,240
That fat kid's got a great arm.

23
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
Over here. Pass it.

24
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,720
Forget it, dork!

25
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
Hey, come on, it's not that bad.

26
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
First game of the season,
11 more to go!

27
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Hey, it's just a game.

28
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
You bozos better
shape up out there.

29
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
I can't do this all by myself.

30
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,440
What is that, liverwurst?

31
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,000
What?

32
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,240
I thought you were supposed to be
on a diet, Chub.

33
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,560
Chub, look at this.

35
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,880
Give me that.

36
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,960
Stop snooping around
in my locker.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Look, chump... big guy.

38
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,800
I can smell that liverwurst
from over there.

39
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
Oh yeah, right underneath these.

40
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
All right Yeah!

41
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
Great game guys, we showed them.

42
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
We lost, Stiles.

43
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
The umpire needed glasses.
Terrific Brad.

44
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Hey, Scottie. You know that
seven bucks you owe me?

45
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
-You owe me.
-Listen, Scott.

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,320
This is important. If I don't
come up with the keg for tonight,

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
they won't let me
into that party.

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,200
Look, even if you come up
with the cash,

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,080
where are you going to buy?

50
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
-Lend me five.
-Later.

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
-Two.
-Later.

52
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,880
Hey, Chubb, how's it going?

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey, Lemonade, give me five, man.

54
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,200
You were terrific...

55
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,080
What the hell is that?

56
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,360
Hey Lemonade, my man.
What it is.

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520
Listen, um,

58
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm raising some cash
for our school's Afro-American...

59
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
...festival
and I thought maybe...

60
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,760
Mick, can we talk?

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Hey, Scottie, come on in.

62
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,360
Great game out there today.

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,240
You want a thigh,
a wing or something?

64
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
No, that's not necessary coach.

65
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,720
Listen,

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
you know how you always said...

67
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,040
...if any of us guys have
any problems...

68
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
I mean, even personal ones...

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,280
...that we should come
and see you.

70
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,720
Hey, that's what I'm here for.

71
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,360
Great... because,

72
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,440
I've got a problem.

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,440
Oh, yeah, what kind of problem?

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,080
As you can see
I'm a very busy man here.

75
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,640
Ah, yeah,
well, it's kind of complicated.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Those kind of problems. Yeah.

77
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
What is it, drugs, girls?

78
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,040
Boy, I'd sure like to help you...

79
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
...but I'm really tapped out
this month.

80
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
The IRS is
breathing down my neck...

81
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,440
like it's some kind of personal
vendetta against Bobby Finstock.

82
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,640
No, Coach...

83
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,720
How can I put this.

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I'm going through changes.

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh,that. Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

86
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
Some a little bit later
than others.

87
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
I'm sorry I didn't notice,

88
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,360
but I haven't been hanging around
the locker room all that much.

89
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
No. You see...

90
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Coach, I just don't think...

91
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
...it's going to be
possible for me...

92
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,120
...to play on the team anymore.

93
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Oh yeah, well,

94
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,680
look, Scottie, I know
what you're going through.

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
A couple years back
a kid came to me,

96
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
much the same way
you're coming to me now.

97
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Saying to me pretty much
the same thing you're saying.

98
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,000
He wanted to drop off the team.

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,120
His mother was a widow,
all crippled up.

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,120
She was scrubbing floors...

101
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,720
She had this pin in her hip.

102
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,600
So he wanted to drop basket ball
and get a job.

103
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Now these were poor people.

104
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,440
These were hungry people
with real problems.

105
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
Understand what I'm saying?

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
What happened to the kid?

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
I don't know. He quit.

108
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,640
He was a third stringer
I didn't need him.

109
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah, ah, coach,
I'm a first stringer.

110
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Yeah,
and you've already got a job...

111
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
...working for your old man.

112
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,040
Fact of the matter is
I should be coming to you...

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,040
...when I need money.

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Fine.

115
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
Thanks a lot coach.

116
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,520
Hey, don't mention it.
Like I said before,

117
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
<i>My house is your house.</i>

118
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,040
Thanks.

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
-Scott.
-Hi, Boof.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,480
-Hi, you're going to work?
-Yeah.

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
-Can I walk with you?
-Catch you later, Boof.

122
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,720
-At the party
-Bye, Tina.

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,280
-Tina. Tina?
-Gina.

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,600
I had the strangest dream
last night, Boof.

125
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,800
It was bizarre.

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,000
Was I in this one?

127
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,480
Yeah, yeah, you, and Pamela
and a bunch of chickens.

128
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,640
Boof, how the hell are ya?

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,640
-Say no.
-No.

130
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,960
Great talking to you.

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Giant chickens like fryers.
You know?

132
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
You know, that guy's right.
We do suck.

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
No news there.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,840
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

135
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sick of it Boof.

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm sick of being so average.

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,560
And it's not just basketball,
it's this school.

138
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,080
It's this town. It's everything.

139
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,280
I like Beacontown.

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,040
I'd just like my life to change.

141
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
You know.
I don't want to end up...

142
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
...working for my Dad
at the hardware store.

143
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,280
Your father's a terrific guy.

144
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Boof, look at me.

145
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Now try and be objective.

146
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,120
Am I alright?

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,480
I mean is there
anything wrong with me?

148
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
You should probably shower
after basketball.

149
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I do.

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,080
Then no,
there's nothing wrong with you.

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Well, then...

152
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,440
Why won't Pamela Wells say
two words to me?

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,640
You can do a lot better than
Pamela Wells.

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,640
Like who?

155
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,920
Don't you have to be at work?

156
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
Hey, did I say something wrong?

157
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,400
No, no.
See you at the party, okay?

158
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,640
-Hey, Angela.
-Hi, Scottie. How are you doing?

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
What was the score?

160
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,960
Very funny.

161
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
-What was the score?
-71...

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,920
Don't tell me I'll lose my count.

163
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,280
Well, down to
our last waffle iron.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
Do you know these wrenches are
made in India?

165
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,920
How do they expect me
to compete with the big boys?

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
-I'm not Sears and Roebuck.
-Sears and Roebuck.

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, I'm not.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,720
You look a little tired
today, Scott.

169
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,080
That coach's not given you boys
steroids or anything.

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,840
Not likely. Maybe he should.

171
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
We lost 71-12.

172
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
You know Beacontown hasn't
won a game in...

173
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,520
It must be three years.

174
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't take it personal, Scott.

175
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
It's all part of growing up.

176
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,080
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,920
Any deliveries?

178
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah, down by the high school.

179
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Some strange sounding guy called.

180
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
Sounded like
he was in a big hurry.

181
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,560
-Today?
-I'm not sure...

182
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
...what I wrote down
but check the clip board.

183
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,040
That's what it's there for.

184
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,720
Well, it is.

185
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,080
It's broken.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,520
Dog whistle?

187
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir?

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
Thanks.

189
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,760
Wow, what an arm.

190
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,280
Thanks, Mr. Thorne.

191
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,080
I appreciate it.

192
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,640
I knew he was out there.

193
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,640
I didn't actually hear him...

194
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,560
...but I knew he was there.

195
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,160
I could only see
a thin white crack of light...

196
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,240
which set my bedroom apart.

197
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,080
More sensual darling.
We need to feel you,

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,000
want to smell you.
Hurt me, hurt me.

199
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,480
From the dense
and heavy darkness.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,600
But surely I could feel him.

201
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,800
It was Nick.

202
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,840
What was that?

203
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,120
Sorry, sorry, sir. That was me.

204
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
What do you want from me?

205
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,920
What do people want from me?

206
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,160
I am merely trying to
rehearse, hm?

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Ah yeah, I'm sorry.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,560
I've got the stuff
that you ordered.

210
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,960
Wait.

211
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,280
Are you from the hardware store?

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
Uh... yeah.

213
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,800
Pamela...

214
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
Excuse me, um...

215
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Are you going to
the party tonight?

216
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,520
Because if you are,

217
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
I'd like to give you a ride.

218
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,040
The paint. My paint,

219
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,400
a can of cocoa,

220
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,040
a can of mauve, am I right?

221
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Ah, right.

222
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,880
Kirk, how was my reading?

223
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
Beautiful, darling. Very sensual,

224
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm still in pain.

225
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,520
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

226
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,640
Listen, about tonight.

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,000
I mean I'm serious...

228
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
I'd like to take you.

229
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
I've got a van.

230
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,040
I hope your acting's better than
your hook, shot boy.

231
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,840
I already have a ride.

232
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,200
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

233
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,640
He just delivers hardware, Mick.

234
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,360
Well, maybe he should get back to
delivering it. Come on.

235
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,280
<i>I said mauve.</i>

236
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,680
<i>Not turquoise.</i>

237
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
Mr. Lolley?

238
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,880
Hey.

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,080
The boss says I'm to pick up
a keg o' beer.

240
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,400
That right?

241
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, the boss called you, right?

242
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Can't say he did.

243
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, hot damn.

244
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,840
The Boss is throwing
a big bash...

245
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,280
...for one of the boys down
at the gravel pit.

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,880
He just got paroled.

247
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Well, I've got plenty of bread.

248
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,960
Here.
There's a little extra for you.

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
Got to see your ID...

250
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,720
...sport.

251
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,080
I don't even like beer.

252
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Never. Say. Die.

253
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,720
Dad?

254
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,360
What would you say if I said...

255
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,200
...I was thinking of quitting
the basketball team.

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Quitting the team?

257
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
-Yeah.
-That's pretty drastic. Isn't it?

258
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
I mean you're not
the worst player they've got.

259
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
You know your mom always said...

260
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
...you could do anything
you wanted to.

261
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Yeah, I know.

262
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,640
Just thinking of
doing something else.

263
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Like what?

264
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,320
School play?

265
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Well.

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Theater has its place
I suppose, but...

267
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
What about your commitment
to the team, to the school?

268
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,440
Yeah, I know.

269
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,440
Has anything ever
happened to you...

270
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,440
...that was so weird.

271
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,880
Maybe it's time
you and I had a little chat.

272
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,160
Hey! Mr. Howard,
how's the king of nuts and bolts?

273
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,720
-Stiles, nice shirt.
-Hey, thanks.

274
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Come on, we're late.

275
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Boof going with you?

276
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,120
Ah, yeah. I don't know
how she's getting there.

277
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
Is this okay?

278
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,400
No, don't worry about it.
I'll get it.

279
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Have a good time. Be careful.

280
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
Come on...

281
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,920
Come on.

282
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,000
Hey, hey, listen, Stiles...

283
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Do you know anything about a rash
that's going around?

284
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,320
Why, you looking to
catch something?

285
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,840
No, I'm serious.

286
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,200
No,

287
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,400
but I heard Mr. Murphy...
you know the shop teacher?

288
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,440
Yeah?

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,200
Got his dick caught
in a vacuum cleaner.

290
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,280
Forget I asked.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,520
Stiles, you're crazy.

292
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,040
No, it's not crazy.

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,600
It's perfect.

294
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,440
Now you just stick this
in your pocket like this.

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,680
All right?
You don't say anything except...

296
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
..."Give me a keg, buddy."

297
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,280
and you pay for it.

298
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,080
That way he can't say
you robbed him.

299
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,520
You know I'd do this myself,

300
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,680
but that old guy in there
already kicked me out.

301
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Give me the gun.

302
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,000
Give me the money.

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm gonna try and buy it,
that's it.

304
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
No, no, no, Scott.

305
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,440
This guy is a ball buster
and it won't work.

306
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,520
-That's it.
-It won't work!

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,640
That's it.

308
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Damn...

309
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
Never say...

310
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,720
...die.

311
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,000
No, no, no, no, no, Not that.

312
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah.

313
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
No, no. I think I'll leave it.

314
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,320
No, no, no.
Thanks a lot, anyways.

315
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
Bye.

316
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,280
Do you have any more of
that liqueur?

317
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,960
My sister really liked that.

318
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
Yes, thank you.

319
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
Hey, Debbie.

320
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,400
Hi.

321
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,280
Hi.

322
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,120
I'd like a keg of beer, please.

323
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,640
You don't say.

324
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,440
Yeah, how much is that?

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,640
Do you have any ID, sonny?

326
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
You little bastards just won't
give up, will you?

327
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
Listen, no ID, no goddamn beer.

328
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,040
Can't you get that through
your thick skull?

329
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
Give me...

330
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,280
...a keg of beer.

331
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
And these.

332
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
<i>Finding my way</i>

333
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,640
What did you say to that guy
in the store?

334
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Just...

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
...give me a keg.

336
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,720
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

337
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,920
Well, Lewis. this is it.

338
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
Tonight's the night.

339
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,320
Pamela Wells is going to be there
and so am I.

340
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,920
And so is Mick.

341
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,640
Of course he's going to be there.

342
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,520
They're going together,
aren't they?

343
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
No, they're not.
They're not going together.

344
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,520
Mick is like twenty years old,
right?

345
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,200
The only reason
he's still in high school is...

346
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,360
-...cause he did time.
-Lewis.

347
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Lewis, I'm telling you,
they're not going together.

348
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,680
Forget Pamela Wells.

349
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,840
They're not going together.

350
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
He's a total psycho.

351
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,200
Why don't you go for Boof.

352
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
She likes you.

353
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,040
You sound like my Dad.

354
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
Pull over.

355
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,120
Pull over.

356
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,240
Trust me.
They're not going together.

357
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,640
Im not even listening any more.

358
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,880
-I'm not...
-Would you just...

359
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
Once and fall all.

360
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,840
Once and for all
they're not going out.

361
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
-Yeah they are...
-Not.

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,880
-They are, dude.
-You're mistaken.

363
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,480
Lewis, Lewis, Lewis,
take my wheels.

364
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
I don't even have my license yet.

365
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,120
Come on, just do it.

366
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Look, Stiles,
let's just get to the party.

367
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,640
You know, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

368
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,880
Surf's up.

369
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,640
Drive out in front of us.

370
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
Yeah, not too close.

371
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
What are you guys gonna do?

372
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Lewis, would you just do it.

373
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,600
Kids.

374
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,560
Alright, okay, listen.

375
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,640
Im going to go slow, alright?

376
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
don't worry about a thing.

377
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,280
We've got everything
under control.

378
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,760
You do your thing
and I will do mine!

379
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,280
Cowabunga!

380
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Huh? What?

381
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,200
-Hey.
-Wow.

382
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,280
Wipe out!

383
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you all right up there?

384
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah, no sweat.
But just watch those waves!

385
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,440
Hello, everybody.
I have arrived. Good to see you.

386
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
You look great.

387
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah, nice hit baby.

388
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,600
-You are a cheezeballo.
-That's my middle name.

389
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,840
You'll never catch me up there.

390
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
Come on, man, you'd be the king
of the urbane surfing.

391
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,440
No way, Louie.
That's my baby. Give me that.

392
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
Hi.

393
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,840
You... are you looking for
someone in particular?

394
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Not you.

395
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,160
There you go.

396
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,880
She said two words to you.

397
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,400
Just like I said, yes, yes,
no dry throats tonight.

398
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,760
Now did I come through for you
big fella or what?

399
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,440
Okay. Put it down over there.

400
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,680
If we don't get to it tonight,
take it home.

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
That's it!

402
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,240
You got some kind of rash?

403
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,520
Matchmaker lady, the hat.

404
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
All right. Next up is...

405
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,960
Whoa, help me Rhonda!

406
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,800
Okay, what do I have to do?

407
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,000
Just read that little name
on the little piece of paper...

408
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,280
...we gave you.

409
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,000
It says, Chubby!

410
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,360
All right.

411
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
All right, Chubby, baby.

412
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,720
You have to eat
this whole bowl of jello.

413
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,640
Well, what do I have to do?

414
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,360
Hold the jello!

415
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,240
All right.

416
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
Next up is...

417
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,320
Boof!

418
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,600
Scott.

419
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,360
Booferino gets the Howard boy!

420
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
I dont know
if this is such a good idea.

421
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,000
Nonsense, baby.
You are going to love it.

422
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,920
In fact,
it's the grand prize, okay?

423
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Two minutes!

424
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,000
Anything goes, baby
and dont disappoint us.

425
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,960
It's kind of funny that
you got me.

426
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,880
I lied, I got Malcolm.

427
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,680
Malcom's a good guy,

428
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,640
You can come a little closer,

429
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
I promise I won't bite.

430
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
Go, go, go...

431
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
All right.

432
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,840
Now, all you have to do is
take this cup,

433
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,120
go up to Throne's house...

434
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,360
Tell him you're from
the board of health...

435
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,080
...and you want to check his,
ah, blood sugar!

436
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,680
Boof, ah, I feel kind of weird.

437
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,760
How do I feel?

438
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
What is this?

439
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,400
-Mick, you've got to see this.
-See what?

440
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
I don't see anything, come on.

441
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Aren't you getting
a little bit rough?

442
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,680
Hey, your finger nails!

443
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,080
It's awful quiet in there.

444
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,800
Do you guys think they're dead?

445
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

446
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,200
Hey.
There's only one way to find out!

447
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,280
So, tell us.

448
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,200
What's it like coming out of
the closet?

449
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,640
It was... unexpected.

450
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
Scott?

451
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,840
Scott?

452
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
Geeze Louise...

453
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,800
Scott?

454
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
Can I come it?

455
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,440
No, dad.

456
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,440
No, I'm a...

457
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,520
I'm doing something in here.

458
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
I'll say...

459
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,760
You may be surprised,

460
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,760
but whatever it is, son,
you can tell me.

461
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll understand.

462
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,800
No, dad.

463
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
No, not this time.

464
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,040
Scott Howard,
this is your father speaking!

465
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,840
Now open this door
right this minute!

466
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Okay, Dad.

467
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,240
You asked for it.

468
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,480
An explanation is
probably long overdue.

469
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
An explanation!

470
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,000
Jesus Christ!
Dad, an explanation! Look at me!

471
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,560
Look at you!

472
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,720
It's not as bad as it looks.

473
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Dad.

474
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,560
You mean you knew about this?

475
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,640
You knew about this
and you didn't tell me!

476
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,680
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.

477
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Sometimes it skips a generation.

478
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,440
I was hoping
it would pass you by...

479
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,760
Well dad, it didn't pass me by.

480
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,680
It landed on my face!

481
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
What the hell am I gonna do?

482
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,320
Scott, we really need to
talk about this.

483
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,200
Forget it, Dad.
I don't want to talk. Go away!

484
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,160
Tough night, huh?

485
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,080
Yeah, yeah. You could say that.

486
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,440
On top of everything else,
there was a full moon last night.

487
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,840
Well I meant to talk to you
about that last evening but...

488
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,600
you were kind of upset.

489
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,640
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.

490
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,680
Looks like you can use it.

491
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,440
That'll help.

492
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,360
Look, Scott. Being what we are is
not without its problems.

493
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,840
But it's not all bad either.

494
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,280
Tell me about it.

495
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,480
Well, for one thing,

496
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
you're going to be able to do
a lot of things...

497
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,520
...the other guys aren't.

498
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,600
Oh, like...

499
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,560
...chase cars
and bite the mail man?

500
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
When you want it,

501
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,520
you're gonna have great power.

502
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,440
And with great power goes
a greater responsibility.

503
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,040
Your mother and I learned to live
with this thing and so can you.

504
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,480
And what if can't?

505
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I can look forward
to a life of...

506
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,320
...stealing babies
in the middle of the night...

507
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,320
And killing chickens.

508
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,200
Fearing full moons,
dodging silver bullets.

509
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,960
Well, thank you, Dad.
But no thanks.

510
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,960
Don't believe all that stuff
you see in the movies.

511
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,240
With certain...
obvious exceptions...

512
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,440
...werewolves are people
just like anyone else.

513
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,160
What I'm trying to say is...

514
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,840
...the werewolf is a part of you,

515
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,080
but that doesn't change
what you have inside.

516
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
Look, Dad,

517
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,600
I've got a bad outside hook shot.

518
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,320
I'm allergic to eggs.
I've got a six dollar haircut.

519
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,040
I mean, I have problems.

520
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,080
I don't need this one.

521
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,960
I gotta get to school.

522
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
That went well.

523
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,880
-Hello.
-Hi.

524
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,080
Bye.

525
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
There's something
different about you.

526
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,720
That's nice.

527
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,240
Did you change your hair?

528
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,240
Missed you in lunch today, Scott.

529
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,080
Ah... yeah, hi, Boof.
Ah, sorry, I forgot. I forgot.

530
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,640
Well, I have to go
study my lines. Kirk...

531
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,040
Mr. Lolley.

532
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,080
He's so demanding.

533
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,040
-Bye.
-Bye.

534
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,920
How's it going Stiles?

535
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,920
The twins were abandoned
and surely would have died...

536
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,600
...in the wilderness
if they hadn't been saved...

537
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,040
...by a... by a what?

538
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,200
A miracle?

539
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,040
Yes, I suppose, but what form...

540
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,520
...did this particular
Miracle take?

541
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Scott Howard?

542
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,400
Very amusing Scott,
but you are correct.

543
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,040
The infants were saved and
suckled by a wolf.

544
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,960
A she wolf, wolf, wolf...

545
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,040
Wolf!

546
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,560
Thomas Wolfe.

547
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,560
Don't you people ever read
what I assign you?

548
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,480
"Look Homeward Angel"

549
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Scott,

550
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,880
it's a book, by Thomas Wolfe.

551
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,760
Wolfe!

552
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,440
-Wolfe!
-Scott.

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,640
Oh, come on, Scott.

554
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,000
It's a lot simpler than it looks.

555
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,640
Okay.

556
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,600
Just try it, Scott.

557
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,080
I gotta go...

558
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
It's wet. You can't go in.

559
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,440
That's wet too.

560
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,640
Don't change. Don't change!

561
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,240
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm!

562
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,240
A little far from your side of
the building, aren't you, Howard?

563
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,960
No! I mean, yes, sir,

564
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
but the halls were wet.

565
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,520
-Let me see your hands.
-Sir.

566
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,320
Let me see your hands now.

567
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,560
You wouldn't happen to
have a marker on you, would you?

568
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
No.

569
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
Ah, no. Ah, no sir.

570
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
I've got my eyes on you...

571
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,640
...and if you ever
get out of line.

572
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,920
Yeah. I've got to go.

573
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,080
Hey, what are you doing?

574
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,680
Hey. Big Brother always keeps
a stash out here for emergencies.

575
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,920
Hey, listen.

576
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Listen, Stiles,

577
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Ive got to talk to you
about something,

578
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,320
cause it's making me nuts.

579
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,920
Yeah, well, I hear you,
but if it's that intense...

580
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,800
...I'll need a solid buzz
to think clearly.

581
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Look, I wouldn't even...

582
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,320
I wouldn't even mention it
to you...

583
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,160
...except that I got to
talk to someone.

584
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,920
Wait a minute. Are you going to
tell me you're a fag.

585
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
I mean if you're going to tell me
you're a fag,

586
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,080
I don't think I can handle it.

587
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,920
No. Im not a fag.

588
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,160
I'm a werewolf.

589
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,840
Where would that scumbag keep it?

590
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,200
Scott?

591
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,960
Scottie?

592
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
Stiles, it's me.

593
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
What do you think?

594
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,520
Can you do that...

595
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,640
...anytime you want?

596
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,840
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean I just did.

597
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
But, see sometimes it happens
when I don't want it to.

598
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,160
What can I say?

599
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,720
You're beautiful.

600
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,440
Hey...

601
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,280
What can a Teen Wolf do?

602
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,080
I can smell
what you're looking for.

603
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,640
The stash?

604
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
No, I checked there.

605
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
Stiles, Stiles.

606
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,120
This is just between
you and me, okay?

607
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tw.

608
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,920
Look at you.

609
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,920
TW, you're going to be glad
you came to me with this, yes.

610
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,600
Because with the right angles...

611
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
...yeah, we're going to turn this
into something...

612
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
...monstrous!

613
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,160
Stiles.

614
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,440
Stiles.

615
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
No way, no way, no way!

616
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Hi, Scott.

617
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
HI.

618
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,440
Boof came over for
a little one on one...

619
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
...and she's killing me.

620
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,080
What, what's so funny?

621
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,320
Nothing. We were just chatting.
Do you mind?

622
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,320
No, no, hey, why should I mind?

623
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,040
Well, I got to get going.

624
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
Would you like to walk me home.

625
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,840
Ah, Boof, I just got here.

626
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,680
Scott.

627
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,560
Yeah.

628
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,680
Thanks, Harold.
Thanks for the game.

629
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,680
Thanks for everything.

630
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,880
You better work on
that jump shot.

631
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
You coming?

633
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
Yeah.

634
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,040
So you guys were chatting.

635
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,920
Harold Howard
and his famous chats.

636
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
What did he say?

637
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,360
He just mentioned that...

638
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,240
...you were thinking about
quitting basketball...

639
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,560
...to work on a school play.

640
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,440
Yeah.

641
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,800
I can see why.

642
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,720
She's very pretty, Scott.

643
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,200
But she has a boyfriend.

644
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,880
A very large boyfriend.

645
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,280
Look, it doesn't matter anyway...

646
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,520
...because the way
things are going now...

647
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,440
...it'd be better if I just
stayed away from everyone.

648
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,760
Even me?

649
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,840
I couldn't get rid of you
if I tried.

650
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,760
-What?
-Do you remember?

651
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,640
How old were we?

652
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,920
-Six?
-We were five.

653
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,240
I wanted to run away from home...

654
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,720
...and you wouldn't
let me go alone.

655
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,440
I was afraid you'd get lost.

656
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,440
Yeah, but I didn't get lost.

657
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,440
So we just kept walking around
the block because our...

658
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,440
-... parents wouldn't let us...
-... parents wouldn't let us...

659
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,840
-...cross the street.
-...cross the street.

660
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,680
God, I thought they were going to
kill us when we got me.

661
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,480
I know, but then when we did,
nobody even knew we were gone.

662
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,040
Did you ever tell anybody?

663
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,560
-No.
-Me neither.

664
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,280
Scott,

665
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,880
if you ever need
someone to talk to...

666
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,840
if something's bothering you...

667
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,760
I'll understand.

668
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,760
Not this time, Boof.

669
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
You won't understand.

670
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,080
I've got to go.

671
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Yeah. Bye.

672
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,240
Okay, now here's the drill.

673
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,680
Play them man for man.

674
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,680
-You know who you've got.
-Hey, baby, ten hut.

675
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,360
Nice hair cut over there.
Be all that you can be.

676
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,080
How was Grenada, man? Hey, Louie,

677
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,200
Louie, what's going on here?

678
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,600
Is the President here today
or something?

679
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Good luck, Scott.

680
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,160
Ah, thanks. Thank you.

681
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,000
Alright,
look at it this way guys,

682
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,800
it'll all be over
in less than an hour.

683
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,640
Any strategy
against Meechum, Coach?

684
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,160
Hey, you guys are great.

685
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,520
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

686
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,400
Go on out there. Give them hell!

687
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,800
Go!

688
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
That's a foul. Let's go.

689
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,840
Come on, set it up.

690
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,520
All right, Scottie, up the line.
You can do it.

691
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,240
Come on get me some salt.

692
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,200
Salt.

693
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,000
Easy... easy...

694
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Come on, let's go!

695
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,840
-Alright, guys!
-Play!

696
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,440
Let's play a little ball here!

697
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,080
Hey, Scott, did the coach know?

698
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,240
Hey, I didn't know. I mean...

699
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,440
-How do you feel?
-He feels...

700
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,840
...like a winner!

701
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,800
Hey, Boof, Boof, did you know?

702
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,080
Are you kidding?

703
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,480
Hey, Lewis.

704
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,880
Whoa, Mr. T.

705
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,240
You may think you're something
special around here,

706
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,520
but let me remind you that
I'm still the vice-principal.

707
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,680
Hey, hey, I'm no different
than anyone else.

708
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,840
That's nice.
You look good in that.

709
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,840
-Well, Scott Howard.
-Hey, Boof.

710
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,240
Aren't you afraid
you'll disappoint all your fans?

711
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,320
Look, Book, I can't help it...

712
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,240
...if the whole town has gone
wolf crazy.

713
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,080
I mean this wasn't my idea.

714
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,320
There are some advantages.

715
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,600
-None.
-All sizes, no waiting everybody.

716
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,400
Check it out. Right over here.
Check it out.

717
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,120
Hey, Scotto,
tip of the iceberg baby.

718
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,840
We are cleaning up.

719
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,080
Boof, I got something for you.
Here you go.

720
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,320
Here we go. Check it out.

721
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,920
All sizes, no waiting.

722
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,680
Elegant.

723
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,560
Scott! Scott!

724
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,440
Listen to this. Kirk wants you to
be in the play.

725
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,080
He does?

726
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,200
Wait a minute, Pamela.
What about basketball?

727
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,480
It won't interfere.
It's a small part, just for you.

728
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,800
Here, Pamela, this is for you.

729
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,280
It's too big for me.

730
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,040
There are some advantages,
Scott, admit it.

731
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,320
You can murder my family,

732
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,760
you can ravage my body...

733
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,320
But I beg you...

734
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,840
...with all that is
decent and holy,

735
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,520
don't destroy my plantation.

736
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Sergeant, burn the fields...

737
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,000
...and when you're done
with that, burn the house.

738
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah,

739
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,480
wolf, wolf, wolf... person,
whatever your name is...

740
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,000
That was really...

741
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,240
Thanks babe, I love ya.

742
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
...something!

743
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,320
Come in.

744
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,080
Hi.

745
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,040
Close the door please.

746
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Yeah.

747
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,840
Relax,

748
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,160
we're just one big happy
family in the theater.

749
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,120
Yeah.

750
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,680
What happened to the wolf?

751
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,080
Can you just change
back and forth...

752
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,000
...whenever you feel like it?

753
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,680
Sure. Well,

754
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,640
sometimes I have to get
kind of worked up to be the wolf,

755
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,280
but it's not too hard.

756
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,720
What do you think about,

757
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,600
to get worked up?

758
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,960
You are an animal!

759
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,400
Strike!

760
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,400
Five in a row!

761
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,720
Okay.

762
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,400
Did you know
he was going to be here?

763
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,800
We had such a nice day today,
Scott.

764
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,040
Don't spoil it.

765
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,920
Okay, you got it.

766
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,320
Nice, good, okay.

767
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,440
Good form.

768
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,600
Nice approach.

769
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,720
Boy that was nice and wonderful.

770
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Okay,

771
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,520
address the ball.

772
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Okay,

773
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,360
tuck in your tummy.

774
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,640
That's good.

775
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,880
Okay,

776
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,200
Here we go. You ready?

777
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,080
-Okay.
-Hey. Hey.

778
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,360
That's my girl.
Don't touch her again.

779
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,480
She's my date tonight, pal.

780
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,160
You don't scare me, freak.

781
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,960
Underneath all that hair,
you're still a dork, Scott.

782
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,200
I've handled your kind before.

783
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,680
Your mama used to steal chickens
out of the backyard...

784
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,600
Till I blew her head off with
a shotgun, right, Scott?

785
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,440
So, does that guy Mick always
act like that?

786
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,720
You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

787
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,200
You mean he was your boyfriend.

788
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,040
Is my boyfriend.

789
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,560
But what about us?

790
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,000
What about us?

791
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,960
Well, this afternoon
in your dressing room.

792
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Yeah?

793
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,040
Yeah.

794
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,960
Well, you see the spring dance is
coming up...

795
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,760
-...and I...
-And I already told you.

796
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,360
I'm going to the dance with Mick.

797
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,080
Hey, Chubaroo, nice game, guy.

798
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,600
At least we're winning.

799
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,600
You mean he's winning.

800
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,680
When do the rest of us get
our hands on the ball?

801
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,000
What good is it
being in the championship...

802
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,720
...if none of us get to play?

803
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,440
Hey, it doesn't matter
how you play the game,

804
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,720
it's whether you win or lose.

805
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,040
And even that doesn't make
all that much difference.

806
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,000
Hey, guys,
how about a celebration, huh?

807
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,400
Chubby, ice cream sundaes...

808
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,600
I'm supposed to be on a diet,
Scott. Remember?

809
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,200
Brad, a glass of milk?

810
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,200
I don't get it coach,
what's their problem?

811
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,680
Let me give you a little advice.

812
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,280
There's three rules
that I live by.

813
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,600
Never get less than
12 hours of sleep.

814
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,600
Never play cards with a guy...

815
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,360
...that's got the same
first name as a city.

816
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,480
And never go near a lady
who's got a tattoo..

817
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,840
...of a dagger on her body.

818
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,600
Now you stick with that,

819
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,360
everything else is cream cheese.

820
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,280
Great game there, Scottie.

821
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,320
Thanks, Coach.

822
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,000
Stiles.

823
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,400
Stiles,
where the hell did you get this?

824
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,760
Hey. Harry's Used Cars, man.

825
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,840
We traded in the Nova. Even swap.

826
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,600
Even swap. Get out of here.

827
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,040
How much extra
did you pay for this.

828
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,520
Even swap.

829
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,640
For certain considerations.

830
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,240
-What?
-Lookey here!

831
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,480
Stiles.

832
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
Hey, surf's up?

833
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,480
Yeah, yeah,
surf is definitely up.

834
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,640
Well, let's go pick up
Lewis, okay?

835
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,280
What? Stiles come on,
what is it with Lewis?

836
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,360
He's avoiding me, right?

837
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,120
He's scared of me.

838
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,440
Look, man, we've got
some fine new wheels.

839
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
We got some good tunes...

840
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,600
...and a total disregard
for public safety!

841
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,760
You're right, okay, let's go.
Surf's up.

842
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,160
Wait a minute.

843
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,800
These waves are mine.

844
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,360
Unbelievable!

845
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,600
Unbelievable! You know what?

846
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,480
You look great up there.
Are you all right?

847
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,200
Missed you at the hardware store
the last few days.

848
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,040
Yeah. Sorry,

849
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,360
I was with Stiles this afternoon.

850
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,520
I know.

851
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,160
You saw.

852
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,240
Yeah, I saw.

853
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,760
Unless that was
another werwolf...

854
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,160
...doing a hand stand on
top of Stiles' wolfmobile,

855
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,640
and making a fool of himself.

856
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,160
Look, Dad,

857
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,080
I'm trying to
get a grip on this...

858
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,800
I really am.

859
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,560
Is Thorne still on your back?

860
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,240
Yeah, Thorne,

861
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,240
some neanderthal named
Mick and...

862
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
...the entire basketball team.

863
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,880
Well, you've dug your own hole
with those fellows but...

864
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,200
...this Thorne business is
my fault.

865
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,760
Wait.
What do you mean your fault?

866
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,240
It goes back a few years.

867
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,200
As you know...

868
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,160
...I loved your mother
since we were kids.

869
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,480
We always knew we were meant
for each other.

870
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,520
But for some reason Rusty Thorne
set his cap for her too.

871
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,640
And no matter what we tried
he just wouldn't go away.

872
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,400
One night, things got a little
physical and...

873
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,480
...and you turned into
a werewolf.

874
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,480
Out of anger. Scott,

875
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,800
I turned into the werewolf
out of anger.

876
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,960
Right in front of
his beady little eyes.

877
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,600
Was he scared?

878
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,840
Scared?

879
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,280
He lost control of
his bodily functions.

880
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,960
I wish I could of seen that.

881
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,320
It wasn't
a very nice thing to do.

882
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,840
But it worked.

883
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,000
After that he never bothered
your mother or me.

884
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,960
But to this day...

885
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I don't know who was most
frightened that night.

886
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,520
Old Rusty Thorne or me?

887
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,600
You got to get a hold of it, son.

888
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,880
Morning, Daisy.

889
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,280
Morning.

890
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,920
Boof.

891
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,320
What's up?

892
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,680
Nothing.

893
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,600
Why does anything ever
have to be up?

894
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,200
I just thought Id walk to
school with you.

895
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,280
Got any plans for
the school dance?

896
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,960
No. I haven't given it
much thought.

897
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,680
I am surprised they haven't
decided to call it...

898
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,160
..."Teen Wolf Ball."

899
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,120
Will you...

900
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,360
...go with me to the dance?

901
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,840
I'll think about it.

902
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,720
Is that a yes?

903
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,760
Yes. On one condition.

904
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,760
You take me to the dance.

905
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,280
I thought
we just established that...

906
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,240
You, Scott Howard.

907
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,040
Not the wolf.

908
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,200
No. No.

909
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,600
Look, I've got to be the wolf.

910
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,360
I mean that's
what everyone expects.

911
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,840
Is that what you want?

912
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,480
Everybody likes the wolf.

913
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,640
Alright, almost everybody.

914
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,400
You said it yourself.
I mean if I go...

915
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,960
...as Scott Howard,
I'm gonna be average.

916
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,800
I mean damn it,
why do I have to be...

917
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,120
...like everyone else?

918
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,200
That's not a problem for you
anymore.

919
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,760
And I guess I don't have a date
for the dance.

920
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,240
Look, Boof...

921
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,920
I'm sorry.

922
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,040
I can't.

923
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,520
Hey, listen.

924
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,800
You still dance with me,
won't you?

925
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,760
Even if I'm a werewolf?

926
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,280
Yes, I'll still dance with you.

927
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,000
-Will you feed me grapes?
-Don't push your luck.

928
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,480
Tickle my paws?

929
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,800
She's right. You are an animal.

930
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,840
There he is! There he is

931
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,600
Oh, my God!

932
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,360
You look fabulous.

933
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,480
Absolutely gorgeous!

934
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,560
Hey, guys.

935
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,560
Nice to see you.

936
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,760
Thank you, thank you...

937
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,760
Hey. Hey, how are you doing?

938
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,320
Hey, save me a dance?

939
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,040
You'll have to ask my escort.

940
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,360
Stay away from her tonight.
I'm warning you!

941
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,200
Hi, how are you doing?

942
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,720
You still want to dance with
the wolf?

943
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,360
Wolf, wolf, wolf...

944
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,840
Your public wants you.

945
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,160
Do you mind?

946
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,200
-What?
-What am I going to do about you?

947
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,760
Hey, Boof. I am what I am.

948
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,760
All I said was...

949
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,840
I might want to dance with him.

950
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,240
You can't possibly take him
seriously...

951
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,600
...not unless you're planning on
having his puppies.

952
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,360
I want Scott for
just a half hour.

953
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,760
I really missed him.

954
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
Stay away from Pamela!
She's mine.

955
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,600
Stick with your own kind, freak!

956
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,360
Like that little tramp.

957
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,200
Mick, watch out!

958
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,160
What are you all laughing at?

959
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,600
You're just some kind of animal.

960
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,800
Come on, freak!

961
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,920
Get back here. Let go of me!

962
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,600
Let go!

963
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,480
Get back here! Come on, freak.

964
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,840
I'm not through with you yet.

965
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,600
Come back here, freak!

966
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,720
This isn't done by a long shot.

967
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,560
Get. back in here, freak!

968
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,520
Hold it!

969
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,160
Now you've done it!

970
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,400
You don't know
how long I have waited...

971
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,920
...to get you
right where I have you.

972
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,800
You're never going to play
basketball again.

973
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,520
You know why?

974
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,560
Because you're not going to be
here anymore. That's why.

975
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,560
You're out of here Mr. Howard!

976
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,080
-And don't you try to...
-Thorne.

977
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,320
Go home, son.

978
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,440
Go ahead.

979
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,080
I'll handle this.

980
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,680
You uh... never learn.
Do you, Rusty.

981
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,960
You stay away from me.

982
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,960
I want you to leave my son alone.

983
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,520
He's a good kid.

984
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,880
He's just having
a tough time right now.

985
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,800
Okay?

986
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,840
I knew I could count on you,
Rusty.

987
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,800
You can murder my family.

988
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,080
You can ravish my body...

989
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,200
...but I beg you
with all that is...

990
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,720
...decent and holy.

991
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,480
Don't destroy my plantation!

992
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,440
Sergeant,

993
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,560
burn the fields...

994
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,840
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, baby.

995
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,200
Hold... hold it.
Hold it right there, babe.

996
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,080
Listen.

997
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,280
This is a full dress rehearsal.

998
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,760
We need to see the wolf,
so wolf out,

999
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,280
wolf up, wolf it.
What ever you do.

1000
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,360
<i>Pronto amigo?</i>

1001
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,240
Well, Mr. Lolley,

1002
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,400
Well, I've been doing some
thinking and I decided that...

1003
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,840
...I'd rather play
the part as me.

1004
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,200
Well, play it. Play it as myself.

1005
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,480
Well, that,
that wouldn't be theater,

1006
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,480
would it? See,

1007
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,600
no one wants to see you.

1008
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, like I said,

1009
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,280
I'd rather play it like this.

1010
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,600
Okay, I see.

1011
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,560
How am I going to
put this to you?

1012
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,320
Look at it this way...

1013
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,760
no wolf, mmm? No wolf,

1014
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,960
ah, no part.

1015
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,000
What do you think?

1016
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,200
Wow. Bummer, huh?

1017
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,160
Hey, Scottie?

1018
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,560
Well, look at it this way, Boof.

1019
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,480
At least I'll have
my Friday nights free.

1020
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,280
Even if you're not going to be
the wolf anymore.

1021
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,680
Do you have to
quit the basketball team?

1022
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,240
Come on, Boof. Are you kidding?

1023
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,200
Look, you've seen me play
basketball. I suck.

1024
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,400
They want the wolf.
I can't give it to them.

1025
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,560
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait, wait, just a minute.

1026
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,760
What's going on here?

1027
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,440
What are you guys talking about?

1028
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,280
We're talking about the wolf,
Stiles.

1029
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,640
I can't do it anymore.

1030
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,800
You saw what happened.

1031
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,960
Scott, what are you, crazy?!

1032
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah, I think maybe I am.

1033
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,880
Scott, you got the championship
basketball game...

1034
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,560
...coming up
in less than four hours.

1035
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,480
I mean you've got everyone
depending on you.

1036
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,920
What are you going to do?
Let down your team,

1037
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,240
your school, this whole town?

1038
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,120
What about me?

1039
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,360
I've got a very large investment
going on over here, Scott.

1040
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,360
And then...

1041
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,200
Hey, Scott, do it for me.

1042
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,760
I've got to go, man.

1043
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,840
Scott, help me out.

1044
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,960
Do the right thing.

1045
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,920
That's all I want to do, Stiles.

1046
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,760
That's all I want to do.

1047
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,600
Time.

1048
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,520
Chubby, get time.

1049
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,080
Come here.

1050
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:55,920
See that.

1051
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,600
Come on.

1052
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,600
That's a purple heart.

1053
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,640
Smart basketball, Brad,
taking charge out there.

1054
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:28,760
Oh, man.

1055
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,400
So, where's the wolf?

1056
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,200
Not today, coach. No wolf.

1057
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,600
Good idea.
Wait till the second half.

1058
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,480
-Build up their confidence.
-Coach.

1059
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,800
Look coach...

1060
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,240
No wolf, not now, not ever.

1061
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,440
Look, I want to play,

1062
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,760
but I got to be myself.

1063
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,760
Okay, but we're going to get
our brains beat in, you know.

1064
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,760
You sure you won't change
your mind?

1065
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,080
I don't want to go back
out there! I've had it!

1066
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,760
That is all your fault, Howard.

1067
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,120
I think we can take these guys.

1068
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,200
That's terrific, Scott.

1069
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,440
Now when do we get to
see the wolf?

1070
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,960
No, Chub, I mean it.

1071
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,560
I think we can win this.

1072
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,920
This is the championship.

1073
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,880
Now it doesn't matter
how we got here. We're here.

1074
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,360
If we're gonna win,
we gotta pull it off ourselves.

1075
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,960
You don't need the wolf.

1076
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,800
Harold, your boy let us down.

1077
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,120
You're dead.

1078
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,680
Shoot. Shoot it.

1079
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,760
Shoot it!

1080
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,680
Shoot it, fat boy.

1081
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Yeah!

1082
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,920
How much more
can you take, freak?

1083
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,600
As much as
you can dish out, man.

1084
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,520
What's so funny, dork?

1085
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,400
That's four fouls.

1086
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,440
One more and you're out of there.

1087
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,680
All right!

1088
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,560
Come on. Make your move.

1089
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,920
You gotta get back.

1090
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,200
Get back.

1091
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,240
You got two shots.

1092
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,880
Get back. Off the court.

1093
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,560
Let's blow out of here.

1094
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,880
Drop dead.
