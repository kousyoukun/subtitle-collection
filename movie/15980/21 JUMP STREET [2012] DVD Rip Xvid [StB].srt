1
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,917
Hey, Melodie.

2
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:50,678
-Hey.
-Look, I know

3
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,318
we've known each other
for a really long time.

4
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:58,760
And we live across the street
from each other and stuff.

5
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,034
And...

6
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:04,001
I know, like, in four days,

7
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,723
I'm sure, if...

8
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,194
-You know, prom's, like, in four days...
-Oh, my God.

9
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:11,116
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

10
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:18,764
Fuck, no.

11
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,723
No, I... No, I just...

12
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:24,276
-You're probably going with someone.
-I'm sorry.

13
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,118
I don't know how to put this nicely.

14
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:27,685
There's not a nice way to put it.

15
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,199
You're a fucking nerd.

16
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:32,085
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

17
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,085
Look at her. Look at her.

18
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:37,596
-Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.
-I'll see you later.

19
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,918
-Bye.
-All right, buddy, good talk.

20
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:41,520
Dude, classic.

21
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,043
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.

22
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:47,799
-Shit.
-Good luck, bro.

23
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,045
I said loud and clear,

24
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:53,438
if you didn't get your grades up,
you weren't going to the prom.

25
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:56,317
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

26
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,287
I should pay who?

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,518
You're not going to the prom.

28
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:02,878
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

29
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,324
But I'm going to be prom king.

30
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:08,365
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

31
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,083
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

32
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,444
Fuck! Fuck!

33
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:47,050
Welcome to the Police Academy.

34
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:50,521
Make sure your form is completely filled out,
then move along.

35
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,528
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

36
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,208
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

37
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,961
Oh, fuck!

38
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,167
-You're good at this, huh?
-Yeah, I am.

39
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:11,241
Thank you.

40
00:03:13,172 --> 00:03:15,003
Such bullshit.

41
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,605
You're really good at this.

42
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,646
Yeah, I am.

43
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,252
Hey, you want to be friends?

44
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:29,929
Come on. Come on, let's go.

45
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,768
Come on, pick your knees up.
Pick your knees up.

46
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,846
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

47
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,370
Chill, all right?
Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

48
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,251
What did I tell you?
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

49
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,245
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

50
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:49,849
Faster. Let's go.

51
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,363
Clear!

52
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,163
Clear!

53
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,246
Come on, come on, come on! Stop.

54
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,893
Yes! Yes!

55
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,331
Let me see. Let me see.

56
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,609
Nice.

57
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:14,532
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:18,370
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

59
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,687
Get ready for a lifetime
of being badass motherfuckers.

60
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,095
I am.

61
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:35,486
I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,

62
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,693
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

63
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,055
Do you guys really think
this is a police matter?

64
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,286
To get your Frisbee back?

65
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,814
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

66
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:46,445
Shit.

67
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,616
Shit! Shit!

68
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:52,048
Yours isn't loaded, right?

69
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,254
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

70
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:55,737
What, you... No.

71
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:57,410
That's no fun. Come on.

72
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,056
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

73
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:00,287
It's right there.

74
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:02,454
-Don't you... Don't...
-Don't. Stop it.

75
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:05,496
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

76
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,371
You feel like a big shot?

77
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:09,812
No fucking way.

78
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:11,813
One Percenters?

79
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,978
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

80
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,092
If we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

81
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,377
You see what I see?

82
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:22,336
Cannabis sativa.

83
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,573
Chaka Khan.

84
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,809
Chaka Khan?

85
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,492
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

86
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,936
Have we forgotten
that the use of marijuana is illegal?

87
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:51,569
I have glaucoma.

88
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,014
I get nervous in crowds.

89
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:54,335
Herpes.

90
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,497
Then you won't mind
if I search your bike, now, would you?

91
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,977
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

92
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,852
-Get up.
-Calmate, gringo.

93
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:08,458
Man, you guys even real cops?
You look like the kids on Halloween.

94
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:13,099
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

95
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,578
I know, right? I know.

96
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,411
It's hilarious.

97
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,975
So why don't you show us a little respect?

98
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,541
-Fuck you, pig.
-Hey.

99
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,211
You want me to beat your dick off?

100
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:24,373
You want to beat my dick off?

101
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:26,294
I'll beat your dick off with both hands.
What's up? Let's go.

102
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,339
-That's weird, man.
-I think what he was trying to say was,

103
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,983
he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area

104
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,213
that your dick's just going to fall off.

105
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:34,622
Why do you have salt in your...

106
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,614
-That's actual drugs.
-Oh, my God.

107
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,341
Get on the ground! Hey!

108
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,062
-Come here now!
-What do I do?

109
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:41,862
-Chase someone!
-Chase someone?

110
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,737
Are you leaving your bike here?

111
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,337
Okay. All right.

112
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:50,061
Don't run from me!
You're making it worse for yourself!

113
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,463
No! Get out of the way!

114
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,818
Stop!

115
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:57,093
I'm going to shoot you
if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

116
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:00,663
Hey! Come here!

117
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:03,213
I'm not playing anymore! I'm so not kidding!

118
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:05,182
I got him. I got him.

119
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,504
Freeze! Freeze!

120
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,697
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

121
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,425
That's it! Come here!

122
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,936
Freeze! Stop it!

123
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,304
You're a pussy!

124
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:35,185
You got the right to... Give me that!
You got the right to...

125
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,623
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

126
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,300
My elbow.

127
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:41,345
-You got nothing.
-How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

128
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,304
-Hey! Hey!
-How's it feel? How's it feel now?

129
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,026
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

130
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,546
We got one! I got him!

131
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:50,300
Yes! Yes!

132
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,945
-Yeah!
-We got an arrest!

133
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:54,383
-Yeah! We got him!
-Yes!

134
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:57,943
-Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
-Fuck you! Yeah!

135
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,097
What's up?

136
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:05,536
Drop my nuts
on your motherfucking forehead!

137
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,903
-That's right.
-Fuck you, park!

138
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,740
-We arrest people now!
-What up, park?

139
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:12,463
-What's up? What's up?
-What up, park? Who wants one?

140
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:21,583
Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

141
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,341
-Thank you, Cinnamon.
-Are those new?

142
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,938
The department was forced
to drop the charges

143
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:28,749
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda rights.

144
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,108
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

145
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,385
you have to do when arresting someone?

146
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,385
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

147
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,587
-Do you even know the Miranda rights?
-Yes.

148
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,543
Let's hear them, then.

149
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,669
You got a lot of stuff to do.

150
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,707
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

151
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,906
We got time.

152
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,465
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

153
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:55,827
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,

154
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,469
for a total of 57 words.

155
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:01,829
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with,
"You have the right to remain silent."

156
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,904
I know you've heard this before. And then,

157
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:08,507
I think it sounds something like...

158
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:11,868
-"You have the right to an attorney."
-Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

159
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,546
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

160
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,669
Did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?

161
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:21,381
You do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.

162
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:22,588
Where were you?

163
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:26,191
I was chasing my perp, sir.

164
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,104
And how did that go for you?

165
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:30,747
Honestly, he did get away,

166
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,671
and he threw me down pretty hard.

167
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,948
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

168
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,148
Can I see that?

169
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:39,703
Yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

170
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,229
Wow.

171
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:43,902
Fortunately for you two,

172
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:47,748
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s

173
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,506
and revamping it for modern times.

174
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,868
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

175
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:54,151
Iack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,

176
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:58,028
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

177
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,946
and expect us all not to notice.

178
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:04,273
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

179
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,073
immature-seeming officers.

180
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,704
Sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,

181
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:12,673
a child sex slavery ring or something?

182
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,350
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

183
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,189
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

184
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,347
I think you idiots are perfect.

185
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:23,909
You're officially transferred.

186
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:25,509
-All right. Yeah.
-That's great.

187
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,308
Where should we report to?

188
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:29,034
Down on Jump Street.

189
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,993
37 Jump Street.

190
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,191
No, that doesn't sound right.

191
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,511
Is it...

192
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:40,313
This has got to be a joke.

193
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,230
This is it.

194
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:51,553
Aroma of Christ Church?

195
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,596
How's it going?

196
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,791
This place is weird.

197
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,627
Everybody comfortable?

198
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,395
Yeah.

199
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,276
Get your motherfucking ass up
when I'm talking!

200
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,550
You will be going undercover
as high school students.

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,635
You are here simply because you look young.

202
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,758
You some Justin Beaver,

203
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,674
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

204
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,200
Captain Sassy.

205
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:51,960
I know what you're thinking,

206
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,670
"Angry Black Captain."

207
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,321
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

208
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,796
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

209
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,109
I'm black.

210
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,314
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

211
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:08,952
And sometimes I get angry.

212
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,600
So suck a dick!

213
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,840
What I'm trying to show you is,

214
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,038
embrace your stereotypes.

215
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,114
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

216
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,761
And he's probably a dummy.

217
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,037
And then this guy.

218
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:26,156
He's short and insecure.

219
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:27,801
And he's probably good with money.

220
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:30,192
-You are good with money.
-What the fuck?

221
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,717
Didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?

222
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,317
I don't... I actually didn't...

223
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:35,631
I didn't get a letter or anything.

224
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:38,437
-Yeah, like, a start time...
-With a dress code or anything like that.

225
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,275
Teenage the fuck up!

226
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:45,675
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

227
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,437
Do not get expelled.

228
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:50,561
Nobody in the system knows you're here.
All right? Nobody.

229
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,236
You get kicked out of school,

230
00:12:52,324 --> 00:12:55,999
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of Jump Street.

231
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,802
Rule number two. Burns.

232
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,479
Do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.

233
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,200
You hear that? That's you.

234
00:13:05,445 --> 00:13:07,003
-Don't do it, man.
-Why...

235
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:09,724
-Keep that dirty dick in your pants.
-Dirty?

236
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,477
Don't fuck no students.

237
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,159
Don't fuck no teachers.

238
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:16,716
Sir, I know we come off
as a couple of lady-killers,

239
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,957
but I promise you
we will be super professional on the job.

240
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,514
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties.

241
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,842
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

242
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,281
I was talking to your partner over here.

243
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,322
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

244
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:31,364
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

245
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:32,595
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

246
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,165
-I'm talking to you.
-Cool.

247
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:37,757
Now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.

248
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,041
Right now!

249
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,683
Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.

250
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,365
So I bought these,

251
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,686
which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right now.

252
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,362
Cheers.

253
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,765
It's a new synthetic d rug.

254
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,998
Goes by the street name H. F.S.

255
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,044
Holy fucking shit.

256
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,722
Holy...

257
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,878
They put this on the Internet
for everybody to see?

258
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,641
They're teenagers, man.
They're really stupid.

259
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,559
So you should blend right in.

260
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,926
Jessica, will you go to prom with me?
But I already know the answer. It's yes.

261
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,808
I could watch this kid all day.

262
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,489
Man, this kid rules.

263
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,924
Ruled.

264
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,241
His parents found him OD'd
in his room a few days ago.

265
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,644
He's dead.

266
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,283
Whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.

267
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,449
And as you can see, this kid is white.

268
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:58,290
That means people actually give a shit.

269
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,321
Sir, I just want to throw out to you
that I would give a shit if he was black.

270
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:09,171
Right now, H. F.S.
is contained right there at Sagan High.

271
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:13,524
Now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.

272
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:17,327
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

273
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:20,372
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

274
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,522
Iike photography and drama.

275
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:25,002
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

276
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:26,845
Find out who's slinging this shit.

277
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,163
Schmidt, says you were a virgin

278
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,811
-through high school.
-It says that?

279
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,645
No. I just assumed it,

280
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:38,012
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.

281
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,450
It's the Juggling Society,
but it's fine. It's fine.

282
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,889
They're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.

283
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:46,130
That's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.

284
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:48,722
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

285
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:51,812
Here's your new identities, all right?

286
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,725
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

287
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,567
The mission is this.

288
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,083
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

289
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,005
We get to be brothers?

290
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:03,167
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

291
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,894
But if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.

292
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,728
God damn.
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

293
00:16:25,136 --> 00:16:26,774
Hey, Korean Jesus.

294
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:31,535
I don't know if you only cater
to Korean Christians

295
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:35,808
or if you even exist. No offense.

296
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,296
I just...

297
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:45,095
I'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.

298
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:51,569
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

299
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:57,569
I know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe I'm not the best cop.

300
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,257
Korean Jesus,
I just really don't want to fuck this up.

301
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,893
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

302
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:06,572
The end?

303
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:10,057
I don't really know how to end a prayer.
The end?

304
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,287
Yeah.

305
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,974
Hey! Hey!

306
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:20,415
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

307
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,928
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

308
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,572
With Korean shit.

309
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,127
-You two get to your mama house ASAP.
-What?

310
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,888
You're teenagers now, all right?

311
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:32,175
You two are staying
at Schmidt's parents' house

312
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,978
for the duration of this assignment.

313
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,459
Fuck me.

314
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,136
This house is adorable.

315
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,858
My baby's home! Come here.

316
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,578
You will always be
my infant angel baby child.

317
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,378
There's my guy.

318
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,052
It's great to see you guys.

319
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,497
-Hey.
-Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

320
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,697
Oh, my God.
Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

321
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,931
-This is unbelievable.
-Well, yeah.

322
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,216
-I guess I did.
-It's gorgeous!

323
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:57,814
So are you.

324
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:01,337
Honey, listen, I want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room

325
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,649
'cause we're kind of using that
as a workout area,

326
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,373
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

327
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:07,175
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please.
No, no.

328
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:09,139
Don't touch that.
We just brought it back from Sedona.

329
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,736
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

330
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,255
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

331
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,577
-and you guys haven't moved on.
-Rid of it?

332
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,176
If we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.

333
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:20,532
I look like Fred Savage
from The Wonder Years,

334
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,500
but completely naked,
wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

335
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,573
That is a great picture, Morton.

336
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:26,982
You look like a young Jay Leno.

337
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:29,697
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

338
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,092
No.

339
00:18:32,183 --> 00:18:33,901
I remember. You know why?

340
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:36,736
Because I've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.

341
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:41,175
I mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.

342
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,821
It's literally a medal for sucking.

343
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,815
-No, that is a medal for trying.
-Yes.

344
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:48,783
Let me tell you something.
This guy was always a great tryer.

345
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:51,980
That must be Phyllis.
She is just dying to see you.

346
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,101
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here?
She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

347
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,176
I told you, it's an undercover assignment.
It's super secretive.

348
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,579
"Undercover." That's so cute.

349
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:04,339
-I'm going upstairs.
-Okay, honey. I want you to know

350
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:05,824
-we are so glad you're here.
-Okay.

351
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,861
That's great. Thank you.

352
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,220
-All right. Where is he?
-He's upstairs.

353
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:13,103
He just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.

354
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,460
-Bye-bye.
-I baked muffins!

355
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:17,941
If you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.

356
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:19,293
You got to study this stuff.

357
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:22,264
Forget those identities. They're bullshit.
They said I was held back a year.

358
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:24,064
You were. You were held back two years.

359
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:27,218
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

360
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,581
Fuck! Socks don't match.

361
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,065
I got to start all over.

362
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,217
It's the first day of school, dude.
I got to look awesome.

363
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:36,062
You know, back in the day,
you were super popular,

364
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,866
and I wasn't as much.

365
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,456
We didn't really get along in high school.

366
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,578
You don't think that's going to happen again,
do you?

367
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:49,616
No. Come on, man. We're adults now.
We're best buds.

368
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,106
It's definitely not going to happen again.

369
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,745
-We're good.
-Cool.

370
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,784
Beautiful day out there, boys.

371
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,981
Just shut up.

372
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,825
"Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

373
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,102
"You have the right to an attorney.

374
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,225
"If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."

375
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:15,699
Dude, do you still not know
the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

376
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,782
Come on, man. They always cut away on TV
before they finish them.

377
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,142
All right, let's do it.

378
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,021
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-What?

379
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,098
What are you doing?

380
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,140
-What? What are you talking about?
-Are you two-strapping?

381
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,820
-My backpack? Yeah.
-Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

382
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,703
You got to one-strap it.

383
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,384
Seriously, I would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.

384
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,823
Okay, what makes you the expert?

385
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,259
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

386
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,302
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

387
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,906
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School,
by Jenko.

388
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,347
One, don't try hard at anything.

389
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,741
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

390
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:57,742
Three, be handsome.

391
00:20:57,831 --> 00:21:00,061
Four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,

392
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:02,187
you punch them directly in the face.

393
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:04,660
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

394
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,980
Shit.

395
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:13,469
All right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,

396
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:16,385
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

397
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,030
We would never.

398
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,349
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

399
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:24,864
-Hey, you ready?
-Go!

400
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,343
That was awesome! That was amazing.

401
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,549
-Was I flying?
-That was amazing.

402
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:37,907
All right, do mine, do mine.

403
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,553
-Okay, ready? Here I go.
-Yeah, yeah.

404
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,193
You okay?

405
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,026
I think I shit my pants.

406
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,703
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

407
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:02,592
-It'll make us look cool.
-That's awesome.

408
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:19,064
Dude?

409
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:22,034
-Everybody's two-strapping it.
-Just stay with the one-strap.

410
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:23,994
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

411
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,670
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

412
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,348
-What are you doing?
-You're supposed to use two straps.

413
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:30,996
-One strap is peer pressure.
-No. No. You're fucking up right now.

414
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,034
Okay, those are Goths.

415
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,115
Those are nerds.

416
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:39,550
I don't know what they are.

417
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,791
What the fuck are those things?

418
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,270
I'm so confused right now.

419
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:53,946
Whoa.

420
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,228
-Hi.
-Hey.

421
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:00,070
-Hey.
-Good morning.

422
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,553
Hey, yo. Hey.

423
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,676
-Is that your car?
-Yeah.

424
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,350
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

425
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:10,156
No, try, like, seven.

426
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:13,149
-What about you?
-Biodiesel, dawg.

427
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,626
Smells like egg rolls.

428
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:18,507
Yeah, it does.
Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

429
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,796
But we try to ride bikes when we can.
Global crisis and whatnot.

430
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,753
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

431
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,558
You don't care about the environment?
That's kind of fucked up, man.

432
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,231
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

433
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,037
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

434
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:34,712
Look at him. He's trying.

435
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,592
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

436
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,597
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

437
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,910
-Look at him. Look at the nerd.
-Who you calling a nerd, man?

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,319
I'm sorry. What...

439
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,078
-Shit!
-Shit, dude.

440
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,230
Are you okay, man? Hey, what the hell?
Are you serious?

441
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,992
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

442
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,957
-You punched me because I'm gay?
-What?

443
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,755
No. Come on.

444
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:54,990
That's not cool, man.

445
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:56,309
That is really insensitive.

446
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,720
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

447
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:01,919
I punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.

448
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,077
-I was gay when you punched me!
-In a weird way,

449
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,470
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you

450
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,392
-just because you were gay.
-Right.

451
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,473
You punched a little gay
black kid in the face,

452
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:12,917
and it's not even second period.
How do you explain that?

453
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,716
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

454
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,315
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

455
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,161
A kid died the other day from drugs,

456
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:23,598
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.

457
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,080
That's weird, guys.

458
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:29,151
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

459
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,473
causing trouble in my school.

460
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:34,396
I am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face

461
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:37,873
away from a nervous breakdown.
Do I make myself clear?

462
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:39,237
You guys cross my line again,

463
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:43,794
and you walk into this office,
I'm going to expel you. You got me?

464
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:47,240
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

465
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:50,715
Let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.

466
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:53,239
Which one of you is named Doug?

467
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,401
-No, dude, I'm Brad.
-Okay, good.

468
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:57,719
So that means your name is Doug, son.

469
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,283
-Yeah, I'm Doug.
-Great.

470
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:00,723
Here are your class schedules.

471
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:03,398
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.

472
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:06,204
I wouldn't.
But you as a drama geek, far less surprising.

473
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,684
Thank you.

474
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:09,357
Now we have the wrong identities,
you dumbass.

475
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:12,602
I'm in drama. I suck at drama.
It's girly and embarrassing.

476
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:15,074
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

477
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:18,481
I can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.

478
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:21,841
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry.
And, no, you can't,

479
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:23,837
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!

480
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:27,562
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes,
and I'm going to go to yours.

481
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:29,716
Okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?

482
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,155
Fuck.

483
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:35,924
So, we are going to hold auditions
for the Peter Pan part today.

484
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:40,283
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

485
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:44,396
When I was a young actor just starting out
in New York state,

486
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:45,920
Albany, to be exact,

487
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:48,202
-I booked a local television commercial...
-Hey.

488
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,278
... in which I had to play a young man...

489
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:53,279
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

490
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:57,401
So are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?

491
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:01,005
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

492
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,484
I was just busting your balls.

493
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:08,479
Okay. Good.

494
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,724
I remember, one time,
doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

495
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:17,480
and we were having so much fun.

496
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,800
And then I realized that she was dead.

497
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:23,924
I remember one summer...

498
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,000
Do kids still do this stuff?

499
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:27,881
Even after what happened to him?

500
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,482
Everyone's saying
that Billiam had a heart murmur.

501
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,642
Pretty much everyone I know does it,
but it's not my thing.

502
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,001
It's not really my thing, either,

503
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,888
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

504
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,882
Who would he call if he wanted it?

505
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,086
Well, you can tell your friend

506
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,519
that if he really wanted it,

507
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,601
it's not so hard to find.

508
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,124
When to take it.
He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

509
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,042
Drugs are bad.

510
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:58,285
But they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.

511
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:00,327
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

512
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,367
Notice the distinction.
I said "professional actor."

513
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:09,884
New person. Mr. Texty T exty.

514
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:12,850
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

515
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,361
Iet's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

516
00:27:15,492 --> 00:27:18,370
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

517
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:22,929
I can't.
I'm fine just being a tree or something.

518
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:25,122
Doug, you never won't know

519
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:28,722
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.

520
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,928
My point is,

521
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:32,811
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

522
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:35,731
Yeah, sure.

523
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:37,885
My favorite molecule is water.

524
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,248
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter.

525
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,890
Its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.

526
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:49,252
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.

527
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:51,163
H2O.

528
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,928
H2O. H2O.

529
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,252
-H2O
-It's okay. Thank you.

530
00:27:57,654 --> 00:28:00,088
Thank you, Zack. So good.

531
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:02,972
All right, anybody else
for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

532
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:05,686
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

533
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:07,044
A what?

534
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:08,969
I'm sorry.

535
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,568
What is your name? Brad?

536
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,533
-Brad. Yes, ma'am.
-Wow. Look at you,

537
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,253
Brad. Big.

538
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,813
What is a pop Quiznos?

539
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:24,285
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

540
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:27,450
-Today's quiz is on...
-You look really old.

541
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:31,650
-Were you held back or something or...
-No. You look super young.

542
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:33,613
Were you held forward?

543
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:36,773
I went to school in France, so...

544
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:40,292
And they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. It's so lame.

545
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:43,216
French, the language of love.

546
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,932
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

547
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:47,966
Hey.

548
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:51,496
Good luck.

549
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,449
I've gotta crow

550
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,777
I'm just the cleverest...

551
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,207
Okay.

552
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:17,733
Maybe try one cooler.

553
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,092
And faster.

554
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,698
And louder. And better.

555
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:27,529
And less insecure and more just cool.

556
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,130
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

557
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,369
I'm going to run outside,

558
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,258
and I'm going to utilize those,
and I'm going to come back.

559
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,529
It's such bullshit.

560
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,100
Wow. You're fast.

561
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,931
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

562
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,331
Let me check out your chest.

563
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,093
Check out your test... Let me...

564
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,739
Let me grade your quiz.

565
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,133
Can I go take a dump?

566
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,498
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

567
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:23,295
We have this "hurry back" rule,

568
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:26,419
so if you're not back in six minutes,
I have to send you to the principal.

569
00:30:27,262 --> 00:30:28,934
Rules are rules, so,

570
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:32,176
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

571
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,016
-Which way is yearbook?
-I don't know.

572
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:35,138
-Is it this way?
-I don't know!

573
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:53,213
-Yo.
-Hey.

574
00:30:53,304 --> 00:30:54,293
You guys, huh?

575
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,743
That was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.

576
00:30:58,824 --> 00:30:59,939
-Yeah.
-He feels awful. He feels...

577
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,861
Totally, very nervous.

578
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,260
You're the dealer?

579
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:05,379
-You're the dealer guy?
-Is that you?

580
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,100
Yep.

581
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:08,300
So do you make the stuff or...

582
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:11,138
Do I look like a fucking scientist?
No, I just sell it.

583
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:13,774
-Yeah, he just sells it. Come on.
-Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

584
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,821
-I meant I just...
-How many you guys want?

585
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:17,538
20 bucks a pop.

586
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:21,537
One each? One pop each of drugs.

587
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,140
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

588
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,461
Whoa!

589
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,338
-Dude, come on.
-No! Maybe you're a narc.

590
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:29,344
You know who calls people narcs?

591
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,984
Narcs, narc.

592
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,305
First of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,

593
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,058
because if you call us narcs,

594
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:39,903
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

595
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,817
-'Cause you just said that.
-They call people...

596
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:44,216
Look, I don't have time for this shit.
You guys want to do this or not?

597
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:45,376
-Jesus.
-Yes.

598
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,344
-Yes, yes.
-No problem.

599
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,984
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

600
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,136
I'm sorry. What?

601
00:31:53,147 --> 00:31:55,263
-We were going to take it home.
-I gotta go back to class,

602
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,736
-is the only thing.
-I was thinking that I was going to go home,

603
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,300
maybe turn down the lights,

604
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:00,787
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

605
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:02,620
I was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.

606
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,541
Okay, I'm not asking.
Take it now or get the fuck out.

607
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,584
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.

608
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:10,737
Yeah?

609
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,864
Yeah, no, it's all good.

610
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:18,624
-I love doing drugs at school.
-I'll just take the drugs right here,

611
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,302
in our mouths.

612
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,022
There you go. That's it.

613
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:30,663
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

614
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,137
Have fun.

615
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:34,948
-You got to pull the trigger!
-Okay.

616
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,622
You got to pull the trigger!

617
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,502
-We got to throw up, man.
-I can't.

618
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,660
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died.
We got to throw up.

619
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,422
Just think of something gross.
Think of something gross.

620
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,149
-You fucking think of something.
-Okay, all right, all right.

621
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,698
Your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.

622
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,667
-What the fuck are you saying?
-I don't know! I'm just trying!

623
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,468
-I'm trying my best! I'm just trying!
-Fuck! Come on, man!

624
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,427
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths.

625
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,060
-No!
-Yeah.

626
00:32:55,151 --> 00:32:56,300
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

627
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,064
-Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die?
-Okay, fine!

628
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,864
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

629
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:11,222
What are you doing?
Are you trying to find my G-spot?

630
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:13,303
-Just stick it in!
-I don't know. I've never done this before!

631
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,507
Just stick it in! Go!

632
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:21,551
Cut your fucking fingernails!

633
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:24,780
Oh, God!

634
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:27,905
Is it me?

635
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:29,311
I'm sorry.

636
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:30,507
I just can't sometimes.

637
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,305
Think we're going to be fine.
I don't feel anything.

638
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,832
Me, neither.

639
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:36,511
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

640
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:39,906
You got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

641
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,705
Pass, in your hand.

642
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:42,942
Hello.

643
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,708
Damn. You guys are late.

644
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:47,545
Now I'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.

645
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:51,752
-No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry.
-Come on, please.

646
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:53,825
You have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.

647
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:56,429
When'd you go through puberty?
Like, at seven or something?

648
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:58,710
You look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.

649
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:01,628
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

650
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:02,789
I read your file.

651
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:05,992
You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

652
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,225
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

653
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,146
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?

654
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:11,384
I consider that a threat.

655
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,233
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

656
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:16,148
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

657
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:17,984
That's Brad.

658
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:20,589
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

659
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,472
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

660
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:27,827
the track star, and this is Brad,
the science prodigy.

661
00:34:30,356 --> 00:34:32,472
He's really fast.

662
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,185
Is this funny to you guys?

663
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:47,386
So you're Doug. You're Doug. You're Doug.

664
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:48,705
You're Doug. You're Doug.

665
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:50,350
Here's the deal.

666
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:53,275
My track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.

667
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,436
I mean, if I wasn't the coach,
I'd be laughing my ass off

668
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,873
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

669
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,916
so I need you.

670
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,310
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

671
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:05,513
Understand?

672
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:09,707
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400
at today's track meet.

673
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:12,392
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

674
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,511
Don't blow on me, son.

675
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,354
I haven't trained.

676
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:21,069
Guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.

677
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,231
Do we have a deal?

678
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,034
Yes.

679
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,233
Nice.

680
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,871
I don't like that.
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

681
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,597
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it.

682
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:38,390
What are you doing? Stop it.

683
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,751
Actually, that's not bad.

684
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,751
All right, here you go.

685
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,637
Are you guys on drugs?

686
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,389
Okay.

687
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,154
One particle of Unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

688
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,751
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner
into a radioactive spider.

689
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,593
Fuck you, science!

690
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:11,878
All right, all right, we're good.

691
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,873
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

692
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:15,634
We're good, baby.

693
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,113
Good work. Hit that shit.

694
00:36:25,722 --> 00:36:28,873
I've gotta crow

695
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:31,472
I'm just the cleverest fellow

696
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:35,192
'Twas ever my fortune to know

697
00:36:36,043 --> 00:36:38,273
I taught a trick to my shadow

698
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,400
To stick to the tip of my toe

699
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:45,519
I've gotta crow

700
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:50,353
I've gotta

701
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:55,677
Crow!

702
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:58,322
Ch ristoph, d id you feel that?

703
00:36:58,404 --> 00:36:59,837
Who are you?

704
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,714
Welcome aboard, Peter.

705
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:17,838
No, keep it going!

706
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:20,075
Keep it going. That was so tight!

707
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,399
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

708
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:28,161
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

709
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:29,964
All right! Yeah!

710
00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:32,357
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

711
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,994
I know y'all seen this shit before.

712
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,485
I know you've seen this shit before.

713
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:40,240
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

714
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:42,197
You're looking amped!

715
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:45,556
Here we go.

716
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:46,966
Here we go! Here we go!

717
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:49,201
Hey, pick it up!

718
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,399
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up.
What are you doing?

719
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:55,516
What are you doing? Pick it...

720
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,764
What? McQuaid!

721
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:01,286
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

722
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,162
Come on!

723
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,920
McQuaid!

724
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:07,124
Run that way!

725
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:10,320
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

726
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:15,282
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

727
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:16,682
Let's go! Come on!

728
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,327
Oh, my God.

729
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:20,556
No, no.

730
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,408
No, stop.

731
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:24,003
Come here. Come here.

732
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:25,522
Don't make a...

733
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:27,088
That is a baton penis.

734
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:38,680
Speak of the devil!

735
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,443
Dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

736
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,760
Organized sports are so fascist.
It makes me sick.

737
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,729
That's just what I do.

738
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,767
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

739
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,121
I don't get this school.

740
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,609
That was awesome.

741
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:59,282
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

742
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,770
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

743
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,648
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

744
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,767
Okay, Captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,

745
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:06,045
but they're not normal popular.

746
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,599
They're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone

747
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,010
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

748
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,162
It's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.

749
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:14,966
Lead dealer, Eric Molson. Alpha dog.

750
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,168
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

751
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,441
Did the AIDS run this year.

752
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:21,087
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

753
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:22,525
and he totally gets me.

754
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,887
Who put this together? Are you autistic?

755
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:26,843
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

756
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,281
-the yarn actually indicates...
-We're compiling a list

757
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:31,408
of suspicious types at school.
The users are here.

758
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,802
This kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.

759
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:34,962
Cut the bullshit!

760
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,607
I want to know who's the supplier.

761
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,647
We don't know. That's why
there's a question mark on his face.

762
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,883
That's not the way his face looks.
That's just a question mark.

763
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:45,612
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

764
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:46,882
Simple.

765
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:50,170
Sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.

766
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:51,727
Great job. You guys are on fire.

767
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:54,125
-So proud.
-Like you could do any better?

768
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:56,086
We just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs

769
00:39:56,174 --> 00:39:58,529
stripping down cars
in the Garfield High metal shop.

770
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,732
-What?
-Meanwhile, you two were standing around

771
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,691
finger-popping each other's assholes.

772
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:06,368
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

773
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,968
What we're doing is getting shit done.

774
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,444
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

775
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:12,173
I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech

776
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:15,565
drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.

777
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,288
-Password!
-Open the door!

778
00:40:24,775 --> 00:40:26,333
-You have to say the password.
-I'm sorry. What?

779
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:27,815
What are you...

780
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,570
Geez.

781
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,407
What are y'all doing?
How'd you get a key in here?

782
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:39,727
Ms. Griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

783
00:40:40,256 --> 00:40:42,167
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

784
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:43,809
-Let me see. You dealing drugs?
-No.

785
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:45,728
It's just a card game.
It's, like, a hybrid card game.

786
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:47,655
-See? They open up.
-Battle Brawlers.

787
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,568
-You're not doing anything illegal?
-No.

788
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:53,207
-What are you doing in here?
-I'm here to study.

789
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:55,813
Good. You could use it.
You're pretty far behind, so...

790
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:57,974
You're behind. I'm ahead.

791
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,253
-I know everything.
-Really?

792
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,095
What's a covalent bond?

793
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:04,169
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

794
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,726
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry.

795
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:09,532
I just... I don't think you know everything.

796
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:10,887
I know everything.

797
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:12,647
Okay.

798
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:23,448
What kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?

799
00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:27,852
They say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.

800
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,531
It helps them to stick together.

801
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:32,813
I could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.

802
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:35,928
What are you doing
with all those phones anyway?

803
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,053
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.

804
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,893
You know, I switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

805
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,174
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

806
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,139
No, no, I can't install a spyware
to remotely monitor calls

807
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,619
or anything that the mic picks up.

808
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,095
-I can't do that at all.
-Wait, you can't do it?

809
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,733
No, I can't.

810
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,892
-Is he being sarcastic?
-I don't know.

811
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,290
So you can.

812
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:04,458
Liking comic books is popular.

813
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:07,294
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

814
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:10,532
If I was just born 10 years later,
I would have been the coolest person ever.

815
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,538
I know. It's bullshit.

816
00:42:13,981 --> 00:42:15,096
You know what?

817
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,491
I totally know the cause.

818
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:20,016
Glee. Fuck you, Glee.

819
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:23,013
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

820
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:27,221
I might become popular.
I might get in with the popular kids.

821
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:31,578
We just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

822
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:32,817
You saying we should throw a party?

823
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:35,782
I'll invite Molly,
and then Molly will invite Eric,

824
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:37,900
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.

825
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:40,372
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?

826
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:41,816
I think it would be better if you get in

827
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:43,461
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.

828
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:45,022
That'd be the best thing for the case.

829
00:42:45,503 --> 00:42:48,176
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

830
00:42:57,624 --> 00:42:59,694
-Hello?
-Hey. Is this Molly?

831
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:01,299
Speaking.

832
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:02,863
Hey. It's Schmidt.

833
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:06,740
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

834
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:09,094
Hey, man.

835
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:11,141
It's so weird that you're calling me.

836
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:15,343
I pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.

837
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:19,215
I was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,

838
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,420
-and...
-Hello?

839
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:21,694
Mom, get off the phone!

840
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,817
Sorry, Doug,

841
00:43:23,905 --> 00:43:25,577
-my teen son.
-Mom!

842
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,020
I love you, honey, Dougie,
Doug, Douglas McQuaid.

843
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,937
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

844
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,625
I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.

845
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:40,785
She just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

846
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:44,137
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

847
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:47,624
Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.

848
00:43:47,787 --> 00:43:50,984
There was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

849
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,861
The doctor thought
I was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.

850
00:43:54,387 --> 00:43:55,900
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

851
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:57,776
Yeah, because you already had one.

852
00:43:57,947 --> 00:43:59,346
Exactly. I already had one.

853
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,185
And you don't need two vaginas.
You just don't.

854
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,303
Although you could use one as a coin purse.

855
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:05,866
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

856
00:44:05,948 --> 00:44:08,223
Wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

857
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:10,139
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.

858
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:13,581
I'm just fucking with you.

859
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:15,661
That is a weird joke.

860
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:17,380
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

861
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,060
No, he did walk out on us, though.

862
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:22,057
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

863
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:23,218
Just broken dreams.

864
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:26,619
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say,

865
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:27,818
well,

866
00:44:29,189 --> 00:44:31,305
that there are some good guys out there,

867
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:34,984
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

868
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:37,378
taint your memory.

869
00:44:37,669 --> 00:44:38,988
Oh, my God.

870
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:41,903
Are you getting choked up?
I'm sorry if I made you upset.

871
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,825
No, it's just, you know,
I don't like when guys are mean to girls.

872
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,265
Yeah. Well, thanks.

873
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,741
Normal transition here.

874
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,101
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come!

875
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,021
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

876
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,269
Do you mind if I just put, like,
a posting on Facebook?

877
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,342
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

878
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:04,066
I should call you back.

879
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:06,381
Well, all right, I'll see you at school.
You're a great person.

880
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:07,426
-Bye-bye. Bye.
-Bye.

881
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:09,069
What the fuck are you...

882
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,231
Are y'all throwing a party?

883
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:26,145
-What?
-There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

884
00:45:27,032 --> 00:45:28,784
And if any of my officers

885
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:31,944
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

886
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:34,348
they'll find theyself in prison

887
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:38,743
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

888
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:42,070
and me shitting down that snorkel.

889
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,910
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

890
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:48,953
You're the best. You are the best.

891
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:50,626
-Oh, my God.
-We love you.

892
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:51,822
-Enjoy the vineyard.
-You boys be good, now.

893
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:54,189
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

894
00:45:54,474 --> 00:45:55,668
Bye!

895
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:58,222
"We love you"? What are you doing?
Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

896
00:45:58,314 --> 00:45:59,667
-I'm in character. Shut up.
-It's weird.

897
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,907
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

898
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:06,152
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

899
00:46:06,794 --> 00:46:08,512
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

900
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:18,191
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

901
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:20,349
Oh, no.

902
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:28,150
We got a pound of coke.

903
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:30,591
We're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.

904
00:46:30,676 --> 00:46:31,791
Pound of marijuana?

905
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:33,868
-Best party ever.
-Boo-yah!

906
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:51,667
To a brilliant idea

907
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:53,634
from my brilliant brother

908
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,748
that I love so very much.

909
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:58,476
And this is going to fucking rock.

910
00:46:58,597 --> 00:47:00,394
-Cheers, man.
-Cheers.

911
00:47:07,038 --> 00:47:08,915
-Who invited you guys?
-I did!

912
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:09,987
The party's here!

913
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:12,230
-What's up, Zack?
-Hey, buddy.

914
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:13,353
What's up, Roman?

915
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:16,828
This is crazy. This is, like,
the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

916
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:22,595
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

917
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:24,192
Do we have enough chips?

918
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:26,190
Is this playlist too dance-y?

919
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:27,428
-Feels too dance-y.
-Too dance-y?

920
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,909
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

921
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,838
What are you doing?

922
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:39,035
-That's my mom's Kokopelli vase.
-I got it, I got it.

923
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,592
Doug, Doug, hey!

924
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:43,831
Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.

925
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,068
Such a bad joke.

926
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,275
T errible, terrible.

927
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,509
-You guys know each other, right?
-Yeah.

928
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,438
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric.
Wait for the signal.

929
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,431
And then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.

930
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,635
What?

931
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,594
What's up, man, how you doing?

932
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,473
Eco Suave.

933
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,030
Whoa.

934
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:03,279
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

935
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,552
Very Native American.

936
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,400
Yeah, our parents are actually

937
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:09,955
-really into Native American...
-Let's rock and roll.

938
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,234
-Sorry.
-What are y'all doing?

939
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:15,439
-Come on.
-Did you guys even see Eric?

940
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:17,552
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

941
00:48:18,082 --> 00:48:19,800
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

942
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:22,635
Yo, this is butt.
There's, like, no hot dudes here.

943
00:48:22,722 --> 00:48:24,474
-Man, let's bounce.
-We're out of here, man.

944
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:27,395
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here,
you just got here.

945
00:48:27,482 --> 00:48:29,632
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

946
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:32,111
Okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,

947
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,715
just go as fast as you possibly can.

948
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:37,432
Taking out the SIM card.

949
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:39,479
Taking down Eric
with the SIM card information

950
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:41,315
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

951
00:48:41,403 --> 00:48:43,041
-Are you drunk?
-No.

952
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:44,476
Have you even been drunk before?

953
00:48:44,603 --> 00:48:46,116
-No, but...
-Give me this.

954
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:47,841
-What?
-Can we get some bitches up in here?

955
00:48:47,923 --> 00:48:49,720
'Cause it's just boys right now.

956
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,521
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

957
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,282
This is my parents' bedroom.

958
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:56,718
-What the fuck, bro? Some privacy!
-Shit, shit, shit!

959
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:59,238
And that is a really gross three-way.

960
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:02,322
But what was the girl in the back doing?

961
00:49:02,404 --> 00:49:04,395
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

962
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,236
Cool, yeah.

963
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:08,315
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

964
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,474
but we got to get going.
You know how it is, yeah?

965
00:49:10,564 --> 00:49:12,202
Dude, tell me about it.

966
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,804
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

967
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:16,364
It's extracting right now.

968
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,356
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

969
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:20,197
Read this.
"Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

970
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:22,435
Shit! It's a bust.

971
00:49:26,645 --> 00:49:27,839
-Keep it casual.
-Yeah.

972
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,920
-Go with the flow, dude.
-Cool, man.

973
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:30,358
-I don't like to make plans or whatever.
-You got it.

974
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:31,555
-Thank you again, though, man.
-All right.

975
00:49:31,646 --> 00:49:35,036
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

976
00:49:35,646 --> 00:49:37,204
Hey, why you here, Scott?

977
00:49:37,326 --> 00:49:39,715
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

978
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:41,797
No, I heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.

979
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:44,401
Wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.

980
00:49:44,486 --> 00:49:46,397
Got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...

981
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,555
I wasn't asking.

982
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:50,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

983
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:53,235
Take five, take five, man, let me get this.
I got this.

984
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,636
-Yeah? You sure?
-I got this one.

985
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:58,558
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

986
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:00,558
-Don't worry about who I am.
-I'm worried about it.

987
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:02,638
-Why?
-'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

988
00:50:02,807 --> 00:50:05,162
This is my temple,
this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

989
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:08,087
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,

990
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,682
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,

991
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:14,841
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott,
what, what, what, what, Scott?"

992
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,281
-It's that kind of party?
-Yeah, dude.

993
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:18,364
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

994
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,439
-No, it's getting real.
-It's getting very real.

995
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:23,326
Yeah. It's like seven strangers
living in one house. True story.

996
00:50:23,408 --> 00:50:24,762
-You want Real World?
-Yeah, let's do it, man.

997
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:26,441
-Come on. What's your Real...
-Here's Real World.

998
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:28,443
What was that? Did you hear that?

999
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:29,962
Real enough for you?

1000
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,522
Schmidt. Doug.

1001
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:33,201
-What do I do?
-Hit him!

1002
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:36,722
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

1003
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,644
Fight normal.

1004
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,169
Yo, I'm serious.

1005
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,365
Sorry.

1006
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,084
-I'll fucking kill you!
-I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

1007
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:58,487
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

1008
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:02,280
I kicked him in the nuts.

1009
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,040
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

1010
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:15,640
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

1011
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:17,608
-I'm gonna fucking kill you!
-You'll knock over my mom's vase!

1012
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:19,728
-Fuck your mom's vase!
-Fuck this!

1013
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:26,081
Oh, shit!

1014
00:51:26,852 --> 00:51:28,126
Yeah!

1015
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,044
That's my brother!

1016
00:51:39,093 --> 00:51:41,482
-That was insane!
-You're so cool!

1017
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,447
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

1018
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:50,922
Oh, shit,

1019
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:52,926
when did I get stabbed?

1020
00:51:54,493 --> 00:51:55,643
That's awesome.

1021
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:58,763
Yeah!

1022
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:03,812
Is that a cop?

1023
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:05,122
Where?

1024
00:52:05,254 --> 00:52:07,449
No, it's not. Here.

1025
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:10,204
I'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.

1026
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,125
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

1027
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,654
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

1028
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:15,805
It's like we're living with a narc.

1029
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:17,854
The boy is an angel.

1030
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:19,524
Pull it out!

1031
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:23,564
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

1032
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:24,770
Sorry!

1033
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,050
Okay, let's take some shots.

1034
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:37,489
Shots, shots!

1035
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:44,965
That's like us fucking Mother Earth
without a condom.

1036
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:23,416
What the fuck is going on?

1037
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:25,369
Annie, hang on.

1038
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:30,097
Are you fucking kidding me?

1039
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:33,131
Get out of my house. I said get out!
The party's over!

1040
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:34,698
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry!

1041
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:36,537
The mom is coming!

1042
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:38,736
-Listen to me!
-Chill out! Chill out!

1043
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,538
-Let go of me!
-You're embarrassing me

1044
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,575
-in front of my friends!
-Get back here, you shit!

1045
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,691
Dude, that was so crazy, man.

1046
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,975
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

1047
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,698
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

1048
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,452
-like, all the time, man.
-I bet you are.

1049
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,969
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

1050
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,052
You, dude, I like you, man.

1051
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,698
How do you feel about making
a little extra money?

1052
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,857
Whatever it is, I'm in.

1053
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:04,209
All right, here's the deal.

1054
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:08,214
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own,
but I only bring in people I like.

1055
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:11,250
Okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

1056
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,417
I introduce you to my hookup.
How's that sound?

1057
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:15,700
-Cool with me.
-My man.

1058
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:17,658
That is my man...

1059
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:19,619
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

1060
00:54:22,182 --> 00:54:24,377
Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

1061
00:54:24,502 --> 00:54:25,855
Yo, yo.

1062
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:31,455
Come on!

1063
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:35,535
"I love dick"?

1064
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:37,101
You think that's funny?

1065
00:54:37,222 --> 00:54:38,702
"Wonder Years douche"?

1066
00:54:38,783 --> 00:54:40,978
What kind of a sick animal draws

1067
00:54:41,103 --> 00:54:44,539
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?

1068
00:54:44,623 --> 00:54:47,660
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

1069
00:54:48,463 --> 00:54:50,135
You think I don't know
that's a dick and balls?

1070
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:52,140
I know all about dick and balls!

1071
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:54,578
I partied with Robert Downey Jr.
before he got sober,

1072
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:56,939
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!

1073
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:59,055
You know what?
From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

1074
00:54:59,144 --> 00:55:01,419
You're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,

1075
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:05,133
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...

1076
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:12,497
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

1077
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:14,381
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

1078
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:17,144
and I had Zack put
this monitoring device in it,

1079
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:20,422
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.

1080
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:22,417
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

1081
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:23,460
What?

1082
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:25,501
-What if you had gotten found out?
-But it worked.

1083
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:27,462
This is, like,
the smartest move I've ever pulled,

1084
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:30,184
so, I'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?

1085
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:33,178
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad you have something to do.

1086
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,735
Good.

1087
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:41,265
What's up?

1088
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:48,260
Great job, Schmidt.

1089
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:06,262
-Password!
-Kneel before Zod!

1090
00:56:06,347 --> 00:56:07,621
You may enter.

1091
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:09,300
Thank you, Zod.

1092
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:18,503
Let's tap that wire, huh?

1093
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,340
We were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.

1094
00:56:20,428 --> 00:56:22,225
We were going to test what blows up.

1095
00:56:22,748 --> 00:56:25,581
There's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right?

1096
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,865
Not that I can think of
that would make sense.

1097
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:30,866
Go for it, go for it.

1098
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:32,746
-Look out.
-Go, go, go!

1099
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:36,778
Yes!

1100
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:39,060
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

1101
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,582
That's what I'm talking about!

1102
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:42,102
I love this science shit!

1103
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:44,618
This is what you guys do all day?
Let's do it again.

1104
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,469
Are you texting Molly?

1105
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,986
What?

1106
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:05,910
I don't... Molly...

1107
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:07,865
Maybe. Is that...

1108
00:57:07,951 --> 00:57:10,590
Whoa, it's cool, man, come on.

1109
00:57:10,671 --> 00:57:13,822
I'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.

1110
00:57:13,911 --> 00:57:16,550
I mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.

1111
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:19,748
I just, like... I don't know,
I don't believe in possessions, ja feel?

1112
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:22,628
Ja feel, ja definitely feel.

1113
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:24,709
-Yeah.
-Schmidty?

1114
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:27,461
Schmidty.

1115
00:57:28,632 --> 00:57:29,621
Phyllis.

1116
00:57:30,912 --> 00:57:32,311
-I'll be right back, dude.
-Okay.

1117
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:36,581
Hey. How are you?

1118
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:38,902
-How is my favorite police officer?
-Okay.

1119
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:41,507
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

1120
00:57:41,593 --> 00:57:43,106
Listen, now is not a really good time.

1121
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:45,151
Are you undercover right now?

1122
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:46,712
Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

1123
00:57:46,793 --> 00:57:48,465
Are those the bad guys over there?

1124
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:51,391
Do they have guns? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, this is so exciting.

1125
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,310
I have got to call Annie. She is gonna die.

1126
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:56,306
I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

1127
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,026
-Where is my phone?
-Okay, okay.

1128
00:57:58,114 --> 00:57:59,433
Shut your fucking mouth.

1129
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:01,630
Shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?

1130
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:03,545
Let's go check this out.

1131
00:58:03,634 --> 00:58:05,750
I will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.

1132
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:07,904
-There is no...
-A straight-up face punch.

1133
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:09,143
I swear to God, you're gonna get me killed.

1134
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:10,633
-Hey, yo.
-That is...

1135
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,351
Shit! She just tried to grab my dick, dude!

1136
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:16,630
-What? You tried to grab his...
-She tried to grab my junk.

1137
00:58:16,715 --> 00:58:18,273
She was like, "Oh, my God, I have arthritis,

1138
00:58:18,355 --> 00:58:20,027
"it hurts my hand,
I need to grab a handful of that dick."

1139
00:58:20,115 --> 00:58:21,230
I was like, "Get the fuck off me!"

1140
00:58:21,315 --> 00:58:22,668
She said, "I need to grab
a handful of that dick"?

1141
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:24,387
And it felt good,
but then it felt weird for a second,

1142
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:26,545
so I pushed her. We got to get out of here.

1143
00:58:26,675 --> 00:58:27,664
All right, cool, let's get the...

1144
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:47,744
So your parents are just cool
with having people over whenever?

1145
00:58:47,876 --> 00:58:49,594
Yeah, you know, they're out most nights.

1146
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:51,388
Pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.

1147
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:54,192
You're so lucky your parents
don't give a shit about you.

1148
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:55,471
Right?

1149
00:58:55,557 --> 00:58:57,388
-This place is awesome.
-Yeah.

1150
00:58:57,557 --> 00:58:58,672
Hey.

1151
00:58:59,157 --> 00:59:00,146
Hey, what's up?

1152
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,670
How's it going?

1153
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:04,669
Wow, that's a bigger hug
than I was expecting.

1154
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:06,876
Sorry. I'm happy to see you.

1155
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:08,515
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

1156
00:59:08,597 --> 00:59:10,190
-Hey.
-Hey.

1157
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:13,626
Good?

1158
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,237
-All right, come on.
-Yeah, let's...

1159
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,593
I brought tacos, so that's cool.

1160
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:20,511
Try to turn it, try to turn it, spoiler alert

1161
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,237
Spoiler alert, spoiler alert!

1162
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:28,194
Hey, boys, this eco-pussy
is going down today.

1163
00:59:28,279 --> 00:59:30,918
Take down eco-pussy

1164
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:33,752
Take down eco-pussy!

1165
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,278
Mother Earth, Mother Earth is dying

1166
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:41,149
And when it rains

1167
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:43,116
It means that beautiful bitch is crying

1168
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,150
-It's real ly not a planet.
-It's for sure a planet.

1169
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,033
Pluto is a planet.

1170
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,155
-It's ready!
-It used to be a planet.

1171
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,275
-It's ready.
-Not anymore.

1172
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,511
Reduce, reuse

1173
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,795
Recycle

1174
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,995
I'm embarrassed.

1175
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,469
-I always feel exposed after playing.
-Do not feel exposed.

1176
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,635
I got to use the bathroom.

1177
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,637
-Is it in there?
-Yeah, yeah, right up there, dude.

1178
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,711
All right, all right, all right, all right.
God damn that.

1179
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,269
The mic is live and we can
hear how the other half lives.

1180
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:22,721
What are you doing?

1181
01:00:22,802 --> 01:00:24,360
I heard something.

1182
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:26,558
Hey, can I ask you something? Sit down.

1183
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:27,836
Okay.

1184
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:31,394
I just want to make sure
that you and Eric are going to be careful

1185
01:00:31,482 --> 01:00:35,111
with whatever it is
that you're getting involved in.

1186
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:38,153
Yeah, I promise we will.

1187
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:40,632
It would just suck
if something bad happened,

1188
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:43,795
because you're a good guy.

1189
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:47,075
Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you,

1190
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:48,994
except girl version.

1191
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:50,842
You're a girl.

1192
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:52,682
-I am.
-Yeah.

1193
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:54,756
That's why I put this dress on,

1194
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:56,276
-to remind you.
-Exactly.

1195
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:59,362
-Are you excited about the play?
-Yes.

1196
01:00:59,444 --> 01:01:00,513
Yeah, you were just

1197
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:01,639
-right in there with excitement.
-Yes.

1198
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,123
-No hesitash.
-I'm very excited.

1199
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,717
Yeah.

1200
01:01:04,884 --> 01:01:06,442
Does that make me a super nerd?

1201
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:08,162
No, not at all.

1202
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,638
We get to act together.

1203
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:12,597
What a vagina. He has no chance with her.

1204
01:01:12,724 --> 01:01:13,793
So...

1205
01:01:13,884 --> 01:01:15,112
-Shit.
-Sorry.

1206
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,002
You're on the prom committee.

1207
01:01:17,085 --> 01:01:18,598
Do you think it's going to be fun?

1208
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:19,994
Did she just bring up prom on her own?

1209
01:01:20,085 --> 01:01:21,882
-She did, she just brought up prom.
-What is she doing?

1210
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:23,603
I think it's going to be awesome.

1211
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,084
-Prom eats a dong.
-Multiple dongs.

1212
01:01:25,165 --> 01:01:26,234
All right, anyone who says

1213
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:29,118
they don't care about prom
actually secretly does.

1214
01:01:29,205 --> 01:01:31,321
Who we gonna take to the prom?
No one's going to prom with us.

1215
01:01:31,405 --> 01:01:34,637
Come on, picture it.
You pull up in a white stallion of a limo.

1216
01:01:34,726 --> 01:01:36,364
You got fine-ass honeys with you.

1217
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:38,596
You're dressed to the nines
with your best buds.

1218
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:40,677
Doves fly out behind you, slow motion.

1219
01:01:40,766 --> 01:01:42,484
Doves. Why doves?

1220
01:01:43,086 --> 01:01:46,203
'Cause doves make you look
like a badass, that's why.

1221
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,004
I am pretty skeptical,

1222
01:01:48,726 --> 01:01:53,243
but maybe, if someone fun asked me,
I would go.

1223
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:57,322
Aren't... Isn't... Aren't you and Eric...

1224
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:58,999
Wouldn't you and Eric go together?

1225
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,959
Not that I know of.

1226
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:11,443
Would you...

1227
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:12,563
He's going to choke.

1228
01:02:12,768 --> 01:02:15,328
He always chokes.
He's going to choke, wait for it.

1229
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:18,680
So would...

1230
01:02:18,928 --> 01:02:20,486
So would...

1231
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:23,246
Would you...

1232
01:02:24,968 --> 01:02:26,196
Mayb...

1233
01:02:27,128 --> 01:02:29,484
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1234
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:32,647
That is the actual sound of choking.

1235
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:36,601
I was wondering if you...

1236
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:39,482
Would you

1237
01:02:41,129 --> 01:02:42,801
maybe want to go

1238
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:45,924
with me to prom?

1239
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:48,126
Would you want to go to me...
Maybe with me to prom?

1240
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:49,805
Yes.

1241
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,926
I would love to go to prom with you.

1242
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,720
What? She just said yes!

1243
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,289
-Whoa.
-Wow.

1244
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,441
Good for you, Doug.

1245
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:01,647
Thank you for asking.

1246
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:11,006
Put her there, man.

1247
01:03:11,091 --> 01:03:13,002
Just put... Put it right there.

1248
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,567
I'm putting it right there.

1249
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:18,563
Yeah. There you guys are.

1250
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:20,204
What's up, my man?

1251
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,280
-Hi.
-How you doing?

1252
01:03:21,371 --> 01:03:23,043
-Whazzup?
-Yeah.

1253
01:03:23,652 --> 01:03:26,485
Doug... Okay, settle an argument.

1254
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:28,284
You and your brother aren't related, right?

1255
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:29,600
'Cause you look totally different.

1256
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:31,011
He's adopted.

1257
01:03:31,092 --> 01:03:33,367
We all suspect from a very lame family.

1258
01:03:34,812 --> 01:03:36,040
Where is he tonight?

1259
01:03:36,172 --> 01:03:39,926
Probably at home with those lame tools
he hangs out with. I don 't know.

1260
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:42,607
You know how T om Cruise is
always pissed off at Rai n Man?

1261
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:46,242
That's like my life,
except Brad is really shitty at math.

1262
01:03:48,693 --> 01:03:50,172
Your brother's kind of a dick.

1263
01:03:50,253 --> 01:03:51,766
Well, yeah,

1264
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,686
he kind of is, isn't he?

1265
01:03:54,853 --> 01:03:56,047
Don't listen to that.

1266
01:03:56,373 --> 01:03:58,125
I don't give a fuck.

1267
01:04:04,214 --> 01:04:06,648
Dude, Eric is the funniest IM-er.

1268
01:04:13,534 --> 01:04:14,933
Oh, fuck.

1269
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:19,044
Hey, guys. It's so funny seeing you here.

1270
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:20,807
How are you? Guess what, I don't care.

1271
01:04:20,895 --> 01:04:23,363
We just closed our third
high school operation.

1272
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:25,366
And check what we found at Kennedy.

1273
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:28,049
Looks like we're going to have to do
your job for you.

1274
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:31,411
Your drugs is spreading
to different schools now, sucker.

1275
01:04:33,655 --> 01:04:37,615
You failed to stop the outbreak,
and you have no leads!

1276
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:39,767
We are running out of time!

1277
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:41,574
You either find the supplier,

1278
01:04:41,696 --> 01:04:44,164
or I'm gonna jump your asses
off Jump Street!

1279
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,212
I totally understand
where you're coming from, sir,

1280
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:48,730
but, look, I heard Eric
talking on the phone yesterday

1281
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:50,966
with somebody that sounded very suspect

1282
01:04:51,056 --> 01:04:53,206
about meeting up with a stuffed pinata.

1283
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,973
Is that a code for sex?

1284
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:01,534
-Pinata? Really?
-Yep.

1285
01:05:01,817 --> 01:05:03,489
Remember that wiretap
I put on Eric's phone?

1286
01:05:03,617 --> 01:05:06,290
While you were having the time of your life
last night, I was listening.

1287
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,215
I overheard a phone call between Eric
and some dude about a pinata.

1288
01:05:11,337 --> 01:05:12,453
That's all you heard?

1289
01:05:13,058 --> 01:05:14,127
Yep.

1290
01:05:17,698 --> 01:05:19,290
I am so nervous.

1291
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:22,455
We are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.

1292
01:05:22,538 --> 01:05:25,006
I apologize in advance
if I throw up on you onstage.

1293
01:05:25,658 --> 01:05:27,216
Serious question, though.

1294
01:05:28,018 --> 01:05:29,497
How do I look?

1295
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,538
Ravishing.

1296
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:34,048
Is it too sexy of an outfit?

1297
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,458
Bend the knee a little bit.

1298
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:36,892
Yep, it is.

1299
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:42,336
It's going to be so much easier
having you onstage with me.

1300
01:05:42,419 --> 01:05:43,898
I am so happy that I met you.

1301
01:05:43,979 --> 01:05:47,289
You're, like, the only guy
that I can really trust.

1302
01:05:47,379 --> 01:05:49,814
Yep. That's me.

1303
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,729
Doug.

1304
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,852
Potassium nitrate.

1305
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,692
Don't hate. It's great.

1306
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,572
It can act as an oxidizer.

1307
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,498
I didn't know that, but now I'm wiser.

1308
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,296
It has a crystalline structure.

1309
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:13,179
If you can't respect that,
you're a butt muncher.

1310
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:16,136
It's a key ingredient in gunpowder.

1311
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:19,260
K-NO-three, don't give no grief.

1312
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:22,574
It can be used to make corned beef.

1313
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:26,418
It's also known as saltpeter.

1314
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:33,537
-Brad?
-Shit.

1315
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,294
Where are you going?

1316
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,532
I don't want to look like
it's like I'm wearing makeup.

1317
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:39,340
-Right.
-Doug! Hi.

1318
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:40,775
Brad!

1319
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,096
Whoa. What are you wearing?

1320
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:43,775
Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.

1321
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:45,058
I need to borrow you.

1322
01:06:45,143 --> 01:06:46,815
Now's not a good time, Brad.

1323
01:06:47,383 --> 01:06:48,657
It's a really good time.

1324
01:06:49,223 --> 01:06:52,898
'Cause my pinata is killing me.

1325
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:54,974
Is that code for a sex thing?

1326
01:06:55,063 --> 01:06:56,701
It's leaving the parking lot.

1327
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:57,932
Pinata?

1328
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:02,019
Molly,

1329
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:04,060
I will be right back.
I need to help Brad with something, okay?

1330
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:05,736
I just need to help Brad
with something real quick.

1331
01:07:05,824 --> 01:07:06,939
-What? No. What?
-I promise you...

1332
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:08,776
Do you understand how soon
the show is starting?

1333
01:07:08,864 --> 01:07:10,456
I swear to you
I will be back in time for curtain.

1334
01:07:10,544 --> 01:07:12,375
-I swear. I swear to you.
-T ell me you understand how soon...

1335
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:14,420
What? Are you kidding me?

1336
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:18,176
What did I say? What did I say?

1337
01:07:18,264 --> 01:07:21,143
See? Whose wiretap is
working for him now, huh?

1338
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:32,014
Shit.

1339
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:33,414
Fuck!

1340
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:35,901
You told me not to worry about the tickets!

1341
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:38,136
I thought they made us look cool.

1342
01:07:38,226 --> 01:07:40,342
-Cones, cones...
-Driver's ed car.

1343
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:41,501
-I'm driving.
-No, you're not.

1344
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:44,504
-I never get to drive. I'm driving this time.
-Fine! Drive!

1345
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:46,537
-Hey, guys.
-Just borrowing this for one sec.

1346
01:07:46,626 --> 01:07:48,696
-Sure.
-Go. Go, go, go, go.

1347
01:07:49,306 --> 01:07:50,864
Guys, hey, wait. Guys, you're not on the list.

1348
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:53,255
Hey, guys, wait! Who cares?

1349
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:11,023
-Holy fucking shit.
-No fucking way.

1350
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:12,987
Those are the guys from the park.

1351
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:14,342
That's just too crazy.

1352
01:08:15,668 --> 01:08:17,738
What do you think's in that thing?

1353
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,500
I don't know, money, drugs.

1354
01:08:19,588 --> 01:08:22,022
They could be a new buyer,
or they could be the supplier.

1355
01:08:22,108 --> 01:08:23,985
If it's good, you'll hear from me.

1356
01:08:24,068 --> 01:08:27,583
If it's not good, you'll hear from me
about telling you how it's not good.

1357
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:28,737
Makes sense.

1358
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,263
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Yeah, no worries, man.

1359
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:32,987
I'll see you guys.

1360
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:35,344
We definitely got to follow
them and find out, though.

1361
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:39,740
-Get down! Get down!
-Get down! Get down!

1362
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:44,458
-What are you doing?
-If they see us,

1363
01:08:44,549 --> 01:08:45,777
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1364
01:08:45,909 --> 01:08:47,388
-What? No!
-Yes. Stop.

1365
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:49,061
You pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1366
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,782
No, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1367
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,189
Why am I automatically blowing you?

1368
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:54,386
'Cause you're in
a fucking Peter Pan costume!

1369
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,539
Okay.

1370
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:02,779
Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1371
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,303
-Go, go, go.
-Okay, fine, we'll follow them.

1372
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,386
But we need to be back in
30 minutes for curtain.

1373
01:09:12,511 --> 01:09:13,785
Dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?

1374
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:14,906
Yeah, you're following too close, dude.

1375
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:16,703
-They're going to make us.
-Well, if I go too far back,

1376
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,622
it's going to look even
more suspicious, so just stop.

1377
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:19,860
God, just let me do my thing.

1378
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,589
I know what I'm doing.

1379
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:26,351
Seriously, if you do that again,
I'm going to Whac-A-Mole you in the balls.

1380
01:09:26,432 --> 01:09:27,467
Just stay back.

1381
01:09:27,552 --> 01:09:30,430
-I could not be more serious.
-Take your foot off the brake.

1382
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,901
-No. I'm not... No.
-Take your foot off the brake!

1383
01:09:40,832 --> 01:09:42,265
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1384
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:43,672
-Look what you did!
-Look what you did!

1385
01:09:43,753 --> 01:09:46,665
What the fuck?
You non-driving motherfuckers!

1386
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:48,550
Get the fuck out of the car!

1387
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:51,193
-Oh, fuck.
-Lock the door! Lock the door!

1388
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:52,428
What do I do? Go away!

1389
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:53,741
What are you, a fucking Keebler Elf?

1390
01:09:54,753 --> 01:09:56,266
Get him out of that car!

1391
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:59,945
-No, no!
-It's fucking ZZ Top!

1392
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,752
-No, no! No, no, no!
-It's fucking ZZ Top!

1393
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:02,823
Like an angry walrus!

1394
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:05,508
-I stomp the car now!
-Oh, my God!

1395
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:08,945
-Stomp! Stomp!
-Oh, shit.

1396
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,304
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, my God! Stop, dude! Go!

1397
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,785
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1398
01:10:19,995 --> 01:10:22,350
-Just let me drive!
-Stop hitting me!

1399
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:32,194
Dude, watch out!

1400
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:35,989
Will you stop front-seat driving?
Get your hands off the wheel!

1401
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:37,868
Man, you just hit two people back there!

1402
01:10:37,956 --> 01:10:39,947
-You stop. I'm not...
-Take your hands off. Shit!

1403
01:10:44,596 --> 01:10:45,870
-We're stuck in traffic!
-Oh, shit.

1404
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:48,271
-Shit, they're coming! They're coming!
-What?

1405
01:10:48,796 --> 01:10:50,115
Oh, my God, dude.

1406
01:10:50,196 --> 01:10:51,265
What do we do?

1407
01:10:51,356 --> 01:10:52,550
What the... What the...

1408
01:10:52,636 --> 01:10:54,433
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1409
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:55,916
Oh, shit.

1410
01:10:55,997 --> 01:10:57,350
-Oh, shit.
-What's wrong with you? Run!

1411
01:10:57,437 --> 01:10:59,314
I can't! I'm wearing tights!

1412
01:10:59,397 --> 01:11:01,786
I got skinny jeans on!
It's the same fucking thing!

1413
01:11:03,837 --> 01:11:05,828
They're going to make us, or kill us.

1414
01:11:07,157 --> 01:11:09,068
-Porsche! Porsche!
-Police! Get out of the car, douche!

1415
01:11:09,157 --> 01:11:10,749
I'm on a call here, jackass.

1416
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:14,114
That's right. Go to sleep, bitch.
You just got head-butted, motherfucker!

1417
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:15,472
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!
-Shit.

1418
01:11:19,438 --> 01:11:21,349
Check around for a gun or something,
all right?

1419
01:11:21,438 --> 01:11:22,757
Where? Where?
There's no glove compartment

1420
01:11:22,838 --> 01:11:25,955
in this shitty-ass car!
There's golf balls and this.

1421
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,909
-What am I supposed to do with this?
-I don't know, man!

1422
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,630
I've never been in a freeway chase before!

1423
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,276
Watch out! It's going to explode!
It's going to go!

1424
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,956
-What happened?
-I don't know.

1425
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,268
-It just didn't explode.
-That's weird.

1426
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,673
Can anybody tell me where my Peter is?

1427
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,790
French! You're not my first choice,
but I need you to go on as Peter.

1428
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,996
Oh, gosh. And I've been in character
for months now.

1429
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,832
Great. Nobody cares.

1430
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,231
Come on! Another traffic jam?

1431
01:12:08,321 --> 01:12:10,312
I'm sorry I didn't check the traffic report

1432
01:12:10,401 --> 01:12:12,232
-before we got in a car chase!
-Let's go! Come on!

1433
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:15,358
-Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-Shit!

1434
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,157
-Are you texting?
-No, I'm not texting!

1435
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:21,391
-Yes, you are! You're texting!
-No, I'm not!

1436
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:22,470
Okay, almost done.

1437
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:25,396
"LOL."

1438
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:28,995
I'm driving!

1439
01:12:29,082 --> 01:12:30,913
Why do you always jump
over the car like that?

1440
01:12:31,002 --> 01:12:32,196
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1441
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:33,681
-Hi.
-God damn, you are beautiful.

1442
01:12:33,762 --> 01:12:35,992
-Oh. Hi.
-You are fine as shit.

1443
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:37,401
Don't worry. Someone will pick you up.

1444
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,313
-Wow.
-Hurry. Just drive.

1445
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:40,921
Wait. Pick me up?

1446
01:12:44,362 --> 01:12:46,001
-They're coming! They're coming!
-I got an idea.

1447
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:48,273
Why don't you text them
and ask them to stop chasing us?

1448
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,482
Oh, shit!

1449
01:12:57,963 --> 01:12:59,032
He's got a gun!

1450
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:00,078
I'm going to throw this thing at him!

1451
01:13:00,163 --> 01:13:01,232
Okay, you don't have to narrate everything!

1452
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,723
-Just throw it!
-Okay! Okay, okay!

1453
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:20,723
-It's going to explode!
-Oh, my God! Roll up the windows!

1454
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:21,954
-What the fuck is that going to do?
-Roll it up!

1455
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:23,160
-I don't fucking care! Just do it!
-Oh, God!

1456
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:32,524
I really thought that one
was going to explode.

1457
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:40,114
Oh, shit!

1458
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:43,919
Look in the glove compartment for a gun.

1459
01:13:44,006 --> 01:13:45,598
What are you talking about?
We're in a pink Bug!

1460
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:48,718
I don't care.
Look in the goddamn glove compartment!

1461
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:50,285
What the hell?

1462
01:13:54,686 --> 01:13:56,517
-Shoot.
-Oh, my God. Okay! Okay!

1463
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,484
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

1464
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:00,683
Can't get a good shot, man!
I can't get a good shot!

1465
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,359
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
-Take the shot!

1466
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:03,755
Take the shot! Just shoot him! Let's go!

1467
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:05,200
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1468
01:14:05,327 --> 01:14:06,646
-Shoot! Shoot!
-Shit, shit...

1469
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:25,203
That's what exploded? Holy shit.
That was crazy.

1470
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:26,721
Why did you shoot for me?

1471
01:14:27,048 --> 01:14:28,447
You weren't shooting, you were choking,

1472
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:30,041
-so I had to save us.
-I was going to shoot.

1473
01:14:30,168 --> 01:14:32,477
-You always do this, every single time.
-What?

1474
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:34,281
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.

1475
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,805
If I miss this play, Molly's going to freak out
and she's not going to go to prom with me.

1476
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:39,880
-Are you fucking serious right now?
-Fuck, yes, I'm serious!

1477
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:46,441
Can't believe you made me late.
You're so selfish.

1478
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,446
-I'm selfish?
-Yes, you're selfish!

1479
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:49,638
Are you fucking kidding me?

1480
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:51,162
Look at yourself!

1481
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,081
You're in too deep, man.

1482
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,959
Yesterday, I found
a college application on your desk!

1483
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,240
I don't know how long this case
is going to last.

1484
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:02,919
And Eric's going to get into Berkeley,
and, honestly, I can get in, too.

1485
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,649
Who knows? I could ride this thing out.
I could be a doctor or something.

1486
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,089
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1487
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,406
You screwed this investigation all up.

1488
01:15:10,011 --> 01:15:12,047
At least I know my Miranda rights, you idiot.

1489
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,600
You are a very silly man indeed.

1490
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:21,807
Boys, squaws, come quickly.

1491
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:25,406
Hey! Sorry! It's okay. I'm here.

1492
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:27,650
I know I missed the first few scenes.

1493
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,087
I want to thank...
Give it up to French Samuels

1494
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:33,522
-for ably backing me up.
-Fuck you, Doug! What?

1495
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,603
I say we just roll right into this thing, huh?

1496
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:40,288
This is my twin. We're together in...

1497
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:41,606
Get the fuck out of here.

1498
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:45,286
What are you doing?
Have you completely lost your mind?

1499
01:15:45,613 --> 01:15:46,841
What is this?

1500
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:49,208
I don't know, but it's already more exciting.

1501
01:15:49,293 --> 01:15:50,772
You're embarrassing me.

1502
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:52,081
It's okay. I'll make it up to you.

1503
01:15:52,733 --> 01:15:55,293
And... Let's fly!

1504
01:15:59,053 --> 01:16:01,123
-Such bullshit!
-Get off of me!

1505
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:05,729
I'm not dumb! I'm smart!

1506
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:07,770
You think I'm stupid? You're stupid!

1507
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,607
-Go, Doug!
-I guess I should do something.

1508
01:16:10,694 --> 01:16:12,412
I should probably not
just stand here watching.

1509
01:16:12,494 --> 01:16:13,847
I should take action.

1510
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:15,333
Worst best friend ever!

1511
01:16:21,094 --> 01:16:22,244
Molly, I'm sorry!

1512
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:24,247
I don't want to talk to you ever again.

1513
01:16:24,335 --> 01:16:25,484
I'm sorry.

1514
01:16:31,455 --> 01:16:32,524
You stupid idiot!

1515
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,928
-Come here!
-Come on!

1516
01:16:46,496 --> 01:16:49,169
Make fun of me behind my back
and everybody laughs at me?

1517
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:52,612
I was a loser for four years!
You couldn't handle it for five minutes!

1518
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,812
Have some fairy dust, motherfucker!

1519
01:16:58,017 --> 01:16:59,132
Hey, guys, no!

1520
01:17:00,577 --> 01:17:03,535
I heard you call me Rain Man, you asshole!

1521
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:05,812
Principal Dadier sucks dick!

1522
01:17:08,697 --> 01:17:10,176
You're supposed to be my friend!

1523
01:17:10,257 --> 01:17:13,932
Stop! Stop it. You're expelled.
Both of you are expelled.

1524
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:19,294
And that's the end of Act Two.

1525
01:17:39,259 --> 01:17:42,251
Is that it? You're not going to scream at us?

1526
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:44,093
Nope.

1527
01:17:45,219 --> 01:17:46,777
I'm gonna just fire you.

1528
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:37,780
Moving out?

1529
01:18:37,862 --> 01:18:39,056
Yep.

1530
01:18:41,662 --> 01:18:43,732
You know what's crazy to me

1531
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:46,618
is that I think that I actually
thought that we were brothers.

1532
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,978
I would've tooken a bullet for you.

1533
01:18:57,823 --> 01:19:00,257
Get in now. Both of you.

1534
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:01,458
Why should I?

1535
01:19:02,463 --> 01:19:03,452
Just get in the car, man.

1536
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,894
Get in the fucking car.

1537
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:07,457
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

1538
01:19:09,304 --> 01:19:10,942
Please get in the car.

1539
01:19:15,704 --> 01:19:18,218
Come on, you guys. Come on. Please. Jesus.

1540
01:19:20,224 --> 01:19:22,419
Some messed up shit went down yesterday.

1541
01:19:22,785 --> 01:19:24,423
Yeah, after we made the exchange,

1542
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:28,020
our potential business partners
got followed by some fucking cops.

1543
01:19:28,105 --> 01:19:29,538
That's insane, man.

1544
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:30,939
Are you serious?

1545
01:19:31,025 --> 01:19:33,141
Okay, it's just I don't want to go to jail!

1546
01:19:33,225 --> 01:19:35,614
You know what happens to
a handsome guy like me in jail?

1547
01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:37,457
It rhymes with "grape"!

1548
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:39,584
It rhymes with "grape."

1549
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:41,820
I can't let that happen.

1550
01:19:41,906 --> 01:19:43,021
So I got these from my dad's gun cabinet.

1551
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:44,784
-Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.
-Whoa. Come on. Whoa.

1552
01:19:44,866 --> 01:19:48,654
Springfield.45s, police issue.
Very powerful guns.

1553
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:50,944
You ever use one?

1554
01:19:51,706 --> 01:19:54,300
-We're not really gun people, man. No.
-No?

1555
01:19:55,826 --> 01:19:57,657
A lot of things
have made me wonder about you.

1556
01:19:57,786 --> 01:19:58,821
Come on.

1557
01:19:59,347 --> 01:20:01,303
Your taste in music.

1558
01:20:01,387 --> 01:20:04,060
The fact that you look
like a fucking 40-year-old man.

1559
01:20:04,707 --> 01:20:07,983
Then after that shit at the play, I realized

1560
01:20:10,707 --> 01:20:13,301
there's no way you guys could be cops.

1561
01:20:15,747 --> 01:20:18,342
Yeah, I got this deal going down.
The supplier's going to be there.

1562
01:20:18,428 --> 01:20:20,623
I need people I can trust.

1563
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:23,861
All right. All right, come on.

1564
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:25,620
Okay, right over here,
we're going to shoot these bottles.

1565
01:20:25,748 --> 01:20:27,101
-We're going to practice, okay?
-Okay.

1566
01:20:37,589 --> 01:20:40,547
That was... That was actually
really fuckin' awesome.

1567
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:41,903
Beginner's luck.

1568
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:43,308
All right.

1569
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:45,027
The supplier wants the deal
to go down at prom.

1570
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:46,622
All right, there's going to be
all these heavies there,

1571
01:20:46,749 --> 01:20:48,228
but as long as you guys have my back...

1572
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:50,140
Yeah? Yeah? Shit.

1573
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:51,981
I always got your back.

1574
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:55,026
Time to get our jobs back.

1575
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,664
Let's get ready for prom.

1576
01:21:13,631 --> 01:21:15,826
Schmidty! Chore time!

1577
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:18,266
Mom, we don't have time
for chores right now!

1578
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:22,185
If you stay in this house,
you have time for chores!

1579
01:21:22,271 --> 01:21:23,545
Mom!

1580
01:21:39,272 --> 01:21:41,103
Fuck this thing.

1581
01:21:46,712 --> 01:21:47,862
Here.

1582
01:21:47,993 --> 01:21:50,029
It'll be quicker if I help.

1583
01:21:52,233 --> 01:21:53,302
There you go.

1584
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,147
Thanks.

1585
01:22:02,193 --> 01:22:04,388
Your shotgun's hanging too low.

1586
01:22:04,473 --> 01:22:06,112
They're gonna see it.

1587
01:22:09,354 --> 01:22:10,503
Thanks.

1588
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:19,633
Jenko...

1589
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:27,151
Will you go to prom with me?

1590
01:22:31,355 --> 01:22:32,674
I guess.

1591
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:38,504
Are we really going to take down
a whole drug operation by ourselves?

1592
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:43,435
I got some contacts that'll help us.

1593
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:27,507
Brad, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

1594
01:23:27,598 --> 01:23:28,667
What if the principal sees you?

1595
01:23:28,798 --> 01:23:30,993
-This is wrong, yet so right.
-What?

1596
01:23:31,118 --> 01:23:33,348
I am so happy you're willing
to get in trouble for me.

1597
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:35,998
You have to go. Please, don't leave me ever.

1598
01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:37,313
Ms. Griggs, stop. Stop.

1599
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:38,798
-Stay! Stay.
-Stop.

1600
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:40,557
-What?
-Stay.

1601
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:41,908
-Go!
-Okay.

1602
01:23:41,999 --> 01:23:43,227
-Stay.
-Stop. Stop.

1603
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:45,037
-I'm lost without you.
-What?

1604
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,118
Get out of me. I'm going to throw up.

1605
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:50,437
You are so hot!

1606
01:23:52,359 --> 01:23:53,428
All right.

1607
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,553
Hey, pumpkin head.

1608
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,995
I'm very mad at you. Dance with me.

1609
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,036
-Are you on that shit?
-So what if I am?

1610
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,072
Look, Molly, some serious stuff
is about to go down,

1611
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,355
and I don't want you to get hurt.

1612
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,875
I've already been hurt, Doug. I don't care.

1613
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:16,914
You need to leave. You need to leave.
You need to get out of here right now.

1614
01:24:17,001 --> 01:24:18,753
Making a lot of hand gestures!

1615
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:21,550
Okay, my name's not Doug.

1616
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:22,915
-It's Schmidt.
-What?

1617
01:24:23,001 --> 01:24:24,593
-And I'm a cop.
-What?

1618
01:24:24,681 --> 01:24:28,390
Okay, and I care about you,
and I don't want you to get busted,

1619
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:30,598
so you have to leave right now.

1620
01:24:30,682 --> 01:24:32,354
Leave the prom right now, Molly.

1621
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,921
-I'm serious.
-Hey. Hey.

1622
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,321
Penthouse now. Supplier's waiting.

1623
01:24:35,402 --> 01:24:36,596
-What are you?
-Come on. Hey, come on.

1624
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,195
-Supplier's waiting.
-Is that Eric?

1625
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:40,318
-Molly, leave right now.
-What are you...

1626
01:24:40,402 --> 01:24:42,791
-Just leave right now!
-What is this?

1627
01:24:57,043 --> 01:24:58,112
Mr. Walters?

1628
01:24:59,003 --> 01:24:59,992
Hey!

1629
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:02,597
Beautiful Brad, and his brother.

1630
01:25:02,683 --> 01:25:04,002
Wow. You look great.

1631
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:05,596
You're the supplier? You're a teacher.

1632
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,276
And I was stuck on a teacher's salary, bro.

1633
01:25:07,404 --> 01:25:09,872
Could barely pay my alimony.
What are you gonna do?

1634
01:25:10,884 --> 01:25:11,873
Oh, yeah.

1635
01:25:12,004 --> 01:25:13,801
You boys are so good at this.

1636
01:25:13,884 --> 01:25:15,476
Oh, yeah, Cinnamon!

1637
01:25:15,564 --> 01:25:18,158
Oh, my God,
we're getting such good evidence.

1638
01:25:18,244 --> 01:25:19,962
I stole some of that Bunsen burner crap

1639
01:25:20,084 --> 01:25:22,359
from the chem lab,
threw in some of my Cool Deets,

1640
01:25:22,444 --> 01:25:24,400
and it was muy delicioso!

1641
01:25:24,484 --> 01:25:26,715
Then one day I catch
Eco Butt-munch over here

1642
01:25:26,805 --> 01:25:28,557
smoking a J.J. behind the field house,

1643
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,522
and I'm like,
"Hey, you want to make some coin?"

1644
01:25:30,605 --> 01:25:32,561
What a green penis that guy is, huh?

1645
01:25:34,445 --> 01:25:35,594
There's my quesadilla.

1646
01:25:37,085 --> 01:25:38,757
I hurt my hands!

1647
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:40,754
Bitch.

1648
01:25:48,086 --> 01:25:49,235
Oh, shit.

1649
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:51,675
You guys look crazy scary.

1650
01:25:51,766 --> 01:25:52,835
How many of you are there?

1651
01:25:53,126 --> 01:25:54,161
A lot.

1652
01:25:54,286 --> 01:25:55,435
Karl.

1653
01:25:55,926 --> 01:25:57,200
Patch looks pimp, man.

1654
01:25:57,766 --> 01:25:59,085
Thank you.

1655
01:25:59,846 --> 01:26:01,360
He's gonna recognize us, man.

1656
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:02,880
I'm freaking out.

1657
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:04,605
This is Walters, he made the stuff.

1658
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:07,203
-Real pleasure to meet you.
-Fuck what his name is.

1659
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,515
Your shit's good.

1660
01:26:08,607 --> 01:26:10,563
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

1661
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:11,875
What, you having a party now?

1662
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:13,798
Who are these two motherfuckers?

1663
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:14,876
Fuck!

1664
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:18,478
-Hey.
-Hey. How's it going?

1665
01:26:19,488 --> 01:26:21,319
Nah, nah, it's cool, man,
they're my boys, so...

1666
01:26:21,808 --> 01:26:22,797
-Are they?
-Yeah.

1667
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,281
I don't like strangers.

1668
01:26:24,608 --> 01:26:27,281
How do you ever expect
to make any new friends with that attitude?

1669
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:30,201
It's, like, everyone's a stranger
till you give them a chance, man.

1670
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:31,721
What the fuck are you talking about?

1671
01:26:31,808 --> 01:26:32,797
I don't even...

1672
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:34,480
Just fuckin' around.

1673
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:36,520
Do your thing, man. Proceed.

1674
01:26:38,529 --> 01:26:39,803
Hey, kid, come here.

1675
01:26:39,929 --> 01:26:41,965
You, you look familiar.

1676
01:26:42,689 --> 01:26:43,963
-Me?
-Yeah.

1677
01:26:44,889 --> 01:26:48,484
I was in a French fry commercial
when I was a kid,

1678
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:50,958
so people are like, you know, often say,
"Oh, I think I know you,"

1679
01:26:51,049 --> 01:26:53,165
but I don't think we've ever met before.

1680
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:55,445
Do I look like I eat French fries?

1681
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,566
I don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,

1682
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:01,962
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day,
like a carb blowout, you know? I don't know.

1683
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,199
Nah.

1684
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,729
Yeah, the theme song was, like...

1685
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:10,002
Come to Andrew's French Fry Emporium

1686
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:13,403
Where friendship and French fries

1687
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:15,925
Go hand in hand

1688
01:27:19,931 --> 01:27:21,364
That's my quesadilla!

1689
01:27:21,451 --> 01:27:22,566
Who wants a piece? Huh?

1690
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:24,482
I know you're in there, Doug,
or whatever your name is!

1691
01:27:24,571 --> 01:27:25,606
You lied to me!

1692
01:27:27,931 --> 01:27:31,207
I'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!

1693
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,045
Hey, you guys, she just called me
a stupid fucking cock. That's rude.

1694
01:27:34,172 --> 01:27:36,527
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

1695
01:27:36,612 --> 01:27:39,524
Did she just say
"nickhead dark motherfucker"?

1696
01:27:39,612 --> 01:27:40,965
That's just racist.

1697
01:27:41,052 --> 01:27:42,485
I know these two.

1698
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:44,244
Your boys are cops! They're cops!

1699
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:45,521
Police! Get on the ground!

1700
01:27:45,652 --> 01:27:47,563
You get on the fuckin' ground!

1701
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:49,608
-We asked you first!
-I don't give a damn!

1702
01:27:49,692 --> 01:27:51,331
You're fucking cops?

1703
01:27:51,453 --> 01:27:53,250
But we partied together, man.

1704
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:55,890
You bought us Taco Bell.

1705
01:27:56,013 --> 01:27:58,322
Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.

1706
01:27:58,413 --> 01:27:59,892
You made me this friendship bracelet.

1707
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:02,811
Well, he's not really your friend.
He was pretending the whole time.

1708
01:28:02,893 --> 01:28:04,884
I'm gonna cut this the fuck off later, all right?

1709
01:28:05,773 --> 01:28:07,890
What the fuck is going on?

1710
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:09,612
Shut this kid up!

1711
01:28:11,214 --> 01:28:12,772
-Him, too.
-No, no! Hey, wait!

1712
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:14,048
No, no, no. Listen, I'm with you guys!

1713
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:15,249
I didn't know these guys were cops!

1714
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:16,562
I'm getting out of here.

1715
01:28:16,654 --> 01:28:18,087
I fucking hate you!

1716
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:19,408
Get that out of my face!

1717
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,405
-Molly!
-Oh, there you are!

1718
01:28:22,494 --> 01:28:23,483
What the fuck!

1719
01:28:23,574 --> 01:28:26,043
Drop your guns, or I'll spray her brains
all over the room!

1720
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:28,490
Trying to take a hostage,
some goddamn TV show shit?

1721
01:28:28,615 --> 01:28:31,652
I don't know! I'm trying to help, all right?
I've never done this shit before.

1722
01:28:31,735 --> 01:28:32,770
Well, you're fucking up.

1723
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:35,528
-Drop the guns or she's dead!
-She looks dead already.

1724
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,123
What? No.

1725
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:38,844
Jesus.

1726
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,373
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

1727
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:43,650
She just passed out from the drugs.
We're good.

1728
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,805
Drop the guns or...

1729
01:28:44,896 --> 01:28:46,488
All right, all right, just chill out.

1730
01:28:46,576 --> 01:28:48,294
We're gonna drop our guns.

1731
01:28:48,376 --> 01:28:51,527
You got to let the kids go,
and no one's gonna die, okay?

1732
01:28:51,616 --> 01:28:53,686
Just drop the guns, and kick them over here.

1733
01:28:55,056 --> 01:28:57,411
D.B., shoot these motherfuckers.

1734
01:28:57,496 --> 01:28:59,885
Oh, come on, that's unfair!
We put our guns down in good faith.

1735
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:01,614
You're a liar, and you're mean!

1736
01:29:02,377 --> 01:29:04,208
-That's unfair.
-We're all friends here.

1737
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:06,687
Let's just relax, and we can
all leave here as friends.

1738
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:09,052
-Yeah, let's do that.
-Y'all boys are stupid.

1739
01:29:09,497 --> 01:29:12,773
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

1740
01:29:13,497 --> 01:29:14,612
God damn it!

1741
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:16,814
Tom Hanson, DEA! On your knees!

1742
01:29:16,897 --> 01:29:17,932
What the fuck?

1743
01:29:18,017 --> 01:29:19,894
-Now!
-Fuck!

1744
01:29:19,977 --> 01:29:22,048
Doug Penhall, DEA! You're under arrest!

1745
01:29:22,138 --> 01:29:24,288
Guns down, all of you! Domingo, tell them!

1746
01:29:24,578 --> 01:29:27,172
Put them down.

1747
01:29:27,298 --> 01:29:28,777
Nice! Yes!

1748
01:29:29,218 --> 01:29:30,856
Shut the fuck up!

1749
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:34,217
You little dweebs just ruined
a five-year investigation.

1750
01:29:34,298 --> 01:29:35,413
We had no idea.

1751
01:29:35,498 --> 01:29:36,851
You're, like, an amazing actor, man.

1752
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,448
You played saxophone
at my sister's wedding, man!

1753
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:41,052
Tough titty. I fucked her, too.

1754
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:42,528
What?

1755
01:29:42,619 --> 01:29:43,938
You little turds.

1756
01:29:44,019 --> 01:29:46,817
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to infiltrate a gang like this?

1757
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:51,578
Do you see this nose?

1758
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:53,218
That is a fake nose.

1759
01:29:53,339 --> 01:29:55,250
Do you want to wear a fake nose
on your fuckin' head

1760
01:29:55,339 --> 01:29:57,171
for, like, months on end? Glue and shit?

1761
01:29:58,340 --> 01:29:59,614
Worse things in the world.

1762
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,930
We had to get fuckin' tattoos
on our dicks, man.

1763
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:03,897
Hey, actually, I just said that

1764
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:05,652
-to mess with you.
-What?

1765
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:07,093
Looks tough.

1766
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:09,859
Look, we know what
it's like being undercover.

1767
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:11,168
Metro Police, Jump Street Division.

1768
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,329
Come on, you guys are Jump Street?

1769
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,455
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

1770
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,497
That's funny, because
we were actually Jump Street.

1771
01:30:15,581 --> 01:30:17,060
-What?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1772
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:18,616
Oh, shit!

1773
01:30:18,701 --> 01:30:20,532
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, shit.

1774
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:21,610
Oh, my God, dude!

1775
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:22,975
Get them!

1776
01:30:23,061 --> 01:30:24,653
Motherfucker!

1777
01:30:26,861 --> 01:30:28,214
Shoot them!

1778
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:30,650
Fuck that.

1779
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:43,051
That was a gun.

1780
01:30:43,182 --> 01:30:44,410
Somebody definitely got shot.

1781
01:30:48,422 --> 01:30:49,411
All right.

1782
01:30:50,462 --> 01:30:52,897
Here, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

1783
01:31:02,543 --> 01:31:03,532
Did I hit anything?

1784
01:31:03,863 --> 01:31:05,262
You were shooting at the fuckin' ceiling.

1785
01:31:06,223 --> 01:31:07,292
Doug.

1786
01:31:08,383 --> 01:31:11,296
I know sometimes I was a jerk to you

1787
01:31:11,904 --> 01:31:13,303
when we were undercover.

1788
01:31:18,664 --> 01:31:21,622
It's just... I didn't feel good about myself.

1789
01:31:22,304 --> 01:31:27,459
All that stuff I wore, like the bracelets,
the rings, the tight pants,

1790
01:31:28,905 --> 01:31:30,224
was just so

1791
01:31:30,305 --> 01:31:32,694
that people would think I'm cool.

1792
01:31:33,465 --> 01:31:34,864
The only approval

1793
01:31:35,945 --> 01:31:37,663
that I ever needed

1794
01:31:39,905 --> 01:31:41,020
was my best friend.

1795
01:31:41,545 --> 01:31:43,297
Thanks, man.

1796
01:32:02,306 --> 01:32:03,899
The money's gone!

1797
01:32:03,987 --> 01:32:05,386
Come on, let's roll.

1798
01:32:05,507 --> 01:32:06,781
We gotta get out of here, man.

1799
01:32:06,867 --> 01:32:08,095
Are you telling me it's on?

1800
01:32:08,587 --> 01:32:10,339
-Let's do this.
-Let's make a baby.

1801
01:32:10,707 --> 01:32:12,140
-What? What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

1802
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:13,820
I was trying to sound cool. Sorry.

1803
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:07,749
That was crazy! You killed a guy!

1804
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:10,542
Oh, fuckin' shit!

1805
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:14,341
Hey, hey, we'll lose them in the prom! Go!

1806
01:33:35,752 --> 01:33:36,901
Go, go, go, go!

1807
01:33:39,032 --> 01:33:40,226
Where'd they go?

1808
01:33:42,752 --> 01:33:43,741
Molly!

1809
01:33:48,792 --> 01:33:49,861
Shit!

1810
01:33:53,873 --> 01:33:55,352
-You want to drive?
-Yeah, I do, actually.

1811
01:33:55,433 --> 01:33:56,582
Okay, cool.

1812
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,783
-Nice!
-Did it look cool when I did it?

1813
01:33:59,873 --> 01:34:01,784
-That's what I'm talking about!
-Yeah!

1814
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:05,911
How you guys doing back there, huh?

1815
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:07,472
God, I love high school!

1816
01:34:07,633 --> 01:34:08,782
Best prom night ever!

1817
01:34:14,514 --> 01:34:16,106
-Shoot them!
-Stay on them!

1818
01:34:16,394 --> 01:34:17,952
I'm on them! I'm on them!

1819
01:34:18,034 --> 01:34:20,594
Oh, good, you guys,
come hang out with me back here.

1820
01:34:20,674 --> 01:34:23,108
-Oh, fuck, dude. Lisa, what are you doing?
-Did she pass out back there?

1821
01:34:27,234 --> 01:34:29,510
Hey, you got a gun.
Why don't you shoot back there?

1822
01:34:29,635 --> 01:34:31,114
Shoot that gun, shoot that gun!

1823
01:34:31,195 --> 01:34:32,514
All right, one second!

1824
01:34:32,635 --> 01:34:33,909
Just shoot someone, you bitch!

1825
01:34:36,395 --> 01:34:37,623
Peek-a-boo!

1826
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:38,984
Give me my money!

1827
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,025
Fuck that! Fuck that! No! No!

1828
01:34:42,115 --> 01:34:44,754
I can't do this!
I'm supposed to go to Berkeley!

1829
01:34:46,236 --> 01:34:47,305
I'm gonna get the party started!

1830
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:48,915
-I'm gonna get the party started!
-No! No! Lisa, no!

1831
01:34:48,996 --> 01:34:52,113
Hey, I'm living my dream
of standing in a limo!

1832
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:53,345
What?

1833
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,508
-You're killing my dream!
-Come in.

1834
01:34:57,676 --> 01:34:58,711
-What? I'm trying to party.
-Down!

1835
01:34:58,956 --> 01:34:59,991
Bitch!

1836
01:35:01,516 --> 01:35:03,427
What? Fuck!

1837
01:35:03,516 --> 01:35:04,836
I'll kill you!

1838
01:35:05,077 --> 01:35:06,066
Kill you!

1839
01:35:07,157 --> 01:35:08,909
-No! No!
-Stay where you are.

1840
01:35:09,157 --> 01:35:10,192
Go! Go, go!

1841
01:35:13,637 --> 01:35:14,990
No! Stop!

1842
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:17,272
I'm not fucking kidding!
Look, I'm trying to shoot people!

1843
01:35:17,357 --> 01:35:18,676
Will you stop! Just for two seconds!

1844
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:20,594
You're really hot and you're really slutty
and it's awesome,

1845
01:35:20,717 --> 01:35:21,991
but I got to shoot people right now!

1846
01:35:22,077 --> 01:35:23,477
You think I'm hot?

1847
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:39,789
I wanna... Oh, my God!

1848
01:35:40,799 --> 01:35:42,517
Wait, guys! Call me!

1849
01:35:42,599 --> 01:35:44,317
Let me know where you're ending up later.

1850
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:50,152
I'm almost out of ammo.

1851
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,354
We're fucked.

1852
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:53,388
Give me my money!

1853
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:55,068
I got an idea.

1854
01:35:55,159 --> 01:35:56,877
-You still got those shotgun shells?
-Yeah.

1855
01:35:57,639 --> 01:35:58,675
Pop Quiznos.

1856
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:03,716
What do you get when lithium batteries
react to potassium nitrate?

1857
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,309
That would be a covalent bond, brother.

1858
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,914
That's when two atoms, they share electrons.

1859
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,991
You see, they both need
what the other one has.

1860
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,559
That makes them stick together.

1861
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:13,868
Are you saying we're covalent bonds?

1862
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,033
What? No.

1863
01:36:16,801 --> 01:36:18,154
We're not atoms, dude.

1864
01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:37,960
-What's this?
-T equila?

1865
01:36:38,602 --> 01:36:40,194
I don't know, it was supposed to explode.

1866
01:36:41,242 --> 01:36:43,392
Oh, shit!

1867
01:36:48,282 --> 01:36:49,795
Where'd you learn how to do that, man?

1868
01:36:49,882 --> 01:36:51,110
App chemistry, bitch.

1869
01:36:57,283 --> 01:36:58,477
Come on, blondie.

1870
01:37:00,363 --> 01:37:01,398
Molly!

1871
01:37:04,163 --> 01:37:05,596
Drop your weapon!

1872
01:37:05,963 --> 01:37:07,316
Don't you fuckin' pull that arm up.

1873
01:37:07,603 --> 01:37:08,672
Don't.

1874
01:37:09,043 --> 01:37:12,400
Looks like you're out of ammo, asshole!

1875
01:37:12,644 --> 01:37:13,713
Come on! Get out here!

1876
01:37:13,804 --> 01:37:15,522
-What? What's going on?
-All right.

1877
01:37:15,604 --> 01:37:18,801
All right, here's the deal.
Nobody moves, or she's gonna get hurt.

1878
01:37:18,924 --> 01:37:21,233
Do you understand? Nobody move!

1879
01:37:21,324 --> 01:37:23,121
-All right.
-Eric, help me.

1880
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:25,243
Don't you have a gun?

1881
01:37:26,284 --> 01:37:27,558
All right, don't move!

1882
01:37:28,484 --> 01:37:30,680
-Come on, let's go. Let's go.
-No!

1883
01:37:30,805 --> 01:37:33,000
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-Hey, no, no, I said don't move!

1884
01:37:36,965 --> 01:37:39,433
-Oh, fuck, you shot him!
-Oh, God!

1885
01:37:39,525 --> 01:37:40,640
Are you okay?

1886
01:37:40,725 --> 01:37:42,363
You shot my partner, you motherfucker!

1887
01:37:42,525 --> 01:37:44,516
I didn't mean to shoot you!
I meant to shoot him!

1888
01:37:44,645 --> 01:37:47,558
Are you alive, buddy? You okay?
You took a bullet for me, man.

1889
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:50,035
Yeah, I'm feeling a little ambivalent
about that right now.

1890
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:53,238
Didn't you hear me? I said don't move!
I said that! You heard, right?

1891
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:54,441
Eric, you heard me!

1892
01:37:54,526 --> 01:37:55,845
-I said don't move!
-Eric, help me!

1893
01:37:55,926 --> 01:37:57,405
-You got this.
-Hey, hold still.

1894
01:38:04,526 --> 01:38:05,676
Freeze!

1895
01:38:05,847 --> 01:38:07,041
Shoot!

1896
01:38:10,047 --> 01:38:11,116
Come on.

1897
01:38:12,527 --> 01:38:14,757
You peaked in high school, motherfucker.

1898
01:38:17,127 --> 01:38:18,242
Oh, shit.

1899
01:38:18,527 --> 01:38:19,562
I shot him in the dick.

1900
01:38:19,647 --> 01:38:22,036
You shot me in the dick!

1901
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:23,316
Oh, my God!

1902
01:38:23,528 --> 01:38:24,517
Yes!

1903
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:26,480
Yes! Yes!

1904
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,723
Yes!

1905
01:38:27,888 --> 01:38:29,719
You are under arrest!

1906
01:38:29,848 --> 01:38:33,318
-It definitely came out my asshole!
-You have the right to remain silent!

1907
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:36,480
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1908
01:38:36,568 --> 01:38:37,637
in a court of law!

1909
01:38:37,728 --> 01:38:39,241
You have the right to an attorney!

1910
01:38:39,328 --> 01:38:42,765
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you!

1911
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:45,922
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

1912
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:47,806
Fuck you! Bitch!

1913
01:38:47,929 --> 01:38:49,567
Yes! Yes!

1914
01:38:49,889 --> 01:38:51,481
We did it, man!

1915
01:38:51,569 --> 01:38:52,684
We did it.

1916
01:38:52,769 --> 01:38:53,918
God, I feel so good.

1917
01:38:54,009 --> 01:38:55,408
We did it, man!

1918
01:38:56,249 --> 01:38:57,921
You're a goddamn rock star.

1919
01:38:59,409 --> 01:39:00,729
Do you feel that?

1920
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:01,799
God damn, you're so cool.

1921
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,684
You just shot him in the dick.

1922
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:06,326
I've never seen that. Who does that?

1923
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:08,762
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.

1924
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:11,324
I know I didn't say you were,
but you're smart.

1925
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:14,010
You're a smart guy, and you're thoughtful,

1926
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:18,329
and you're sincere and you're sweet
and you're loyal...

1927
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:21,163
And I fuckin' cherish you.

1928
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:25,120
Should we high-five?

1929
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:32,729
My hand!

1930
01:39:34,011 --> 01:39:35,729
Are you all right?
Should we get you to the hospital, man?

1931
01:39:35,812 --> 01:39:37,643
-Yeah, I think we need to call somebody.
-Hey, call somebody!

1932
01:39:37,812 --> 01:39:39,723
I got to get my dick sewn back on.

1933
01:39:39,812 --> 01:39:41,325
-You shut the fuck up.
-Hey, you shut up.

1934
01:39:41,572 --> 01:39:43,130
-That's not funny.
-Is that it?

1935
01:39:43,412 --> 01:39:44,527
What?

1936
01:39:46,012 --> 01:39:47,445
That's my dick!

1937
01:39:48,132 --> 01:39:49,167
Pick up my dick! Please!

1938
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:50,566
No, we're not picking up your dick.

1939
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:52,051
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

1940
01:39:55,373 --> 01:39:56,362
Oh, fuck!

1941
01:40:01,853 --> 01:40:03,047
He's my friend.

1942
01:40:03,853 --> 01:40:06,003
They don't serve vegan in jail, bitch.

1943
01:40:13,694 --> 01:40:14,888
Hey.

1944
01:40:16,454 --> 01:40:17,853
Molly...

1945
01:40:19,254 --> 01:40:20,243
I'm really sorry.

1946
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:25,163
I know you wanted a guy to trust,
and I wanted to be that person so badly.

1947
01:40:26,214 --> 01:40:28,364
And I let you down in a lot of ways.

1948
01:40:29,014 --> 01:40:30,164
And...

1949
01:40:32,575 --> 01:40:34,247
It's good that you're mad at me.

1950
01:40:34,855 --> 01:40:37,574
I think it's good.
I think you should be mad at more guys,

1951
01:40:37,655 --> 01:40:42,683
because you deserve a guy who's good
and who doesn't lie to you.

1952
01:40:43,055 --> 01:40:45,523
And you should never settle
for less than that.

1953
01:40:45,855 --> 01:40:47,811
There are good guys out there

1954
01:40:49,696 --> 01:40:51,368
who aren't assholes like me.

1955
01:40:54,056 --> 01:40:55,967
Thanks for saving my life,

1956
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:57,808
asshole.

1957
01:41:00,376 --> 01:41:02,367
Put her there, partner.

1958
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:17,375
I'll come back later.

1959
01:41:22,097 --> 01:41:25,295
We're, like, in the end of Die Hard right now,
but it's our actual life.

1960
01:41:25,618 --> 01:41:26,653
It's crazy.

1961
01:41:26,738 --> 01:41:29,093
-Number one or two?
-Three.

1962
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:31,735
-Sam Jackson one. Yeah!
-Sam Jackson style.

1963
01:41:33,378 --> 01:41:36,529
Boom, motherfuckers!
What's going on? Come on!

1964
01:41:41,378 --> 01:41:42,937
Where is he? There's my guy!

1965
01:41:43,059 --> 01:41:45,368
There he is! That's him. That's him.

1966
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:46,768
-Enough.
-Too long on the hug.

1967
01:41:47,259 --> 01:41:51,047
Congratulations, you crazy,
sick, vigilante motherfuckers.

1968
01:41:51,139 --> 01:41:52,891
You got your first arrest, huh?

1969
01:41:53,899 --> 01:41:55,855
-Look. Got something made for you.
-You didn't!

1970
01:41:55,939 --> 01:41:58,134
-Come on. All right, all right.
-Enough. Enough.

1971
01:41:58,339 --> 01:41:59,613
New assignment.

1972
01:42:00,059 --> 01:42:02,733
Since you two cowboys love to drink booze,

1973
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:07,053
smoke weed with kids, and fuck
anything with a big ass in jeans

1974
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:08,459
with low self-esteem,

1975
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:12,499
I'm gonna send you to a place
where all that shit is allowed.

1976
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:13,808
Oh, I love Disneyland!

1977
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:17,212
You two sons of bitches
are going to college!

1978
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,939
-Yes!
-No!

1979
01:43:00,183 --> 01:43:01,172
Boo-yah!

1980
01:43:38,025 --> 01:43:40,061
Oh, my God!
You're like two Hardy Boys in one!

1981
01:43:54,906 --> 01:43:55,895
Oh, fuck!

1982
01:45:45,552 --> 01:45:46,826
Hey, why are you here, Scott?

1983
01:45:46,912 --> 01:45:49,346
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?
