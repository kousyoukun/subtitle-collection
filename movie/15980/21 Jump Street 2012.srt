00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:29,812
Look, I know, uh..

8
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,225
We know each other

00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:46,694
- I'm sure, uh, there's, uh, you know, uh, the prom's like in 4 days..
- Oh my God.

13
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:49,560
You're not asking me
to prom, are you?

14
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,085
Oh, God, no, I, I..

15
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,003
No, I just, I mean..

16
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,807
You, you probably go with someone.

17
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,972
I'm sorry, but I don't know
how to put this nicely.

18
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:05,921
There's no need to nice to him, quit it.
He's a fucking nerd.

19
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:09,268
And you know, she's, I don't know,
She's hot..

20
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,793
Look at her, look at her!

21
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,393
- Look at her, look at her!
- I'll see you, I'll see you later.

22
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:15,274
Bye..

23
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,197
All right, buddy.
Good job!

27
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:26,066
I say it loud and clear.

00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:29,488
If you didn't get your grades up,
you won't going to the prom..

29
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,091
You my friend, are about
to pay the paper!

30
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:36,083
- I should pay who?
- You're not going to the prom..

31
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,781
But you're lucky,
you even graduate..

32
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,628
But, I'm gonna be the Prom King

33
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,939
I'm glad you had a great time
in school..

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,542
But you ain't learn nothing!

00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:06,781

Come on, come on, let's go!
Come on! Pacing it up, pacing it up!

50
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:11,588
Chill, all right?
Look..

51
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:17,629

Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,470
Faster, let's go!

54
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,546
Clear!

55
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:28,988
Clear!

56
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,862
Come on, come on, come on!
Yes!

57
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,475


58
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,829
Let me see.

59
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:41,624
Nice!

60
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,717
Stand up!

61
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:48,237
Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you
the graduates of Class 137.

62
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,725
You ready for life-time pretty
bad-ass motherfuckers?

63
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,769
Oh, I am.

64
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:04,562
<i>I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions..</i>

65
00:05:04,706 --> 00:05:07,214
<i>Unless homeless people
doing it everywhere.. </i>

66
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,314
Do you guys think this is police matter?
To get your frisbee back?

67
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:15,131
- Get your own fuckin' frisbee!
- Shit!

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,542
Shit!  Shit!

69
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:19,888
SCHMIDT:
Yours is unloaded, right?

70
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,890
SCHMIDT:
We supposed to unload it
pretty fast, right?

71
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,769
JENKO:
you, duh!
that's not fun, come on..

72
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,634
The sign says:
"Do not feed the ducks!"

73
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:28,989
It's right there..

74
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,060
- Don't you.. don't! / don't!
- stop it!  / don't! / You did it..

75
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:34,031
Fed the ducks..

76
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:35,041
You like to pick shots?

77
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,011
No fuckin' way!

78
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,564
<i>One-percenters?    </i>

79
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,136
These guys are big town drug dealers..

80
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:45,127
We can take them down on first pass,
we'd be out-parked here for sure..

81
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,772
Do you see what I see?

82
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,936
<i>Cannabis, Sativa</i>

83

Chak, chaka Khan?

85
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,423
Gentlemen, do we have a little party?

86
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:15,433
Are we forgotten that abusive of
marijuana is illegal?

87
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,576
I have, uhm, glaucoma..

88
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,870
I get nervous in crowds..

89
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:21,205
Herpes..

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,105
- Then you don't mind if I search your bike now, would you?
- Wait, you won't find shit!

91
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:29,042
Get up!

92
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:32,438
And then you guys, even real cops,
you look like..

93
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,943
the kids on Halloween.

94
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:38,523
If them both are cops, I'm DEA
(<i>Drug Enforcement Administration) </i>

95
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,376
I know, right?
I know!

96
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:42,345
It's hilarious..

97
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,064
Mind show some of respects!

98
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:47,052
- Fuck you, pig!
- Hey, you want me to beat your dick off?

99
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,058
You want to beat my dick off?

100
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,010
I can beat your dick off with both hands,
what's up? Let's go!

101
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,008
That's weird, man..

102
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,716
I think what he trying to say was, he's gonna punch you so many time
around the genital area, that your dick's just gonna fall off..

103
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,282
- Why you have salts in you..
- that's stash of drugs

104
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:01,863
Oh my God, get on the ground!

105

Hey, you! Come here!
What do I do?

106
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,243
- Chase the one!
- Chase the one?

107
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:08,030
Are you leaving your bike here?

108
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,619
All right..

109
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:14,945
Don't run from me,
you make it worse for yourself!

110
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,405
Stop!

111
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,996
I will shoot you, if you don't slow down, man..
Come on!

112
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,613
Hey, come here!

113
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,894
I'm not playing anymore!

114
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,128
All right, then

115
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,880
I got him, I got him..

119
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,543
Freeze!

120
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,141
Stop it!

121
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,879
You're a pussy!

122
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,932
You have the right to..

123
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,557
Give me your hand!  /  All right..

124
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,384
You have the right to..
to suck my dick, motherfucker!

125
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:00,630
Oh, my elbow..

126
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:04,523
You like me sit on your ass, huh?
Hell, a liar!

127
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:08,659
Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!
We got one, I got him!

128
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,185
yesss!!

129
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:13,718
We got him, all right.

130
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:17,980
Fuck you!

131
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,303
yeah!!

132
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:22,023
Suck my nuts out your
motherfucker faulty mouth.

133
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:26,910
Suck my nuts out your
motherfucker faulty mouth.

134
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,366
Fuck you!

135
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:32,919
We arrest people, now!
What's up, what's up!

136
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:42,616
- Congratulations on the bust boys, sounds great!
- Thank you, Cinnamon..

137
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:43,811
That was new?

138
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:45,725
The Department was forced
to drop the charges..

139
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,115
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda Rights..

140
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:52,161
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing..

141
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:54,322
you have to do when arresting someone..

142
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:58,272
I did read him his rights, I..
a bit a version of that..

143
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:01,216
- Do you even know the Miranda Rights?
- Yes

144
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,043
Let's see on that..

145
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,355
With all we doing, you know,
you got a lot stuff to do..

146
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:08,357
Oh, go ahead, you got any worse than that?
We have time.

147
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,684
I had thing written, probably
push it back?

148
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,026
Go ahead, it's 4 declamatory sentences,
followed by a question..

149
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:16,614
- For a total of 57 words
- Okay..

150
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:20,051
Uh, it's, wrap it up, these start with
the right to remain silence..

151
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,389
And like I've known before..

152
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,162
and then, uhm, it, it..
I think it sounds something like.. uh..

153
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,474
<i>your right to ATTAIN an attorney..</i>

154
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:31,926
oh ya, all right, you have the right
to REMAIN an attorney..

155
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:33,656
Did you say..

156
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,001
- ..that you have the right to be an attorney?
- You do have the right to be an attorney..

157
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:38,510
..if you want to.

158
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:41,698
- Where were you?
- I was, uh..

159
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,342
I was chasing my burg, Sir..

160
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:46,419
And how that go for you?

161
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,337
Honestly, he did get away..
and he threw me down, pretty hard..

162
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,173
Actually, fucked up my elbow pretty bad..

163
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,889
Can I see that?

164
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,019
Yeah, it's actually hurt, 'cause
dirt gets smashed in..

165
00:09:58,342 --> 00:09:59,953
Fortunately for you two..

166
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:03,940
We're reviving a canceled undercover
police program from the eighties..

167
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:09,971
Revamping it from modern science. You see, the guys in charge
of the stuff, lack creativity and are completely out of ideas.

168
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:13,542
So all they do now, is recycle shit
from the past,

169
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,773
and expect us all not to notice..

170
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,362
One of these programs..

171
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:21,262
involves the use of young,
immature-seeming officers.

172
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:27,880
So, you're saying, that you're gonna send us
into like a, child-sex-slavery thing or something?

173
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,726
Sir, if I had to suck somebody's dick,

174
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:31,806
I will..

175
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,121
it's just, I prefer not to..

176
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:38,905
I think you're idiots are perfect.
You're officially transferred..

177
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:42,331
- All right..
- That's great, well, where we should report to?

178
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:46,110
Down on Jump Street, 37 Jump Street.

179
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,316
No, it didn't sound right.

180
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,778
This is gotta be a joke.

181
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,964
Yes, it is.

182
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:05,074
Aroma of Christ Church ?

183
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:23,606
How's it goin'?

184
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:29,006
This place is weird..

185
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,170
Everybody comfortable?

186
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,730
ya

187
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:47,783
Get your  motherfuckin' ass up,
when I'm talking!!

188
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,249
You will be goin' on  undercover
as high school students.

189
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,333
You are here simply because,
you look young..

190
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:59,953
Used in Justin Bieber dan Miley Cyrus
lookin' motherfuckers..

191
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:04,358
- <i>Captain Sassy..</i>
- I know what you're thinking, ain't you agree?

192
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:08,145
Black Captain, it ain't none but
stupid stereotype..

193
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,503
Oh guess what, motherfuckers?

194
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:11,880
I'm black..

195
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:15,304
And I worked my ass off to be the Captain.

196
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,239
And sometimes I get angry..

197
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,967
So, suck a dick!

198
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:25,490
What I'm trying to show you is,
embrace your stereotypes

199
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:31,662
Like this guy right here, handsome,
and he's probably a dummy..

200
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:37,478
And then this guy, he's short and insecure,
and he's probably good with money..

201
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,578
- Are you that good with money?
- What the fuck..

202
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,499
Didn't somebody tell you guys,
this is undercover unit?

203
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,849
I don't, I actually didn't,
I didn't get a letter or anything.

204
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,489
- ya, like a dress code, or anything like that.
- Teenage, the fuck up!

205
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,793
Rule number 1 at Jump Street

206
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:56,466
- Ferguzy?
- Do not get expelled.

207
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:59,403
Nobody in the system knows that you're here,
all right? Nobody!

208
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:04,284
You get kicked out of school, your monkey ass
get kicked out of Jump Street..

209
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,435
Rule number 2, Barnes!

210
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:10,355
Do not have sexual relation with
students or teachers, Sir..

211
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,090
Do you hear that?

212
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,680
Yes, you!  Don't do it, man..

213
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:17,337
- Pardon?
- Keep that dirty dick in your pants!

214
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,077
No fuck no students,
no fuck no teachers..

215
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,746
Sir, I know we come off as
a couple lady killers..

216
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:27,695
But I promise you, we'll be
super professional on the job.

217
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,242
Clearly, I wasn't talkin' to you, big titties!

218
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:34,490
You cherub-lookin' motherfucker!
I was talkin' to your partner over here..

219
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:41,041
Fake-ass handsome with gig.  When I'm talkin' to him, I'm talkin'
to him, when I say "shut the fuck up!", I'm talkin' to you!

220
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:46,339
And you two sons of bitches, in my office, now!
right now!

221
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,565
Hi, I'm Billiam Willingham

222
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,349
So I bought this..

223
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:54,888
Which is all anybody seems to be
talking about right now. Cheers!

224
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,913
It's new synthetic drug,
called by the street named: HFS  (Holy Fucking Shit)

225
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:04,334
Holy fucking shit...

226
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,781
he put this in internet?
Everybody can see?

227
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:10,514
They're teenagers, man. They're really stupid.
So, you should blend right in..

228
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,585
PHASE 01:
THE GIGGS

229
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,339
PHASE 02:
TRIPPING MAJOR BALLSACK

230
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:25,349
PHASE 03:
OVER-FALSITY
OF CONVIDENCE

231
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,382
Jessica, would you go to prom with me?
But I already know the answer, it's YES

232
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:34,307
PHASE 04:
FUCK YEAH MOTHERFUCKER

233
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,949
- I can watch this all day..
- And this kid ruled!

234
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,255
Ruled?
His parents found him OD'ed in his room
a few days ago, he's dead..

235
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,889
Whatever he took, the Lab is never
seen it before..

236
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:01,725
Now you can see, this kid is white.
That means people actually give a shit.

237
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:05,958
Sir, I just want after you,
that I would give a shit if he was black

238
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:12,258
Right now, HFS is contained
right there in Sagan High

239
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,549
Now once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days..

240
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,816
Jenko

241
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,051
I looked at your old transcript..

242
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,455
I enrolled you at a bunch of
bullshit courses

243
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,801
like photography and drama..

244
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:29,719
Get in with burn-outs and cool kids,
find out who's smiting this shit.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,483
- Schmidt, since you're a virgin through high school
- It says that?

246
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:40,082
No. I just assumed it. Due to your many years
on honor role, and your membership to the juggling squad.

247
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,533
Juggling is a society, but..
It's fine, it's fine.

248
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:47,531
They steal the equipment from the chemistry Lab.
That's what we think they cookin' a dope with..

249
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,125
I enrolled you in honors chemistry.

250
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:51,805
Here's your new identities.

251
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:54,909
All right,
Brad dan Dough McQuaid.

252
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,473
The mission is this:

253
00:15:56,474 --> 00:16:00,281
- Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier..
- We get to be brothers?

254
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:04,029
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier!

255
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,898
What if we find the supplier first,
We not have to worry about the dealers.

256
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,799
Goddamn, Infiltrate the dealers,
find the supplier!

257
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:26,988
Hey, Korean Jesus..

258
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:35,534
I don't know if You only cater to Koreans,
Christians, or.. if You even exist, no offense..

259
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,003
I just..

260
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,247
Really freak out..

261
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:45,415
I'm going back to High School

262
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:51,437
It was just so fuckin' hard
the first time

263
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:56,364
I know we don't made our first arrest,
maybe I'm not the best cop

264
00:16:57,432 --> 00:17:00,493
Korean Jesus, just make sure
You don't fuck this up

265
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:02,743
Sorry for swearing so much..

266
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:09,639
THE END?
I don't really know how to end the prayer. "The End"?

267
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:18,272
Hey! Hey!
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

268
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:21,768
He ain't got time for your problems,
He's busy with Korean shit!

269
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,918
- You two get to your mama house, ASAP!
- What?

270
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,914
You're teenagers now!

271
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:31,998
All right? You two are staying at Schmidt's parents house,
but to addition to this, as assignment..

272
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:32,852
Oh, fuck me..

273
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,621
This house is adorable..

274
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,380
Hi, baby..

275
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:41,398
- I know you'll come to me. You'll always my baby..
- This my guy, (mmmuach..)

276
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:42,860
Nice to see you guys..

277
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,291
Schmidt family.. yeeeeaa!
I caught by the spirit..

278
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,513
Oh my God, Mom Schmidt, did you do all
these by yourself? This is unbelievable..

279
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,542
Yeah, yeah, I did.

280
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,222
- It's gorgeous
- Oh, so are you..

281
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,133
Oh, honey, listen, I wanna tell you.

282
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,896
We did blob the air mattress in your room,
we kinda use it as vicarious.

283
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,633
So I hope you don't mind it
if we make the call.

284
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:03,122
Jenko, Jenko! oh my God..

285
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,242
Please, no no, don’t touch that,
we just brought it here from Sedona..

286
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,542
Guys, can we, can we
get rid of these stuff?

287
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:10,769
I mean, it looks I die in the car crash,
and you guys having it moved on..

288
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,839
- Rid of it?
- We take it down, we have to stop braggin' about you.

289
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,209
I look like Fred Savage from
Wonder Years..

290
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,706
But completely naked wearing
Indian friendship bracelets..

291
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,634
That was a great picture morphed.

292
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,364
You look like young Jay Leno

293
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,592
Am I wearing any underwear
in this picture?

294
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,805
No!

295
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:31,005
I remember, you know why? Because
I've told you at therapist about 8000 times

296
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:35,716
I mean, this is the fourth grade
participation medal for soccer

297
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,739
- It's literally a medal for soccer
- No..

298
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,373
It's the medal for trying

299
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:43,027
Let me tell you something, this guy,
is always a great trier..

300
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:43,269


301
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,310
Oh, that must be Phyllis,
she is this dying to see you

302
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:49,137
What? Mom you told Phyllis I was here,
she will tell the whole neighborhood.

303
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,324
I told you, it's undercover assignment,
super secret!

304
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:55,215
Undercover? That's so cute..

305
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,050
uhh, I'm going upstairs

306
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,458
Okay, Honey, I want you know
we are so glad that you're  here / Okay

307
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,261
That's great, thank you.

308
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,812
- All right, where is he?
- He's upstairs

309
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,930
He just need take a little rest,
and then he's tying at your finger tip.

310
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,563
- Bye-bye..
- I bake muffin

311
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,247
If you don't know your identity,
well, screw to her!

312
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,539
We got to study this stuff.

313
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,141
- Forget those identities, it's a bullshit,
  it said I was back a year..
- You were, you were back two years

314
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,728
Just because that fake back stories,
doesn't mean that doesn't hurt my feeling.

315
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:22,397
Fuck! Shocks don't match..

316
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,138
I'm gonna start all over

317
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:26,388
First day at school, dude,
I got to look awesome.

318
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:31,864
You know, back at the day, you were
super popular, and I wasn't, as much..

319
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,673
We didn't really get along in High School.

320
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,368
You know that's not gonna
happened again, do you?

321
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,438
No

322
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:42,933
Come on, man. We're adults now, we're best buds.
It's definitely not gonna happened again.

323
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,562
- We're good?
- Cool

324
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,498
Beautiful day out there, boys.

325
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,607
What's around?

326
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,969
Anything you say can or will be used
against you in Court of Law..

327
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,423
You have the right to attain attorney

328
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,986
If you can't afford,
one will be appoint..

329
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:06,557
You still don't know the Miranda rights?
You're a cop!

330
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:10,234
Come on, man. They always cut it away on TV
before they finish them..

331
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:15,909
- All right, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! / What?

332
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,220
What are you doing?

333
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:19,511
- What? What are you talking about?
- Are you two-strapped?

334
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:22,764
- My backpack? Yeah..
- I gotta be seeing with you

335
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,226
You gotta one-strapped

336
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:28,443
- Seriously, I would no-strapped if found it would be possible..
- Okay, what makes you the expert?

337
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,893
I was cool in High School,
you aware?

338
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,454
Okay, that makes sense, continue

339
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,011
The three keys of coolness
in High School..

340
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,014
by Jenko

341
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,688
One, don't try hard at anything

342
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:44,871
Two, make fun of people
who do try

343
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,680
Three, be handsome.

344
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:51,111
Four, if anyone steps you on the first day of school,
you punch them directly in the face.

345
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:54,052
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

346
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,424
Shit.

347
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,315


348
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:04,302
All right, let's just don't drive like teenagers
rubbin' up the engine and shit, okay?

349
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:06,287
We would never!

350
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:09,151
Come on, how's to keep
give us a little credit?

351
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:13,259
- Are you ready?
- Go!

352
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:22,592
- That's awesome!
- It's amazing!

353
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:24,011
It's amazing!

354
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:28,468
- All right, you're fine, you're fine..
- Okay, you ready? here we go! / Yeah, yeah!

355
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:35,721
You okay?

356
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,615
I think I shit my pants.

357
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:49,245
- Hey, parking at handicap’s park, that may add some cool.
- That's awesome!

358
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:07,949
- Dude? Everybody's two-strapped.
- Just stick to one-strapped.

359
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,043
- I can't, I can't, I can't right now.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

360
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:12,865
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.
What are you doing?

361
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,846
You suppose to two-strapped

362
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:15,943
- One-strapped is peer pressure.
- No, you're not

363
00:22:15,944 --> 00:22:19,234
And those are goths.

364
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,981
Those are nerds.

365
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:25,540
I don't know what they are.

366
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:27,863
What the fuck of those says?

367
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:30,343
I'm so confused right now.

368
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,653
Cool.

369
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:43,674
- Hi!
- Hey..

370
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:47,482
Oh hi yo!

371
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,115
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

372
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:54,183
- Would that thing get 10 mile for the gallon?
- No, I thought like 7

373
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,434
- What about you?
- Bio-diesel, though

374
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:58,592
- Smells like egg rolls.
- Yeah, it does.

375
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:01,168
From leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

376
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:04,102
we ride bike as we can,
Global crisis are going on.

377
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:08,956
- Whatever, man, I don't care about anything.
- Are you don't care about the environment?

378
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:13,691
- It's kinda fucked up, man..
- Hey, would ya shut the hell up? Trying to study.

379
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:17,218
Look at him?
He's trying..

380
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,346
This guy is trying, what a nerd!
Look at the nerd, look at the nerd.

381
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,378
Who you're calling nerd, man?

382
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,310
I'm sorry, what?

383
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:28,133
- Shit!
- Are you okay, man?

384
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:31,162
- Hey, what the hell, are you serious?
- This is not gay as musical.

385
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:33,621
- You punch me because I'm gay?
- No! I..

386
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,910
- Oh, come on..
- That's not cool, you know?

387
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,334
That is really insensitive.

388
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,052
I didn't punch him because he's gay..

389
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:43,452
I punched him, and he's happened
to turn out to be gay afterward.

390
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:44,763
How dare you punch me!

391
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:49,560
In a weird way, it might have been homophobic
not to punch you, just because you're a gay  / Right.

392
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,421
You punch a little gay black kid in the face?
That was a second period.

393
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:53,963
How do you explain that?

394
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:58,009
- Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that, I just..
- Okay, I'm gonna relate to you, okay?

395
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,316
A kid die in the other day, from drugs,
and nobody including me, is doing anything about it.

396
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,731
That's weird, guys.

397
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:06,853


398
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:11,331
And then you two show up with 30 days left,
causing trouble in my school.

399
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:15,759
I'm one more black gay kid getting punch
in the face away from nervous breakdown.

400
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,600
Do I make myself clear?

401
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:23,340
You guys cross my line again, you walk in this office,
I'm gonna expel you, you got me?

402
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:25,676
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

403
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:32,359
Let's do that again, and pretend you guys are not weird.
Which one of you is named Doug?

404
00:24:32,574 --> 00:24:36,476
- Knock it off, I'm Brad.
- Okay, good. That means your name is Doug, son.

405
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,190
- Yeah, I'm Doug.
- Great.

406
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,490
Here the class schedule.

407
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,792
The fun is, I will taking you
to the brainy type.

408
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:45,299
I end up for you for the drama geek,
far less surprising / Thank you

409
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,020
Now we're at the wrong edges,
you dumb-ass!

410
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:53,391
- I'm in drama, I suck at drama, it's girly, embarrassing.
- Oh my God, I know there's no student's care..

411
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,561
I can fake my week in practice in AP Chemistry
for a few weeks.

412
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,229
AP (Advanced Placement) Chemistry

413
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,731
AP Chemistry, no you can't..

414
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,824
You don't even know what is fucking "cold"!

415
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,180
It's gonna be fun! You go to my classes,
and I go to yours.

416
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:07,641
Okay, Chemistry is along with
shape and shit, right?

417
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:13,636
So, we are going to hold auditions
for Peter Pan part today.

418
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:17,704
Billiam, would have wanted
this show to go on..

419
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:22,935
When I was a young actor just starting out
in New York, States Albany, to be exact.

420
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:26,912
- <i> I booked a local television commercial,
  which I had to play a young man.. </i>
- Hey..

421
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:30,072
It's really sad about that kid.
He was talented.

422
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:33,817
So, are you saying, if he wasn't talented
it would be less sad?

423
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:38,359
No, no, no, no, no, uh..
That's not what I mean.

424
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:40,828
I was just piercing your balls.

425
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:45,334
Okay, I get it.

426
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:49,989
I remember one time, doing cocaine
with Willy Nelson's whores

427
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,252
and..

428
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:57,570
We were having so much fun, and then
I realized that she was dead.

429
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:01,403
- I remember one summer..
- The kids still doing this stuff?

430
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:03,856
Even after what happened to him?

431
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,655
Everyone think that Billiam
had a heart murmur.

432
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,615
Everyone I know said that Billiam does it.
It's not my thing.

433
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:12,738
It's not really my thing, either.

434
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:17,594
But, a buddy of mine, really wants it,
who do you call, if you want it?

435
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:24,817
Or, you can tell your friend, that if he
really wanted it, it's not so hard to find.

436
00:26:24,818 --> 00:26:28,997
<i>You shouldn't take it at all.
Drugs are bad..</i>

437
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:30,990
<i>But this thing has a place </i>

438
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,667
<i>even in life of professional artist..</i>

439
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:35,634
- Thank you
- Very well

440
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,920
LOOKING 4 HOOK-UP

441
00:26:40,787 --> 00:26:43,456
New person, Mr. Texty Texty

442
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:46,372
Since you have so much to say
to Molly..

443
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,943
Let's see if you can be Peter,
to our Wendy.

444
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:51,852
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

445
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:56,077
Uh, I can't. I'm fine just being a tree
or something..

446
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,638
Doug, you never would know
what you can't achieve,

447
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,338
before you don't achieve it..

448
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:06,130
My point is, you have to,
everyone auditions for Peter.

449
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,357
Yeah, sure.

450
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,083

00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:40,568
All right, yeah!
I like it, I like the confidence, son!

598
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,722
a little piece, a little pump

599
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:44,973


600
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:49,778
Huge lead, huge lead, we got this!
All right! You rock at them!

601
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:54,434
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

602
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:59,343
Hey, pick it up! Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up!
What are you doing?!

603
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,458
Where are you going? Pick it...
WHAT?!

604
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:09,582
McQuaid! Don't throw the baton, you jack-ass!

605
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,680
Come on!  McQuaid!

606
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,285
Run that way!

607
00:37:13,286 --> 00:37:17,435
find that!
Fuck you, Mile Davis!

608
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:23,938
Go goddammit, let's go!
Let's go! come on!

609
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:28,774
Just, no, no!
Now stop!

610
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,486
Come here, come here!
Don't make me.. That's not a tough penis!

611
00:37:31,487 --> 00:37:33,721


612
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:39,218
PHASE 05:
ASLEEPYNESS

613
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:43,912
I speak to the devil, dude

614
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:47,006
That was awesome, by how you sabotaged
that track this day,

615
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:49,347
Organize sport so fascist,
it makes me sick..

616
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,075
Yes, this is what I do.

617
00:37:51,076 --> 00:37:53,580
Okay, shit it, let's see you around, right?

618
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:58,054
I don't get this school.

619
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:00,657
That was awesome..

620
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,313
Okay, so we stay up all night,
making this, this awesome..

621
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,855
You really gonna like it. All yarn work
was done by jenko.

622
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:09,108
okay, Captain, look. The dealers
are popular kids.

623
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:11,431
But they're not normal popular.

624
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:13,513
They're deadly crunchy granule that up to
convinced everyone that they're cool.

625
00:38:13,514 --> 00:38:16,368
And they're not cool. It's backward,
and unnatural, and it's gotta be stopped.

626
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,032
Lead dealer, Eric Molson..

627
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:20,924
Alpha dog, sick-chicks, killer's teeth

628
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,191
Edge-run this year,

629
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:24,486
He's gettin' in Berkeley,
early amidst

630
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,114
And he totally gets me.

631
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:28,413
Who put this together?
Your artistic?

632
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:31,631
- It is artistic, Sir. Because the thing is, the yarn..
- Uhm..

633
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:33,964
we make a list of some suspicious type
of student..

634
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:36,638


635
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,461
Cut the bullshit!
I wanna know who the supplier!

636
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:43,823
We don't know, that's why,
there's a question mark on his face..

637
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,873
That's not the way his face looks,
Th’s just the question mark.

638
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:49,385
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier!
Simple!

639
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,528
Sounds that you guys really
crack the whole case..

640
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,222
Good job, you guys are on fire,
I'm so proud..

641
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,285
Like you could do any better?

642
00:38:56,286 --> 00:39:01,259


643
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:05,866
Meanwhile, you two are filling around,
finger-popping each other's assholes.

644
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:08,190
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

645
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:11,143
What we're doin'
is gettin' shit done.

646
00:39:11,144 --> 00:39:16,683
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm about to infiltrate super high-tech
drug manufacturing, way in chemistry class room

647
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:21,545
SCIENCE

648
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:25,560
- password?
- open the door!

649
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,950
- Get the suitable password.
- I'm sorry, what?

650
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,106
Geez!

651
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:37,005
What are you doing?
How do you get key in here?

652
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:40,366
Ms. Griggs gave us one, so we could
work, to the deal Bakugan..

653
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,521
Bakugan?

654
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:42,313
You deal on drugs?  /  No

655
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,980
- Let me see it! you deal on drugs?
- It's just card game, it's a hybrid card game

656
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:49,852
- Do you see? / They open up the stuff..
- You are not doing anything illegal?  / No

657
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:53,577
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm here, to study..

658
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:56,783
- Good, you can use it, you're very far behind, so..
- You behind..

659
00:39:56,784 --> 00:40:01,332
- I'm ahead, I know everything..
- Really? uh, what is covalent bond?

660
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,693
Oh, fuck you, man!
I'm not gonna tell you..

661
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:06,110
I, I.. wasn't trying to be rude, sorry.

662
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:09,006
I, I just, I don't think you
know everything?

663
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,783
I know everything.

664
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,132
Okay.

665
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:22,359
What kind of bullshit did they say about
covalent bond in this school?

666
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,382
They say, it's uh, when 2 atoms share both electrons,
it's uh, helps them to stick together..

667
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:31,326
I, I can help you out, if you
want I do it for you for the test.

668
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:33,426
What are you doing with all those
phones anyway?

669
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:37,304
Uh, I, I crack and jailbreak these phones, uh..
trying save for collage..

670
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,152
You know, I try to put these wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

671
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,330
Can you listen to all phone call
by this now?

672
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:44,791
No, no. I can't install spyware to remotely
monitor calls..

673
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,671
Or anything that the mic picks up..

674
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:50,352
- I can't do it at all..
- Wait, you can't do it? / No, I can't.

675
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,285
- Is it me being sarcastic?
- I don't know..

676
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,824
So, you can?

677
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:04,041
Liking comic books is popular?
Environmental awareness? Being tolerant?

678
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:07,147
How was that for 10 years later,
I would've been the coolest person ever!

679
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,557
I know. It's bullshit.

680
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,746
You know what?

681
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:13,228
I told you on the cause..

682
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:14,688
Glee.

683
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:17,317
Fuck you, Glee!

684
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:19,434
Man, I gotta say,
this is kind of awesome.

685
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,706
I might become popular, I might be enabled
to popular kids

686
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:27,285
We just could do something wildly
irresponsible to earn their trust.

687
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:31,580
- You're saying, we should throw a party?
- I invite Molly, and Molly will invite Eric..

688
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:36,440
- and that would be the quickest way for me to pro down..
- Wouldn't that be better if we're both join the popular kids group?

689
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:41,010
I think it would be better, you join with the nerd kids,
and see what's going on over there. That'd be the best for the kids.

690
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:44,241
I guess that makes sense.

691
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,776
- Hello?
- Hey, uh, is this, is this Molly?

692
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:57,892
- Who's speaking?
- Hey, it's, uh, it's Schmidt

693
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:01,535
Schmidt, Schmidt, uh, it's
Doug "Schmidt" McQuaid.

694
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,226
Oh, hey, man.

695
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:05,991
So weird that you're calling me.
I'm pretty much text..

696
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:10,202
Except for one of random old relative called.

697
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:13,707
I just called, uh, 'cause we co-star
in this play together? And..

698
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,961
- Hello..
- Mom, get off the phone!

699
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:18,515
Oh, sorry, my Doug,  my teen son.

700
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:24,629
- Mom!
- I love you honey, doggy,
  Doug, Doug Schmidt McQuaid.
- Mom, so serious right now! stop!

701
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,597
I'm sorry, my mom such a dick.

702
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:32,553
Uh, she's like smothered me
with affection.

703
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:33,690
makes me feel like I'm 5 years old.

704
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:37,218
Wow, I share, I dig that.

705
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:40,380
Well, I'm 18 years old, but my mom
box a lunch for me everyday.

706
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:43,502
There's this one month, where she bought me
43 stuffy animals

707
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:46,218
The doctor thought that I will
spontaneously grow a vagina.

708
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:48,417
I didn't though, just to be clear.

709
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:50,184
Yeah, because you already have one.

710
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:52,700
Exactly, I already have..

711
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,176
- Hey, you don't need two vagina, you just don't.
- Although, you can use of the other one purse.

712
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,792
I never got any stuffy animals as here I am.
Oh wait, actually that's not true. I did.

713
00:43:00,392 --> 00:43:03,109
My dad gave me soft puppy,
when the day he bailed on us.

714
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:05,995
I'm just fucking with you.

715
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:08,864
That's was a weird joke. I thought
your dad abandon your family.

716
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:10,847
No, he did walk out, on a cell.

717
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:13,346
And he didn't leave me a soft puppy.

718
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:14,633
It's broken dreams.

719
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,971
Oh man, I guess to that,
I would say..

720
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:19,490
Well, uh..

721
00:43:20,178 --> 00:43:23,100
There' are some good guys out there.

722
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:27,387
And, uh, I wouldn't let,
you know one experience..

723
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:29,554
Take your uh, memory,
oh my God..

724
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,416
Are you getting choked up?

725
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,491
- I'm sorry if I just make you upset.
- No.

726
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:37,467
You know, I don't like the guys
who mean to girls..

727
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:41,598
- Yeah, well, thanks.
- Normal transition here.

728
00:43:41,773 --> 00:43:45,128
Uhm, actually I'm having a party
next week, and you should come.

729
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,236
You and Eric and Juario,
whatever..

730
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:50,183
Do you mind if I just put
like, uh, posting on facebook?

731
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:53,814
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah..
Uhm, I should, I should call you back.

732
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:56,082
Well, all right, I see it clear,
you're great person..

733
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,626
- Bye bye! / Bye..
- What the fucking..

734
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:10,407
Are y'all throwing up a party?

735
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:13,122
- What?
- There's rumors

736
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,279
In the twittersphere.

737
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,460
And if my officers, are caught..

738
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:23,191
Giving alcohol to minors,
you'll find yourself in prison.

739
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:26,578
With snorkle duck-taped to their mouth.

740
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,826
And me, shittin' down that snorkle.

741
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:34,147
It's extremely vivid, thank you.

742
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:37,044
You're the best, you are the best!
Oh my God.

743
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,274
We love you,

847
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:38,771
If you do good, maybe we'll
bring you what we're doing

848
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:41,313
I'll introduce you to my hook-up.

"I love dick"? You think that's funny?
"Wonder Years douche"?

854
00:53:04,707 --> 00:53:10,583
What kind of sick animal, draws
an ejaculating penis into 8 year old mouth?

855
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:14,106
Thought it'd be, like an airplane throwing up.

856
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,725
You think I don't know about dick and balls?
I know all about dick and balls.

857
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:22,538
I partied with Robert Downing Jr, before got sober,
we did really fucked up, and had a lot of fun.

858
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:24,717
And you know what? From now on,
you're gonna do some chores.

859
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:30,158
You're gonna wash the laundry, you're gonna fold it,
you're gonna do the dishes, you're gonna mow the lawn

860
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:37,739
Dude, I have a surprise for you.
Last night at the party..

861
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,555
I took Eric's phone and had Zack
put this monitoring device in it.

862
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:44,527
So, we're gonna get to hear every single
thing that a little prick is up to.

863
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:47,258
- Dude, I don't know that is good idea.
- What?

864
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:49,651
- What if you gotten found out?
- But it worked.

865
00:53:49,652 --> 00:53:53,929
This is like the smartest move I've ever plot to.
I'm sorry, what are you getting mad at me for?

866
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,314
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad, you have something to do.

867
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:01,841
Good.

868
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:13,589
Great job, Schmidt.

869
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:28,756

- Kneel to be fucked up!

870
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:32,034
- You may enter.
- Thank you, Zach!

871
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:43,148
- Let's tap that wire, huh?
- We just want to go outside with a bunch of chemicals

872
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:48,354
We're uhm, gonna test what blows up. Uh, there's
no reason to wiretap, is it? Uh, super urgent, right?

873
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:50,742
Not that I can think of,
that would make sense.

874
00:54:50,743 --> 00:54:54,946
More, more.
Go, go, go, go!

875
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,706
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

876
00:55:01,707 --> 00:55:04,782
I love this science shit!
Is this what you guys do all day?

877
00:55:04,783 --> 00:55:07,188
Let's do it again!

878
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:13,033

00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,761
Schmidtie!

888
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,800
Phyllis.

889
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:52,670
Uh, I'll be right back / Okay.

890
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:57,810
How are you?
How is my favorite police officer?

891
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:02,258
- Your mother told me that you are undercover.
- Listen, now is not a really good time.

892
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,545
- Yes, are you undercover right now?
- Yes, this is undercover mission.

893
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:10,071
Are those bad guys out there?
Oh, my God. This so exciting.

894
00:56:10,072 --> 00:56:15,584
I have gotta call Aunt Anna, she's gonna die.
I heard that Jacob boy, is your partner?

895
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:19,781
Shut your fucking mouth.

896
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:23,986
- All right guys, check this out.
- I was trying to punch you on the face,
  and you have to match acting up ///

897
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:26,964
I swear I'm not gonna punch you / Hey yo!

898
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:33,596
- Shit, she tried to grab my dick,dude!
- What?!

899
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:36,392
She's probably touch... She's like: "Oh, my God,
I have grab his pants with my own hands.."

900
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,755
"..I even grab a handful of that dick,
I kicked a fucked out of her.."

901
00:56:38,756 --> 00:56:40,481
ERIC: she grab you a handful of dick?!
SECURITY: You all right?

902
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:45,081
..I felt weird for a second, so I pushed her, I pushed her!
Let's get out of here, let's get out here!

903
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:57,192
SCHMIDT:
DON'T WAIT-UP, OUT WITH ERIC :)

904
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:03,836
So, your parents, they just cool
if having people over whenever?

905
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:07,686
Yeah, you know, they are  most nice,
pretty fair just about all things..

906
00:57:07,687 --> 00:57:11,032
You're so lucky your parents
don't give  a shit about you, right?

907
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:14,016
This place is awesome!

908
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:16,223
- Hi!!
- Hey, how you doin'?

909
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:20,142
Wow, that's a bigger hug
than I were expecting..

910
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:24,151
- I'm happy to see you.
- Yeah, yeah me too.

911
00:57:29,637 --> 00:57:32,854
I brought tacos, so..

912
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:42,309
Hey, boys. Miss eco-pussy
is going down, today.

913
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:47,959
Kick down eco-pussy!
Kick down eco-pussy!

914
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,522
Mother earth,
 mother earth is dying..

915
00:57:52,523 --> 00:57:56,857
And when it rains, you're gonna
be beautiful bitches cryin'..

916
00:57:56,858 --> 00:57:59,245
- It's really not a planet..
- It's for sure a planet.

917
00:57:59,246 --> 00:58:00,632
- Pluto is a planet.
- The jupiter planet..

918
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,200
- Ready, ready!
- Not anymore..

919
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:11,816
- I'm embarrassed, I was like feel exposed..
- Do not feel exposed..

920
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:15,494
- I must go to toilet, it's in the corner, right?
- Yeah, there it is.

921
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:19,976
the mic is live, we can hear the
other half lips

922
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:28,144
<i>- Do you have the guys?
- Zack do her though? / yes</i>

923
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:34,875
What are you doing?

924
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:37,821
- I heard something.
- <i>hey, can I ask you something?</i>

925
00:58:37,822 --> 00:58:40,061
- <i>Sit down.
- Okay </i>

926
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,787
<i> I just wanna make sure that you and Eric
are gonna be careful..</i>

927
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:47,057
with whatever it is, that you're
getting involved at.

928
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:52,791
- Yeah, I promise, we will.
- It was just suck when something bad happened, 'cause...

929
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:57,814
- you're.. you're a good guy.
- Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you.

930
00:58:57,815 --> 00:59:01,757
It's like, girl version,
you're a girl.

931
00:59:01,758 --> 00:59:05,279
- I am. /  Yeah... hahaha
- That's why I put this dress on,

932
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,946
- to remind you..
- yes, exactly.

933
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:09,513
- Are you, are you excited about the play?
- Yeah

934
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:14,362
- Yeah, you were just right in there, with excitement
- Yes, I'm very excited.

935
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:18,183
- Does that make me a super-nerd?
- No. Not at all.

936
00:59:18,184 --> 00:59:20,821
- <i>We'd act together</i>
- Hahaha vagina.

937
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:24,907
- He had no chance with her.
- oh shit!

938
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:28,125
You're in the prom committee ? / uh-hmmm?
Do you think it's gonna be fun?

939
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,916
- Did she just bring prom to her home?
- She did, she just brought her prom.

940
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:32,968
<i>- What is she doing?</i>
- I think it's gonna be awesome.

941
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,684
- Prom is a donk. / Multiple donk.
- All right. Anyone who says their don't care about the prom..

942
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:39,010
- actually, secretly does.
- We're not gonna take the prom.

943
00:59:39,011 --> 00:59:41,022
- There's no one wants to go to prom with us.
- Come on, picture it!

944
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:46,273
You pull up with the white stallion of a limo, you got
fine-ass honeys with you, you dress to the night..

945
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:49,289
with your best buds, doves fly out behind you.
With slow motion doves.

946
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:54,811
- Doves, why doves?
- Cause doves make you look like a bad-ass, that's why.

947
00:59:54,812 --> 01:00:00,309
I'm pretty skeptical, but,
maybe if someone fun asked me..

948
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,875
I would go.

949
01:00:02,912 --> 01:00:07,871
Aren't you with Eric? Wouldn't you
and Eric go together?

950
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:11,205
Not that I know of.

951
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:20,310
- Would you ...
- He's gonna choked

952
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:23,697
He's always choked, he's gonna choked.
Wait for it.

953
01:00:26,073 --> 01:00:32,294
So.. would...you... maybe...

954
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,595
Oh my God, are you okay? / oh yeah..

955
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:40,042
That is actually sound of choking.

956
01:00:40,043 --> 01:00:44,502
I, I was wondering, if you, uh..

957
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:50,071
Would you, uh..
Maybe wanna go..

958
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:54,882
with me to prom? Would you wanna
go maybe with to prom?

959
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:56,804
Yes.

960
01:00:56,805 --> 01:01:02,300
- I would love to go to the prom with you.
- What? she said "yes"

961
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:08,381
- Good for you, Doug.
- Thank you for asking.

962
01:01:15,189 --> 01:01:18,345
Put it there, then.
Just put it right there.

963
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:22,263
I'm putting it right there.

964
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:27,468
<i>Yeah, here you guys, huh?</i>

965
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:29,320
Oh, how are you doin'?

966
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:32,931
Okay, settle an argument. You and your brother
aren't really related, right?

967
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:35,420
- 'cause you two look so different
- He's adopted.

968
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:39,133
<i>We all suspect him
from a very lame family.

969
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:43,813
- <i>Where is he tonight?
- <i>Probably at home, playing tool with..</i>

970
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:46,420
You know how Tom Cruise had
always pissed-off at Rain Man?

971
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:50,939
That's like my life, except Brad
is really shit at Math.

972
01:01:52,472 --> 01:01:58,396
- Your Bro kind of dick.
- Yeah, he.. he kind of, doesn't he?

973
01:01:58,397 --> 01:02:02,946
- Don't let me do that.
- I'll give it for work.

974
01:02:06,554 --> 01:02:10,311
Eric is the funniest I ever..

975
01:02:18,632 --> 01:02:22,096
Hello. Hey you guys, so funny seeing you here.
How are you, guess what?

976
01:02:22,097 --> 01:02:25,217
I don't care. We just closed our third
high school operations.

977
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:29,609
And check what we found at Kennedy.
Looks like we're gonna have to do your job for you.

978
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,314
Your drugs currently spread
in different school now, sucker!

979
01:02:34,774 --> 01:02:39,161
You failed to stop the outbreak.
And you have no leads.

980
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:42,751
We're running out of time.
You will find the supplier,

981
01:02:42,752 --> 01:02:45,427
Or I'll jump your
asses off Jump Street.

982
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,563
I totally understand what are you calling from, Sir. But
look, I heard Eric talking on the phone yesterday.

983
01:02:49,564 --> 01:02:54,460
With somebody, that sounds very suspect
about " meat loaf would not stop at pinata".

984
01:02:55,262 --> 01:02:58,195
Is that a code for sex?

985
01:02:59,922 --> 01:03:03,841
- Pinata, really?
- Yup, remember that wiretap in Eric's phone?

986
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:05,674
While you have a good time
in your life, last night..

987
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:09,735
I was listening, I overheard a phone call
between Eric and some dude, about that pinata.

988
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:14,423
- So, you heard?
- Yep.

989
01:03:17,236 --> 01:03:22,009
I am so nervous! We are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.

990
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:24,850
I apologize in advanced,
if I threw up on you on stage.

991
01:03:24,851 --> 01:03:30,686
- serious question, now: How do I look?
- About the same.

992
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:36,274
- Is it too sexy of an outfit?
- bend your knee a little bit? Yup, it is.

993
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:41,164
Oh, it's gonna be so much easier
having you on stage with me.

994
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:46,139
I'm so happy that I met you.
You're like the only guy that I can really trust.

995
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,860
Yup, that's me.. Doug.

996
01:03:55,222 --> 01:04:00,219
Potassium  Nitrate, don't hate it.
It's great.

997
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,245
It's an active oxidizer

998
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:05,501
I didn't know that, now I'm wiser.

999
01:04:05,689 --> 01:04:09,401
It has crystal line structure.
If you can't respect that,

1000
01:04:09,402 --> 01:04:13,749
you're a butt-mouther.
It's the key ingredient of gun powder.

1001
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:17,029
KNO3, don't get no grieve.

1002
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:20,986
You can be used to
make corned beef.

1003
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:24,310
It's also known as salt titer.

1004
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:32,040
Brad, where are you going?

1005
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:35,087
- I don't wanna look like a techie wearing a..
- Doug, hey.

1006
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:38,375
- Hi!
- Hi! Wow, what are you wearing?

1007
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:41,197
That, potassium nitrate explosives.
I need to borrow you.

1008
01:04:41,198 --> 01:04:45,429
- Now is not a good time, Brad
- Uh-hmmm? It's really a good time.

1009
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:50,823
- 'Cause my pinata is killing me.
- Is that for a sex thing?

1010
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:54,972
- It's leaving the parking lot.
- Pinata? / Uh-hmmm?

1011
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:59,669
Molly, uh... I would be right back. I need to help
Brad with somebody, okay?

1012
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,306
I just need to help Brad with somebody, / What?
real quick. I promise you..  / No!

1013
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:04,076
Do you understand  how soon
the show to curtain?

1014
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:05,729
- tell me you understand.. ?
- I swear you, I swear you.

1015
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,336
What? Are you kidding me?!

1016
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:16,265
What did I say, what did I say?
Whose wiretap is working now, huh?

1017
01:05:27,932 --> 01:05:32,448
- You told me I don't have to worry about the tickets.
- I thought it made us look cool.

1018
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:34,912
- That man has car.
- I'm driving.

1019
01:05:34,913 --> 01:05:36,375
- Oh, you're not.
- I never get the chance..

1020
01:05:36,376 --> 01:05:39,134
- Fine ! Fine!
- Hey guys!

1021
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,768
- This car does look fast.
- Go!

1022
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:45,928
Guys, hey wait, guys. You're not on the list,
hey guys, wait...

1023
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:48,400
Uh, who cares?

1024
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:03,769
- Holy fuckin' shit!
- No fuckin' way.

1025
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,597
- Those are the guys in the park.
- That is just crazy.

1026
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:11,692
- What's in that thing?
- I don't know. Money, drugs..

1027
01:06:11,693 --> 01:06:14,412
There could be a new buyer,
or they wield on some product.

1097
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:04,966
OIL & FUEL

1098
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:12,958
I really thought that one was gonna explode.

1099
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:23,040
Look at the compartment drawer for gun!

1100
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,791
- What are you talking about? We're in the pink car!
- I don't care!

1101
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:30,303
- Look at the goddamn gun in drawer compartment!

1102
01:11:33,353 --> 01:11:35,376
Shoot! / Okay, okay, okay!

- I need to aim at him, before I can shoot!

1104
01:11:39,357 --> 01:11:44,919
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1105
01:11:59,943 --> 01:12:02,327
- That one exploded?
- Holy shit, that was crazy!

1106
01:12:02,328 --> 01:12:05,399
- Why did you shoot for me?
- You weren't shooting, you were shocking!

1107
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,274
- So, I had to save us.
- I was gonna shooting!

1108
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:09,535
- You always do this every single time.
- What?

1109
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:12,108
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.
If I missed the play..

1110
01:12:12,109 --> 01:12:15,218
Molly's gonna freak-out. She's not
gonna go to prom with me.

1111
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:19,089
- Are you fuckin' serious,  buddy?
- Fuck, yes, I'm serious.

1112
01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:22,837
I can't believe you make me late.
You're so selfish!

1113
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,027
- I'm selfish?
- Yes, you're selfish.

1114
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:27,528
- Are you fuckin' kidding me?
- Look at yourself!

1115
01:12:27,529 --> 01:12:30,360
You're in too deep, man.

1116
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:32,670
Yesterday I found a college
application on your desk!

1117
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:34,700
I don't know how long
this case is gonna last?

1118
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:38,389
And if Eric's gonna get in to Berkeley,
and honestly, I can get in too..

1119
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:41,072
Who knows, I can right at things,
I can be doctor or something.

1120
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:44,864
Have you lost your fucking mind?
You screw this investigation, all up!

1121
01:12:44,865 --> 01:12:47,963
At least I know my Miranda Rights, you idiot!

1122
01:12:51,715 --> 01:12:56,159
- You're very silly man, indeed.
- Boys, squat, come quickly.

1123
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,968
Uh, I'm here.
I know I missed first two scenes, uh..

1124
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:07,095
- I wanna thank you for Samuel, for...
- Fuck you, Doug!

1125
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:10,544
I said we just, blow right
on to this thing, huh?

1126
01:13:12,141 --> 01:13:16,229
- This is my twin, well, we're together in..
- Back up, get fuck out here.

1127
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,500
- What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
- What is this?

1128
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:23,013
I don't know, but it's already
more exciting..

1129
01:13:23,014 --> 01:13:25,937
- You're embarrassing me.
- It's okay. I'll make it out to you.

1130
01:13:25,938 --> 01:13:30,122
And, uh..  let's fly!

1131
01:13:31,748 --> 01:13:35,078
- Such a bullshit!
- Get off of me! Get off of me!

1132
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:40,997
I'm not damn, I'm smart!
Do you think I'm stupid?

1133
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:43,401
- Yeah!
- I guess I should do something.

1134
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:46,321
I should probably not standing here watching,
I should take action.

1135
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:49,460
Worst best friend ever!

1136
01:13:53,436 --> 01:13:56,500
- Molly, I'm sorry.
- I don't wanna talk to you ever again.

1137
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:58,940
I'm sorry.

1138
01:14:02,717 --> 01:14:05,312
You stupid idiot!

1139
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,817
Come on!

1140
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:20,269
Make fun of me behind my back?
Everyone laugh at me?

1141
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:23,514
I've been a loser for 4 years,
you can't nail it for 5 minutes?!

1142
01:14:23,515 --> 01:14:26,314
How does feel the fairy dust, motherfucker?!

1143
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:32,191
- Hey guys, no!
- I heard you called me Rain Man...

1144
01:14:32,192 --> 01:14:36,720
- You ass-hole!
- Make it fun a bit, suck dick!

1145
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:40,349
- No!
- You supposed to be my friend!

1146
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:45,089
Stop! Stop it! You're expelled!
Both of you are expelled!

1147
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,222
And that's the end of act two.

1148
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:13,757
- Is that it? You're not gonna scream at us?
- Nope.

1149
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:16,923
I'm just gonna fire you.

1150
01:16:03,089 --> 01:16:06,613
- Movin' out?
- Yup.

1151
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:14,227
You know, You know what's crazy to me?
That I actually thought we're brothers.

1152
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:17,951
I would've taken a bullet for you.

1153
01:16:23,605 --> 01:16:27,912
- Get in, now! Both of you.
- Why should I?

1154
01:16:28,052 --> 01:16:31,498
- Just get in the car, man.
- Get in the fuckin' car!

1155
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:34,223
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

1156
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:37,534
Please, get in the car.

1157
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,315
Come on, you guys, come on!
Please! Jesus!

1158
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:47,349
That messed up shit you've done yesterday.

1159
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:52,321
And, after we made the exchange, our potential
business partners got followed by some fucking cops!

1160
01:16:52,322 --> 01:16:57,432
- That's insane, man. Are you serious?
-Yes, I don't wanna go to jail!

1161
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:59,782
Are you,..  you know what happened with
the handsome guy like me in jail?

1162
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,179
It rhymes with "grape".

1163
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,211
It rhymes with "grape".
I can't let that happened.

1164
01:17:06,212 --> 01:17:07,708
So, I got these from my Dad's
gun storage.

1165
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:10,919
- Eric, Eric, Eric! / Come on, whoa!
- Springfield 45. Police issue.

1166
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,107
Very powerful gun.
Have you ever used one?

1167
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:18,446
No, we're really not gun people, man.

1168
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:22,208
- A lot of things I might be wonder about you.
- Come, on.

1169
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:27,954
Your taste in music. Fact that you
look like fucking' 40 year old man.

1170
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:31,444
And after that shit at the play,
I realized..

1171
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:37,081
No way you guys could be cops.

1172
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:41,125
I got this deal going down.
The supplier's gonna be there.

1173
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:43,614
I need people I can trust.

1174
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:49,166
All right. Come on. Well, both of you are
gonna shoot these bottles. We're gonna practice.

1175
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:52,308
Okay? / Okay.

1176
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:03,786
- Oh, that was, that was really fuckin' awesome.
- Beginner's luck.

1177
01:18:03,787 --> 01:18:06,909
All right. The supplier wants the
deal to go down at prom.

1178
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,951
This is gonna be always this heavy there,
but, as long as you guys all at my back..

1179
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:14,082
- Yeah? Yeah?
- We can do that.

1180
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:17,511
It's time to get our jobs back.

1181
01:18:18,663 --> 01:18:21,796
Let's get ready for prom.

1182
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:38,813
- Schmidtie, chore time!
- Mom, we don't have time for chores right now!

1183
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:45,044
- If you stay in this house, you have time for chores.
- Mom!

1184
01:18:58,388 --> 01:19:00,891
k'o'o'c'1'n'g_g4ul (N4ka's'h'i'm'a T4da'y'o's'h'i)

1185
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:09,754
Here. It'll be quicker if I help.

1186
01:19:11,072 --> 01:19:15,241
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1187
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:25,327
Your shotgun hanging too low.
They're gonna see it.

1188
01:19:27,489 --> 01:19:29,727
Thanks.

1189
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:38,269
Jenko ...

1190
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:45,555
Will you go to prom with me?

1191
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,227
I guess.

1192
01:19:52,049 --> 01:19:56,414
Are we really gonna take down all drug
operations by ourselves?

1193
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,721
I got some contacts that would help us.

1194
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,372
ONE NIGHT IN TIJUANA

1195
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:42,477
Brad, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

1196
01:20:42,478 --> 01:20:45,862
This is wrong,
you're so right. / What?

1197
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:51,327
I'm so happy you willing to get job over me.
You have to go. Please, don't leave me, ever.

1198

- I'm scared. Stop. Stop.
- Stay! / Stop.

1199
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:55,526

01:20:55,527 --> 01:20:58,117
- Go! - Stay!
- Okay, stop.

1201
01:20:58,118 --> 01:21:00,702
- I'm lost without you.

1202
01:21:00,703 --> 01:21:05,163
Get off of me, I'm gonna throw up.
You are so hot.

1203
01:21:12,684 --> 01:21:16,765
Hey, pumpkin man. I'm very mad at you.

1204
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:18,989
- Are you on shit?
- So, what if I am?

1205
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,869
Look, Molly. It's so serious,
stuff is about to go down.

1206
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:25,652
- And, and I don't you to get hurt.
- I've already been hurt, Doug.

1207
01:21:25,653 --> 01:21:29,760
- I don't care.
- You need to leave, you need to leave, you need get out of here.

1208
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:33,386
- Right now.
- Making a lot of hand gestures.

1209
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:35,554
- Okay, my name is not Doug. It's Schmidt.
- What?

1210
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:37,134
- And I'm a cop.
- What?

1211
01:21:37,135 --> 01:21:40,701
Okay? And, and I care about you.
and, and I don't you get busted, so..

1212
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:44,504
So, you need to leave right now.
leave the prom right now, Molly.

1213
01:21:44,505 --> 01:21:47,738
- I'm serious.
- Hey, hey. Penthouse now! Supplier's waiting.

1214
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:49,621
- What are you?
- Hey, come on. Supplier's waiting.

1215
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:54,650
- Is that Eric?
- Molly, leave, right now. Leave, right now!

1216
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:13,056
- Mr. Walters?
- Hey, beautiful Brad.

1217
01:22:13,057 --> 01:22:15,567
And his brother.
Wow, you look great!

1218
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:18,600
- You're the supplier? You're teacher.
- And I was stuck out at teacher's salary, bro

1219
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,225
Can barely pay my alimony.

1220
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:22,577
But you're gettin' bailed. Huh!

1221
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:26,149
- You boys are so good at this, aren't you?
- Yeah, Cinnamon

1222
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,772
Oh my God. We're getting
such a good evidence.

1223
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:32,980
I stole some of that bust of burned crap from Chem Lab,
doing some of my cool deeds.

1224
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,554
And it was molly-delicioso!
And one day I catch this eco-butt-munch over here..

1225
01:22:36,555 --> 01:22:39,063
smokin' JJ behind the field house.

1226
01:22:39,064 --> 01:22:41,081
And I'm like: "hey, wanna make some coins?"

1227
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:43,972
Green-penis, I guess, huh?

1228
01:22:43,973 --> 01:22:48,771
So, I gave my deal.
Oh my! I hurt my hand.

1229
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:51,997
Bitch.

1230
01:22:58,609 --> 01:23:01,985
You guys look crazy scary.
How many you all there?

1231
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:04,466
A lot. Carl.

1232
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:08,073
- The patch looks great, man.
- Thank you.

1233
01:23:08,236 --> 01:23:11,936
- He's gonna recognize us, man.
- Domingo, this is, this is Walters.

1234
01:23:11,937 --> 01:23:14,177
- He made the stuff.
- Real pleasure to meet you.

1235
01:23:14,178 --> 01:23:17,247
Fuck with the name is.
Yours is good.

1236
01:23:17,248 --> 01:23:18,831
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

1237
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:22,861
What? You have a party now?
Who are these two motherfuckers?

1238
01:23:23,886 --> 01:23:26,820
Hey, how's it goin'?

1239
01:23:26,821 --> 01:23:29,585
- No, that's cool man. They're my boys. So..
- Are they?

1240
01:23:29,586 --> 01:23:31,961
- Yes.
- I don't like strangers.

1241
01:23:31,962 --> 01:23:35,735
How do you ever  expect making new friends,
with that attitude, it was like..

1242
01:23:35,736 --> 01:23:39,050
- Everyone is stranger till you give them a chance, man.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1243
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:44,689
Oh, leave it. I'm fuckin' around.
Do your thing, and proceed.

1244
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,441
Hey, kid, come here.
You? You look familiar.

1245
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,432
- Me?
- Yeah.

1246
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:54,900
I was in, uh, in french fry commercial
when I was a kid.

1247
01:23:54,901 --> 01:23:59,580
So, people are like, they often say, I, I.. "I think
know you bad". And I would bet, I've never met them before.

1248
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:04,104
- Do I look like I eat french fries?
- I don't know you would. Like you're in a great shape.

1249
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:08,126
But, maybe you have like one chiptail like
a carb, carb blow out, you know? I don't know.

1250
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:11,092
- No.
- Yeah, theme song's  like..

1251
01:24:11,093 --> 01:24:15,572
<i>Come to Andrew's French Fry Emporium</i>

1252
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:21,973
<i>Where friendship and French fries,
go hand in hand.. </i>

1253
01:24:24,921 --> 01:24:28,695
- That's my casadia? Who wants a piece, huh?
- I know you're in it, Doug.

1254
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:28,790
<font color="#ffff01">PHASE 04:
FUCK YEAH MOTHERFUCKER</font>

1255

You lied to me!

1256
01:24:32,463 --> 01:24:35,971
I' gonna kill you!
<i>You're a dammit fucking <font color="#ffff01">COP</font>!</i>

1257
01:24:35,972 --> 01:24:38,918
Hey you guys, she just called me
<i>"stupid fucking <font color="#ffff01">COCK</font>"</i>. It's rude.

1258
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:44,096
- <i>Dick head <font color="#ffff01">NARC</font>, motherfucker! </i>
- Did she just said, "nick head <font color="#ffff01">DARK</font> motherfucker"?</i>

1259
01:24:44,097 --> 01:24:47,205
- That was just racist.
- I know what is these two.

1260
01:24:47,206 --> 01:24:50,473
- Your boys are cops!
- Police! Get on the ground!

1261
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:52,794
- You get on the fuckin' ground!
- We ask you first!

1262
01:24:52,795 --> 01:24:55,753
- Why should I give a damn?
- You're fucking cops?!

1263
01:24:55,754 --> 01:24:59,886
We partied together, man.
You brought us Taco Bell.

1264
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:03,685
- Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.
- You made me have this friendship bracelet.

1265
01:25:03,686 --> 01:25:06,198
Well, he's not really your friend.
He's pretending the whole time.

1266
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:08,322
- It is the fake bracelet.
- I'm gonna cut this fuck out later, right?

1267
01:25:08,323 --> 01:25:13,782
What the fuck is going on?
Shut this kid up!

1268
01:25:14,295 --> 01:25:17,489
- Him too.
- No, no, no. Listen! I'm with you guys.

1271
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:26,712
- Oh, hey! There you are!
- What the fuck?

1272
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:29,119
Drop your gun, or I'll spray
her brain all over the room!

1273
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,560
Did you get all this hostage from
goddamn TV show shit?

1274
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:33,069
I don't know.
I'm trying to help.

1275
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,530
- I never done this shit this before.
- You're fuckin' up.

1276
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:38,098
- Drop the gun, or she's dead!

What? No!
Oh, Jesus..

1278
01:25:42,035 --> 01:25:45,815
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.
She just pass out from the drug. We're good.

1279
01:25:45,816 --> 01:25:48,567
- Drop the gun!
- All right, all right! Just chill out.

1280
01:25:48,568 --> 01:25:53,059
We're gonna drop our guns. You gotta let
the kid going. No one is gonna die. Okay?

1281
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,143
just drop the guns,
and kick them over here!

1282
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:58,856
D.B, shoot these motherfuckers.

1283
01:25:58,857 --> 01:26:01,255
Oh, come on. That's not fair. We put
our guns down, for a good thing.

1284
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,235
you're a liar and you're mean!

1285
01:26:03,236 --> 01:26:06,509

1286
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,180
and we can all leave here as friends.

1287
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:10,485
- Yeah, let's do that.
- You boys are stupid!

1288
01:26:10,486 --> 01:26:14,019
Oh my God, we're gonna die..

1289
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:17,724
Goddammit! Tom Hansen, DEA!
On your knees!

1290
01:26:17,725 --> 01:26:19,719
- What the fuck?

01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,845
Fuck! Doug Penhall, DEA.
You're under arrest!

- Just ruined 5 years investigation.
- We have no idea.

1297
01:26:34,855 --> 01:26:39,115
- You're like an amazing actor, man.
- You played saxophone in my sister's wedding, man.

1298
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:41,974
- Talk to her, I fucked her too.
- What?

1299
01:26:41,975 --> 01:26:47,395
You little turds. Do you have any idea how
difficult it is to infiltrate the gang like this?

1300
01:26:48,515 --> 01:26:52,090
You see this nose?
That is fake nose.

1301
01:26:52,091 --> 01:26:55,159
You wanna wear a fake nose in your fuckin' head,
for like months run in..

- glue and shit?
- Worst thing in the world!

1303
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:03,577
- We have to get fuckin' tattoo on our dicks, man.
- Yeah, actually, I just said that to mess with you.

1304
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:05,582
- What?
- Looks tough.

1305
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,921
Hey, look, pal. We know what it is like
being undercover.

1306
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:10,609
- Metro Police, Jump Street Division.
- Come on. You guys from Jump Street?

1307
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,655
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's funny, because we were actually Jump Street.

1308
01:27:13,656 --> 01:27:15,541
- What? That's crazy!
- Yeah.

1309
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:19,638
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

1310
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:22,807
- Get your guns!
- Shoot!

1311
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:26,741
Kill them!

1312
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:29,724
What the fuck!

1313
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:33,785
Shoot them!

1314
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:42,244
- That was a gun.
- Something is definitely got shot.

1315
01:27:46,812 --> 01:27:52,007
Kid, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

1316
01:27:58,116 --> 01:28:02,071
- Did I hit anything?
- You shoot at the fucking ceiling.

1317
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:09,668
I know sometimes I was jerky.
When we were undercover,

1318
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:19,090
I just, I don't feel good about myself.
All the stuff I wore,

1319
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:23,576
the bracelets, rings, the tight pants..

1320
01:28:23,746 --> 01:28:28,283
It was just, so, that people would think I'm cool.

1321
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:33,461
The only approval,
that I ever need it..

1322
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:38,970
- was my best friend.
- Thanks, man.

1323
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:59,051
The money's gone!
Go, let's go!

1324
01:28:59,052 --> 01:29:01,838
- We gotta get out of here, man.
- You're telling me, you're tired?

1325
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:03,897
- Let's do this!
- Let's make a baby!

1326
01:29:03,898 --> 01:29:07,694
- What?! What are you talking about? / I don't know.
- That's not cop's sign.

1327
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,839
That was crazy!
You're killer god!

1328
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,043
Oh, fuck it. Shit!

1329
01:30:03,473 --> 01:30:06,701
We loose through the prom, go!

1330
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,708
Go, go, go, go!

1331
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:31,179
Where they got?

1332
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:34,350
Molly!

1333
01:30:42,532 --> 01:30:44,293
- You wanna drive?
- Yeah, I do love it.

1334
01:30:44,294 --> 01:30:46,319
Okay, cool.

1335
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,061
- Do you look at how I did it?
- That's what I'm talking about!

1336
01:30:52,672 --> 01:30:56,050
What are you guys doin' back there, huh?
God, I love high school.

1337
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:59,073
Best prom ever!

1338
01:31:02,827 --> 01:31:04,928
- You gotta shoot them.
- Stay arm!

1339
01:31:04,929 --> 01:31:06,720
I'm at them. I'm at them.

1340
01:31:06,721 --> 01:31:12,233
- Oh, hey, did you guys come hang out with me?
  Back here, think I'm so lonely.
- Oh fuck! / She's pass out?

1341
01:31:14,505 --> 01:31:18,813
Hey, you got a gun. Why don't
you shoot back there?

1342
01:31:18,814 --> 01:31:22,410
- Shoot that gun! Shoot that gun! / I won't take it.
- Just shoot someone, you bitch!

1343
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:27,073
Pretty goo-goo! Give me my money!

1344
01:31:27,074 --> 01:31:33,016
Fuck! No, no, no! I can't do this.
I want to end up school at Berkeley.

1345
01:31:33,064 --> 01:31:36,227
- I'm gonna break the party!
- No, no, no!

1346
01:31:36,228 --> 01:31:40,525
Hey, I'm living my dream,
I'm standing on a my limo!

1347
01:31:41,717 --> 01:31:44,381
- Heck, killing my dream!
- Come here.

1348
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:46,859
- What? I'm trying to party.
- Bitch!

1349
01:31:49,527 --> 01:31:53,153
I'll kill you!

1350
01:31:53,154 --> 01:31:55,412
- Stop it! Enough!
- It's hard! / Enough.

1351
01:31:55,413 --> 01:31:57,751
Let's go!

1352
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:03,440
No, stop! I'm not fuckin' play.
What you're trying is stupid, would you stop!

1353
01:32:03,441 --> 01:32:07,569
Just 2 seconds. You're really hot, and your
body's awesome, but I got to shoot people right now!

1354
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:10,121
You think I'm hot?

1355
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:30,128
Wait, guys! Call me!
Let me know where you end up later?

1356
01:32:32,933 --> 01:32:36,202
I almost out of ammo.
We're fucked!

1357
01:32:36,203 --> 01:32:39,039
- Give me my money!
- I got an idea.

1358
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,593
- You still got that shotgun shell ?
- Yeah.

1359
01:32:41,594 --> 01:32:44,638
Pop-Quiznos:
What do you get..

1360
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:47,484
when lithium batteries react with
potassium nitrate?

1361
01:32:47,485 --> 01:32:52,840
That would be a covalent bond, brother.
That when 2 atoms, they share electrons.

1362
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:56,101
You see, they both need what the other one had.
That makes them stick together.

1363
01:32:56,102 --> 01:33:00,278
- Are you saying, we're the covalent bond?
- What? No!

1364
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:03,070
We're not atoms, dude.

1365
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:20,753
- What's this?
- Tequila?

1366
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:23,963
I don't know, it was, it was
supposed to explode.

1367
01:33:29,831 --> 01:33:34,236
- Where did you learn how to do that, man?
- AP Chemistry, bitch.

1368
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,498
Come on, blondie.

1369
01:33:41,924 --> 01:33:45,505
Molly! Molly!

1370
01:33:45,506 --> 01:33:48,827
- Drop your weapon!
- Don't you fuckin' pull that arm.

1371
01:33:48,828 --> 01:33:53,847
- Don't..
- Looks you out of ammo, ass-hole!

1372
01:33:53,848 --> 01:33:56,118
Come on! Get out here!

1373
01:33:56,119 --> 01:33:59,018
- What's going on?
- here's the deal. Nobody moves,

1374
01:33:59,019 --> 01:34:02,553
or she's gonna get hurt, you understand?
Nobody moves! All right.

1375
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:06,646
Eric, help me!
Don't you have a gun?

1376
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:10,295
- All right. Don't move!
- Come on, let's go. Let's go!

1377
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:13,827
- No, no, no, no!
- I said don't move!

1378
01:34:17,036 --> 01:34:20,591
- Oh, fuck! You shot him!
- Whoa, God!
- You okay?

1379
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:24,643
- You shot my partner, you motherfucker!
- I didn't mean to shoot you, I meant to shoot him!

1380
01:34:24,644 --> 01:34:27,273
Are you all right, buddy? Are you okay?
You took a bullet for me, man.

1381
01:34:27,274 --> 01:34:31,466
- Yeah, I'm feeling a little numb from that impact right now.
- Don't you hear me? I said don't move!

1382
01:34:31,467 --> 01:34:33,424
I said that.
You heard, right?

1383
01:34:33,425 --> 01:34:35,005
Eric, you heard me, don't move!

1384
01:34:35,006 --> 01:34:38,713
- You got this.
- Hey, hold still.

1385
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:46,781
<i>- freeze!
- Shoot!</i>

1386
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,901
Come on.

1387
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:54,639
You pitting high school, motherfucker!

1388
01:34:55,705 --> 01:35:00,698
- Oh shit! I shot him in the dick.
- You shot me in the dick.

1389
01:35:05,954 --> 01:35:11,357
You are under arrest!
You have the right to remain silent.

1390
01:35:11,358 --> 01:35:15,636
Anything you said can and will be used
against you in the Court of Law.

1391
01:35:15,637 --> 01:35:19,070
You have the right to attain an attorney,
and if you can not afford an attorney,

1392
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:23,779
one will appointed for you. Do you understand
these rights as they have been read to you?

1393
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:27,357
Fuck you!  Yes!

1394
01:35:27,358 --> 01:35:31,049
- We did it, man! We did it!
- God, that feels so good.

1395
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:35,788
- We did it, man!
- You're goddamn rock star.

1396
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:39,266
You feel that?
I can't believe you're so cool.

1397
01:35:39,267 --> 01:35:43,490
You shot him in the dick. I've never
seen that. Who does that?

1398
01:35:43,491 --> 01:35:46,993
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.
I know I didn't say you were, but..

1399
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:50,220
You're smart, you're smart guy,
and you're thoughtful

1400
01:35:50,221 --> 01:35:54,712
and you're sincere, and, and, you're,
you're sweet and loyal..

1401
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:57,492
I'm fuckin' cherish you.

1402
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:02,327
Should we high-five?

1403
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:09,324
Aww, my hand!

1404
01:36:09,325 --> 01:36:11,022
Uh, are you all right?
You need to hospital then?

1405
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:13,103
- We need to call somebody.
- Then call somebody!

1406
01:36:13,104 --> 01:36:14,968
I need my dick saw back on.

1407
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:17,494
- You shut the fuck up!
- That's not funny.

1408
01:36:17,495 --> 01:36:20,267
- Is that it?
- What?!     (freak out)

1409
01:36:20,842 --> 01:36:22,768
That's my dick!

1410
01:36:22,769 --> 01:36:25,221
- Pick up my dick, please!
- No! We're not gonna pick it up your dick.

1411
01:36:25,222 --> 01:36:27,697
I'm gonna pick up my dick.

1412
01:36:29,811 --> 01:36:32,291
uh, fuck!

1413
01:36:36,048 --> 01:36:41,644
He's my friend. They'll serve vegan
in jail, bitch!

1414
01:36:49,892 --> 01:36:52,291
Molly, I'm..

1415
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:54,696
I'm really sorry.

1416
01:36:54,697 --> 01:36:59,474
I know you wanted a guy at trust.
I wanna be that person so badly.

1417
01:36:59,475 --> 01:37:03,949
And I let you down all the ways, and..

1418
01:37:05,302 --> 01:37:07,580
It's good that you mad at me.

1419
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:11,228
I think it's good. I think you should be mad
at more guys, because..

1420
01:37:11,229 --> 01:37:15,433
you deserve a guy who's good
and who doesn't lie to you.

1421
01:37:15,434 --> 01:37:18,248
And you should never set off less than that.

1422
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:21,054
There are good guys out there.

1423
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:25,016
weren't ass-holes like me.

1424
01:37:25,993 --> 01:37:30,087
Thank you for saving my life, ass-hole.

1425
01:37:32,234 --> 01:37:35,595
Put it there, partner.

1426
01:37:47,271 --> 01:37:49,885
Uhmm? I'll come back later.

1427
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:56,816
We're like in the end of Die Hard
right now, but it's in our actual life.

1428
01:37:56,817 --> 01:37:58,950
- That's crazy.
- Number 1 or 2?

1429
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:03,222
- Three.
- Samuel Jackson dies, yeah!

1430
01:38:03,223 --> 01:38:08,210
Boom, motherfucker, what's going on?
Come on!

1431
01:38:11,623 --> 01:38:15,049
- Oh, here's my guy!
