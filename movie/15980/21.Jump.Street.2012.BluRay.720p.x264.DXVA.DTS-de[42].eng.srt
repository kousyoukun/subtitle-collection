Hey. Um, look, I know

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,270
we've known each other for a really long time.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,710
And we live across the street from each other and stuff.

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,030
And...

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,950
I know, like, in four days,

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,670
I'm sure, if...

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,150
You know, prom's, like, in four days... Oh, my God.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,070
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,710
Fuck, no.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,670
No, I... No, I just...

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,250
You're probably going with someone. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,070
I don't know how to put this nicely.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,630
There's not a nice way to put it.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,150
You're a fucking nerd.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,030
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,030
Look at her. Look at her.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,750
Shit. Good luck, bro.

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,990
I said loud and clear,

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,390
if you didn't get your grades up, you weren't going to the prom.

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,260
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,230
I should pay who?

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,470
You're not going to the prom.

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,830
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,270
But I'm going to be prom king.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,310
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,030
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

51
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,390
Fuck! Fuck!

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,510


53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,950


54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,990

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,470
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,150
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,900
Oh, fuck!

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,560
Oh!

You're good at this, huh? Yeah, I am.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,180
Thank you.

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,860


63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,940
Such bullshit.

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,110


65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,550
You're really good at this.

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,590
Yeah, I am.

67
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,190
Hey, you want to be friends?

Come on. Come on, let's go.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,710
Come on, pick your knees up. Pick your knees up.

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,790
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,310
Chill, all right? Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,190
What did I tell you? Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,190
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,790
Faster. Let's go.

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,300
Clear!

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,100
Clear!

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,190
- Come on, come on, come on! - Stop.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,830
Yes! Yes!

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,270
Let me see. Let me see.

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,190


81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,550
Nice.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,470
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,310
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

84
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,630
Get ready for a lifetime of being badass motherfuckers.

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,030
Oh, lam.

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,440
I really thought this job would have more car chases and explosions,

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,630
and less homeless people doo-dooing everywhere.

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,990
Do you guys really think this is a police matter?

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,220
To get your Frisbee back?

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,750
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

91
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,380
Shit.

92
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,550
Shit! Shit!

93
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,990
Yours isn't loaded, right? Huh?

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,190
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

95
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,670
What, you... No.

96
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,350
That's no fun. Come on.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,990
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

98
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,270
It's right there.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,390
Don't you... Don't... Don't. Stop it.

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,430
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

101
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,310
You feel like a big shot?

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,750
No fucking way.

103
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,750
One Percenters?

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,950
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,030
If we could take them down as our first bust, we'd be off park duty for sure.

106
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,310
You see what I see?

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,270
Cannabis sativa.

108
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,510
Chaka Khan.

109
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,740
Chaka Khan?

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,430
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,870
Have we forgotten that the use of marijuana is illegal?

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,500
I have glaucoma.

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,950
I get nervous in crowds.

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,270
Herpes.

115
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,430
Then you won't mind if I search your bike, now, would you?

116
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,910
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,790
Clmate, gringo. Get up.

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,390
Man, you guys even real cops? You look like the kids on Halloween.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,030
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,510
I know, right? I know.

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,340
It's hilarious.

122
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,910
So why don't you show us a little respect?

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,470
Fuck you, pig- Hey.

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,140
You want me to beat your dick off?

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,310
You want to beat my dick off?

126
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,230
I'll beat your dick off with both hands. What's up? Let's go.

127
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,270
That's weird, man. SCHMIDT: I think what he was trying to say was,

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,920
he's going to punch you so many times around the genital area

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,150
that your dick's just going to fall off.

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,550
Why do you have salt in your...

131
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,550
That's actual drugs. Oh, my God.

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,270
Get on the ground! Hey!

133
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,990
- Come here now! - What do I do?

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,790
- Chase someone! - Chase someone?

135
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,670
Are you leaving your bike here?

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,270
Okay. All right.

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,990
Don't run from me! You're making it worse for yourself!

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,390
No! Get out of the way!

139
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,750
Stop!

140
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm going to shoot you if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

141
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,590
Hey! Come here!

142
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,140
I'm not playing any more! I'm so not kidding!

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,110
I got him. I got him.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,430
Freeze! Freeze!

145
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,630
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

146
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,350
That's it! Come here!

147
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,870
Freeze! Stop it!

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,230
You're a pussy!

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,120
You got the right to... Give me that! You got the right to...

150
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,550
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

151
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,230
Oh, my elbow.

152
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,270
You got nothing. How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

153
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,230
Hey! Hey! How's it feel? How's it feel now?

154
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,950
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

155
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,470
We got one! I got him!

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,230
Yes! Yes!

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,020
What's up?

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,460
Drop my nuts on your motherfucking forehead!

162
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,830
That's right. Fuck you, park!

163

We arrest people now! What up, park?

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,390
What's up? What's up? What up, park? Who wants one?

165
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,510
Congratulations on the bust, boys. It sounds great.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,270
- Thank you, Cinnamon. - Are those new?

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,860
The department was forced to drop the charges

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,670
because you forgot to read him his Miranda rights.

169
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,030
What possible reason is there for not doing the only thing

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,310
you have to do when arresting someone?

171
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,310
I did read him his right... I did a version of that.

172
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,020
Do you even know the Miranda rights? Yes.

173
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,470
Let's hear them, then.

174
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,590
You got a lot of stuff to do.

175
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,630
No, go ahead. You going anywhere, Schmidt?

176
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,830
We got time.

177
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,390
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

178
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,750
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences, followed by a question,

179
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,390
for a total of 57 words.

180
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with, "You have the right to remain silent."

181
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,830
I know you've heard this before. And then,

182
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,430
I think it sounds something like...

183
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,800
"You have the right to an attorney." Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

184
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,470
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

185
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,590
Did you say that you have the right to be an attorney?

186
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,300
You do have the right to be an attorney, if you want to.

187
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,510
Where were you?

188
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,110
I was chasing my perp, sir.

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,030
And how did that go for you?

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,670
Honestly, he did get away,

191
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,590
and he threw me down pretty hard.

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,870
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

193
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,070
Can I see that?

194
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,630
Yeah, actually, it hurts 'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

195
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,150
Wow.

196
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,820
Fortunately for you two,

197
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,670
we're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s

198
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,430
and revamping it for modern times.

199
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,790
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

200
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,070
lack creativity and are completely out of ideas,

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,940
so all they do now is recycle shit from the past

202
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,870
and expect us all not to notice.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,190
One of these programs involves the use of young,

204
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,990
immature-seeming officers.

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,650
Sir, are you saying that you're going to send us into, like,

206
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,590
a child sex slavery ring or something?

207
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,270
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

208
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,110
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

209
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,270
I think you idiots are perfect.

210
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,830
You're officially transferred.

211
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,430
All right. Yeah. That's great.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,230
Where should we report to?

213
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,950
Down on Jump Street.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,910
37 Jump Street.

215
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,110
No, that doesn't sound right.

216
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,420
Is it...

217
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,230
This has got to be a joke.

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,150
This is it.

219
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,470
Aroma of Christ Church?

220
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,590


221
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,510
How's it going?

222
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,710
This place is weird.

223
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,540
Everybody comfortable?

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,310
Yeah.

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,190
Get your motherfucking ass up when I'm talking!

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,470
You will be going undercover as high school students.

227
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,550
You are here simply because you look young.

228
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,670
You some Justin Beaver,

229
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,590
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

230
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,110
Captain Sassy.

231
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,870
I know what you're thinking,

232
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,580
"Angry Black Captain."

233
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,270
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,710
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,020
I'm black.

236
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,230
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

237
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,870
And sometimes I get angry.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,510
So suck a dick!

239
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,750
What I'm trying to show you is,

240
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,950
embrace your stereotypes.

241
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,030
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

242
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,710
And he's probably a dummy.

243
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,950
And then this guy.

244
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,070
He's short and insecure.

245
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,710
And he's probably good with money.

246
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,120
You are good with money. What the fuck?

247
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,630
Didn't somebody tell you guys this was an undercover unit?

248
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,230
I don't... I actually didn't...

249
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,540
I didn't get a letter or anything.

250
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,350
Yeah, like, a start time... With a dress code or anything like that.

251
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,190
Teenage the fuck up!

252
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,590
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

253
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,350
Do not get expelled.

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,470
Nobody in the system knows you're here. All right? Nobody.

255
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,150
You get kicked out of school,

256
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,910
your monkey ass is getting kicked out of Jump Street.

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,710
Rule number two Burns.

258
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,390
Do not have sexual relations with students or teachers, sir.

259
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,110
You hear that? That's you.

260
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,910
Don't do it, man. Why...

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,630
Keep that dirty dick in your pants. Dirty?

262
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,390
Don't fuck no students.

263
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,070
Don't fuck no teachers.

264
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,630
Sir, I know we come off as a couple of lady-killers,

265
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,870
but I promise you we will be super professional on the job.

266
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,420
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties.

267
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,750
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

268
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,190
I was talking to your partner over here.

269
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,230
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

270
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,270
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

271
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,500
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

272
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,070
I'm talking to you. Cool.

273
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,690
Now, you two sons of bitches, in my office now.

274
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,950
Right now!

275
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,590
Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.

276
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,270
So I bought these,

277
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,590
which is all anybody seems to be talking about right now.

278
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,270
Cheers.

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,670
It's a new synthetic drug.

280
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,910
Goes by the street name H.F.S.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,950
Holy fucking shit.

282
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,630
Holy...

283
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,790
They put this on the Internet for everybody to see?

284
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,550
They're teenagers, man. They're really stupid.

285
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,470
So you should blend right in.

286
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,590


287
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,350


288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,310


289
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,830
Jessica, will you go to prom with me? But I already know the answer. It's yes.

290
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,270


291
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,830
Whoo!

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,710
I could watch this kid all day.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,390
Man, this kid rules.

294
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,830
Ruled.

295
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,150
His parents found him OD'd in his room a few days ago.

296
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,550
He's dead.

297
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,190
Whatever he took, the lab has never seen it before.

298
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,350
And as you can see, this kid is white.

299
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,190
That means people actually give a shit.

300
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,230
Sir, I just want to throw out to you that I would give a shit if he was black.

301
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,070
Right now, H.F.S. is contained right there at Sagan High.

302
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,430
Now, once this drug breaks containment, it goes viral in a few days.

303
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,230
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

304
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

305
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,430
like photography and drama.

306
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,900
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,750
Find out who's slinging this shit.

308
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,070
Schmidt, says you were a virgin

309
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,710
through high school. It says that?

310
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,550
No. I just assumed it,

311
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,930
due to your many years on the honor roll and your membership to the juggling squad.

312
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,350
It's the Juggling Society, but it's fine. It's fine.

313
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,790
They're stealing equipment from the chemistry lab.

314
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,030
That's what we think they're cooking the dope with.

315
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,620
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

316
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,710
Here's your new identities, all right?

317
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,630
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

318
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,470
The mission is this.

319
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,980
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

320
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,910
We get to be brothers?

321
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,070
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

322
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,800
But if we find the supplier first, we don't have to worry about the dealers.

323
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,630
God damn. Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

324
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,510


325
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,670
Hey, Korean Jesus.

326
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,430
I don't know if you only cater to Korean Christians

327
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,710
or if you even exist. No offense.

328
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,190
I just...

329
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,990
I'm really freaked out about going back to high school.

330
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,470
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

331
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,470
I know we haven't made our first arrest, or maybe I'm not the best cop.

332
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,150
Korean Jesus, I just really don't want to fuck this up.

333
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,790
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

334
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,470
The end?

335
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,950
I don't really know how to end a prayer. The end?

336
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,180
Yeah.

337
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,870
Hey! Hey!

338
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,310
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

339
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,820
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

340
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,470
With Korean shit.

341
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,040
You two get to your mama house ASAP. What?

342
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,780
You're teenagers now, all right?

343
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,070
You two are staying at Schmidt's parents' house

344
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,870
for the duration of this assignment.

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,350
Oh, fuck me.

346
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,030
This house is adorable.

347
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,750
My baby's home! Come here.

348
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,470
You will always be my infant angel baby child.

349
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,270
There's my guy.

350
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,950
It's great to see you guys.

351
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,390
Hey. Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

352
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,590
Oh, my God. Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

353
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,830
This is unbelievable. Well, yeah.

354
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,110
I guess I did. It's gorgeous!

355
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,710
So are you.

356
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,240
Honey, listen, I want to tell you, we did blow up the air mattress in your room

357
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,540
'cause we're kind of using that as a workout area,

358
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,270
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

359
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,070
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please. No, no.

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,030
Don't touch that. We just brought it back from Sedona.

361
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,630
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

362
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,150
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

363
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,470
and you guys haven't moved on. Rid of it?

364
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,070
If we take it down, we have to stop bragging about you.

365
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,430
I look like Fred Savage from The Wonder Years,

366
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,390
but completely naked, wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

367
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,470
That is a great picture, Morton. Mmm-hmm.

368
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,870
You look like a young Jay Leno.

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,590
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

370
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,690
Umm...

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,980
No.

372
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,790
I remember. You know why?

373
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,630
Because I've told it to a therapist about 8,000 times.

374
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,030
I mean, this is a fourth grade

375
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,080
participation medal for soccer.

376
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,710
It's literally a medal for sucking.

377
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,710
No, that is a medal for trying. Yes.

378
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,670
Let me tell you something. This guy was always a great tryer.

379
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,870
That must be Phyllis. She is just dying to see you.

380
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,010
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here? She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

381
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,070
I told you, it's an undercover assignment. It's super secretive.

382
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,470
"Undercover." That's so cute.

383
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,230
I'm going upstairs. Okay, honey. I want you to know

384
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,710
we are so glad you're here. Okay.

385
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,750
That's great. Thank you.

386
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,110
All right. Where is he? He's upstairs.

387
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,990
He just needs to take a little rest, and then he's dying to see you, too.

388
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,360
Bye-bye. I baked muffins!

389
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,830
If you don't know your identity, we're screwed tomorrow.

390
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,180
You got to study this stuff.

391
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,160
Forget those identities. They're bullshit. They said I was held back a year.

392
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,950
You were. You were held back two years.

393
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,120
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

394
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,470
Fuck! Socks don't match.

395
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,950
I got to start all over.

396
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,070
It's the first day of school, dude. I got to look awesome.

397
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,140


398
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,950
You know, back in the day, you were super popular,

399
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,070
and I wasn't as much.

400
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,380


401
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,340
We didn't really get along in high school.

402
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,470
You don't think that's going to happen again, do you?

403
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,500
No. Come on, man. We're adults now. We're best buds.

404
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,990
It's definitely not going to happen again.

405
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,630
We're good. Cool.

406
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,670
Beautiful day out there, boys.

407
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,870
Just shut up.

408
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,710
"Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law."

409
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,990
"You have the right to an attorney."

410
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,110
"If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed..."

411
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,590
Dude, do you still not know the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

412
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,670
Come on, man. They always cutaway on TV before they finish them.

413
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,030
All right, let's do it.

414
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

415
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,980
What are you doing?

416
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,030
What? What are you talking about? Are you two-strapping?

417
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,730
My backpack? Yeah. Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

418
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,590
You got to one-strap it.

419
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,270
Seriously, I would no-strap it if that would even be possible.

420
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,710
Okay, what makes you the expert?

421
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,140
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

422
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,190
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

423
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,790
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School, by Jenko.

424
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,230
One, don't try hard at anything.

425
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,630
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

426
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,630
Three, be handsome.

427
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,950
Four, if anyone steps to you on the first day of school,

428
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,070
you punch them directly in the face.

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,540
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

430
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,860
Shit.

431
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,350
All right, but just don't be driving it like teenagers,

432
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,270
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

433
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,910
We would never.

434
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,230
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,750
Hey, you ready? Go!

436
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,230
That was awesome! That was amazing.

437
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,430
Was I flying? That was amazing.

438
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,790
All right, do mine, do mine.

439
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
Okay, ready? Here I go. Yeah, yeah.

440
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,110
You Okay?

441
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,910
I think I shit my pants.

442
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,580
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

443
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,490
It'll make us look cool. That's awesome.

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,940
Dude?

445
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,920
Everybody's two-strapping it. Just stay with the one-strap.

446
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,870
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

447
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,590
What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

448
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,230
What are you doing? You're supposed to use two straps.

449
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,890
One strap is peer pressure. No. No. You're fucking up right now.

450
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,910
Okay, those are Goths.

451
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,990
Those are nerds.

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,430
I don't know what they are.

453
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,670
What the fuck are those things?

454
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,150
I'm so confused right now.

455
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,820
Whoa.

456
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,120
Hi. Hey.

457
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,950
Hey. Good morning.

458
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,430
Hey, yo. Hey.

459
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,550
Is that your car? Yeah.

460
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,230
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

461
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,030
No, try, like, seven.

462
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,070
What about you? Biodiesel, dawg.

463
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,500
Smells like egg rolls.

464
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,390
Yeah, it does. Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

465
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,690
But we try to ride bikes when we can. Global crisis and whatnot.

466
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,650
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

467
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,450
You don't care about the environment? That's kind of fucked up, man.

468
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,110
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

469
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,910
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

470
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,590
Look at him. He's trying.

471
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,510
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

472
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,470
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

473
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,790
Look at him. Look at the nerd. Who you calling a nerd, man?

474
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,190
I'm sorry. What...

475
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,950
Shit! Shit, dude.

476
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,110
Are you okay, man? Hey, what the hell? Are you serious?

477
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,870
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

478
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,830
You punched me because I'm gay? What?

479
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,630
No. Oh, Come on.

480
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,860
That's not cool, man.

481
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,180
That is really insensitive.

482
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,590
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

483
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,810
I punched him, and then he happened to turn out to be gay afterwards.

484
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,950
I was gay when you punched me! In a weird way,

485
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,340
it might have been homophobic not to punch you

486
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,270
just because you were gay. Right.

487
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,350
You punched a little gay black kid in the face,

488
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,790
and it's not even second period. How do you explain that?

489
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,590
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

490
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,190
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

491
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,030
A kid died the other day from drugs,

492
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,470
and nobody, including me, is doing anything about it.

493
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,950
That's weird, guys.

494
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,020
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

495
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,350
causing trouble in my school.

496
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,270
I am one more black gay kid getting punched in the face

497
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,770
away from a nervous breakdown. Do I make myself clear?

498
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,110
You guys cross my line again,

499
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,690
and you walk into this office, I'm going to expel you. You got me?

500
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,110
All right, let's do this. Which one of you is Doug?

501
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,590
Let's do that again and pretend you guys aren't weird.

502
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,110
Which one of you is named Doug?

503
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,270
No, dude, I'm Brad. Okay, good.

504
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,590
So that means your name is Doug, son.

505
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,150
Yeah, I'm Doug. Great.

506
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,590
Here are your class schedules.

507
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,270
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you for the brainy type.

508
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,070
I wouldn't. But you as a drama geek, far less surprising.

509
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,550
Thank you.

510
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,230
Now we have the wrong identities, you dumb-ass.

511
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,470
I'm in drama. I suck at drama. It's girly and embarrassing.

512
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,940
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

513
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,350
I can fake my way through band practice and app chemistry for a few weeks.

514
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,710
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry. And, no, you can't,

515
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,710
because you don't even know what it's actually fucking called!

516
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,440
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes, and I'm going to go to yours.

517
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,610
Okay, now, chemistry's the one with the shapes and shit, right?

518
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,020
Fuck.

519
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,790
So, we are going to hold auditions for the Peter Pan part today.

520
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,150
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

521
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,260
When I was a young actor just starting out in New York state,

522
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,790
Albany, to be exact,

523
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,090
I booked a local television commercial... Hey.

524
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,150
...In which I had to play a young man...

525
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,150
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

526
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,270
So are you saying if he wasn't talented, it would be less sad?

527
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,870
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

528
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,350
I was just busting your balls.

529
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,350
Okay. Good.

530
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,590
I remember, one time, doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

531
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,350
and we were having so much fun.

532
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,670
And then I realized that she was dead.

533
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,790
I remember one summer...

534
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,870
Do kids still do this stuff?

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,750
Even after what happened to him?

536
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,350
Everyone's saying that Billiam had a heart murmur.

537
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,510
Pretty much everyone I know does it, but it's not my thing.

538
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,870
It's not really my thing, either,

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,750
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

540
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,750
Who would he call if he wanted it?

541
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,990
Well, you can tell your friend

542
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,380
that if he really wanted it,

543
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,470
it's not so hard to find.

544
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,990
When to take it. He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

545
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,870
Drugs are bad.

546
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,150
But they can have their place in the life of a professional actor.

547
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,190
Thank you. Oh, you're welcome.

548
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,230
Notice the distinction. I said "professional actor."

549
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,390


550
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,750
New person. Mr. Texty Texty.

551
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,710
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

552
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,270
let's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

553
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,230
You look like you might have a little Peter inside of you.

554
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,790
Uh, I can't. I'm fine just being a tree or something.

555
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,030
Doug, you never won't know

556
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,590
what you can't achieve before you don't achieve it.

557
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,790
My point is,

558
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,670
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

559
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,590
Yeah, sure.

560
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,750
My favorite molecule is water.

561
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,110
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter.

562
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,750
Its solid form floats on its liquid form, which makes it far outside the norm.

563
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,120
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars, and we use it to wash our cars.

564
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,020
H2O.

565
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,790
H2O. H2O.

566
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,110
H2O It's okay. Thank you.

567
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,950
Thank you, Zack. Whoo! So good.

568
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,830
All right, anybody else for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

569
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,550
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

570
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,900
A What?

571
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

572
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,430
What is your name? Brad?

573
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,390
Brad. Yes, ma'am. Wow. Look at you,

574
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,110
Brad. Big.

575
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Uh...

576
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,670
What is a pop Quiznos?

577
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,160
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

578
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,330
Today's quiz is on... You look really old.

579
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,510
Were you held back or something or... No. You look super young.

580
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,470
Were you held forward?

581
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,630
I went to school in France, so...

582
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,170
And they do, like, two extra years of middle school there. It's so lame.

583
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,070
French, the language of love.

584
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,790
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

585
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,820
Hey.

586
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,350
Good luck.

587
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,410


588
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,330
กำ I've gotta crow

589
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,330


590
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,620
กำ I'm just the cleverest... กำ

591
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,060
Okay.

592
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,380
Um...

593
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,590
Maybe try one cooler.

594
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,950
And faster.

595
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,550
And louder. And better.

596
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,390
And less insecure and more just cool.

597
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,790


598
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,990
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

599
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,220
I'm going to run outside,

600
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,110
and I'm going to utilize those, and I'm going to come back.

601
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,310


602
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,260


603
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,310


604
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,380
It's such bullshit.

605
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,460
Oh.

606
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,950
Wow. You're fast.

607
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,790
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

608
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,190
Let me check out your chest.

609
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,950
Check out your test... Let me...

610
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,590
Let me grade your quiz.

611
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,710


612
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,990
Um, can I go take a dump?

613
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,350
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

614
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,150
Oh. We have this "hurry back" rule,

615
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,280
so if you're not back in six minutes, I have to send you to the principal.

616
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,790
Rules are rules, so,

617
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,030
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

618
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,870
Which way is yearbook? I don't know.

619
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,990
Is it this way? I don't know!

620
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,060
Yo. Hey.

621
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,140
You guys, huh?

622
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,520
Um...

623
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,590
That was a total mix-up, what happened earlier.

624
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,790
Yeah. He feels awful. He feels...

625
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,710
Totally, very nervous.

626
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,110
You're the dealer?

627
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,230
You're the dealer guy? Is that you?

628
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,950
Yep.

629
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,150
So do you make the stuff or...

630
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,990
Do I look like a fucking scientist? No, I just sell it.

631
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,620
Yeah, he just sells it Come on. Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

632
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,670
I meant I just... How many you guys want?

633
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,390
20 bucks a pop.

634
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,390
One each? One pop each of drugs.

635
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,990
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

636
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,310
Whoa!

637
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,230
Dude, come on. No! Maybe you're a narc.

638
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,190
You know who calls people narcs?

639
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,830
Narcs, narc.

640
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,150
First of all, your argument kind of just collapsed on itself,

641
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,910
because if you call us narcs,

642
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,750
if narcs call people narcs, and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

643
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,670
'Cause you just said that. They call people...

644
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,070
Look, I don't have time for this shit. You guys want to do this or not?

645
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,220
Jesus. Yes.

646
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,190
Yes, yes. No problem.

647
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,830
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

648
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,980
I'm sorry. What?

649
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,120
We were going to take it home. I gotta go back to class,

650
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,580
is the only thing. I was thinking that I was going to go home,

651
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,150
maybe turn down the lights,

652
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,630
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

653
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,470
I was going to take it, and then masturbate later.

654
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,390
Okay, I'm not asking. Take it now or get the fuck out.

655
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,430
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page by lunch.

656
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,580
Yeah?

657
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,710
Yeah, no, it's all good.

658
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,480
I love doing drugs at school. I'll just take the drugs right here,

659
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,150
in our mouths.

660
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,910
There you go. That's it.

661
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,860
Mmm. Mmm.

662
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,510
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

663
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,980
Have fun.

664
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,790
You got to pull the trigger! Okay.

665
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,470
You got to pull the trigger!

666
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,350
We got to throw up, man. I can't.

667
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,510
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died. We got to throw up.

668
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,270
Just think of something gross. Think of something gross.

669
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,000
You fucking think of something. Okay, all right, all right.

670
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,590
Your grandma's vagina, and there's a dick going into it.

671
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,510
What the fuck are you saying? I don't know! I'm just trying!

672
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,310
I'm trying my best! I'm just trying! Fuck! Come on, man!

673
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,270
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths.

674
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,900
No! Yeah.

675
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,140
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

676
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,930
Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die? Okay, fine!

677
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,710
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

678
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,070
What are you doing? Are you trying to find my G-spot?

679
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,150
Just stick it in! I don't know. I've never done this before!

680
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,350
Just stick it in! Go!

681
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,390
Cut your fucking fingernails!

682
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,620
Oh, God!

683
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,750
Is it me?

684
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,150
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,350
I just can't sometimes.

686
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,150
Think we're going to be fine. I don't feel anything.

687
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,670
Me, neither.

688
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,350
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

689
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,770
You got a pass for running around the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

690
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,550
Pass, in your hand.

691
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,780
Hello.

692
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,560
Oh, damn. You guys are late.

693
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,390
Now I'm going to have to take you to the principal's office.

694
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,590
No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry. Come on, please.

695
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,710
You have exceptional muscle tone there, young man.

696
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,270
When'd you go through puberty? Like, at seven or something?

697
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,590
You look like you're in your mid-20s, for crying out loud.

698
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,470
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

699
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,630
I read your file.

700
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,830
You got a lot of something special going on there, young man.

701
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,070
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

702
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,990
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that again, all right?

703
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,220
I consider that a threat.

704
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,070
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

705
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,010
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

706
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,820
That's Brad.

707
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,430
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

708
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,310
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

709
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,670
the track star, and this is Brad, the science prodigy.

710
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,310
He's really fast.

711
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,070


712
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,020
Is this funny to you guys?

713
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,830


714
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,040
So you're Doug.

715
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,540
You're Doug. You're Doug.

716
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,190
Here's the deal.

717
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,110
My track team is full of physically incapable rejects.

718
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,270
I mean, if I wasn't the coach, I'd be laughing my ass off

719
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,710
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

720
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,750
so I need you.

721
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,150
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

722
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,350
Understand?

723
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,540
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400 at today's track meet.

724
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,230
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

725
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,350
Don't blow on me, son.

726
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,190
I haven't trained.

727
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,910
Guys, don't make me take you to the principal's office.

728
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,070
Do we have a deal?

729
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,870
Yes.

730
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,070
Nice.

731
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,710
I don't like that. Put your tongue back in your mouth.

732
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,430
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it.

733
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,230
What are you doing? Stop it.

734
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,590
Actually, that's not bad.

735
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,590
All right, here you go.

736
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,470
Are you guys on drugs?

737
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,220
Okay.

738
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,990
One particle of Unobtainium has a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

739
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,610
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner into a radioactive spider.

740
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,430
Fuck you, science!

741
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,990


742
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,710
All right, all right, we're good. Whoo!

743
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,710
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

744
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,470
We're good, baby. Whoo!

745
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,950
Good work. Hit that shit.

746
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:08,560


747
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,730
กำ I've gotta crow

748
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,080
กำ I'm just the cleverest fellow

749
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,310


750
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,400


751
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,020
กำ 'Twas ever my fortune to know

752
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:18,880
กำ I taught a trick to my shadow

753
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,110


754
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
กำ To stick to the tip of my toe

755
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,230


756
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,000
กำ I've gotta crow

757
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,350


758
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,490


759
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,210
กำ I've gotta

760
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,290


761
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,420
กำ Crow! กำ

762
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,150
Christoph, did you feel that?

763
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,670
Who are you?

764
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,550
Welcome aboard, Peter.

765
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,830


766
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,670
Whoo! No, keep it going!

767
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,910
Keep it going. That was so tight!

768
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,230
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

769
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,990
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

770
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,790
All right! Yeah!

771
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,190
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

772
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,350
I know y'all seen this shit before. I know you've seen this shit before.

773
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,070
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

774
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,030
You're looking amped!

775
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,380
Here we go.

776
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,790
Here we go! Here we go!

777
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,060
Hey, pick it up!

778
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,230
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up. What are you doing?

779
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,340
What are you doing? Pick it...

780
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,590
What? McQuaid!

781
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,110
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

782
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,990
Come on!

783
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,750
McQuaid!

784
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,950
Run that way!

785
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,150
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

786
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,110
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

787
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,510
Let's go! Come on!

788
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,150
Oh, my God.

789
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,380
No, no.

790
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,270
No, stop.

791
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,830
Come here. Come here.

792
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,350
Don't make a...

793
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,910
That is a baton penis.

794
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,910


795
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,510
Oh, speak of the devil!

796
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,270
Dude, that was awesome how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

797
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,590
Organized sports are so fascist. It makes me sick.

798
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,550
That's just what I do.

799
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,590
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

800
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,950
I don't get this school.

801
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,430
That was awesome.

802
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,110
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

803
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,590
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

804
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,470
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

805
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,590
Okay, Captain, look, the dealers are the popular kids,

806
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,870
but they're not normal popular.

807
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,420
They're these crunchy granola dudes that have convinced everyone

808
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,830
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

809
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,990
It's backwards and unnatural, and it's got to be stopped.

810
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,790
Lead dealer, Eric Moison. Alpha dog.

811
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,990
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

812
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,260
Did the AIDS run this year.

813
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,910
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

814
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,350
and he totally gets me.

815
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,710
Who put this together? Are you autistic?

816
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,670
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

817
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,110
the yarn actually indicates... We're compiling a list

818
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,230
of suspicious types at school. The users are here.

819
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,620
This kid was actually talking to a tree this morning.

820
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,780
Cut the bullshit!

821
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,460
I want to know who's the supplier.

822
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,470
We don't know. That's why there's a question mark on his face.

823
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,710
That's not the way his face looks. That's just a question mark.

824
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,430
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

825
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,700
Simple.

826
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,990
Sounds like you guys really cracked the whole case.

827
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,550
Great job. You guys are on fire.

828
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,060
So proud. Like you could do any better?

829
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,910
We just brought down a group of wannabe thugs

830
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,340
stripping down cars in the Garfield High metal shop.

831
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,560
What? Meanwhile, you two were standing around

832
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,510
finger-popping each other's assholes.

833
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,190
We're not finger-popping each other's assholes.

834
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,790
What we're doing is getting shit done.

835
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,260
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

836
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,990
I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech

837
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,390
drug manufacturing ring in the chemistry classroom.

838
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,150


839
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,110
Password! Open the door!

840
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,150
You have to say the password. I'm sorry. What?

841
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,630
What are you...

842
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,380
Geez.

843
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,230
What are y'all doing? How'd you get a key in here?

844
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,550
Ms. Griggs gave us one so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

845
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,990
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

846
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,630
Let me see. You dealing drugs? No.

847
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,550
It's just a card game. It's, like, a hybrid card game.

848
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,470
See? They open up. Battle Brawlers.

849
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,390
You're not doing anything illegal? No.

850
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,030
What are you doing in here? I'm here to study.

851
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,630
Good. You could use it. You're pretty far behind, so...

852
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,790
You're behind. I'm ahead.

853
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,070
I know everything. Really?

854
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,910
What's a covalent bond?

855
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,990
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

856
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,540
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry.

857
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,350
I just... I don't think you know everything.

858
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,700
I know everything.

859
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,460
Okay.

860
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,270
What kind of bullshit do they say about a covalent bond in this school?

861
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,670
They say it's when two atoms share both their electrons.

862
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,350
It helps them to stick together.

863
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,630
I could help you out if you want, tutor you for the test.

864
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,740
What are you doing with all those phones anyway?

865
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,870
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones to try and save for college.

866
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,710
You know, I switch their wireless carriers, get them restricted apps.

867
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,990
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

868
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,950
No, no, I can't install a spyware to remotely monitor calls

869
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,430
or anything that the mic picks up.

870
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,920
I can't do that at all. Wait, you can't do it?

871
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,550
No, I can't.

872
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,710
Is he being sarcastic? I don't know.

873
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,100
So you can.

874
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,270
Liking comic books is popular.

875
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,110
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

876
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,360
If I was just born 10 years later, I would have been the coolest person ever.

877
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,350
I know. It's bullshit.

878
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,910
You know what?

879
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,300
I totally know the cause.

880
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,830
Glee. Fuck you, Glee.

881
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,830
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

882
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,030
I might become popular. I might get in with the popular kids.

883
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,390
We just have to do something wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

884
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,630
You saying we should throw a party?

885
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,590
I'll invite Molly, and then Molly will invite Eric,

886
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,710
and that'll be the quickest way for me to bro down with him.

887
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,180
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated the cool kids' group?

888
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,630
I think it would be better if you get in

889
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,270
with the nerdy kids and see what's going on over there.

890
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,830
That'd be the best thing for the case.

891
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,990
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

892
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,510
Hello? Hey. Is this Molly?

893
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,110
Speaking.

894
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,670
Hey. It's Schmidt.

895
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,550
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

896
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,910
Oh. Hey, man.

897
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,950
It's so weird that you're calling me.

898
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,150
I pretty much text except for when a random old relative calls.

899
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,030
Uh I was just calling 'cause we're costarring in this play together,

900
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,220
- and... - Hello?

901
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,500
Mom, get off the phone!

902
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,630
Oh. Sorry, Doug,

903
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,390
my teen son. Mom!

904
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,830
I love you, honey, Dougie Doug, Douglas McQuaid.

905
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,750
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

906
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,430
I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.

907
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,620
Ugh! She just, like, smothers me with affection and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

908
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,950
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

909
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,460
Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom still packs a lunch for me every day.

910
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,790
There was this one month where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

911
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,670
The doctor thought I was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.

912
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,710
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

913
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,580
Yeah, because you already had one.

914
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,190
Exactly. I already had one.

915
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,990
And you don't need two vaginas. You just don't.

916
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,110
Although you could use one as a coin purse.

917
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,670
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

918
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,030
Oh, wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

919
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,950
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy the day he bailed on us.

920
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,390
I'm just fucking with you.

921
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,470
That is a weird joke.

922
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,190
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

923
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,870
No, he did walk out on us, though. Oh.

924
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,860
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

925
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,020
Just broken dreams.

926
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,430
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say,

927
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,620
well, uh,

928
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,110
that there are some good guys out there,

929
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,790
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

930
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,180
taint your memory.

931
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,790
Oh, my God.

932
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,710
Are you getting choked up? I'm sorry if I made you upset.

933
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,630
No, it's just, you know, I don't like when guys are mean to girls.

934
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,070
Yeah. Well, thanks.

935
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,550
Normal transition here.

936
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,910
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend. You should come!

937
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,830
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

938
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,070
Do you mind if I just put, like, a posting on Facebook?

939
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,150
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

940
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,870
I should call you back.

941
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,190
Well, all right, I'll see you at school. You're a great person.

942
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,230
Bye-bye. Bye, Bye.

943
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,870
What the fuck are you...

944
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,030
Are y'all throwing a party?

945
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,970
What? There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

946
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,590
And if any of my officers

947
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,750
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

948
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,150
they'll find theyself in prison

949
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,550
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

950
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,870
and me shitting down that snorkel.

951
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,710
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

952
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,760
You're the best. You are the best.

953
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,430
Oh, my God. We love you.

954
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,620
Enjoy the vineyard. You boys be good, now.

955
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,990
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

956
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,470
Bye!

957
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,040
"We love you"? What are you doing? Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

958
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,470
I'm in character. Shut up. It's weird.

959
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,710
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

960
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,950
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

961
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,310
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

962
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,220


963
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,990
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

964
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,150
Oh, no.

965
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,940


966
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,950
We got a pound of coke.

967
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,390
We're trying to show them a good time, not ruin their fucking lives.

968
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,590
Pound of marijuana?

969
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,670
Best party ever. Boo-yah!

970
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,390


971
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,260


972
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,470
To a brilliant idea

973
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,430
from my brilliant brother

974
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,550
that I love so very much.

975
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,270
And this is going to fucking rock.

976
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,190
Cheers, man. Cheers.

977
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,710
Who invited you guys? I did!

978
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,780
The party's here!

979
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,030
What's up, Zack? Hey, buddy.

980
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,150
What's up, Roman?

981
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,630
This is crazy. This is, like, the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

982
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,390
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

983
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,990
Do we have enough chips?

984
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,990
Is this playlist too dance-y?

985
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,220
Feels too dance-y. Too dance-y?

986
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,710
What are you talking about? I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

987
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

988
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,850
That's my mom's Kokopelli vase. I got it, I got it.

989
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,390
Doug, Doug, hey!

990
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,630
Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.

991
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,860
Such a bad joke.

992
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,070
Terrible, terrible.

993
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,300
You guys know each other, right? Yeah.

994
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,240
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric. Wait for the signal.

995
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,230
And then you come in here looking like a rock-solid 10.

996
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,430
What?

997
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,390
What's up, man, how you doing?

998
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,270
Eco Suave.

999
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,820
Whoa.

1000
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,070
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

1001
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,350
Very Native American.

1002
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,190
Yeah, our parents are actually

1003
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,750
really into Native American... Let's rock and roll.

1004
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,030
- Sorry. - What are y'all doing?

1005
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,230
Come on. Did you guys even see Eric?

1006
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,350
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

1007
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,590
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

1008
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,430
Yo, this is butt. There's, like, no hot dudes here.

1009
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,270
Man, let's bounce. We're out of here, man.

1010
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,190
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here, you just got here.

1011
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,430
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

1012
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,900
Okay, boys, come on, we did it, we can do this, just go,

1013
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,510
just go as fast as you possibly can.

1014
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,250
Taking out the SIM card. Taking out the SIM card.

1015
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,330


1016
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,290
กำ Taking down Eric with the SIM card information กำ

1017
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,110
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

1018
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,830
Are you drunk? No.

1019
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,270
Have you even been drunk before?

1020
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,910
No, but?Give me this.

1021
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,630
What? Can we get some bitches up in here?

1022
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,510
'Cause it's just boys right now.

1023
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,310
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

1024
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,070
This is my parents' bedroom.

1025
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,510
What the fuck, bro? Some privacy! Shit, shit, shit!

1026
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,030
And that is a really gross three-way.

1027
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,110
But what was the girl in the back doing?

1028
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,190
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

1029
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,030
Cool, yeah.

1030
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,110
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

1031
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,270
but we got to get going. You know how it is, yeah?

1032
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,990
Dude, tell me about it.

1033
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,630
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

1034
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,150
It's extracting right now.

1035
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,150
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

1036
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,990
Read this. "Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

1037
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,230
Shit! It's a bust.

1038
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,630
- Keep it casual. - Yeah.

1039
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,710
Go with the flow, dude. Cool, man.

1040
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,150
I don't like to make plans or whatever. You got it.

1041
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,340
Thank you again, though, man. All right.

1042
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,830
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

1043
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,990
Hey, why you here, Scott?

1044
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,500
What, Kennedy High isn't having any parties tonight?

1045
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,590
No, I heard you guys were partying with some new stuff.

1046
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,190
Wanted to know your hookup so me and my boys can get in on it.

1047
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,190
Got other commitments on that front, so, you know...

1048
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,340
I wasn't asking.

1049
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1050

Take five, take five, man, let me get this. I got this.

1051
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,420
Yeah? You sure? I got this one.

1052
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,350
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

1053
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,350
Don't worry about who I am. I'm worried about it.

1054
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,430
Why? 'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

1055
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,950
This is my temple, this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

1056
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,880
and you're coming in here like an emotional bull in a china shop,

1057
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,470
metaphorically knocking over vases, messing with my crew,

1058
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,630
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott, what, what, what, what, Scott?"

1059
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,070
It's that kind of party? Yeah, dude.

1060
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,150
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

1061
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,230
No, it's getting real. It's getting very real.

1062
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,110
Yeah. It's like seven strangers living in one house. True story.

1063
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,550
You want Real World? Yeah, let's do it, man.

1064
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,230
Come on. What's your Real... Here's Real World.

1065
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,230
What was that? Did you hear that?

1066
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,750
Real enough for you?

1067
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,310
Schmidt. Doug.

1068
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,990
What do I do? Hit him!

1069
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,510
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

1070
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,430
Fight normal.

1071
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,950
Yo, I'm serious.

1072
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,150
Sorry.

1073
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,880
I'll fucking kill you! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

1074
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,270
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

1075
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,060
I kicked him in the nuts.

1076
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,870
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

1077
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,420
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

1078
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,390
I'm gonna fucking kill you! You'll knock over my mom's vase!

1079
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,740
Fuck your mom's vase! Fuck this!

1080
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,860
Oh, shit!

1081

Yeah!

1082
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,830
That's my brother!

1083
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,260
That was insane! You're so cool!

1084
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,230
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

1085
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,700
Oh, shit,

1086
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,710
when did I get stabbed?

1087
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,420
That's awesome.

1088
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,540
Yeah!

1089
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,590
Is that a cop?

1090
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,900
Where?

1091
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,230
No, it's not. Here.

1092

Oh, I'm so glad we're going back to get my phone.

1093
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,910
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

1094
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,430
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

Dude, that was so crazy, man.

1127
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,750
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

1128
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,470
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

1129
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,230
like, all the time, man. I bet you are.

1130
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,740
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

1131
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,830
You, dude, I like you, man.

1132
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,470
How do you feel about making a little extra money?

1133
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,630
Whatever it is, I'm in.

1134
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,980
All right, here's the deal.

1135
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,990
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own, but I only bring in people I like.

1136
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,020
Okay, you do good, maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

1137
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,190
I introduce you to my hookup. How's that sound?

1138
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,470
Cool with me. My man.

1139
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,430
That is my man...

1140
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,390
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

1141
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,150
Um... Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

1142
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,630
Yo, yo.

1143
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,230
Come on!

1144
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,310
I love dick"?

1145
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,910
You think that's funny?

1146
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,470
"Wonder Years douche"?

1147
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,750
What kind of a sick animal draws

1148
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,310
an ejaculating penis into an 8-year-old's mouth?

1149
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,430
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

1150
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,910
You think I don't know that's a dick and balls?

1151
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,910
I know all about dick and balls!

1152
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,350
I partied with Robert Downey Jr. before he got sober,

1153
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,710
when he was really fucked up and a lot of fun!

1154
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,830
You know what? From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

1155
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,190
You're gonna wash the laundry, you're gonna fold it,

1156
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,900
you're gonna do the dishes, you're gonna mow the lawn...

1157
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,270
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

1158
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,150
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

1159
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,950
and I had Zack put this monitoring device in it,

1160
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,190
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing that little prick is up to.

1161
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,190
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

1162
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,230
What?

1163
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,270
What if you had gotten found out? But it worked.

1164
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,230
This is, like, the smartest move I've ever pulled,

1165
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,950
so, I'm sorry, what are you getting mad at me for?

1166
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,950
I'm not getting mad at you. I'm glad you have something to do.

1167
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,500
Good.

Let's tap that wire, huh?

1183
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,110
We were just about to go outside with a bunch of chemicals.

1184
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,990
We were going to test what blows up.

1185
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,350
There's no reason the wiretap is super urgent, right?

1186
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,630
Not that I can think of that would make sense.

Hey. How are you?

How is my favorite police officer? Okay.

1213
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,270
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

1214
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,870
Listen, now is not a really good time.

1215
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,910

Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

1221

Where is my phone? Okay, okay.

Let's go check this out.

1225
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,510
I will straight-up punch you in the face if you do not shut up.

1226
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,690
There is no... A straight-up face punch.

1227
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,900
I swear to God, you're gonna get me killed.

1228
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,390
Hey, yo. That is...

1229
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,110
Shit! She just tried to grab my dick, dude!

1230
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,410
What? You tried to grab his... She tried to grab my junk.

1231
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,030
She was like, "Oh, my God, I have arthritis,"

1232
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,790
"it hurts my hand, I need to grab a handful of that dick."

1233
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,990
I was like, "Get the fuck off me!"

1234
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,430
She said, "I need to grab a handful of that dick"?

1235
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,150
And it felt good, but then it felt weird for a second,

1236
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,310
so I pushed her. We got to get out of here.

1237
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,420
All right, cool, let's get the...

1239
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,520
Ah, so your parents are just cool with having people over whenever?

1240
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,350
Yeah, you know, they're out most nights.

1241
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,150
Pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.

1242
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,950
You're so lucky your parents don't give a shit about you.

1243
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,230

I heard something.

1285
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,310
Hey, can I ask you something? Sit down.

1286
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,590
Okay.

1287
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,150
I just want to make sure that you and Eric are going to be careful

1288
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,860
with whatever it is that you're getting involved in.

1289
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,910
Yeah, I promise we will.

1290
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,380
It would just suck if something bad happened,

1291
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,550
because you're a good guy.

1292
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,830
Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you,

1293
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,750
except girl version.

1294
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,590
You're a girl.

1295
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,430
I am. Yeah.

1296
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,510
That's why I put this dress on,

1297
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,030
to remind you. Exactly.

1298
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,110
Are you excited about the play? Yes.

1299
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,260
Yeah, you were just

1300
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,390
right in there with excitement. Yes.

1301
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,870
No hesitash. I'm very excited.

1302
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,470
Yeah.

1303
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,190
Does that make me a super nerd?

1304
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,910
No, not at all.

1305
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,390
We get to act together.

1306
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,350
What a vagina. He has no chance with her.

1307
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,540
So...

1308
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,860
Shit. Sorry.

1309
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,750
You're on the prom committee. Mmm-hmm.

1310
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,350
Do you think it's going to be fun?

1311
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,740
Did she just bring up prom on her own?

1312
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,630
She did, she just brought up prom. What is she doing?

1313
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,350
I think it's going to be awesome.

1314
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,830
Prom eats a dong. Multiple dongs.

1315
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,980
All right, anyone who says

1316
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,870
they don't care about prom actually secretly does.

1317
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,070
Who we gonna take to the prom? No one's going to prom with us.

1318
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,400
Come on, picture it. You pull up in a white stallion of a limo.

1319
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,110
You got fine-ass honeys with you.

1320
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,350
You're dressed to the nines with your best buds.

1321
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,430
Doves fly out behind you, slow motion.

1322
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,230
Doves. Why doves?

1323
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,950
'Cause doves make you look like a badass, that's why.

1324
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,750
I am pretty skeptical,

1325
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,000
but maybe, if someone fun asked me, I would go.

1326
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,070
Aren't... Isn't... Aren't you and Eric...

1327
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,750
Wouldn't you and Eric go together?

1328
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,710
Not that I know of.

1329
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,850
Uh...

1330
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,190
Would you...

1331
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,310
He's going to choke.

1332
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,080
He always chokes. He's going to choke, wait for it.

1333
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,430
So would...

1334
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,230
So would...

1335
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,990
Would you...

1336
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,940
Mayb...

1337
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,240
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah.

1338
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,390
That is the actual sound of choking.

1339
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,350
I was wondering if you...

1340
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,230
Would you

1341
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,550
maybe want to go

1342
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,670
with me to prom?

1343
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,010
Would you want to go to me... Maybe with me to prom?

1344
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,550
Yes.

1345
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,670
I would love to go to prom with you.

1346
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,470
What? She just said yes!

1347
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,030
Whoa. Wow.

1348
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,190
Good for you, Doug.

1349
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,390
Thank you for asking.

1350
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,750
Put her there, man.

1351
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,750
Just put... Put it right there.

1352
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,310
I'm putting it right there.

1353
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,310
Yeah. There you guys are.

1354
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,950
What's up, my man?

1355
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,020
Hi. How you doing?

1356
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,790
Whazzup? Yeah.

1357
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,230
Doug... Okay, settle an argument.

1358
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,030
You and your brother aren't related, right?

1359
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,340
'Cause you look totally different.

1360
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,750
He's adopted.

1361
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,110
We all suspect from a very lame family.

1362
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,780
Where is he tonight?

1363
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,690
Probably at home with those lame tools he hangs outwith. I don't know.

1364
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,350
You know how Tom Cruise is always pissed off at Rain Man?

1365
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,980
That's like my life, except Brad is really shitty at math.

1366
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,910
Your brother's kind of a dick.

1367
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,510
Well, yeah

1368
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,430
he kind of is, isn't he?

1369
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,790
Don't listen to that.

1370
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,870
I don't give a fuck.

1371
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,390
Dude, Eric is the funniest IM-er.

1372
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,670
Oh, fuck.

1373
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,780
Oh, hey, guys. It's so funny seeing you here.

1374
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,550
How are you? Guess what, I don't care.

1375
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,100
We just closed our third high school operation.

1376
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,110
And check what we found at Kennedy.

1377
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,790
Looks like we're going to have to do your job for you.

1378
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,150
Your drugs is spreading to different schools now, sucker.

1379
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,350
You failed to stop the outbreak, and you have no leads!

1380
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,510
We are running out of time!

1381
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,310
You either find the supplier,

1382
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,900
or I'm gonna jump your asses off Jump Street!

1383
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,950
I totally understand where you're coming from, sir,

1384
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,470
but, look, I heard Eric talking on the phone yesterday

1385
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,710
with somebody that sounded very suspect

1386
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,950
 with a stuffed piata. about meeting up

1387
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,710
Is that a code for sex?

1388
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,270
Piata? Really? Yep.

1389
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,230
Remember that wiretap I put on Eric's phone?

1390
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,030
While you were having the time of your life last night, I was listening.

1391
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,950
I overheard a phone call between Eric and some dude about a piata.

1392
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,190
That's all you heard?

1393
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,860
Yep.

1394
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,030
I am so nervous.

1395
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,190
We are about to premiere in front of the whole school.

1396
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,740
I apologize in advance if I throw up on you onstage.

1397
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,950
Serious question, though.

1398
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,270
How do I look?

1399
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,270
Ravishing.

1400
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,780
Is it too sexy of an outfit?

1401
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,190
Bend the knee a little bit.

1402
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,630
Yep, it is.

1403
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,070
Oh, it's going to be so much easier having you onstage with me.

1404
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,630
I am so happy that I met you.

1405
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,030
You're, like, the only guy that I can really trust.

1406
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,550
Yep. That's me.

1407
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,460
Doug.

1408
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,590
Potassium nitrate.

1409
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,470
Don't hate. It's great.

1410
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,310
It can act as an oxidizer.

1411
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,230
I didn't know that, but now I'm wiser.

1412
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,030
It has a crystalline structure.

1413
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,910
If you can't respect that, you're a butt muncher.

1414
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,870
It's a key ingredient in gunpowder.

1415
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,990
K-NO-three, don't give no grief.

1416
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,310
It can be used to make corned beef.

1417
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,150
It's also known as saltpeter.

1418
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,270
Brad? Shit.

1419
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,030
Where are you going?

1420
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,270
I don't want to look like it's like I'm wearing makeup.

1421
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,070
Right. Doug! HL

1422
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,550
Brad!

1423
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,830
Whoa. What are you wearing?

1424
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,510
Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.

1425
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,790
I need to borrow you.

1426
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,550
Now's not a good time, Brad.

1427
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,390
Mmm-hmm. It's a really good time.

1428
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,630
'Cause my piata is killing me.

1429
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,710
Is that code for a sex thing?

1430
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,430
It's leaving the parking lot.

1431
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,660
Mmm-hmm. Piata?

1432
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,750
Molly, uh,

1433
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,790
I will be right back. I need to help Brad with something, okay?

1434
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,470
I just need to help Brad with something real quick.

1435
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,670
What? No. What? I promise you...

1436
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,510
Do you understand how soon the show is starting?

1437
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,190
I swear to you I will be back in time for curtain.

1438
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,110
I swear. I swear to you. Tell me you understand how soon...

1439
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,150
What? Are you kidding me?

1440
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,910
What did I say? What did I say?

1441
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,870
See? Whose wiretap is working for him now, huh?

1442
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,740
Shit.

1443
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,140
Fuck!

1444
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,630
You told me not to worry about the tickets!

1445
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,870
I thought they made us look cool.

1446
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,100
Cones, cones... Driver's ed car.

1447
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,230
I'm driving. No, you're not.

1448
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,230
I never get to drive. I'm driving this time. Fine! Drive!

1449
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,270
Hey, guys. Just borrowing this for one sec.

1450
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,520
Sure. Go. Go, go, go, go.

1451
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,590
Guys, hey, wait. Guys, you're not on the list.

1452
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,980
Hey, guys, wait! Ah, who cares?

1453
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,750
Holy fucking shit. No fucking way.

1454
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,710
Those are the guys from the park.

1455
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,070
That's just too crazy.

1456
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,470
What do you think's in that thing?

1457
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,230
I don't know, money, drugs.

1458
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,750
They could be a new buyer, or they could be the supplier.

1459
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,710
If it's good, you'll hear from me.

1460
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,310
If it's not good, you'll hear from me about telling you how it's not good.

1461
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,460
Makes sense.

1462
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,990
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah, no worries, man.

1463
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,710
I'll see you guys.

1464
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,070
We definitely got to follow them and find out, though.

1465
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,470
Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!

1466
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,180
What are you doing? If they see us,

1467
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,500
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1468
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,110
What? No! Yes. Stop.

1469
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,790
You pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1470
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,510
No, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

1471
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,910
Why am I automatically blowing you?

1472
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,110
'Cause you're in a fucking Peter Pan costume!

1473
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,260
Okay.

1474
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,500
Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

1475
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,030
Go, go, go. Okay, fine, we'll follow them.

1476
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,110
But we need to be back in 30 minutes for curtain.

1477
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,510
Dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?

1478
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,630
Yeah, you're following too close, dude.

1479
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,430
They're going to make us. Well, if I go too far back,

1480
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,350
it's going to look even more suspicious, so just stop.

1481
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,580
God, just let me do my thing.

1482
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,310
I know what I'm doing.

1483
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,080
Seriously, if you do that again, I'm going to Whac-A-Mole you in the balls.

1484
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,190
Just stay back.

1485
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,160
I could not be more serious. Take your foot off the brake.

1486
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,620
No. I'm not... No. Take your foot off the brake!

1487
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,990
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1488
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,390
Look what you did! Look what you did!

1489
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,390
What the fuck? You non-driving motherfuckers!

1490
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,270
Get the fuck out of the car!

1491
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,930
Oh, fuck. Lock the door! Lock the door!

1492
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,150
What do I do? Go away!

1493
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,460
What are you, a fucking Keebler Elf?

1494
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,990
Get him out of that car!

1495
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,670
No, no! It's fucking ZZ Top!

1496
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,470
No, no! No, no, no! It's fucking ZZ Top!

1497
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,540
Like an angry walrus!

1498
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,240
I stomp the car now! Oh, my God!

1499
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,670
Stomp! Stomp! Oh, shit.

1500
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,030
Okay. Okay. Oh, my God! Stop, dude! Go!

1501
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,510
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1502
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,090
Just let me drive! Stop hitting me!

1503
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,910
Dude, watch out!

1504
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,730
Will you stop front-seat driving? Get your hands off the wheel!

1505
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,590
Man, you just hit two people back there!

1506
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,670
You stop. I'm not... Take your hands off. Shit!

1507
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,590
We're stuck in traffic! Oh, shit.

1508
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,990
Shit, they're coming! They're coming! What?

1509
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,830
Oh, my God, dude.

1510
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,980
What do we do?

1511
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,270
What the... What the...

1512
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,150
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1513
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,630
Oh, shit.

1514
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,070
Oh, shit. What's wrong with you? Run!

1515
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,030
I can't! I'm wearing tights!

1516
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,500
I got skinny jeans on! It's the same fucking thing!

1517
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,550
They're going to make us, or kill us.

1518
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,790
Porsche! Porsche! Police! Get out of the car, douche!

1519
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,470
I'm on a call here, jackass.

1520
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,850
That's right. Go to sleep, bitch. You just got head-butted, motherfucker!

1521
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,190
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Shit.

1522
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,070
Check around for a gun or something, all right?

1523
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,470
Where? Where? There's no glove compartment

1524
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,670
in this shitty-ass car! There's golf balls and this.

1525
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,670
What am I supposed to do with this? I don't know, man!

1526
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,350
I've never been in a freeway chase before!

1527
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,580


1528
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,710


1529
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,990
Watch out! It's going to explode! It's going to go!

1530
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,670
What happened? I don't know.

1531
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,980
It just didn't explode. That's weird.

1532
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,390
Can anybody tell me where my Peter is?

1533
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,520
French! You're not my first choice, but I need you to go on as Peter.

1534
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,710
Oh, gosh. And I've been in character for months now.

1535
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,550
Great. Nobody cares.

1536
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,950
Come on! Another traffic jam?

1537
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,030
I'm sorry I didn't check the traffic report

1538
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,950
before we got in a car chase! Let's go! Come on!

1539
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,310
Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1540
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,870
Shit!

1541
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,870
Are you texting? No, I'm not texting!

1542
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,130
Yes, you are! You're texting! No, I'm not!

1543
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,180
Okay, almost done.

1544
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,780


1545
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,110
"LOL."

1546
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:11,710
I'm driving!

1547
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,630
Why do you always jump over the car like that?

1548
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,910
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1549
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,390
Hi. God damn, you are beautiful.

1550
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,710
Oh. Hi. You are fine as shit.

1551
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,110
Don't worry. Someone will pick you up.

1552
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,030
Wow. Hurry. Just drive.

1553
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,630
Wait. Pick me up?

1554
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,710
They're coming! They're coming! I got an idea.

1555
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,990
Why don't you text them and ask them to stop chasing us?

1556
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,190
Oh, shit!

1557
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,740
He's got a gun!

1558
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,790
I'm going to throw this thing at him!

1559
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,940
Okay, you don't have to narrate everything!

1560
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,430
Just throw it! Okay! Okay, okay!

1561
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,630


1562
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,910


1563
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,430
It's going to explode! Oh, my God! Roll up the windows!

1564
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,660
What the fuck is that going to do? Roll it up!

1565
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,900
I don't fucking care! Just do it! Oh, God!

1566
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,490
Huh?

1567
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,230
I really thought that one was going to explode.

1568
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,820
Oh, shit!

1569
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,630
Look in the glove compartment for a gun.

1570
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,310
What are you talking about? We're in a pink Bug!

1571
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,430
I don't care. Look in the goddamn glove compartment!

1572
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,990
What the hell?

1573
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,230
Shoot Oh, my God. Okay! Okay!

1574
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,190
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

1575
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,390
Can't get a good shot, man! I can't get a good shot!

1576
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,070
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Take the shot!

1577
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,460
Take the shot! Just shoot him! Let's go!

1578
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,910
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1579
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,350
Shoot! Shoot! Shit, shit...

1580
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,910
That's what exploded? Holy shit. That was crazy.

1581
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,430
Why did you shoot for me?

1582
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,150
You weren't shooting, you were choking,

1583
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,750
so I had to save us. I was going to shoot.

1584
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,220
You always do this, every single time. What?

1585
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,990
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.

1586
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,510
If I miss this play, Molly's going to freak out and she's not going to go to prom with me.

1587
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,590
Are you fucking serious right now? Fuck, yes, I'm serious!

1588
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,150
Can't believe you made me late. You're so selfish.

1589
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,150
I'm selfish? Yes, you're selfish!

1590
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

1591
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,870
Look at yourself!

1592
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,790
You're in too deep, man.

1593
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,660
Yesterday, I found a college application on your desk!

1594
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,950
I don't know how long this case is going to last.

1595
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,620
And Eric's going to get into Berkeley, and, honestly, I can get in, too.

1596
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,370
Who knows? I could ride this thing out. I could be a doctor or something.

1597
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,790
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1598
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,110
You screwed this investigation all up.

1599
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,750
At least I know my Miranda rights, you idiot.

1600
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,300
You are a very silly man indeed.

1601
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,510
Boys, squaws, come quickly.

1602
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,110
Hey! Sorry! It's okay. I'm here.

1603
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,350
I know I missed the first few scenes.

1604
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,790
I want to thank... Give it up to French Samuels

1605
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,230
for ably backing me up. Fuck you, Doug! What?

1606
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,310
I say we just roll right into this thing, huh?

1607
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,990
This is my twin. We're together in...

1608
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,310
Get the fuck out of here.

1609
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,990
What are you doing? Have you completely lost your mind?

1610
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,540
What is this?

1611
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,910
I don't know, but it's already more exciting.

1612
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,470
You're embarrassing me.

1613
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,780
It's okay. I'll make it up to you.

1614
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,000
And... Let's fly!

1615
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,830
- Such bullshit! - Get off of me!

1616
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,430
I'm not dumb! I'm smart!

1617
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,470
You think I'm stupid? You're stupid!

1618
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,310
Go, Doug! I guess I should do something.

1619
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,110
I should probably not just stand here watching.

1620
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,550
I should take action.

1621
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,030
Worst best friend ever!

1622
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,940
Molly, I'm sorry!

1623
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,950
I don't want to talk to you ever again.

1624
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,180
I'm sorry.

1625
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,220
You stupid idiot!

1626
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,630
Come here! Come on!

1627
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,870
Make fun of me behind my back and everybody laughs at me?

1628
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,310
I was a loser for four years! You couldn't handle it for five minutes!

1629
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,510
Have some fairy dust, motherfucker!

1630
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,830
Hey, guys, no!

1631
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,230
I heard you call me Rain Man, you asshole!

1632
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,510
Principal Dadier sucks dick!

1633
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,870
You're supposed to be my friend!

1634
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,630
Stop! Stop it. You're expelled. Both of you are expelled.

1635
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,990
And that's the end of Act Two.

1636
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,950
Is that it? You're not going to scream at us?

1637
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,790
Nope.

1638
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,470
I'm gonna just fire you.

1639
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,590


1640
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,470
Moving out?

1641
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,750
Yep.

1642
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,430
You know what's crazy to me

1643
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,310
is that I think that I actually thought that we were brothers.

1644
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,670
I would've tooken a bullet for you.

1645
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,950
Get in now. Both of you.

1646
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,150
Why should I?

1647
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,140
Just get in the car, man.

1648
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,590
Get in the fucking car.

1649
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,150
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

1650
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,630
Please get in the car.

1651
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,910
Come on, you guys. Come on. Please. Jesus.

1652
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,110
Some messed up shit went down yesterday.

1653
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,110
Yeah, after we made the exchange,

1654
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,720
our potential business partners got followed by some fucking cops.

1655
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,230
That's insane, man.

1656
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,630
Are you serious?

1657
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,830
Okay, it's just I don't want to go to jail!

1658
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,300
You know what happens to a handsome guy like me in jail?

1659
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,150
It rhymes with "grape"!

1660
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,270
It rhymes with "grape."

1661
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,510
I can't let that happen.

1662
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,710
So I got these from my dad's gun cabinet.

1663
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,470
Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric. Whoa. Come on. Whoa.

1664
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:31,340
Springfield .45s, police issue. Very powerful guns.

1665
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,630
You ever use one?

1666
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,990
We're not really gun people, man. No. No?

1667
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,350
A lot of things have made me wonder about you.

1668
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,510
Come on.

1669
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,990
Your taste in music.

1670
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,750
The fact that you look like a fucking 40-year-old man.

1671
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,670
Then after that shit at the play, I realized

1672
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,990
there's no way you guys could be cops.

1673
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:58,350
Oh.

1674
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,030
Yeah, I got this deal going down. The supplier's going to be there.

1675
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,310
I need people I can trust.

1676
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,550
All right. All right, come on.

1677
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,310
Okay, right over here, we're going to shoot these bottles.

1678
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,790
We're going to practice, okay? Okay.

1679
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,230
That was... That was actually really fuckin' awesome.

1680
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,590
Beginner's luck.

1681
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,990
All right.

1682
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,710
The supplier wants the deal to go down at prom.

1683
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,310
All right, there's going to be all these heavies there,

1684
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,910
but as long as you guys have my back...

1685
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,830
Yeah? Yeah? Shit.

1686
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,670
I always got your back.

1687
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,710
Time to get our jobs back.

1688
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,350
Let's get ready for prom.

1689
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,510
Schmidty! Chore time!

1690
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,950
Mom, we don't have time for chores right now!

1691
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,870
If you stay in this house, you have time for chores!

1692
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,230
Mom! Ugh!

1693
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,790
Fuck this thing.

1694
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,540
Here. Huh?

1695
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,710
It'll be quicker if I help.

1696
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:35,980
There you go.

1697
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,830
Thanks.

1698
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,070
Your shotgun's hanging too low.

1699
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,790
They're gonna see it.

1700
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,180
Thanks.

1701
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,310
Jenko, uh...

1702
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,870
Will you go to prom with me?

1703
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,350
I guess.

1704
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,200
Are we really going to take down a whole drug operation by ourselves?

1705
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,110
I got some contacts that'll help us.

01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,180
Brad, what are you doing here? You can't be here.

1724
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,390
What if the principal sees you?

1725
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,670
This is wrong, yet so right. What?

1726
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,030
I am so happy you're willing to get in trouble for me.

1727
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,680
You have to go. Please, don't leave me ever.

1728
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,990
Ms. Griggs, stop. Stop.

1729
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,470
Stay! Stay. Stop.

1730
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,230
What? Stay.

1731
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,580
Go! Okay.

1732
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,900
Stay. Stop. Stop.

1733
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,710
I'm lost without you. What?

1734
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,790
Get out of me. I'm going to throw up.

1735
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,110
You are so hot!

1736
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,100
All right.

1737
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,230
Hey, pumpkin head.

1738
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,670
I'm very mad at you. Dance with me.

1739
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,710
Are you on that shit? So what if I am?

1740
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,750
Look, Molly, some serious stuff is about to go down,

1741
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,030
and I don't want you to get hurt.

1742
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,550
I've already been hurt, Doug. I don't care.

1743
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,590
You need to leave. You need to leave. You need to get out of here right now.

1744
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,430
Making a lot of hand gestures!

1745
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,220
Okay, my name's not Doug.

1746
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,590
It's Schmidt. What?

1747
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,270
And I'm a cop. What?

1748
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:11,060
Okay, and I care about you, and I don't want you to get busted,

1749
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,270
so you have to leave right now.

1750
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,030
Leave the prom right now, Molly.

1751
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,590
I'm serious. Hey. Hey.

1752
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,990
Penthouse now. Supplier's waiting.

1753
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,270
What are you? Come on. Hey, come on.

1754
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,870
Supplier's waiting. Is that Eric?

1755
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,990
Molly, leave right now. What are you...

1756
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,490
Just leave right now! What is this?

1757
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,780
Mr. Walters?

1758
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,660
Hey!

1759
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,270
Beautiful Brad, and his brother.

1760
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,670
Wow. You look great.

1761
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,270
You're the supplier? You're a teacher.

1762
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,950
And I was stuck on a teacher's salary, bro.

1763
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,890
Could barely pay my alimony. What are you gonna do? Ha!

1764
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,540
Oh, yeah.

1765
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,470
You boys are so good at this.

1766
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,150
Oh, yeah, Cinnamon!

1767
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,830
Oh, my God, we're getting such good evidence.

1768
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,630
I stole some of that Bunsen burner crap

1769
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,030
from the chem lab, threw in some of my Cool Deets,

1770
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,070
and it was muy delicioso!

1771
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,390
Then one day I catch Eco Butt-munch over here

1772
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,230
smoking a J.J. behind the field house,

1773
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,190
and I'm like, "Hey, you want to make some coin?"

1774
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,230
What a green penis that guy is, huh?

1775
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,260
There's my quesadilla.

1776
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,430
I hurt my hands!

1777
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,420
Bitch.

1778
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,900
Oh, shit.

1779
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,340
You guys look crazy scary.

1780
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,500
How many of you are there?

1781
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,830
A lot.

1782
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,100
Karl.

1783
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,870
Patch looks pimp, man.

1784
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:41,790
Thank you.

1785
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,030
He's gonna recognize us, man.

1786
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,550
I'm freaking out.

1787
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,270
This is Walters, he made the stuff.

1788
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,870
Real pleasure to meet you. Fuck what his name is.

1789
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,180
Your shit's good.

1790
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,230
Thank you.

1791
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,540
That means a lot coming from you. What, you having a party now?

1792
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,470
Who are these two motherfuckers?

1793
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,540
Fuck!

1794
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,150
Hey. Hey. How's it going?

1795
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,990
Nah, nah, it's cool, man, they're my boys, so...

1796
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,460
Are they? Yeah.

1797
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,950
I don't like strangers.

1798
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,970
How do you ever expect to make any new friends with that attitude?

1799
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,890
It's, like, everyone's a stranger till you give them a chance, man.

1800
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,390
What the fuck are you talking about?

1801
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,460
I don't even...

1802
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,150
Just fuckin' around.

1803
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,190
Do your thing, man. Proceed.

1804
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,470
Hey, kid, come here.

1805
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,630
You, you look familiar.

1806
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,630
Me? Yeah.

1807
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,150
I was in a French fry commercial when I was a kid,

1808
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,620
so people are like, you know, often say, "Oh, I think I know you,"

1809
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,830
but I don't think we've ever met before.

1810
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,110
Do I look like I eat French fries?

1811
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,230
I don't know, you look like you're in great shape,

1812
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,630
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day, like a carb blowout, you know? I don't know.

1813
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,860
Nah.

1814
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,390
Yeah, the theme song was, like...

1815
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:48,360
กำ Come to Andrew's French Fry Emporium

1816
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:52,670

1818

กำ Go hand in hand กำ

1820
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,590


1821
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,030
That's my quesadilla!

1822
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,230
Who wants a piece? Huh?

1823
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,150
I know you're in there, Doug, or whatever your name is!

1824
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,270
You lied to me!

1825
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,510


1826
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,870
I'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!

1827
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,710
Hey, you guys, she just called me a stupid fucking cock. That's rude.

1828
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,190
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

1829
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,190
Did she just say "nickhead dark motherfucker"?

1830
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,630
That's just racist.

1831
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,150
I know these two.

1832
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:26,910
Your boys are cops! They're cops!

1833
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,230
Police! Get on the ground!

1834
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,230
You get on the fuckin' ground!

1835
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,270
We asked you first! I don't give a damn!

1836
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,990
You're fucking cops?

1837
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,910
But we partied together, man.

1838
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,550
You bought us Taco Bell.

1839
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,980
Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.

1840
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,550
You made me this friendship bracelet.

1841
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,480
Well, he's not really your friend. He was pretending the whole time.

1842
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,550
I'm gonna cut this the fuck off later, all right?

1843
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,550
What the fuck is going on?

1844
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,270
Shut this kid up!

1845
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,430
Him, too. No, no! Hey, wait!

1846
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,710
No, no, no. Listen, I'm with you guys!

1847
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,910
I didn't know these guys were cops!

1848
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,220
I'm getting out of here.

1849
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,750
I fucking hate you!

1850
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,070
Get that out of my face!

1851
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,070
Molly! Oh, there you are!

1852
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,140
What the fuck!

1853
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,700
Drop your guns, or I'll spray her brains all over the room!

1854
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,150
Trying to take a hostage, some goddamn TV show shit?

1855
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,310
I don't know! I'm trying to help, all right? I've never done this shit before.

1856
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,430
Well, you're fucking up.

1857
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,190
Drop the guns or she's dead! She looks dead already.

1858
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,780
What? No.

1859
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,500
Oh, Jesus.

1860
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,030
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

1861
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,310
She just passed out from the drugs. We're good.

1862
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,460
Drop the guns or...

1863
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,150
All right, all right, just chill out.

1864
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,950
We're gonna drop our guns.

1865
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,190
You got to let the kids go, and no one's gonna die, okay?

1866
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,350
Just drop the guns, and kick them over here.

1867
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,070
D.B., shoot these motherfuckers.

1868
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,540
Oh, come on, that's unfair! We put our guns down in good faith.

1869
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,270
You're a liar, and you're mean!

1870
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,870
That's unfair. We're all friends here.

1871
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,350
Let's just relax, and we can all leave here as friends.

1872
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,720
Yeah, let's do that. Y'all boys are stupid.

1873
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,430
Oh, my God, we're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1874
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,270
God damn it!

1875
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,470
Tom Hanson, DEA! On your knees!

1876
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,590
What the fuck?

1877
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,550
Now! Fuck!

1878
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,710
Doug Penhall, DEA! You're under arrest!

1879
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,950
Guns down, all of you! Domingo, tell them!

1880
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,710
Put them down.

1881
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,820


1882
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,430
Nice! Yes!

1883
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,510
Shut the fuck up!

1884
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,870
You little dweebs just ruined a five-year investigation.

1885
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,070
We had no idea.

1886
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,510
You're, like, an amazing actor, man.

1887
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,100
You played saxophone at my sister's wedding, man!

1888
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,710
Tough titty. I fucked her, too.

1889
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,180
What?

1890
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,590
You little turds.

1891
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,470
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to infiltrate a gang like this?

1892
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,230
Do you see this nose?

1893
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,870
That is a fake nose.

1894
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,910
Do you want to wear a fake nose on your fuckin' head

1895
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,830
for, like, months on end? Glue and shit?

1896
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,270
Worse things in the world.

1897
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,590
We had to get fuckin' tattoos on our dicks, man.

1898
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,550
Hey, actually, I just said that

1899
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,310
to mess with you. What?

1900
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,750
Looks tough.

1901
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,510
Look, we know what it's like being undercover.

1902
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,820
Metro Police, Jump Street Division.

1903
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,980
Come on, you guys are Jump Street?

1904
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,110
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1905
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,150
That's funny, because we were actually Jump Street.

1906
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,710
What? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1907
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,270
Oh, shit!

1908
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,190
Oh, my God! Oh, shit.

1909
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,260
Oh, my God, dude!

1910
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,630
Get them!

1911
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,310
Motherfucker!

1912
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,870
Shoot them!

1913
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,300
Fuck that.

1914
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,700
That was a gun.

1915
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,060
Somebody definitely got shot.

1916
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,060
All right.

1917
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,550
Here, take the money, all right? We're getting out of here.

1918
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,180
Did I hit anything?

1919
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,910
You were shooting at the fuckin' ceiling.

1920
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,940
Doug.

1921
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,950
I know sometimes I was a jerk to you

1922
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,950
when we were undercover.

1923
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:04,270
It's just... I didn't feel good about myself.

1924
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,110
All that stuff I wore, like the bracelets, the rings, the tight pants,

1925
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,870
was just so

1926
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,340
that people would think I'm cool.

1927
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,510
The only approval

1928
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,310
that I ever needed

1929
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,670
was my best friend.

1930
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,950
Thanks, man.

1931
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,550
The money's gone!

1932
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,030
Come on, let's roll.

1933
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,430
We gotta get out of here, man.

1934
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,740
Are you telling me it's on?

1935
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,990
Let's do this. Let's make a baby.

1936
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,790
What? What are you talking about? I don't know.

1937
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,470
I was trying to sound cool. Sorry.

1938
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,390
That was crazy! You killed a guy!

1939
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,190
Oh, fuckin' shit!

1940
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,990
Hey, hey, we'll lose them in the prom! Go!

1941
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,510

01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,540
Go, go, go, go!

1949
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,870
Where'd they go?

1950
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,380
Molly!

1951
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,500
Shit!

1952
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,990
You want to drive? Yeah, I do, actually.

1953
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,220
Okay, cool.

1954
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,430
Nice! Did it look cool when I did it?

1955
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,430
That's what I'm talking about! Yeah!

1956
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,550
How you guys doing back there, huh?

1957
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,110
God, I love high school!

1958
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,420
Best prom night ever!

1959
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,750
Shoot them! Stay on them!

1960
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,590
I'm on them! I'm on them!

1961
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,240
Oh, good, you guys, come hang out with me back here.

1962
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,750
Oh, fuck, dude. Lisa, what are you doing? Did she pass out back there?

1963
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,150
Hey, you got a gun. Why don't you shoot back there?

1964
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,750
Shoot that gun, shoot that gun!

1965
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,150
All right, one second!

1966
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,550
Just shoot someone, you bitch!

1967
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,260
Peek-a-boo!

1968
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,620
Give me my money!

1969
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,670
Fuck that! Fuck that! No! No!

1970
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,390
I can't do this! I'm supposed to go to Berkeley!

1971
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,940
I'm gonna get the party started!

1972
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,550
I'm gonna get the party started! No! No! Lisa, no!

1973
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,750
Hey, I'm living my dream of standing in a limo!

1974
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,980
What?

1975
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,150
You're killing my dream! Come in.

1976
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,350
What? I'm trying to party. Down!

1977
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,630
Bitch!

1978
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,070
What? Fuck!

1979
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,470
I'll kill you!

1980
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,700
Kill you!

1981
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,550
No! No! Stay where you are.

1982
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,830
Go! Go, go!

1983
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,630
No! Stop!

1984
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,910
I'm not fucking kidding! Look, I'm trying to shoot people!

1985
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,310
Will you stop! Just for two seconds!

1986
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,230
You're really hot and you're really slutty and it's awesome,

1987
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,630
but I got to shoot people right now!

1988
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,110
You think I'm hot?

1989
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,430
I wanna... Oh, my God!

1990
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,150
Wait, guys! Call me!

1991
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,950
Let me know where you're ending up later.

1992
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,790
I'm almost out of ammo.

1993
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,990
We're fucked.

1994
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,020
Give me my money!

1995
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,700
I got an idea.

1996
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,510
You still got those shotgun shells? Yeah.

1997
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,310
Pop Quiznos.

1998
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:46,350
What do you get when lithium batteries react to potassium nitrate?

1999
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,940
That would be a covalent bond, brother.

2000
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,550
That's when two atoms, they share electrons.

2001
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,630
You see, they both need what the other one has.

2002
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,190
That makes them stick together.

2003
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:56,500
Are you saying we're covalent bonds?

2004
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,670
What? No.

2005
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,790
We're not atoms, dude.

2006
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,590
What's this? Tequila?

2007
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,830
I don't know, it was supposed to explode.

2008
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,030
Oh, shit!

2009
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,430
Where'd you learn how to do that, man?

2010
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,740
App chemistry, bitch.

2011
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,110
Come on, blondie.

2012
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,030
Molly!

2013
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,230
Drop your weapon!

2014
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,950
Don't you fuckin' pull that arm up.

2015
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,300
Don't.

2016
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,030
Oh-ho! Looks like you're out of ammo, asshole!

2017
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,340
Come on! Get out here!

2018
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,150
What? What's going on? All right.

2019
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:01,430
All right, here's the deal. Nobody moves, or she's gonna get hurt.

2020
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,860
Do you understand? Nobody move!

2021
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,750
All right. Eric, help me.

2022
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,870
Don't you have a gun?

2023
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,190
All right, don't move!

2024
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,310
Come on, let's go. Let's go. No!

2025
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,640
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, no, no, I said don't move!

2026
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,060
Oh, fuck, you shot him! Oh, God!

2027
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,270
Are you okay?

2028
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,990
You shot my partner, you motherfucker!

2029
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,150
I didn't mean to shoot you! I meant to shoot him!

2030
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,190
Are you alive, buddy? You okay? You took a bullet for me, man.

2031
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,660
Yeah, I'm feeling a little ambivalent about that right now.

2032
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,870
Didn't you hear me? I said don't move! I said that! You heard, right?

2033
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,070
Eric, you heard me!

2034
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,470
- I said don't move! - Eric, help me!

2035
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,030
- You got this. - Hey, hold still.

2036
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,300
Freeze!

2037
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,670
Shoot!

2038
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,740
Come on.

2039
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,390
You peaked in high school, motherfucker.

2040
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,870
Oh, shit.

2041
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,190
I shot him in the dick.

2042
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,660
You shot me in the dick!

2043
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,940
Oh, my God!

2044
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,140
Yes!

2045
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,110
Yes! Yes!

2046
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,350
Yes!

2047
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,350
You are under arrest!

2048
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,950
It definitely came out my asshole! You have the right to remain silent!

2049
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,110
Anything you say can and will be used against you

2050
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,260
in a court of law!

2051
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:21,870
You have the right to an attorney!

2052
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,390
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you!

2053
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,550
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?

2054
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,430
Fuck you! Bitch!

2055
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,190
Yes! Yes!

2056
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,110
We did it, man!

2057
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,310
We did it.

2058
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,540
God, I feel so good.

2059
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,030
We did it, man!

2060
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,550
You're a goddamn rock star.

2061
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,350
Do you feel that?

2062
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,420
God damn, you're so cool.

2063
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,310
You just shot him in the dick.

2064
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,950
I've never seen that. Who does that?

2065
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,390
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.

2066
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,950
I know I didn't say you were, but you're smart.

2067
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,640
You're a smart guy, and you're thoughtful,

2068
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,950
and you're sincere and you're sweet and you're loyal...

2069
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,790
And I fuckin' cherish you.

2070
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,740
Should we high-five?

2071
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,350
Ow! My hand!

2072
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,350
Are you all right? Should we get you to the hospital, man?

2073
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,270
Yeah, I think we need to call somebody. Hey, call somebody!

2074
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,350
I got to get my dick sewn back on.

2075
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,950
You shut the fuck up. Hey, you shut up.

2076
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,750
That's not funny. Is that it?

2077
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,150
What?

2078
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,070
That's my dick!

2079
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,790
Pick up my dick! Please!

2080
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,190
No, we're not picking up your dick.

2081
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,670
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

2082
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,980
Oh, fuck!

2083
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,670
He's my friend.

2084
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,630
They don't serve vegan in jail, bitch.

2085
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,510
Hey.

2086
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,470
Molly...

2087
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,860
I'm really sorry.

2088
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:07,810
I know you wanted a guy to trust, and I wanted to be that person so badly.

2089
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,990
And I let you down in a lot of ways.

2090
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,780
And...

2091
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,870
It's good that you're mad at me.

2092
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:20,190
I think it's good. I think you should be mad at more guys,

2093
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:25,300
because you deserve a guy who's good and who doesn't lie to you.

2094
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,140
And you should never settle for less than that.

2095
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,430
There are good guys out there

2096
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,990
who aren't assholes like me.

2097
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,590
Thanks for saving my life,

2098
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,430
asshole.

2099
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,990
Put her there, partner.

2100
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,990
I'll come back later.

2101
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,910
We're, like, in the end of Die Hard right now, but it's our actual life.

2102
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:09,270
It's crazy.

2103
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,710
Number one or two? Three.

2104
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,350
Sam Jackson one. Yeah! Sam Jackson style.

2105
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,150
Boom, motherfuckers! What's going on? Come on!

2106
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,550
Where is he? There's my guy!

2107
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,980
There he is! That's him. That's him.

2108
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,380
Enough. Too long on the hug.

2109
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:33,660
Congratulations, you crazy, sick, vigilante motherfuckers.

2110
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,510
You got your first arrest, huh?

2111
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,470
- Look. Got something made for you. - You didn't!

2112
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,790
Come on. All right, all right. Enough. Enough.

2113
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,230
New assignment.

2114
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,350
Since you two cowboys love to drink booze,

2115
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,670
smoke weed with kids, and fuck anything with a big ass in jeans

2116
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,070
with low self-esteem,

2117
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:55,110
I'm gonna send you to a place where all that shit is allowed.

2118
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,420
Oh, I love Disneyland!

2119
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,830
You two sons of bitches are going to college!

2120
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,510
No! Yes!

2121
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,910


2122
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,780
Boo-yah!

2123
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,670
Oh, my God! You're like two Hardy Boys in one!

2124
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,500
Oh, fuck!

2125
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,430
Hey, why are you here, Scott?

2126
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,950
What, Kennedy High isn't having any parties tonight?
