1
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,113
- Good morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.
- Morning, Ozzie.

2
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,510
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

3
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,199
Nick, breakfast.

4
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,911
- Nick!
- I'm coming.

5
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,112
<i>Your hands are</i>
<i>getting bigger now</i>

6
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,192
<i>Your arms and legs</i>
<i>are longer now</i>

7
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,432
<i>You even sense your insides</i>
<i>grow when Mom and Dad</i>

8
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,831
- Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

9
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,309
- Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

10
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,552
- He gets out of the playpen.
- No, I fixed it.

11
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,952
Sweetheart, I hate to remind you, but
the last time you fixed the playpen...

12
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,996
he still got out of it.

13
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,878
Well, he won't get out this time.

14
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,032
Hiya.
Will you, big buddy, huh?

15
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,793
I'm certainly capable of fixing
a playpen, aren't I?

16
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,314
- You're just a little baby, after all.
- Your hat?

17
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,233
- It's my helmet.
- New one?
- Yeah, it's a new one.

18
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
See, it shaves me.
See that?

19
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,155
There.

20
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,550
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

21
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,712
Mom, in the first place, I'm not
the first girl who has ever gone
away to college.

22
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,598
- And in the second place, we're...
- Mom.
- Excuse me.

23
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,353
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in. That's it.

24
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,159
- Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, yeah, I want to hear a noise.

25
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,196
- This one?
- Yeah. Now, this time...
- This one.

26
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,396
Okay.

27
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,036
- Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.
- More?

28
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,553
Sure.

29
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,155
- Mom, let's say you were a girl.
- I think I can visualize it.

30
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,232
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me, I mean.

31
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,551
It's a rhetorical question, Mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

32
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,791
- Am I any girl in particular?
- No.

33
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,158
Just a girl I might, I don't know,
ask to go to the movies or something.

34
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,153
Nicky, you are turning into
a very handsome young man.

35
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,118
- You're gonna be just like your dad.
- Honey...

36
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,636
can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

37
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,714
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone...

38
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,395
the baby-sitter's number's
in the kitchen.

39
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,392
- What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

40
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,596
Nick? Our Nick?

41
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,319
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

42
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,873
Uh-oh.

43
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,430
- I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk!
- Nick, stop!

44
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,352
- Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

45
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,069
Yes, I should hope so.
Come on.

46
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,592
- Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,671
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

48
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,036
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

49
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,635
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.

50
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,070
I never said you were stupid.

51
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,917
Taxi's here.

52
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,711
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?

53
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,997
Mmm, fantastic.

54
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,389
The taxi's gonna
take Mommy to the airport.

55
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,075
And then Mommy's gonna show Amy
her new room at school.

56
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,116
Hopefully they'll tire
him out at day care.

57
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,316
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

58
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,879
- No nap!
- Honey...

59
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,748
- we don't say the "n" word
around two-year-olds.
- Adam.

60
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,879
- Colored car.
- Okay, now, Adam's lunch
is in the freezer...

61
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,793
- Adam.
- and I put the baby-sitter's
number on the refrigerator.

62
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,156
- Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting some...
- Diane, Diane, relax.

63
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,755
Don't you think I can handle
things around here?

64
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,354
Of course you can, honey.

65
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,672
Break it up, guys.

66
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,115
Don't worry, Dad. She'll get there,
realize there's nothing to do...

67
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,270
turn around,
and come right back.

68
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,753
Bye.

69
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,119
- Bye, Nick.
- Come on, Amy. We gotta get going.

70
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,031
Oh. Don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

71
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,476
Gosh, the time. I got to get you
to work. I got a big test today.

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,120
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

73
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,319
Come on. Come on.

74
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,119
Come on. Come on.

75
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,915
You can do it.
Atta girl.

76
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,157
<i>Szalinski test number 1277.</i>

77
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,913
<i>Crystal Group 5.</i>

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,036
Shouldn't we wait
for Szalinski?

79
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,271
Maybe this will teach him
to be here on time.

80
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,557
Szalinski isn't running the show.
I am.

81
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,952
- This better work this time,
so concentrate.
- Ten seconds.

82
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,238
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

83
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,110
four, three, two, one, zero.

84
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,191
Here.

85
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,269
Sorry, everybody. There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun,
and I-I lost power.

86
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,148
And my son got a job for the summer...
Wet and Wild. I had to drop him off.

87
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,674
What's that stuff on your face?

88
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,996
- Oh, excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson?
- I'm sick and tired of this!

89
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,790
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments
shrinking matter.

90
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,075
But reversing the process,
enlarging matter...

91
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,391
has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

92
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,836
Clifford Sterling demands results.

93
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,754
His board of directors demands results,
the United States government
demands results...

94
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,990
- and as project director, I...
- Excuse me, Dr. Hendrickson.

95
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,312
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project co-director,
I intend to deliver results.

96
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,039
- I-I've been doing some work on my own
on the problem, sir.
- Yes, Wayne.

97
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,829
- I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...
- Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

98
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,798
When you licensed your device
to Sterling Labs, you were promised...

99
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,190
that the finest minds in the country
would be working on it, and they are.

100
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,474
- I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

101
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,711
But I-I think if you look at these
notes, you'll find that although...

102
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,391
- Mandy?
- Yeah, Rick?

103
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,869
- Nick.
- Nick.

104
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,599
Hey, Nick, your dad's here
in his spaceship. The Dweezil Wheels.

105
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,716
Hey, Nicky!
Want a ride?

106
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,634
- Hey, look. It's the Nerdmobile.
- Hey, look at that.

107
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,631
- Oh, man.
- Have a nice flight.

108
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,513
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

109
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,398
Nothing.

110
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,875
- Dad, were you ever popular in school?
- You bet.

111
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,872
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

112
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,952
We were happenin' guys.

113
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,076
So Mom tells me that
there's some girl?

114
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,071
What?

115
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,597
No. No, I was...
I was just wondering.

116
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,755
How was your flight?
Uh-huh. N-No, fine.

117
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,274
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.

118
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,275
What noise? Uh, it was just
a bad connection, that's all.

119
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,874
The baby?
Well, h-he's fine.

120
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,636
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it. He can't get out.

121
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,634
- Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

122
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,473
Uh-huh. Yeah.

123
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,596
Hey, stop it.

124
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,478
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

125
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,516
No, everything's fine.

126
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,909
Boy, you worry too much.

127
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,191
What? The chicken?

128
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,431
Well, the chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

129
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,271
So I was thinking,
with Mom and Amy out of town...

130
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,750
that this would give us guys
a chance to, uh, talk about, uh...

131
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,876
you know, the birds and the bees.

132
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,671
Here, Nicky.

133
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,159
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny? What?

134
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,472
I was thinking we got to be nice to
our brother Nick. You know why? No, why?

135
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,076
Well, because he moved away to
a new place now, and he's got to make
all new friends, just like me and you.

136
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,639
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,551
- Shall we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,551
- What song shall we sing?
- "ABCs."

139
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,437
- How about "Twinkle, Twinkle"?
- "ABC."

140
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,431
- "ABC"?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,909
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle...</i>
- "ABCs"!

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,831
- Let's sing
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."
- "ABCs."

143
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,471
"ABCs"? Okay, first "ABCs."
<i>A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P</i>

144
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,676
Now "Twinkle, Twinkle," okay?

145
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,830
Okay.

146
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,392
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

147
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,516
<i>How I won...</i>

148
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,837
<i>What you are</i>

149
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,798
It'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

150
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,678
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

151
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,470
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself
to one crazy idea after another.

152
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,872
I have to tell you,
the board of directors is very worried.

153
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,520
If you'll pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.

154
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,433
<i>Hello?</i>

155
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,159
- What was that?
- It was a balloon popping,
Dr. Hendrickson.

156
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,310
I got the idea while
singing my kid to sleep.

157
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,277
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force...

158
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,158
<i>you don't allow the molecules time</i>
<i>to expand, and the balloon pops.</i>

159
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,674
- Problem?
- No, Szalinski.

160
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,239
Oh, him.

161
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,031
Why Clifford insists on keeping
him involved is absolutely beyond me.

162
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,271
If I were running this project
by myself right now,
we'd be neck-deep in apples...

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,032
the size of Buicks.

164
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,395
There are those of us on
the board who would agree with you.

165
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,277
<i>... fundamental integrity</i>
<i>of the atomic substructure...</i>

166
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,069
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

167
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,278
to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

168
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,592
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion...

169
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,719
especially if you're the one to
actually make this thing work.

170
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,189
<i>... thereby allowing the</i>
<i>molecules time to expand...</i>

171
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,350
without tearing the atomic fabric.

172
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,158
Hello?

173
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,037
Szalinsk... Szalinski...

174
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,759
<i>why don't you write up this, uh,</i>
<i>balloon research of yours?</i>

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,958
- I can do the math and have it
on your desk tomorrow.
- No, that's not necessary.

176
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,715
All right, have a good
weekend, Szalinski.

177
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,870
"Have a good weekend, Szalinski"?

178
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,795
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

179
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,269
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>Mandy, phone.</i>

180
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,635
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Mandy?

181
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,471
I'll fix it.

182
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,993
- Daddy!
- Hey, what are you doing up, little guy?

183
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,956
- Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

184
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,510
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.

185
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,149
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky
down to the lab and we'll play?

186
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,796
Okay, guys.

187
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,791
See, Adam, this is
where Daddy works.

188
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,030
- Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

189
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,395
- Got to be a little bit
discreet about this.
- Huh?

190
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,029
- Mr. Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.
- Hello. You working today?

191
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,112
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little bit.

192
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,151
- Wow.
- Wow.

193
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,595
- This is some lab.
- Some lab.

194
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,716
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

195
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,394
- Way better.
- Way better.

196
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,399
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr. Hendrickson, please?

197
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,069
Call up a command directory
labeled "primary laser drive."
Tell me what it says under "intensity."

198
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,159
- It says "access denied."
- Access denied?

199
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,670
Got to figure out some way how
to lower the intensity of the laser.

200
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,757
Hey, Dad.

201
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,797
We could diffuse it maybe.

202
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,157
That's a good idea.

203
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,869
- Now we'll set final target.
- Target what, Dad?

204
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,400
- Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

205
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,871
Come on. Let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really Big Bunny, huh?

206
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,469
Yes, sir. I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

207
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,836
No, you did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

208
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,031
Well, that's it for me.

209
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,430
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

210
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,351
There you go.

211
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,232
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

212
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,355
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

213
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,475
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

214
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,109
<i>19, 18, 17, 16...</i>

215
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,998
<i>15, 14, 13...</i>

216
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,878
<i>12, 11, 10...</i>

217
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,112
<i>9, 8, 7, 6, 5...</i>

218
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,476
- Dang! Power surge!
<i>- 3, 2, 1...</i>

219
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,357
- Quick, the abort switches!
<i>- zero.</i>

220
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,033
Unable to abort.

221
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,273
Joe, what's happening up here?

222
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,756
Uh, Mr. Szalinski.
Uh, your security clearance...

223
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,876
denies you access
to the equipment...

224
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,916
without Dr. Hendrickson's
permission.

225
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,639
- You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

226
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,871
Uh, Mr. Szalinski...

227
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

228
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,514
That baby of yours.
Sure starting to get big.

229
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,079
See you, Smitty.

230
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,148
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

231
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,711
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission to work
on your own invention?

232
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,873
Well, Nick, Dad's a member
of a team now, and I'm working
with some real talented people.

233
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,873
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.

234
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,676
Okay, bud. Looks like Daddy...

235
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,399
needs to spend a little quality time
with Nick, okay?

236
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,393
So I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.
You're gonna have yourself a good time.

237
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,311
- Nick.
- Yeah.

238
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,193
You puttin' on
a little bit of weight?

239
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,631
I'm big.

240
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,153
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

241
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,549
Maybe kind of
a low-cal thing.

242
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,108
What do you think, huh?
It's gonna be good.

243
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,795
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.

244
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,075
This guy's gonna keep you company,
and I'm gonna make...

245
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,116
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,992
555-5654.

247
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,118
Okay, so lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?

248
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,555
- Yeah?
<i>- Hi, is this Mandy Park?</i>
- Yeah.

249
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,076
Uh, hi, this is, uh, Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?

250
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,799
Uh, 3:30?
Sounds okay, Mr. Schlitzminski.

251
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,919
- Uh, Szalinski, dear.
- Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

252
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,310
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,
I actually have to do anything...

253
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,154
like change diapers
or clean up or something,
in which case, the price goes up.

254
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,834
Oh, no. All you have to do
is just-just watch him, really.

255
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,911
<i>- Okay, see you at 3:30.</i>
- Okay.

256
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,913
Okay.

257
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,434
Okay. Are these Quark's
or yours?

258
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,956
You just stay here, okay?

259
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,191
- She sounded great on the phone.
- I want to go to a restaurant.

260
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,919
You want to go to a restaurant?
But I just made this stuff.
It's gonna be good.

261
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,992
I want to go eat in restaurant.

262
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,312
Well, um, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh, let me take your order.

263
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,311
- What would you like?
- I want the duck.

264
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,518
Duck. The duck...
The duck is not very good tonight.
Uh, can I recommend the special?

265
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,717
- Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have soup du jour.

266
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,268
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

267
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,113
- Would you like 'em?
- Okay.
- All right.

268
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,031
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

269
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,994
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

270
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,310
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert Six
I wanted to see.

271
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,278
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

272
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,478
- I'll check show times.
- Okay, and then maybe afterwards,
we can get a bite to eat or something.

273
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,078
Big, Big Bunny.

274
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,517
What's that?

275
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,711
What's gotten into him?

276
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,240
- Dad, how?
- Where were you in the lab this morning?
Were you watching Adam?

277
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,278
- He was off to the side.
- But at the moment of discharge,
where was he?

278
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,035
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side. Wasn't he?

279
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,475
Somehow, I don't think so.

280
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,599
Boo.

281
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,318
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make everything okay.

282
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,596
Okay, we got to get him back to the lab,
analyze the data
and reverse the process.

283
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,113
- One thing, Dad.
- What?

284
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,273
Do you think the security guard might
get suspicious with us walking in
with a seven-foot baby?

285
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,032
Good point.

286
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,274
This will cover your head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.

287
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,992
There. He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

288
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,278
All right. Okay.
Now just act natural.

289
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,749
Come on, bud.
Atta boy.

290
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,430
Smitty! Smitty! Um, I forgot the,
um, the keys, uh, to my van,
and I couldn't-couldn't start the van.

291
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,239
It's in the lab.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going
to use anything in there...

292
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,630
because of my security, you know,
access... a-access thing,
which you mentioned earlier.

293
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,551
So I'm just gonna get
the keys in the lab now.

294
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,311
Adam.

295
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,996
Come on, down.

296
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,753
- Szalinski.
- Go back up.

297
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,070
Just stopped by to do
some, uh, computations...

298
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,674
in the... in the database.

299
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,151
- The database has been erased.
Our entire experiment, gone.
- Get back! Back!

300
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,674
- Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.
- It can't be.

301
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,150
Sure it can, if the main controller was
trying to compensate laser intensity...

302
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,834
for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot...

303
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,515
causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

304
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,115
- Who was that?
- Who?

305
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,873
- The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a-a friend of mine.

306
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,315
- Well, what language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

307
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,393
- You let a foreigner into the lab.
- He's not a foreigner. He's my wife's
Uncle Yanosh from Yugoslavia.

308
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,597
He's family, and he just wanted to see
the lab, and I... and I brought him here.

309
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,636
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

310
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,235
- 225, the IQ on that man.
An extended brainpan.
- Extended brainpan?

311
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,914
- Bafroom.
- No bathroom right now, Adam.

312
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,833
- Did he say "bathroom"?
- Bafoon. Bafoon. Yugoslavian.

313
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,751
It's a term of, uh, of appreciation.

314
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,150
"Bafoon: thank you for bringing me down
here on a Saturday to the lab...

315
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,754
to look around,"
that's all.

316
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,037
- How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?
- Well, that doesn't concern you.

317
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,634
You're off the project.

318
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,154
- You don't have the authority
to make that decision.
- Well, maybe I don't.

319
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,879
So why don't you call Clifford Sterling
personally and plead your case.

320
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,555
However, after this morning's little
escapade, and the time and money
it'll cost Sterling Labs...

321
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,676
I don't think the old man
will have a great deal of sympathy.

322
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,470
So I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment of having
to be escorted to the gate.

323
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,195
Start working data restoration backwards
from 8:56 this morning...

324
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,669
to the exact time
the system crashed.

325
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,638
I want to know
what he was up to.

326
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,075
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then...

327
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,277
they'd know that you were able to
make it work when nobody else could.

328
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,830
Look, Nick. Remember we made you kids
promise never, ever to tell anyone...

329
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,559
- you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,394
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,
to undergo countless tests...

331
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,598
to go through endless observations
and who knows what else.

332
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,673
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

333
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,878
I don't know.
What I do know is...

334
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,158
we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

335
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,592
Hi, guys.
I'm home.

336
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,954
Where'd this come from?

337
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,914
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

338
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,468
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

339
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,518
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean, older.

340
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,354
- Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

341
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,431
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

342
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,796
I'll just explain.

343
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,839
Sure. It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

344
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,388
to our family.

345
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,870
- I'll just tell the truth.
- Then beg for mercy.

346
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,712
Colored car.

347
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,917
- What was that all about?
- Um, I had a little trouble
with the van.

348
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,675
I-I-I thought I put it in, uh, in-in
park, and it went into reverse...

349
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,830
'cause the "P" and the...
and the "R" look...

350
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,914
- You're back early.
- Yeah, I-I took a cab from the airport.
You know, it really was silly.

351
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,028
- Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man in the loud sport coat?
- Stop. No. No, those are Nick's.

352
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,918
Well, Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Now, the-the...

353
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,673
- Sit down.
- Mom.
- Sit down!

354
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,911
You know how sometimes
the-the things that I invent...

355
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,355
don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

356
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,956
Sweetheart, you can tell me.
How bad can it be?

357
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,510
After all, it's not like you did
something to one of the kids again.

358
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,873
- Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

359
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,431
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?

360
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,478
- All right, I confess. I did it.
- Did what?

361
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,471
Peekaboo.

362
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,916
I blew up the baby.

363
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,429
Mama fall down.
Mama?

364
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,550
- How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

365
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,835
Mama sleeping?

366
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,469
- I'll kill Wayne.
- You don't want to kill Wayne.

367
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,710
I want to kill Wayne.

368
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,792
- What's he doing?
- He's playing with his toys.

369
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,677
Well, make him stop.

370
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,637
"Make him stop."

371
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,079
Why didn't I think of that?

372
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,991
Adam.

373
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,548
Adam, stop fooling around!

374
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,676
- Catch.
- Adam.

375
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,070
- That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

376
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,628
- Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick!

377
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,280
- Catch it.
- This is your last warning.

378
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,758
Okay, I'll give you
one more warning.

379
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,677
Honey, shh, shh.
It's not as bad as it seems.

380
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,957
It almost couldn't be,
could it?

381
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,190
Well, I finally
got him in his room.

382
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,398
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

383
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,550
I did close the door.

384
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,719
He just opened his door.

385
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,998
- And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.
- Oh, baby.

386
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,389
Adam, put the door down,
sweetheart.

387
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,789
Why don't you give
the door to Daddy, Adam?

388
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,758
- Give Daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

389
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,752
Wait till the Vista Del Mar
Standards Committee sees this.

390
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,593
Maybe we shouldn't bother with it.
It's just a mailbox.

391
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,478
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

392
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,760
- Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

393
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,717
- Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go!

394
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,111
I fix it!

395
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,829
Don't fix it, Adam.
Just put down Mommy's coffee table.

396
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,196
- Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Ad-Ad-Adam.

397
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,759
- Not my antique chair!
- Gentle. Gentle.

398
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,276
- They remodeling in there?
- Come back. Come back here.

399
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,830
Adam. Adam!

400
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,230
- Adam, sit down. Sit down, Adam.
- He's on this side.

401
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,312
- He's yours.
- Oh, Adam.
- This is not a game.

402
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,278
- What do we do when we catch him?
- Adam, Adam, hang on.

403
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,670
Okay, wait. Okay.
You guys go that way. I'll go this way.

404
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,436
Hi, little guy.

405
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,910
Adam, put Daddy down!
Adam, put Daddy down!

406
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,909
- Guitar.
- Not my room!

407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,152
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

408
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,071
- Get back here.
- Come on.
- Get back.

409
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,355
- All right, now.
That's enough, fellas. Stop.
- Adam, sweetheart.

410
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,318
- He's got my guitar!
- Nicky, he's just a baby.

411
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,914
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

412
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,636
He's gonna break my guitar!

413
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,352
- Come back here. Come back here!
- Come back, Adam.
Give me back my guitar!

414
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,351
Give it back, you brat!

415
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,591
Other way.

416
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,638
- Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

417
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,310
He targeted something.
But it's gonna take a lot more enhancing
to figure out what.

418
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,436
I can do it.

419
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,318
- What do you suppose this is here?
- Condensation on the lens?

420
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,960
- No, no, it's much too solid.
- How can you be sure?

421
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,237
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.

422
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,474
Play in here with Daddy.

423
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,630
- Play what?
- Play anything.

424
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,759
- This should distract him.
- Great!
<i>- That's what it's all about</i>

425
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,877
<i>You put your right foot in</i>
<i>You put your right foot out</i>

426
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,475
<i>You put your right foot in</i>
<i>and you shake it all about</i>

427
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,518
<i>- You do the Hokey Pokey</i>
<i>and you turn yourself around</i>
- Yeah!

428
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,194
- Dance, Adam.
<i>- That's what it's all about</i>

429
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,238
- Good. This foot, Adam.
<i>- You do the Hokey Pokey</i>

430
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,710
- Isn't this fun, Wayne?
<i>- That's what it's all about</i>
- Clap your hands. Clap your hands.

431
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,872
<i>- You put your left foot in</i>
- Put your left foot in. Good boy, Adam.
<i>- You put your left foot out</i>

432
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,669
<i>- You put your left foot in</i>
<i>and you shake it all about</i>
- Why are you closing the shutters?

433
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,355
So one of the neighbors doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby
and call the <i>National Inquirer.</i>

434
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,591
<i>- That's what it's all about</i>
- Doorbell.
- Who's that?

435
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,797
- One of the neighbors.
- So far, your plan's working perfectly.

436
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,189
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.

437
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,555
We heard shouting
and a lot of noise...

438
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,518
so we were just wondering
if everything was all right.

439
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,957
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.

440
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,713
- Uncle Yanosh.
- Uncle Yanersh.

441
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,791
<i>You put your whole self in</i>
<i>You put your whole self out</i>

442
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,996
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor.

443
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,719
- Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

444
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,236
He's breaking my ribs.
Oh, don't do that, Adam.

445
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,911
My God, it appears
to have three eyes.

446
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,116
A new life-form of some sort?

447
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,156
Try scaling up the window.

448
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,790
- This could be big.
- This could be very big.

449
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,590
Well, I think you did a great job with
these. This should really distract him.

450
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,319
- Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

451
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,518
Yeah. You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

452
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,195
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

453
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,195
Yeah, but you have to admit, Mom,
not many guys could come up with
something like this in half an hour.

454
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,311
- Cuckoo.
- No. No. Adam.

455
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,595
Sweetheart, no, no, no.
Stay away from that, sweetheart.

456
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,591
Adam, please,
please don't touch that.

457
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,194
Adam, no, don't touch
Mommy's cuckoo.

458
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,751
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here and play with Nicky.

459
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,274
Play with Nicky, Adam.

460
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,591
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

461
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,793
Wayne?

462
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,997
Well, some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

463
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,358
- Please, honey, the truth, okay?
- The truth, Diane, is that...

464
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,558
without the access to the data
at the plant, I don't know
that there's anything I can do.

465
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,269
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

466
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,273
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Hey, Mom, look.
I finally found a way to keep him quiet.

467
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,114
There were 12
ice cream bars in there.

468
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,116
- Well, he's ruined his dinner.
- Not necessarily, Mom.

469
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,670
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

470
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,513
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

471
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,595
Okay, boys, we're going out.

472
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,035
- Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

473
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,190
Maybe there's somebody there who...

474
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,589
Who knows what they're doing?

475
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,639
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now...

476
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,359
is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

477
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,034
- Come on, Nicky.
Help me get him out to the van.
- Shrink?

478
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,636
Diane, wait! I got an idea.
My original machine...
it's in the lab security warehouse.

479
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,278
Yes!

480
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,430
This'll have to be
a covert operation.

481
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,637
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with the baby.

482
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,429
- Oh, no.
We are not leaving them here alone.
- Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

483
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,830
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.
Look at him.

484
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,798
He's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.

485
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,110
No nap!

486
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,230
Look who I got:
really Big Bunny.

487
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,800
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.

488
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,757
You're real tired,
aren't you, Adam?

489
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,479
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

490
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,472
Should we sing the song?

491
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,439
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

492
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,638
<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

493
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,872
<i>Up above the world so high</i>

494
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,555
<i>Like a diamond in the sky</i>

495
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,031
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

496
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,111
<i>- How I won...</i>
- Mine!

497
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,079
- Let go!
- Gimme!
- Adam Szalinski, you let go
of that bunny right now!

498
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,436
Put Daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt Daddy.

499
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,112
Sorry, Mama.

500
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,919
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

501
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,836
Dr. Hendrickson, we can make out hair,
bone and metal, all sort of intertwined.

502
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,196
I think you should take
a look at this. Yes, sir.

503
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,238
- He's on his way.
- We'll show him
the keratin analysis first.

504
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,595
- Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

505
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,514
- I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

506
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,594
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour. Come on.

507
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,477
Bye-bye.

508
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,310
This is our latest image, superimposing
structural and keratin analysis.

509
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,313
- And as you can see, there appears to...
- All right. Just move over.

510
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,996
It's a baby and a stuffed bunny.

511
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,630
Szalinski.

512
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,757
I'm gonna pay him
a little visit.

513
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,709
- Back to work.
- I knew it was a baby.
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

514
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,357
This'll just take a second. They stored
all my stuff in one large crate.

515
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,238
- It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

516
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,513
- Maybe it's in
alphabetical order or something.
- What if it's not?

517
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,990
All I wanted to do was
take Nick to the movies. Uh-oh.

518
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,718
What?

519
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,599
Doorbell.

520
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,750
<i>Twinkle, twinkle lit...</i>

521
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,351
- Bunny.
- Wait here.

522
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,308
- Mandy.
- Rick.

523
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,955
- Nick. Nick Szalinski.
- Right.

524
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,113
- I'm here to baby-sit.
- We don't need a baby-sitter.

525
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,752
Adam, no!

526
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,877
Very funny. Now can I come in?
I'm already charging you.

527
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,635
We changed our mind, that's all.
We don't need a baby-sitter.

528
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,918
I don't think so. Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.

529
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,673
- Plus the extra if I'm grossed out.
- Uh, listen, Mandy.

530
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,797
Take it from me. You don't want
to baby-sit. Not this baby.

531
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,155
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.

532
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,515
Wayne, we've gotta get back to the kids.
This is just taking too long.

533
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,590
Honey, it's up here!

534
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,830
See if you can find
a forklift.

535
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,869
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.

536
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,635
Now, if you promise not to scream,
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.

537
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,551
Promise?

538
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,310
- Help me! Someone help me!
- Mandy! Mandy, no!
- Please, somebody help me! Giant baby!

539
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,231
You're scaring him.
Stop.

540
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,356
- Mandy, stop. Calm down.
- Help me!

541
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,312
What's that?

542
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,551
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Giant baby! Help!

543
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,437
- The Slitzitskis.
- Giant baby!

544
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,279
Wayne, this is a solar van.
We're inside.

545
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,158
There's a switch, honey, marked
"batteries." Just be careful
not to switch it to...

546
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,355
high.

547
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,878
No! No!

548
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,031
Hold on!

549
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,911
Can we try again?

550
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,637
Good.
Now, despite what he looks like...

551
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,676
Adam is just a little kid.

552
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,593
He's-He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.

553
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,070
<i>Summertime.</i>
<i>The active woman.</i>

554
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,749
<i>She knows what it is</i>
<i>to have a headache.</i>

555
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,515
<i>Everybody's doin'</i>
<i>a brand new dance now</i>

556
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,751
<i>- Come on, baby, do the locomotion.</i>
- Let's welcome 'em.

557
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,196
<i>I know you'll get to like it</i>
<i>if you give it a chance now</i>

558
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,319
<i>Come on baby</i>
<i>Do the locomotion</i>

559
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,879
Sorry.

560
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,551
<i>... learn than your ABCs</i>

561
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,997
<i>So come on, come on and do</i>
<i>the locomotion with me</i>

562
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,231
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.

563
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,869
- And the guys next door.
- Then he made you regular size again.

564
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,032
- And now he's made
your baby brother big.
- Right.

565
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,277
And you don't, like, think
that's unusual.

566
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,559
Oh, my God.
He's out and he's bigger.

567
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,598
- You got to help me, okay?
- This wasn't in the job description.

568
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,638
- We'll pay you overtime.
- Okay.

569
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,714
There's no way I'm changing
those diapers.

570
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,631
Come on.

571
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,430
- Adam! Adam!
- Adam! Adam!

572
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,349
Adam, where are you?
Come on!

573
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,271
Julia, be quiet and sit down.

574
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,909
Now, for the famous
Chinese blocks trick.

575
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,991
Shazam.

576
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,111
Okay.
Now for my next trick.

577
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,958
Adam!

578
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,391
Now for the disappearing
bunny trick.

579
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,268
Watch carefully.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

580
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,353
Shazam. Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?

581
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,352
- There!
- You think it's still on my head?

582
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,357
Big Bunny.

583
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,678
Bye.

584
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,679
- There he is! Come on!
- I don't care if Clifford's
at the Rand Institute this weekend.
I want him notified.

585
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,594
I also want the board of directors
in on this. Hey, what the...

586
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,115
Contact the federal marshals.
Get 'em out here. I want something
large enough to hold...

587
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,475
to hold something large.

588
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,238
Big Bunny.
Big, Big, Big bunny.

589
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,197
In big trouble.

590
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,478
- Wait. You hold it right there.
- Hey!

591
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,596
I'm just the baby-sitter.

592
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,640
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.

593
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,473
- Wayne, how's it coming?
- Just about got it, honey.

594
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,630
Hold on. I'm taking a short cut.

595
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,272
What do I do?

596
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,718
Okay, let's see
if this thing works.

597
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,112
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.

598
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,115
It works!

599
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,159
- They're getting away.
- I think they're out
of our jurisdiction.

600
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,039
Hold it.
You can't go in.

601
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,588
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.

602
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,869
Excuse me.

603
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,032
- Where are my boys? Where are they?
- Hold on, folks. Hold it.
Hold it just a minute.

604
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,557
Preston Brooks, US Marshals.
Now, we found this guy down the street
hiding in a garage.

605
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,191
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs. Szalinski. We just needed
to get the baby some more room
so he wouldn't hurt himself.

606
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,589
Of course, the mutated child
will have to undergo immediate testing.

607
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,797
That's my kid you're talking about!
Let go of me!

608
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,872
- Hold on, Mr. Szalinski.
- Let go of me!

609
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,629
You can't keep him
in that truck.

610
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,995
Don't worry.
It's all fixed up.

611
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,389
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.

612
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,153
- That's what I mean.
- I'd listen to him if I were you.

613
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,516
Look, Miss. When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

614
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,558
Mama, help.

615
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,471
Out! Out!

616
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,430
He's got a 40-inch neck.

617
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,751
- Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
- The parents are here.

618
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,469
We'll bring them to meet
the child when he's secure.

619
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,757
- I can authorize that!
- Marshal Brooks?

620
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,229
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.

621
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,676
- On what charge?
- Theft. Malicious mischief.

622
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,398
Child endangerment.

623
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,749
If you'll excuse me.

624
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,799
Clifford.
Well, I hardly know what to say.

625
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,474
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

626
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,630
Yes. Yes, you did, Charles.

627
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,235
If it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors believed
that you were right all along.

628
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:38,519
Dr. Sterling. Dr. Sterling, sir.
I can reverse my son's growth.
Just give me a chance, sir.
I can get him back to normal.

629
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,797
- You can?
- Yeah, with what, Szalinski?
Coca-Cola bottles?

630
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,678
Hmm? Maybe some, what,
chewing gum and twine?

631
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,309
- Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?
- Diane, let me handle this.

632
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,960
- Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?
- Clifford...

633
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,156
the situation demands
that I bring in the people...

634
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,198
with the expertise
and the credentials.

635
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,397
Wait a second. You think I'm just
some guy from Fresno...

636
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,313
who tinkered with crackpot
ideas in his attic?

637
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,311
Well, let me tell you something.

638
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,789
This whole country is built on
the shoulders of people who tinkered...

639
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,316
with crackpot ideas in attics
and basements and backyards.

640
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,359
- Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.
- Young man, don't presume...

641
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,829
to stand there and lecture me
about great minds...

642
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,717
and great inventors.

643
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,633
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

644
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,280
or been involved
with anyone else who is.

645
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,033
I certainly don't intend
to start now.

646
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,553
- Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?
- You're fired.

647
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,712
- What?
- You're fired.

648
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,317
So Szalinski, what have you got in mind,
so we can get that kid of yours...

649
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,992
back to normal size by bedtime?

650
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,868
- Well, sir, the prototype's in the van...
- Hold on, folks. We've got a problem.

651
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,997
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

652
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,913
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

653
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,911
- I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

654
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,153
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.

655
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,829
<i>- He broke out?</i>
- He busted out of the truck
and knocked it completely over.

656
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,832
<i>- What's he doing now?</i>
- He's just standing there.
But he's smiling.

657
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,230
- Now, Adam, sit down.
- Nick, I don't think sitting's
such a good idea.

658
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,117
Ooh, toys.

659
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,991
- He did what?
- Put your son and the baby-sitter
in his pocket and left.

660
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,196
He's always doing that. I find
the strangest things in his pockets.

661
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,319
- Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?
- I don't know.

662
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,392
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

663
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,040
- That runs alongside high-voltage lines.
- Oh.

664
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,509
And yesterday when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

665
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,831
- And you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.
- Of course!

666
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,754
- I don't understand any of this.
- Electromagnetic flux.

667
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,957
Around every operating
electrical device, there's a flux.

668
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,828
- Like an electromagnetic force field.
- That's what's causing the baby to grow.

669
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,277
Would this electromagnetic, uh...
Would it surround neon lights too?

670
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,478
- Yeah, why?
- Your kid. He's headed toward Las Vegas.

671
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,556
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

672
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,113
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

673
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,751
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for. At last!
Sterling has gone too far this time.

674
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,788
The board is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.

675
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,394
Whatever it takes, just get
the situation under control.

676
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,517
Yeah, I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

677
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,637
Fine. I'll get the clearance. Charles,
Just-Just-Just handle this for us.

678
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,598
We'll... We'll do
the right thing by you.

679
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,394
<i>Police reports just in say that</i>
<i>some kind of large creature...</i>

680
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,473
<i>has just escaped from a government</i>
<i>caravan and is heading toward the city.</i>

681
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,435
Mrs. Szalinski, if he heads for
the lights, he has to come this way.

682
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,479
- According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still for 12.2 seconds.
- What?

683
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,790
His increased mass requires
a longer period of exposure.

684
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,158
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old to hold
still for 12 point anything seconds?

685
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,869
She's right, Doctor,
we tried to have his picture
taken a month ago. Total bust.

686
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,396
We're just pulling up now, Dan.
There are a lot of police cars gathered.

687
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,393
- We'll find out what's going on.
- Call the paramedics now!

688
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,119
All right, here's a shot.
Okay.

689
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,033
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site...

690
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,954
of what will certainly become the
most important news story of the decade.

691
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,555
Dan, I'm seeing a giant.

692
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,391
Oh, my God.

693
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,278
Oh, Adam.

694
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,717
- Well, honey, he looks okay.
- Let me see.

695
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,316
Do you think this is gonna
affect him for life? I mean,
something like this could ruin a kid.

696
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,678
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,
help him see the big picture.

697
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,469
Baby.
There they are!

698
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,677
- Let's move into position!
- I'm with you, pal!

699
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,950
- Help!
- Get us down from here!
- Get us down!

700
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,793
- We're up here!
- We're up in the pocket!
- This is Constance Winters...

701
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,192
reporting live
on the progress of the giant baby
who has just been identified...

702
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,669
as Adam Szalinski
from Vista Del Mar.

703
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,429
- Let's go.
- The governor's on the phone
for you, sir.

704
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,359
Yes, Governor.
He's a pretty big baby.

705
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,549
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

706
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,393
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

707
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,598
- Baby? Look at him.
- Hey, we're his parents, okay?
We'll handle this.

708
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,717
- Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?
- How do we handle this?

709
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,277
- Ready!
- Watch out! Look out! Look out!

710
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,909
Mommy. Mom!

711
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,117
- Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

712
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,192
- Adam, baby, Mommy's here.
- Nicky, I'm gonna get you
out of here right away!

713
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,589
Okay, Dad, but hurry!

714
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,831
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

715
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,275
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

716
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,834
Adam, now sit down
really slowly.

717
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,196
I got it! Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.

718
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,111
- I need something called Big Dummy?
- No, Bunny!

719
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,873
- Bunny?
- It's his favorite toy!

720
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,155
It's the kid's favorite toy.

721
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,399
A helicopter is approaching
with what looks like...

722
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,438
a giant stuffed animal of
some sort hanging from it.

723
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,036
- Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous!

724
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,918
- Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,197
It's all primed. Be ready
to activate as soon as he's down.

726
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,191
I'll be fine.

727
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:32,079
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

728
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,276
Tell me I'm not seeing this.

731
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,634
<i>- Up above the world so high</i>
- I told you my Dad would have a plan.

732
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,713

<i>How I wonder what you are</i>

737
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,432
Oh, I'm tired.
Are you tired, Big Bunny?

738
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,876
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.

739
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,872
I can't remember
when I was this tired.

740
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,033
- Get ready, Dr. Sterling.
He's getting blinky.
- Yeah, me too.

741
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,031
- I don't know what to do.
- He's getting sleepy!

742
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,190
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.

743
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,558
I got an idea.
Why don't we all have a nice...

744
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,073
- No!
- long...

745
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,674
- Don't say it!
- nap?

746
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,320
- Brace yourself!
- No nap!

747
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,951
Whoa! Help! Help! Hang on!
Get me away from him! Move me away!

748
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,349
No nap!

749
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,749
- I get it! No nap!
- Hold on, Dad!

750
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,832
- Take me up or put me down!
Take me away!
- Roy, let's move in closer!

751
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,832
- I'm gonna jump! I'm gonna jump!
- Release the bunny.

752
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,234
- Whoa!
- Dad!

753
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,470
Release it now!

754
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,228
- Run!
- Run!
- Whoa!

755
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,434
- Dad, this is Mandy.
- Hi...

756
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,196
Stay right there, kids. There's
absolutely nothing to worry about.

757
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,078
I feel a whole lot better.

758
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,789
- That's my dad.
- He seems really nice.

759
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,959
Run, Dad!
Watch out for his foot!

760
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,829
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

761
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,869
- He's headed for the strip.
- You little devil.

762
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,075
He's heading toward the city. We'll
follow and bring you a live update.

763
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,073
Adam Szalinski, this is your
Mommy talking. You stop right now!

764
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,073
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs. Szalinski. I'm sure he expects
his mommy to be bigger than he is.

765
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,278
To him you're just...
Well, you're nothing more
than a little talking doll.

766
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,473
Nothing can stop him now.

767
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,116
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want, but
we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

768
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,634
- All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

769
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,235
Dr. Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

770
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,357
- Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.
- Just so you're aware, sir.

771
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,318
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

772
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,109
Frankly, Captain, I'm not under
the jurisdiction of the state militia.
Your orders mean nothing to me.

773
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,111
<i>A giant infant is</i>
<i>heading toward the city.</i>

774
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,670
<i>The baby is over 50 feet tall and</i>
<i>appears to be growing even bigger</i>
<i>at an alarming rate.</i>

775
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,719
- All right, let's move it, Captain, now.
- lf it's okay with you,
I'll just sit tight.
<i>- Scientists say this may be caused by...</i>

776
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,916
<i>More on this story</i>
<i>as it develops.</i>

777
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,030
There's something down
by my foot.

778
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,236
- Look at this.
- Wow.

779
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,709
Let's see what else is down here.

780
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,310
Cereal. Hey cool, want some?

781
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,675
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

782
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,671
Have a raisin.

783
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,230
Please clear the streets
for your own safety.

784
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,835
Please stay indoors!
This is an emergency!

785
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,593
All pedestrians
are in grave danger.

786
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,830
Please clear the streets!

787
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,111
<i>This is the Emergency Broadcast System.</i>
<i>This is not a test.</i>

788
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,794
<i>A human baby of abnormal proportions</i>
<i>is approaching the city.</i>

789
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,670
<i>The giant appears</i>
<i>to be growing at a tremendous rate</i>
<i>and has now reached 100 feet.</i>

790
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,751
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

791
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,310
No, they don't do this for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.

792
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,075
Listen, babe, there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

793
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,117
- Of course, I could be wrong.
- Peekaboo.

794
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,151
Is he growing
or are we shrinking?

795
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,313
It's amazing! He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

796
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,477
Adam! Put us down!
You put us down now!

797
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,318
<i>Howdy, partners.</i>

798
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,675
<i>Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.</i>

799
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,356
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

800
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,110
He's toddling down the center
of Fremont Street.

801
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,475
He knows not to go in
the street by himself.

802
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,471
There's no telling
how huge he might get.

803
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,109
Especially if he touches
any of those lights.
We've got to get him away from them.

804
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,634
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

805
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,109
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

806
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,638
- Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.
- Follow that ice-cream truck.

807
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,672
We'll need a really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an ice-cream truck
real fast?

808
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,231
- I can burn rubber.
- Well, start burning it.
We'll be with you on the walkie-talkie.

809
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,074
- Preston Brooks, US Marshals. We're
commandeering this vehicle. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute!

810
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,954
- What's that?
- It's a tranquillizer cannon.
It's used on large mammals.

811
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,315
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

812
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,790
It's like a normal injection, but
on a slightly larger scale, of course.

813
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,634
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem
like the type of...

814
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,554
Well, naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.

815
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,509
Reporting live from the famous Glitter
Gulch where certainly the biggest story
of the year is unfolding.

816
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,036
Casino owners are understandably upset.
They've been ordered
to evacuate the area.

817
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,588
The answers to many of our questions lie
with two key players in this drama...

818
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,591
- Dr. Clifford Sterling
of Sterling Laboratories...
- What we do know is that a baby...

819
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,037
by the name of Adam Szalinski
has somehow measured over 100 feet tall.

820
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,953
Stop the clapping.

821
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,670
- I got a plan.
- Great. 'Cause I'm
starting to get airsick.

822
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,958
We'll pull the thread out
of the bottom of the pocket and
use it as a rope to slide down.

823
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,157
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

824
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,549
But so far all the casinos
are still standing.

825
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,311
Watch out!

826
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,229
- Hi.
- Hey! Hey, don't! What are you doin'?

827
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,709
Stop! Stop! Stop!

828
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,278
We'll have to jump.

829
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,909
Hold on.

830
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,754
Don't look down. Watch out
for the gearshift. Jump!

831
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,877
- Go!
- I'm trying!

832
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,757
- Truly, I'm trying.
<i>- Stayin' alive</i>

833
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,594
- Hurry! Hurry, do something!
<i>- Stayin alive</i>
- I'm used to an automatic.

834
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,875
<i>- Stayin alive</i>
- We've gotta get out of here.

835
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,470
Toy car!

836
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,755
Buckle up!

837
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,073
- Adam, get him away from me!
- Adam!

838
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,311
Adam! Adam! Don't eat us!

839
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,913
Whoa!

840
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,518
We're here live in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski...

841
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,831
who has lifted a small yellow
sports car into the air...

842
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,990
with three unidentified
persons in it.

843
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,231
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,
a boy and a girl...

844
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,153
and a man dressed
in an Indian costume.

845
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,360
- What's he doing?
- He's taking something out
of his pocket. A peppermint!

846
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,550
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

847
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,630
<i>Howdy, partners.</i>

848
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,759
That car is like a toy to him.

849
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,877
I hope this thing
has air bags!

850
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,357
- Do something, Nick! Tell him to stop!
- I can't! He's too big!

851
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,670
We gotta get him away from those lights
before he touches any of them.

852
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,796
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

853
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,269
- We're almost set.
<i>- Roger.</i>

854
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,199
- No!
- Watch the tree!

855
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,878
Oh, no!

856
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,190
Just a big baby
with his toy.

857
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,790
Coming through!

858
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,552
Get out of the way!

859
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,279
- Come on, Adam, put it down.
Put it down.
- Come on, sweetheart. Put it down.

860
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,116
What's he doing now?

861
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,318
Put us down!
Put us down!

862
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,231
He put it down.

863
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,073
Pick us up!
Pick us up!

864
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,552
Oh, my God! We're gonna die! We're gonna
die! We're gonna die in a convertible!

865
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,200
- What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

866
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,794
Okay. We're set.

867
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,431
- No! Wait!
- Hold it! Hold it!

868
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,511
We need him to get the kids down.

869
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,111
Cut it off!

870
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,911
- I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God!

871
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,631
Whatever you do,
don't look down!

872
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,792
- Nick, don't let go! Please!
- I won't.

873
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,075
I'm gonna pull you
back up, okay?

874
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,151
- Nick! Mandy!
- Hold on!

875
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,198
- But you gotta help.
- Okay!

876
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,511
Get the car, Adam!

877
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,877
Adam! Pick up the car!

878
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,396
- Adam, get the car!
- Come on, Adam. Come on.
- Come on, sweetheart.

879
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,357
Come on. I got you.

880
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,714
Car fall down!

881
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,235
Lock your door.

882
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,511
Thank you, Adam.

883
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,512
- He put 'em in the pocket!
- Honey, we can't wait any longer.

884
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,830
Let's do it.

885
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,356
Everyone stand by now.
Attention, all casinos, wait
for my signal to turn off your lights.

886
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,034
Marshal Brooks,
bring on the truck.

887
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,990
Nick, come on.

888
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,997
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.

889
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,110
Go, Golden Gate.

890
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,668
Las Vegas Club.

891
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,718
Now, hit the searchlights.

892
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,310
Go, Brooks!

893
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,228
Lucky Lady. Jackpot.

894
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,198
- Come on, Adam.
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby. Go for it.
- Go for it.

895
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,840
Glitter Gulch. Golden Goose.

896
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,993
- Ice cream.
- Coin Castle.

897
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,789
Binion's Horseshoe. Vegas World.

898
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,757
This must be another
one of my dad's plans.

899
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,637
- Star Palace.
- Great.

900
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,269
4 Queens. The Fremont.

901
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,598
- It's working, Wayne.
- Go, Adam!
- He really likes ice cream.

902
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,677
- Yes!
- It's working!

903
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,276
- Ice cream!
- Where are you guys?

904
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,238
<i>This kid's gaining on me.</i>

905
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,718
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.

906
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,876
Brooks said he caught the ice-cream
truck just outside of town.

907
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,110
Next thing I know, he grabbed
it right off the truck.

908
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,988
<i>- What'd he do with it?</i>
- What do you think he did with it?

909
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,594
- You got another idea?
- I will. Come on. Let's go.

910
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,831
- Dr. Sterling?
- Wayne!

911
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,675
Do you remember how we got Adam to
hold still to have his picture taken?
I put him in my lap and I held him.

912
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,558
- Yeah?
- Honey, he needs me.

913
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:15,112
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

914
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,830
- No, Diane. It's a crazy idea...
- Wayne!

915
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,595
For almost 20 years I've watched
you have one crazy idea after another.

916
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,353
It's my turn
to have just one.

917
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,712
Fire!

918
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,920
- My guitar.
- Uh-oh!

919
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,150
- What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar!

920
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,110
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

921
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,116
Diane, I should be
doing this, not you.

922
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,316
There's one thing
every little kid knows.

923
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,153
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.

924
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,595
But-But-But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

925
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,716
Too little power and you'll
grow too slowly like Adam.

926
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,519
- And too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

927
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,630
Wayne, time to get large.

928
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,431
Here's your soda, sir.

929
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,239
- What do you need a Coke bottle for?
- I don't.

930
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,390
- Just the bottom.
- Oh.

931
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,237
Tom, I'm here just outside the Hard Rock
Cafe. The giant baby is approaching.

932
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,438
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?

933
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,353
A giant what? Baby?

934
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,917
Guitar!

935
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,436
- Oh, my God!
- Let's get out of here!

936
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,232
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

937
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,356
Adam! Don't touch the guitar!

938
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,919
I'll save ya!

939
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,356
No, Adam!
Adam, put down the guitar.

940
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,956
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again!

941
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,918
This is as fast as we
can go safely, Doctor!

942
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,353
Constance Winters live across
the street from the Hard Rock Cafe.

943
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,591
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

944
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,636
He's trying to play a tune!

945
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,429
- Bring me into range and hold it steady.
- Doctor, wait a minute.

946
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,512
Now, if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

947
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,831
Well, we'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

948
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,198
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the airplane.

949
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,635
Airplane. Hi.

950
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:40,871
Hold it. Steady.

951
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,390
- They're shooting at Adam!
- I assume that little maneuver
was an error, Captain.

952
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:50,756
Now steady, or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

953
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,559
Hey! Pick on somebody
your own size.

954
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,798
Ow!

955
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,272
All right, let's go again.

956
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,312
Dan, the...

957
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,029
Hold it stead...

958
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,953
Back off!

959
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,190
Yes, ma'am.

960
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,554
You tell 'em!
That's my mom!

961
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,872
- I need a vacation.
- Whoa. Look at that mother.

962
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,512
- Come here, baby.
- Mama!

963
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,590
Come to Mommy.

964
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,510
Come here, baby.
Come to Mommy!

965
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,878
Mom! Easy, Mom!

966
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,315
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

967
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,477
- Mommy's here.
- Everything it's got, Doctor!

968
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,471
Roger!

969
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:53,192
- You crying?
- Yeah. It's okay to cry
when you're so happy.

970
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,788
The bearings in the generator are
about to burn out. We better do it.

971
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,871
Okay, now, look at Daddy.
Smile for Daddy.

972
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,077
- There he is.
- Daddy.

973
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,072
Wayne, 1450!
It's all she can take!

974
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,556
- Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

975
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,715
Come on, Wayne.

976
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,356
- Look, Adam, there's Daddy.
- Daddy!

977
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,318
Honey, you did it.

978
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,197
Adam!

979
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,510
Adam.

980
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,512
- You gave us quite a scare, little man.
- I knew you could do it, honey.

981
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,875
There he is!
Let me through!

982
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,591
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

983
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,959
Dr. Hendrickson,
that looked like some sort of rifle
that you were shooting at my baby.

984
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:07,715
They were tranquillizer cartridges. They
wouldn't have hurt him, I assure you.

985
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,713
Oh. Tranquillizer cartridges.

986
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,039
- Never cross Mommy.
- We got an emergency here.

987
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,955
Dr. Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect
of having to find a new career.

988
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,715
Hey, big fella, is this
what you were lookin' for?

989
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,837
Wayne! Nick and Mandy!

990
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,957
- Weren't they in Adam's pocket?
- In Adam's pocket!

991
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,678
- Don't tell me.
- Oh, my God.

992
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,230
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move!

993
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:50,711
Don't worry. I have highly specialized
equipment to deal with this.

994
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,509
I'll need the helmet
and I'll need the dog.

995
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,477
<i>Good morning, Las Vegas.</i>
<i>All vehicles are asked...</i>

996
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,518
<i>to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe</i>
<i>where inventor Wayne Szalinski...</i>

997
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,478
<i>is conducting a one-man search</i>
<i>to find some missing children.</i>

998
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,712
<i>It was Szalinski's matter-expanding</i>
<i>machine that was responsible</i>
<i>for last night's amazing events.</i>

999
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,588
<i>Dr. Clifford Sterling</i>
<i>has just announced...</i>

1000
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,514
I guess your father's about
the most famous guy in the world today.

1001
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,268
And I guess you're
about the bravest.

1002
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,111
That's for saving my life.

1003
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,714
It wasn't much.

1004
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,394
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

1005
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,233
What I did wasn't so much.

1006
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,188
<i>Ours if we want it</i>

1007
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,989
<i>Tonight has our initials on it</i>

1008
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,435
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

1009
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,354
I think it may be a while
before they find us.

1010
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,035
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.

1011
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,715
We're not all that different.

1012
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,679
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...

1013
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,672
I guess the world needs people
who are different.

1014
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,275
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

1015
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:11,830
<i>We'll appear sometime</i>

1016
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,037
<i>Maybe tonight is yours and mine</i>

1017
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,877
- Are they okay?
- Yep. I think we better give 'em
a couple of minutes though.

1018
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,839
- What are we gonna do about that?
- Adam, look!

1019
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,990
Big, Big, Big Bunny.

1020
