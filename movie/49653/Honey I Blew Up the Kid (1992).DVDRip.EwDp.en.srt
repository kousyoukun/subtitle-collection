1
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:27,652
Good morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.

2
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,810
Morning, Ozzie.

3
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:47,954
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

4
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,766
Nick, breakfast.

5
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:26,097
Nick.
- I'm coming.

6
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,521
Your hands are getting bigger now

7
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:34,732
Your arms and legs are longer now

8
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:39,344
You even sense your insides
grow when Mom and Dad...

9
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:42,707
Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

10
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,272
Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

11
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,705
He gets out of the playpen.
- No, I fixed it.

12
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:54,281
Sweetheart, I hate to remind you, but
the last time you fixed the playpen...

13
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,408
...he still got out of it.

14
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,437
Well, he won't get out this time.

15
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:02,718
Hiya.
Will you, big buddy, huh?

16
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,584
I'm certainly capable of fixing
a playpen, aren't I?

17
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,211
You're just a little baby, after all.
- Your hat?

18
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:09,901
It's my helmet.
- New one?

19
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,256
Yeah, it's a new one.

20
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,030
See, it shaves me.
See that?

21
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,402
There.

22
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,931
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

23
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,511
Mom, in the first place, I'm not
the first girl who has ever gone...

24
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,226
...away to college.

25
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,513
And in the second place, we're...
- Mom.

26
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,229
Excuse me.

27
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,107
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in. That's it.

28
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:32,027
Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, yeah, I want to hear a noise.

29
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,664
This one?
- Yeah. Now, this time...

30
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:34,154
This one.

31
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:36,465
Okay.

32
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,836
Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.

33
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,329
More?

34
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,914
Sure.

35
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:47,667
Mom, let's say you were a girl.
- I think I can visualize it.

36
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,879
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me, I mean.

37
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,341
It's a rhetorical question, Mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

38
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:57,731
Am I any girl in particular?
- No.

39
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:02,265
Just a girl I might, I don't know,
ask to go to the movies or something.

40
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,436
Nicky, you are turning into
a very handsome young man.

41
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,523
You're gonna be just like your dad.
- Honey...

42
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:13,704
...can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

43
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,533
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone...

44
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:23,370
...the baby-sitter's number's in the kitchen.

45
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:26,498
What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

46
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,809
Nick? Our Nick?

47
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:33,682
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

48
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,285
Uh-oh.

49
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:46,411
I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk.

50
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,186
Nick, stop.

51
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,494
Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

52
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:55,370
Yes, I should hope so.
Come on.

53
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:59,641
Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

54
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,327
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

55
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,831
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

56
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:11,600
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.

57
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:15,594
I never said you were stupid.

58
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,405
Taxi's here.

59
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,192
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?

60
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,729
Mmm, fantastic.

61
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,231
The taxi's gonna
take Mommy to the airport.

62
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:37,069
And then Mommy's gonna show Amy
her new room at school.

63
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,196
Hopefully they'll tire him out at day care.

64
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,490
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

65
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,116
No nap.
- Honey...

66
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,650
...we don't say the 'n' word
around two-year-olds.

67
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:47,162
Adam.

68
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,145
Coloured car.
- Okay, now, Adam's lunch...

69
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:51,458
...is in the freezer...

70
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,135
Adam.
- And I put the baby-sitter's...

71
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,503
...number on the refrigerator.

72
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,164
Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting some...

73
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,006
Diane, Diane, relax.

74
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,760
Don't you think I can handle
things around here?

75
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:04,486
Of course you can, honey.

76
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,988
Break it up, guys.

77
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,520
Don't worry, Dad. She'll get there,
realize there's nothing to do...

78
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,726
...turn around,
and come right back.

79
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,879
Bye.

80
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:22,077
Bye, Nick.
- Come on, Amy. We gotta get going.

81
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:27,077
Oh. Don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

82
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,664
Gosh, the time. I got to get you
to work. I got a big test today.

83
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,437
Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

84
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,901
Come on. Come on.

85
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,821
Come on. Come on.

86
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,779
You can do it.
Atta girl.

87
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:59,544
Szalinski test number 1277.

88
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,417
Crystal Group 5.

89
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,614
Shouldn't we wait for Szalinski?

90
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,993
Maybe this will teach him
to be here on time.

91
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:11,465
Szalinski isn't running the show.
I am.

92
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:15,186
This better work this time,
so concentrate.

93
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,001
Ten seconds.

94
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:20,482
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

95
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:25,562
...four, three, two, one, zero.

96
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,464
Here.

97
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:03,338
Sorry, everybody. There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun,

98
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,299
and I-I lost power.

99
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,345
And my son got a job for the summer...
Wet and Wild. I had to drop him off.

100
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,197
What's that stuff on your face?

101
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:16,520
Oh, excuse me, Dr Hendrickson?
- I'm sick and tired of this.

102
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:20,488
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments...

103
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:21,525
...shrinking matter.

104
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,902
But reversing the process,
enlarging matter...

105
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:27,364
...has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

106
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,967
Clifford Sterling demands results.

107
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:34,145
His board of directors demands results,
the United States government...

108
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,038
...demands results...

109
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:37,374
...and as project director, I...
- Excuse me, Dr Hendrickson.

110
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:40,317
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project co-director,

111
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,878
I intend to deliver results.

112
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:44,197
L-I've been doing some work on my own
on the problem, sir.

113
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:44,715
Yes, Wayne.

114
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,133
I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...

115
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:48,677
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

116
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,763
When you licensed your device
to Sterling Labs, you were promised...

117
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:55,308
...that the finest minds in the country
would be working on it, and they are.

118
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,643
I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

119
00:10:56,747 --> 00:11:02,863
But I-I think if you look at these
notes, you'll find that although...

120
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,075
Mandy?
- Yeah, Rick?

121
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,650
Nick.
- Nick.

122
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:42,647
Hey, Nick, your dad's here
in his spaceship. The Dweezil Wheels.

123
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,875
Hey, Nicky.
Want a ride?

124
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:51,031
Hey, look. It's the Nerdmobile.
- Hey, look at that.

125
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:53,705
Oh, man.
- Have a nice flight.

126
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:58,218
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

127
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:01,521
Nothing.

128
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,922
Dad, were you ever popular in school?
- You bet.

129
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,050
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

130
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:13,274
We were happenin' guys.

131
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,472
So Mom tells me that there's some girl?

132
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,662
What?

133
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:22,288
No. No, I was...
I was just wondering.

134
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,880
How was your flight?
Uh-huh. N-No, fine.

135
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,957
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.

136
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:43,938
What noise? Uh, it was just
a bad connection, that's all.

137
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,559
The baby?
Well, h-he's fine.

138
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,525
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it. He can't get out.

139
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:56,736
Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

140
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,696
Uh-huh. Yeah.

141
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,910
Hey, stop it.

142
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,915
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

143
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,086
No, everything's fine.

144
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,535
Boy, you worry too much.

145
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,050
What? The chicken?

146
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,836
Well, the chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

147
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,542
So I was thinking,
with Mom and Amy out of town...

148
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:29,171
...that this would give us guys
a chance to, uh, talk about, uh...

149
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,466
...you know, the birds and the bees.

150
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,745
Here, Nicky.

151
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:59,826
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny? What?

152
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:04,331
I was thinking we got to be nice to
our brother Nick. You know why? No, why?

153
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:07,485
Well, because he moved away to
a new place now, and he's got to make...

154
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,127
...all new friends, just like me and you.

155
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,754
Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,756
Shall we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

157
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,841
What song shall we sing?
- 'ABCs.'

158
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,802
How about 'Twinkle, Twinkle'?
- 'ABC.'

159
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,991
'ABC'?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,482
Twinkle, twinkle...
- 'ABCs'.

161
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,134
Let's sing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.'

162
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:23,475
'ABCs.'

163
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:28,313
'ABCs'? Okay, first 'ABCs.'
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P

164
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,607
Now 'Twinkle, Twinkle,' okay?

165
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,870
Okay.

166
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:38,669
Twinkle, twinkle little star

167
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:40,884
How I won...

168
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:45,390
What you are...

169
00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:48,458
...lt'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

170
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:51,480
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

171
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:54,646
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself...

172
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,466
...to one crazy idea after another.

173
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:01,054
I have to tell you,
the board of directors is very worried.

174
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:03,807
If you'll pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.

175
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,865
Hello?

176
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,873
What was that?
- It was a balloon popping,

177
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:09,688
Dr Hendrickson.

178
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,940
I got the idea while singing my kid to sleep.

179
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,984
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force...

180
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,987
...you don't allow the molecules time
to expand, and the balloon pops.

181
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,629
Problem?
- No, Szalinski.

182
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,804
Oh, him.

183
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:26,246
Why Clifford insists on keeping
him involved is absolutely beyond me.

184
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,317
If I were running this project
by myself right now,

185
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:29,624
we'd be neck-deep in apples...

186
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,460
...the size of Buicks.

187
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,920
There are those of us on
the board who would agree with you.

188
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,881
...fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure...

189
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:39,843
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

190
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:44,241
...to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

191
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:48,727
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion...

192
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,023
...especially if you're the one to
actually make this thing work.

193
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:55,609
...thereby allowing the
molecules time to expand...

194
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,861
...without tearing the atomic fabric.

195
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,738
Hello?

196
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,698
Szalinsk... Szalinski...

197
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:04,534
...why don't you write up this, uh,
balloon research of yours?

198
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,499
I can do the math and have it
on your desk tomorrow.

199
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:08,914
No, that's not necessary.

200
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:12,850
All right, have a good weekend, Szalinski.

201
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,863
'Have a good weekend, Szalinski'?

202
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,302
Hello?
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

203
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,897
Sure.
Mandy, phone.

204
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,364
Hello?
- Hi, Mandy?

205
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,754
I'll fix it.

206
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,545
Daddy.
- Hey, what are you doing up, little guy?

207
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:45,762
Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?

208
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,451
Yeah, sure.

209
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:50,174
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.

210
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:54,630
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky...

211
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,748
...down to the lab and we'll play?

212
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,945
Okay, guys.

213
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,968
See, Adam, this is where Daddy works.

214
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:05,554
Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

215
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,722
Got to be a little bit discreet about this.

216
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,228
Huh?

217
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,433
Mr Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.

218
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:15,731
Hello. You working today?

219
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,026
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little bit.

220
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,430
Wow.
- Wow.

221
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,911
This is some lab.
- Some lab.

222
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:32,080
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

223
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,889
Way better.
- Way better.

224
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:41,011
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr Hendrickson, please?

225
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:49,172
Call up a command directory
labeled 'primary laser drive.'

226
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,733
Tell me what it says under 'intensity.'

227
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:58,294
It says 'access denied.'
- Access denied?

228
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:06,438
Got to figure out some way how
to lower the intensity of the laser.

229
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,846
Hey, Dad.

230
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,194
We could diffuse it maybe.

231
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,564
That's a good idea.

232
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:28,772
Now we'll set final target.
- Target what, Dad?

233
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,395
Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

234
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:42,260
Come on. Let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really Big Bunny, huh?

235
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:52,119
Yes, sir. I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

236
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:57,009
No, you did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

237
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,001
Well, that's it for me.

238
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,547
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

239
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,736
There you go.

240
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:27,758
Thirty seconds.

241
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,675
Twenty-five seconds.

242
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,538
Twenty seconds.

243
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:41,803
19, 18, 17, 16...

244
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,815
...15, 14, 13...

245
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,818
...12, 11, 10...

246
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:52,233
...9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

247
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,741
Dang. Power surge.
- 3, 2, 1...

248
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,753
Quick, the abort switches.
- Zero.

249
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,962
Unable to abort.

250
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,464
Joe, what's happening up here?

251
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,682
Uh, Mr Szalinski.
Uh, your security clearance...

252
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:38,892
...denies you access to the equipment...

253
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:41,019
...without Dr Hendrickson's permission.

254
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:45,023
You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

255
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,331
Uh, Mr Szalinski...

256
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:52,093
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

257
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:58,343
That baby of yours.
Sure starting to get big.

258
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,518
See you, Smitty.

259
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:10,474
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

260
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,886
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission to work...

261
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:15,220
...on your own invention?

262
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,036
Well, Nick, Dad's a member
of a team now, and I'm working...

263
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,558
...with some real talented people.

264
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:25,423
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.

265
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,716
Okay, bud. Looks like Daddy...

266
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,552
...needs to spend a little quality time
with Nick, okay?

267
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:59,723
So I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.
You're gonna have yourself a good time.

268
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:01,913
Nick.
- Yeah.

269
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,536
You puttin' on a little bit of weight?

270
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,058
I'm big.

271
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:27,626
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

272
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,128
Maybe kind of a low-cal thing.

273
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,798
What do you think, huh?
It's gonna be good.

274
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:36,635
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.

275
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,012
This guy's gonna keep you company,
and I'm gonna make...

276
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:42,750
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

277
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:47,283
555-5654.

278
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:52,628
Okay, so lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?

279
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,779
Yeah?
- Hi, is this Mandy Park?

280
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:56,196
Yeah.

281
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,866
Uh, hi, this is, uh, Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?

282
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,703
Uh, 3:30?
Sounds okay, Mr Schlitzminski.

283
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:06,998
Uh, Szalinski, dear.
- Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

284
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,106
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,

285
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,544
I actually have to do anything...

286
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:12,887
...like change diapers
or clean up or something,

287
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,548
in which case, the price goes up.

288
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:17,342
Oh, no. All you have to do
is just-just watch him, really.

289
00:23:17,446 --> 00:23:20,017
Okay, see yOu at 3:30.
- Okay.

290
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,370
Okay.

291
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:27,754
Okay. Are these Quark's or yours?

292
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,091
You just stay here, okay?

293
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,444
She sounded great on the phone.
- I want to go to a restaurant.

294
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,538
You want to go to a restaurant?
But I just made this stuff.

295
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:38,280
It's gonna be good.

296
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,504
I want to go eat in restaurant.

297
00:23:41,596 --> 00:23:45,996
Well, um, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh, let me take your order.

298
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,081
What would you like?
- I want the duck.

299
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:50,714
Duck. The duck...
The duck is not very good tonight.

300
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,461
Uh, can I recommend the special?

301
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,797
Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have soup du jour.

302
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,467
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

303
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,700
Would you like 'em?
- Okay.

304
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:01,428
All right.

305
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,837
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

306
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:31,541
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

307
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,960
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert Six
I wanted to see.

308
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:37,047
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

309
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:40,857
I'll check show times.
- Okay, and then maybe afterwards,

310
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,387
we can get a bite to eat or something.

311
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,576
Big, Big Bunny.

312
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,295
What's that?

313
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,633
What's gotten into him?

314
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:12,552
Dad, how?
- Where were you in the lab this morning?

315
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:13,500
Were you watching Adam?

316
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:15,961
He was off to the side.
- But at the moment of discharge,

317
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:16,670
where was he?

318
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:20,590
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side. Wasn't he?

319
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:23,150
Somehow, I don't think so.

320
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,250
Boo.

321
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:48,931
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make everything okay.

322
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,132
Okay, we got to get him back to the lab,
analyse the data...

323
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,626
...and reverse the process.

324
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:58,211
One thing, Dad.
- What?

325
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:01,432
Do you think the security guard might
get suspicious with us walking in...

326
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:02,549
...with a seven-foot baby?

327
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,739
Good point.

328
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:37,376
This will cover your head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.

329
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,893
There. He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

330
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:46,362
All right. Okay.
Now just act natural.

331
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,938
Come on, bud.
Atta boy.

332
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:54,033
Smitty. Smitty. Um, I forgot the,
um, the keys, uh, to my van,

333
00:26:54,137 --> 00:26:55,894
and I couldn't-couldn't start the van.

334
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:57,730
It's in the lab.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going...

335
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:58,814
...to use anything in there...

336
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,201
...because of my security, you know,
access... a-access thing,

337
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:02,359
which you mentioned earlier.

338
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:06,451
So I'm just gonna get
the keys in the lab now.

339
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:10,555
Adam.

340
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,263
Come on, down.

341
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:21,266
Szalinski.
- Go back up.

342
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:23,672
Just stopped by to do
some, uh, computations...

343
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,397
...in the... in the database.

344
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:30,050
The database has been erased.
Our entire experiment, gone.

345
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:31,054
Get back. Back.

346
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,914
Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.

347
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:33,682
It can't be.

348
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:37,310
Sure it can, if the main controller was
trying to compensate laser intensity...

349
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:40,105
...for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot...

350
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:43,942
...causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

351
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:47,711
Who was that?
- Who?

352
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,574
The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a-a friend of mine.

353
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:53,118
Well, what language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

354
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,002
You let a foreigner into the lab.
- He's not a foreigner. He's my wife's

355
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,372
Uncle Yanosh from Yugoslavia.

356
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,709
He's family, and he just wanted to see
the lab, and I... and I brought him here.

357
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,836
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

358
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,428
225, the IQ on that man.
An extended brainpan.

359
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:06,590
Extended brainpan?

360
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:09,384
Bafroom.
- No bathroom right now, Adam.

361
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,429
Did he say 'bathroom'?
- Bafoon. Bafoon. Yugoslavian.

362
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,431
It's a term of, uh, of appreciation.

363
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:17,976
'Bafoon: Thank you for bringing me down
here on a Saturday to the lab...

364
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,687
...to look around,' that's all.

365
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,955
How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?

366
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:24,107
Well, that doesn't concern you.

367
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:26,833
You're off the project.

368
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,686
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.

369
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,446
Well, maybe I don't.

370
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,282
So why don't you call Clifford Sterling
personally and plead your case.

371
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:35,122
However, after this morning's little
escapade, and the time and money...

372
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,119
...it'll cost Sterling Labs...

373
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,330
I don't think the old man
will have a great deal of sympathy.

374
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:43,621
So I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment of having...

375
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,384
...to be escorted to the gate.

376
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:52,427
Start working data restoration backwards
from 8:56 this morning...

377
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:55,013
...to the exact time the system crashed.

378
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:58,118
I want to know what he was up to.

379
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:07,943
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then...

380
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,279
...they'd know that you were able to
make it work when nobody else could.

381
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:14,991
Look, Nick. Remember we made you kids
promise never, ever to tell anyone...

382
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:17,516
...you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?

383
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:17,828
Yeah.

384
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:20,560
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,

385
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:21,832
to undergo countless tests...

386
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:26,211
...to go through endless observations
and who knows what else.

387
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:30,479
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

388
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,863
I don't know.
What I do know is...

389
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:41,064
...we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

390
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,420
Hi, guys.
I'm home.

391
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,626
Where'd this come from?

392
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:04,097
What do we do?
- I don't know.

393
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,752
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

394
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:09,921
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean, older.

395
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:13,940
Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

396
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,094
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

397
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:19,614
I'll just explain.

398
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:23,810
Sure. It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

399
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:26,488
...to our family.

400
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:30,108
I'll just tell the truth.
- Then beg for mercy.

401
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,298
Coloured car.

402
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:47,161
What was that all about?
- Um, I had a little trouble...

403
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:47,876
...with the van.

404
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,797
L-I-I thought I put it in, uh, in-in
park, and it went into reverse...

405
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,049
'cause the 'P' and the...
and the 'R' look...

406
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:57,530
You're back early.
- Yeah, I-I took a cab from the airport.

407
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,346
You know, it really was silly.

408
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:02,948
Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man in the loud sport coat?

409
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:04,685
Stop. No. No, those are Nick's.

410
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:07,688
Well, Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Now, the-the...

411
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:09,497
Sit down.
- Mom.

412
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,565
Sit down.

413
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,944
You know how sometimes
the-the things that I invent...

414
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:16,488
...don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

415
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:21,301
Sweetheart, you can tell me.
How bad can it be?

416
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:27,327
After all, it's not like you did
something to one of the kids again.

417
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:30,658
Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

418
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,340
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?

419
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:38,510
All right, I confess. I did it.
- Did what?

420
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:40,700
Peekaboo.

421
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,245
I blew up the baby.

422
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,947
Mama fall down.
Mama?

423
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,191
How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

424
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:55,584
Mama sleeping?

425
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:59,364
I'll kill Wayne.
- You don't want to kill Wayne.

426
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,710
I want to kill Wayne.

427
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:04,911
What's he doing?
- He's playing with his toys.

428
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:07,101
Well, make him stop.

429
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:11,230
'Make him stop.'

430
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,650
Why didn't I think of that?

431
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:17,632
Adam.

432
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:20,310
Adam, stop fooling around.

433
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,529
Catch.
- Adam.

434
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:26,058
That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

435
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:28,727
Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick.

436
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:32,110
Catch it.
- This is your last warning.

437
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:37,658
Okay, I'll give you one more warning.

438
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,537
Honey, shh, shh.
It's not as bad as it seems.

439
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:50,975
It almost couldn't be,
could it?

440
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:54,252
Well, I finally got him in his room.

441
00:32:54,774 --> 00:32:57,672
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

442
00:32:57,777 --> 00:32:59,935
I did close the door.

443
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,282
He just opened his door.

444
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:08,970
And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.

445
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:09,768
Oh, baby.

446
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,270
Adam, put the door down,
sweetheart.

447
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,773
Why don't you give
the door to Daddy, Adam?

448
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:17,859
Give Daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

449
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:23,016
Wait till the Vista Del Mar
Standards Committee sees this.

450
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:26,034
Maybe we shouldn't bother with it.
It's just a mailbox.

451
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:29,705
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

452
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,457
Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

453
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:36,018
Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go.

454
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,431
I fix it.

455
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:51,309
Don't fix it, Adam.
Just put down Mommy's coffee table.

456
00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:55,579
Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Ad-Ad-Adam.

457
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:59,568
Not my antique chair.
- Gentle. Gentle.

458
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:03,238
They remodelling in there?
- Come back. Come back here.

459
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,961
Adam. Adam.

460
00:34:07,054 --> 00:34:10,495
Adam, sit down. Sit down, Adam.
- He's on this side.

461
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,247
He's yours.
- Oh, Adam.

462
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,707
This is not a game.

463
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:16,793
What do we do when we catch him?
- Adam, Adam, hang on.

464
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:21,861
Okay, wait. Okay.
You guys go that way. I'll go this way.

465
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:26,361
Hi, little guy.

466
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,171
Adam, put Daddy down.
Adam, put Daddy down.

467
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:35,196
Guitar.
- Not my room.

468
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:39,620
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

469
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,041
Get back here.
- Come on.

470
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:41,610
Get back.

471
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,227
All right, now.
That's enough, fellas. Stop.

472
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:43,987
Adam, sweetheart.

473
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:47,074
He's got my guitar.
- Nicky, he's just a baby.

474
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:49,925
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

475
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,034
He's gonna break my guitar.

476
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,573
Come back here. Come back here.
- Come back, Adam.

477
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:58,585
Give me back my guitar.

478
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,775
Give it back, you brat.

479
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,049
Other way.

480
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:07,698
Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

481
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,372
He targeted something.
But it's gonna take a lot more enhancing...

482
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:15,227
...to figure out what.

483
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,454
I can do it.

484
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:20,440
What do you suppose this is here?
- Condensation on the lens?

485
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:23,193
No, no, it's much too solid.
- How can you be sure?

486
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:27,906
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.

487
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:31,049
Play in here with Daddy.

488
00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,286
Play what?
- Play anything.

489
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,733
This should distract him.
- Great.

490
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,582
That's what it's all about

491
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,836
You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

492
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,589
You put your right foot in
and you shake it all about...

493
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,413
You do the Hokey Pokey
and you turn yourself around

494
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:47,759
Yeah.

495
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,554
Dance, Adam.
- That's what it's all about...

496
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:53,724
Good. This foot, Adam.
- You do the Hokey Pokey...

497
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,805
Isn't this fun, Wayne?
- That's what it's all about

498
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,352
Clap your hands. Clap your hands.

499
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,686
You put your left foot in
- Put your left foot in. Good boy, Adam.

500
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,647
You put your left foot out...

501
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,971
You put your left foot in
and you shake it all about

502
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,609
Why are you closing the shutters?

503
00:36:04,714 --> 00:36:07,208
So one of the neighbours doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby...

504
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,447
...and call the National Inquirer.

505
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,933
That's what it's all about
- Doorbell.

506
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:11,825
Who's that?

507
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:17,247
One of the neighbours.
- So far, your plan's working perfectly.

508
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:18,817
Hi.
- Hello.

509
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:19,750
Hello.

510
00:36:19,854 --> 00:36:22,210
We heard shouting and a lot of noise...

511
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,297
...so we were just wondering
if everything was all right.

512
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:29,926
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.

513
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:32,818
Uncle Yanosh.
- Uncle Yanersh.

514
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,973
You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out

515
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,267
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor.

516
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:40,208
Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

517
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:44,285
He's breaking my ribs.
Oh, don't do that, Adam.

518
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:48,747
My God, it appears to have three eyes.

519
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,947
A new life-form of some sort?

520
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:53,356
Try scaling up the window.

521
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:59,159
This could be big.
- This could be very big.

522
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:07,089
Well, I think you did a great job with
these. This should really distract him.

523
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:09,925
Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

524
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:14,304
Yeah. You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

525
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:18,141
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

526
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:22,333
Yeah, but you have to admit, Mom,
not many guys could come up with...

527
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,439
...something like this in half an hour.

528
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:26,629
Cuckoo.
- No. No. Adam.

529
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,985
Sweetheart, no, no, no.
Stay away from that, sweetheart.

530
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,071
Adam, please,
please don't touch that.

531
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,782
Adam, no, don't touch Mommy's cuckoo.

532
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:38,537
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here and play with Nicky.

533
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,179
Play with Nicky, Adam.

534
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:45,877
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

535
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:47,963
Wayne?

536
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:51,299
Well, some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

537
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:55,846
Please, honey, the truth, okay?
- The truth, Diane, is that...

538
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,699
...without the access to the data
at the plant, I don't know...

539
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:00,225
...that there's anything I can do.

540
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,104
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

541
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,063
I'm sorry, honey.
- Hey, Mom, look.

542
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,275
I finally found a way to keep him quiet.

543
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:12,293
There were 12 ice cream bars in there.

544
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:17,492
Well, he's ruined his dinner.
- Not necessarily, Mom.

545
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:21,204
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

546
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:24,588
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

547
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,521
Okay, boys, we're going out.

548
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,050
Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

549
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:35,302
Maybe there's somebody there who...

550
00:38:35,406 --> 00:38:37,804
Who knows what they're doing?

551
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:42,017
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now...

552
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,853
...is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

553
00:38:44,957 --> 00:38:47,215
Come on, Nicky.
Help me get him out to the van.

554
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:47,647
Shrink?

555
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:50,438
Diane, wait. I got an idea.
My original machine...

556
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,444
...it's in the lab security warehouse.

557
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:54,154
Yes.

558
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:56,406
This'll have to be a covert operation.

559
00:38:56,511 --> 00:38:59,743
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with the baby.

560
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,907
Oh, no.
We are not leaving them here alone.

561
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,705
Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

562
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,687
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.

563
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:07,250
Look at him.

564
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:10,337
He's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.

565
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,766
No nap.

566
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:19,148
Look who I got: Really Big Bunny.

567
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:23,913
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.

568
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:25,936
You're real tired,
aren't you, Adam?

569
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,876
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

570
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:31,913
Should we sing the song?

571
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:36,049
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

572
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:40,427
How I wonder what you are

573
00:39:40,513 --> 00:39:44,842
Up above the world so high

574
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:48,682
Like a diamond in the sky

575
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:53,350
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

576
00:39:53,442 --> 00:39:55,528
How I won...
- Mine.

577
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:57,084
Let go.
- Gimme.

578
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,656
Adam Szalinski, you let go

579
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,140
Put Daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt Daddy.

580
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:04,891
Sorry, Mama.

581
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:08,895
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

582
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,941
Dr Hendrickson, we can make out hair,
bone and metal, all sort of intertwined.

583
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:16,445
I think you should take
a look at this. Yes, sir.

584
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,250
He's on his way.
- We'll show him...

585
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:19,614
...the keratin analysis first.

586
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:22,075
Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

587
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,434
I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

588
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:37,716
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour. Come on.

589
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,906
Bye-bye.

590
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:45,200
This is our latest image, superimposing
structural and keratin analysis.

591
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:51,081
And as you can see, there appears to...
- All right. Just move over.

592
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:54,021
It's a baby and a stuffed bunny.

593
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:58,057
Szalinski.

594
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,317
I'm gonna pay him a little visit.

595
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:04,594
Back to work.
- I knew it was a baby.

596
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:07,701
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

597
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:32,164
This'll just take a second. They stored
all my stuff in one large crate.

598
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:35,636
It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

599
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,700
Maybe it's in
alphabetical order or something.

600
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:44,843
What if it's not?

601
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:48,472
All I wanted to do was
take Nick to the movies. Uh-oh.

602
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,661
What?

603
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:13,643
Doorbell.

604
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:22,641
Twinkle, twinkle lit...

605
00:43:25,446 --> 00:43:27,532
Bunny.
- Wait here.

606
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:42,797
Mandy.
- Rick.

607
00:43:43,005 --> 00:43:46,837
Nick. Nick Szalinski.
- Right.

608
00:43:46,926 --> 00:43:51,446
I'm here to baby-sit.
- We don't need a baby-sitter.

609
00:43:54,183 --> 00:43:56,269
Adam, no.

610
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,336
Very funny. Now can I come in?
I'm already charging you.

611
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,257
We changed our mind, that's all.
We don't need a baby-sitter.

612
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,720
I don't think so. Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.

613
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:12,597
Plus the extra if I'm grossed out.
- Uh, listen, Mandy.

614
00:44:12,702 --> 00:44:15,851
Take it from me. You don't want
to baby-sit. Not this baby.

615
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:19,943
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.

616
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,714
Wayne, we've gotta get back to the kids.
This is just taking too long.

617
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:50,062
Honey, it's up here.

618
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,903
See if you can find a forklift.

619
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,685
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.

620
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:02,606
Now, if you promise not to scream,
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.

621
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,795
Promise?

622
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:10,472
Help me. Someone help me.
- Mandy. Mandy, no.

623
00:45:10,576 --> 00:45:12,699
Please, somebody help me. Giant baby.

624
00:45:12,803 --> 00:45:14,701
You're scaring him.
Stop.

625
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:17,730
Mandy, stop. Calm down.
- Help me.

626
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:19,998
What's that?

627
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:23,377
Help. Help. Help. Help.
Giant baby. Help.

628
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:26,051
The Slitzitskis.
- Giant baby.

629
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:32,469
Wayne, this is a solar van.
We're inside.

630
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:36,137
There's a switch, honey, marked
'batteries.'Just be careful...

631
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:37,391
...not to switch it to...

632
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:39,867
...high.

633
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:47,129
No. No.

634
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,305
Hold on.

635
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:00,434
Can we try again?

636
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,339
Good.
Now, despite what he looks like...

637
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:11,466
Adam is just a little kid.

638
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:14,511
He's-He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.

639
00:46:14,615 --> 00:46:18,150
Summertime.
The active woman.

640
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:21,977
She knows what it is to have a headache.

641
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:25,913
Everybody's doin' a
brand new dance now...

642
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:29,276
Come on, baby, do the locomotion.
- Let's welcome 'em.

643
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,863
I know you'll get to like it
if you give it a chance now

644
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:37,178
Come on baby Do the locomotion

645
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:39,348
Sorry.

646
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:43,665
...learn than your ABCs

647
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:48,313
So come on, come on and do
the locomotion with me

648
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:51,673
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.

649
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:55,469
And the guys next door.
- Then he made you regular size again.

650
00:46:55,573 --> 00:46:59,118
And now he's made your baby brother big.

651
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:01,289
Right.

652
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:06,010
And you don't, like, think that's unusual.

653
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:14,363
Oh, my God.
He's out and he's bigger.

654
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:18,116
You got to help me, okay?
- This wasn't in the job description.

655
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:21,305
We'll pay you overtime.
- Okay.

656
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:27,626
There's no way I'm changing those diapers.

657
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,628
Come on.

658
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:34,643
Adam. Adam.
- Adam. Adam.

659
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:41,858
Adam, where are you?
Come on.

660
00:47:41,953 --> 00:47:43,850
Julia, be quiet and sit down.

661
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:47,655
Now, for the famous Chinese blocks trick.

662
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,835
Shazam.

663
00:47:52,922 --> 00:47:56,207
Okay.
Now for my next trick.

664
00:47:58,427 --> 00:48:00,513
Adam.

665
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:04,841
Now for the disappearing bunny trick.

666
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:08,875
Watch carefully.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

667
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,143
Shazam. Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?

668
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:16,779
There.
- You think it's still on my head?

669
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,617
Big Bunny.

670
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:33,588
Bye.

671
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:38,195
There he is. Come on.
- I don't care if Clifford's...

672
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,574
...at the Rand Institute this weekend.

673
00:48:40,678 --> 00:48:46,173
I also want the board of directors
in on this. Hey, what the...

674
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:50,417
Contact the federal marshals.
Get 'em out here. I want something...

675
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:51,460
...large enough to hold...

676
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,957
...to hold something large.

677
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,031
Big Bunny.
Big, Big, Big bunny.

678
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:04,202
In big trouble.

679
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:08,518
Wait. You hold it right there.
- Hey.

680
00:49:08,623 --> 00:49:10,838
I'm just the baby-sitter.

681
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,389
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.

682
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:28,330
Wayne, how's it coming?
- Just about got it, honey.

683
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:31,270
Hold on. I'm taking a short cut.

684
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:50,289
What do I do?

685
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,856
Okay, let's see if this thing works.

686
00:50:05,513 --> 00:50:10,388
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.

687
00:50:29,453 --> 00:50:31,539
It works.

688
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:39,472
They're getting away.
- I think they're out...

689
00:50:39,576 --> 00:50:41,661
...of our jurisdiction.

690
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:47,117
Hold it.
You can't go in.

691
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:50,412
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.

692
00:50:56,981 --> 00:50:59,472
Excuse me.

693
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,896
Where are my boys? Where are they?
- Hold on, folks. Hold it.

694
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:02,758
Hold it just a minute.

695
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:06,445
Preston Brooks, US Marshals.
Now, we found this guy down the street...

696
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:07,471
...hiding in a garage.

697
00:51:07,575 --> 00:51:10,608
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs Szalinski. We just needed...

698
00:51:10,712 --> 00:51:12,309
...to get the baby some more room

699
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:14,811
Of course, the mutated child
will have to undergo immediate testing.

700
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:18,148
That's my kid you're talking about.
Let go of me.

701
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,532
Hold on, Mr Szalinski.
- Let go of me.

702
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:30,494
You can't keep him in that truck.

703
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:32,954
Don't worry.
It's all fixed up.

704
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,457
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.

705
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:38,335
That's what I mean.
- I'd listen to him if I were you.

706
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:43,137
Look, Miss. When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

707
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,404
Mama, help.

708
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:48,241
Out. Out.

709
00:51:55,873 --> 00:51:59,491
He's got a 40-inch neck.

710
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:02,943
Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
- The parents are here.

711
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:06,822
We'll bring them to meet
the child when he's secure.

712
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:10,294
I can authorize that.
- Marshal Brooks?

713
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,828
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.

714
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:16,415
On what charge?
- Theft. Malicious mischief.

715
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,604
Child endangerment.

716
00:52:24,527 --> 00:52:26,934
If you'll excuse me.

717
00:52:30,074 --> 00:52:34,286
Clifford.
Well, I hardly know what to say.

718
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,060
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

719
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,312
Yes. Yes, you did, Charles.

720
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,827
If it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors believed...

721
00:52:41,932 --> 00:52:43,066
...that you were right all along.

722
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:46,810
Dr Sterling. Dr Sterling, sir.
I can reverse my son's growth.

723
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,572
Just give me a chance, sir.

724
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:50,843
You can?
- Yeah, with what, Szalinski?

725
00:52:50,947 --> 00:52:51,992
Coca-Cola bottles?

726
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:54,995
Hmm? Maybe some, what,
chewing gum and twine?

727
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,565
Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?

728
00:52:57,669 --> 00:52:58,790
Diane, let me handle this.

729
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:01,074
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

730
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:01,543
Clifford...

731
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,837
...the situation demands
that I bring in the people...

732
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:07,007
...with the expertise and the credentials.

733
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:10,343
Wait a second. You think I'm just
some guy from Fresno...

734
00:53:10,448 --> 00:53:13,388
...who tinkered with crackpot
ideas in his attic?

735
00:53:13,492 --> 00:53:15,474
Well, let me tell you something.

736
00:53:15,578 --> 00:53:18,060
This whole country is built on
the shoulders of people who tinkered...

737
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:21,730
...with crackpot ideas in attics
and basements and backyards.

738
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,377
Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.

739
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:25,942
Young man, don't presume...

740
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:28,528
...to stand there and lecture me
about great minds...

741
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:30,489
...and great inventors.

742
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:33,533
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

743
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:36,286
...or been involved with anyone else who is.

744
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,758
I certainly don't intend to start now.

745
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:41,847
Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?

746
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:42,834
You're fired.

747
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:46,142
What?
- You're fired.

748
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:51,968
So Szalinski, what have you got in mind,
so we can get that kid of yours...

749
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:53,720
...back to normal size by bedtime?

750
00:53:53,824 --> 00:53:57,766
Well, sir, the prototype's in the van...
- Hold on, folks. We've got a problem.

751
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,019
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

752
00:54:01,123 --> 00:54:04,064
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

753
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:07,536
I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

754
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:12,849
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.

755
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:15,881
He broke out?
- He busted out of the truck...

756
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:17,536
...and knocked it completely over.

757
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,832
What's he doing now?
- He's just standing there.

758
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:20,664
But he's smiling.

759
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,241
Now, Adam, sit down.
- Nick, I don't think sitting's...

760
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:24,209
...such a good idea.

761
00:54:24,313 --> 00:54:26,399
Ooh, toys.

762
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:30,757
He did what?
- Put your son and the baby-sitter...

763
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,300
...in his pocket and left.

764
00:54:32,405 --> 00:54:34,594
He's always doing that. I find
the strangest things in his pockets.

765
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:38,166
Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?

766
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:38,890
I don't know.

767
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:42,102
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

768
00:54:42,206 --> 00:54:44,855
That runs alongside high-voltage lines.
- Oh.

769
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:47,441
And yesterday when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

770
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:50,315
And you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.

771
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:50,902
Of course.

772
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:54,990
I don't understand any of this.
- Electromagnetic flux.

773
00:54:55,094 --> 00:54:58,326
Around every operating
electrical device, there's a flux.

774
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:02,372
Like an electromagnetic force field.
- That's what's causing the baby to grow.

775
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:07,002
Would this electromagnetic, uh...
Would it surround neon lights too?

776
00:55:07,106 --> 00:55:11,626
Yeah, why?
- Your kid. He's headed toward Las Vegas.

777
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:13,893
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

778
00:55:13,997 --> 00:55:16,083
Uh-oh.

779
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:21,433
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

780
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:26,323
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for. At last.

781
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,532
Sterling has gone too far this time.

782
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,612
The board is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.

783
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:36,323
Whatever it takes, just get
the situation under control.

784
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:39,576
Yeah, I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

785
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,829
Fine. I'll get the clearance. Charles,
Just-Just-Just handle this for us.

786
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:46,567
We'll... We'll do the right thing by you.

787
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:06,561
Police reports just in say that
some kind of large creature...

788
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:13,402
...has just escaped from a government
caravan and is heading toward the city.

789
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:20,158
Mrs Szalinski, if he heads for
the lights, he has to come this way.

790
00:56:20,263 --> 00:56:23,956
According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still for 12.2 seconds.

791
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,371
What?

792
00:56:24,475 --> 00:56:26,790
His increased mass requires
a longer period of exposure.

793
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:29,384
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old to hold...

794
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:31,336
...still for 12 point anything seconds?

795
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,667
She's right, Doctor,
we tried to have his picture...

796
00:56:33,771 --> 00:56:35,215
...taken a month ago. Total bust.

797
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:38,885
We're just pulling up now, Dan.
There are a lot of police cars gathered.

798
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,056
We'll find out what's going on.
- Call the paramedics now.

799
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,912
All right, here's a shot.
Okay.

800
00:56:45,997 --> 00:56:48,937
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site...

801
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:53,025
...of what will certainly become the
most important news story of the decade.

802
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:56,794
Dan, I'm seeing a giant.

803
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:04,015
Oh, my God.

804
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:13,188
Oh, Adam.

805
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:17,817
Well, honey, he looks okay.
- Let me see.

806
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:20,639
Do you think this is gonna
affect him for life? I mean,

807
00:57:20,743 --> 00:57:22,596
something like this could ruin a kid.

808
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,419
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,

809
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,142
help him see the big picture.

810
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:31,114
Baby.
There they are.

811
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:35,197
Let's move into position.
- I'm with you, pal.

812
00:57:54,482 --> 00:57:55,916
Help.
- Get us down from here.

813
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,630
Get us down.

814
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,339
We're up here.
- We're up in the pocket.

815
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,591
This is Constance Winters...

816
00:57:59,695 --> 00:58:02,406
...reporting live
on the progress of the giant baby...

817
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:04,179
...who has just been identified...

818
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:07,828
...as Adam Szalinski from Vista Del Mar.

819
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:14,183
Let's go.
- The governor's on the phone...

820
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:15,065
...for you, sir.

821
00:58:15,169 --> 00:58:18,448
Yes, Governor.
He's a pretty big baby.

822
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:23,323
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

823
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:26,284
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

824
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:29,527
Baby? Look at him.
- Hey, we're his parents, okay?

825
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:30,664
We'll handle this.

826
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,517
Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?

827
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,706
How do we handle this?

828
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:41,800
Ready.
- Watch out. Look out. Look out.

829
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:45,605
Mommy. Mom.

830
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,932
Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

831
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:51,181
Adam, baby, Mommy's here.
- Nicky, I'm gonna get you...

832
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:52,144
...out of here right away.

833
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:54,656
Okay, Dad, but hurry.

834
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,025
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

835
00:58:58,129 --> 00:59:02,383
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

836
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:10,537
Adam, now sit down really slowly.

837
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:14,057
I got it. Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.

838
00:59:14,145 --> 00:59:16,043
I need something called Big Dummy?
- No, Bunny.

839
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:18,934
Bunny?
- It's his favourite toy.

840
00:59:19,025 --> 00:59:21,595
It's the kid's favourite toy.

841
00:59:32,288 --> 00:59:35,103
A helicopter is approaching
with what looks like...

842
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:39,994
...a giant stuffed animal of
some sort hanging from it.

843
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:43,070
Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous.

844
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:46,073
Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

845
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:49,493
It's all primed. Be ready
to activate as soon as he's down.

846
00:59:49,597 --> 00:59:51,682
I'll be fine.

847
00:59:55,603 --> 00:59:59,857
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

848
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:02,089
Tell me I'm not seeing this.

849
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:05,941
Twinkle, twinkle little star

850
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:09,862
How I wonder what you are...

851
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:13,934
Up above the world so high
- I told you my Dad would have a plan.

852
01:00:14,038 --> 01:00:18,202
Like a diamond in the sky
- Bunny.

853
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:22,124
Twinkle, twinkle little star

854
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:28,127
How I wonder what you are...

855
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:33,177
Radio it in. Radio...
- Twinkle, twinkle little star

856
01:00:33,266 --> 01:00:39,386
How I wonder what you are

857
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,976
Oh, I'm tired.
Are you tired, Big Bunny?

858
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:47,567
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.

859
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:50,679
I can't remember when I was this tired.

860
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:53,914
Get ready, Dr Sterling.
He's getting blinky.

861
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:55,017
Yeah, me too.

862
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:57,102
I don't know what to do.
- He's getting sleepy.

863
01:00:57,206 --> 01:00:59,354
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.

864
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:03,919
I got an idea.
Why don't we all have a nice...

865
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:05,485
No.
- Long...

866
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,211
Don't say it.
- Nap?

867
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:10,970
Brace yourself.
- No nap.

868
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:15,787
Whoa. Help. Help. Hang on.
Get me away from him. Move me away.

869
01:01:15,892 --> 01:01:18,299
No nap.

870
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:20,792
I get it. No nap.
- Hold on, Dad.

871
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:22,819
Take me up or put me down.
Take me away.

872
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:24,004
Roy, let's move in closer.

873
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:28,628
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.
- Release the bunny.

874
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,734
Whoa.
- Dad.

875
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:34,066
Release it now.

876
01:01:36,454 --> 01:01:38,018
Run.
- Run.

877
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:40,208
Whoa.

878
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,413
Dad, this is Mandy.
- Hi...

879
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:48,362
Stay right there, kids. There's
absolutely nothing to worry about.

880
01:01:48,466 --> 01:01:51,383
I feel a whole lot better.

881
01:01:57,016 --> 01:02:00,295
That's my dad.
- He seems really nice.

882
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:06,984
Run, Dad.
Watch out for his foot.

883
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,011
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

884
01:02:13,115 --> 01:02:18,276
He's headed for the strip.
- You little devil.

885
01:02:26,295 --> 01:02:29,945
He's heading toward the city. We'll
follow and bring you a live update.

886
01:02:30,049 --> 01:02:34,116
Adam Szalinski, this is your
Mommy talking. You stop right now.

887
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,785
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs Szalinski. I'm sure he expects...

888
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,286
...his mommy to be bigger than he is.

889
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:42,628
To him you're just...
Well, you're nothing more...

890
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:45,210
...than a little talking doll.

891
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:48,101
Nothing can stop him now.

892
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:51,523
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want, but...

893
01:02:51,627 --> 01:02:52,926
...we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

894
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,554
All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

895
01:02:55,658 --> 01:02:59,307
Dr Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

896
01:02:59,412 --> 01:03:01,415
Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.

897
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:02,561
Just so you're aware, sir.

898
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:05,647
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

899
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:08,253
Frankly, Captain, I'm not under
the jurisdiction of the state militia.

900
01:03:08,357 --> 01:03:09,609
Your orders mean nothing to me.

901
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:11,695
A giant infant is heading toward the city.

902
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:14,545
The baby is over 50 feet tall and
appears to be growing even bigger...

903
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:15,407
...at an alarming rate.

904
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:18,710
All right, let's move it, Captain, now.
- Lf it's okay with you,

905
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:19,619
I'll just sit tight.

906
01:03:19,724 --> 01:03:22,737
More on this story as it develops.

907
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,295
There's something down by my foot.

908
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:30,605
Look at this.
- Wow.

909
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:33,618
Let's see what else is down here.

910
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,982
Cereal. Hey cool, want some?

911
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:40,448
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

912
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:42,622
Have a raisin.

913
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:46,229
Please clear the streets for your own safety.

914
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:49,999
Please stay indoors.
This is an emergency.

915
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:52,861
All pedestrians are in grave danger.

916
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:55,207
Please clear the streets.

917
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:02,788
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.
This is not a test.

918
01:04:02,892 --> 01:04:05,582
A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city.

919
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,801
The giant appears
to be growing at a tremendous rate...

920
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:10,670
...and has now reached 100 feet.

921
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:12,839
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

922
01:04:12,944 --> 01:04:16,551
No, they don't do this for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.

923
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:22,307
Listen, babe, there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

924
01:04:22,411 --> 01:04:25,868
Of course, I could be wrong.
- Peekaboo.

925
01:04:51,941 --> 01:04:53,922
Is he growing or are we shrinking?

926
01:04:54,026 --> 01:04:58,990
It's amazing. He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

927
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:10,957
Adam. Put us down.
You put us down now.

928
01:05:12,044 --> 01:05:14,962
Howdy, partners.

929
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:17,706
Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.

930
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:34,400
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

931
01:05:37,612 --> 01:05:39,760
He's toddling down the centre
of Fremont Street.

932
01:05:39,864 --> 01:05:42,220
He knows not to go in the street by himself.

933
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:44,306
There's no telling how huge he might get.

934
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,331
Especially if he touches any of those lights.

935
01:05:46,435 --> 01:05:48,101
We've got to get him away from them.

936
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:50,729
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

937
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,315
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

938
01:05:53,419 --> 01:05:58,294
Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.

939
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,801
Follow that ice-cream truck.

940
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:11,060
We'll need a really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an ice-cream truck...

941
01:06:11,164 --> 01:06:11,625
...real fast?

942
01:06:11,729 --> 01:06:14,090
I can burn rubber.
- Well, start burning it.

943
01:06:14,194 --> 01:06:16,380
We'll be with you on the walkie-talkie.

944
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:22,717
Preston Brooks, US Marshals. We're
commandeering this vehicle. Come on.

945
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:24,907
Hey, wait a minute.

946
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,935
What's that?
- It's a tranquillizer cannon.

947
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:29,643
It's used on large mammals.

948
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,104
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

949
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:35,732
It's like a normal injection, but
on a slightly larger scale, of course.

950
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:38,809
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem...

951
01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:39,736
...like the type of...

952
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,892
Well, naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.

953
01:06:47,306 --> 01:06:50,142
Reporting live from the famous Glitter
Gulch where certainly the biggest story...

954
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:51,081
...of the year is unfolding.

955
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:53,820
Casino owners are understandably upset.
They've been ordered...

956
01:06:53,924 --> 01:06:54,751
...to evacuate the area.

957
01:06:54,856 --> 01:06:57,421
The answers to many of our questions lie
with two key players in this drama...

958
01:06:57,525 --> 01:06:58,595
Dr Clifford Sterling
of Sterling Laboratories...

959
01:06:58,699 --> 01:06:59,506
What we do know is that a baby...

960
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:04,136
...by the name of Adam Szalinski
has somehow measured over 100 feet tall.

961
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,194
Stop the clapping.

962
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,601
I got a plan.
- Great.'Cause I'm...

963
01:07:12,706 --> 01:07:14,187
...starting to get airsick.

964
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:17,061
We'll pull the thread out
of the bottom of the pocket and...

965
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:18,650
...use it as a rope to slide down.

966
01:07:18,754 --> 01:07:21,987
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

967
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:26,168
But so far all the casinos are still standing.

968
01:07:36,772 --> 01:07:38,858
Watch out.

969
01:07:50,703 --> 01:07:54,404
Hi.
- Hey. Hey, don't. What are you doin'?

970
01:07:54,498 --> 01:07:56,990
Stop. Stop. Stop.

971
01:08:00,922 --> 01:08:03,839
We'll have to jump.

972
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:07,625
Hold on.

973
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,152
Don't look down. Watch out
for the gearshift. Jump.

974
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:18,019
Go.
- I'm trying.

975
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:19,961
Truly, I'm trying.
- Stayin'alive...

976
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:22,423
Hurry. Hurry, do something.
- Stayin'alive

977
01:08:22,528 --> 01:08:23,965
I'm used to an automatic.

978
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:27,792
Stayin'alive
- We've gotta get out of here.

979
01:08:28,908 --> 01:08:31,150
Toy car.

980
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:33,532
Buckle up.

981
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:47,479
Adam, get him away from me.
- Adam.

982
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,795
Adam. Adam. Don't eat us.

983
01:08:50,888 --> 01:08:52,974
Whoa.

984
01:08:57,395 --> 01:09:00,377
We're here live in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski...

985
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:03,839
...who has lifted a small yellow
sports car into the air...

986
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:06,091
...with three unidentified persons in it.

987
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:08,685
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,

988
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:09,469
a boy and a girl...

989
01:09:09,574 --> 01:09:12,514
...and a man dressed in an Indian costume.

990
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:16,424
What's he doing?
- He's taking something out...

991
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:19,276
...of his pocket. A peppermint.

992
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:22,326
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

993
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,922
Howdy, partners.

994
01:09:42,648 --> 01:09:45,483
That car is like a toy to him.

995
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:48,735
I hope this thing has air bags.

996
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:57,559
Do something, Nick. Tell him to stop.
- I can't. He's too big.

997
01:09:57,663 --> 01:09:59,978
We gotta get him away from those lights
before he touches any of them.

998
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:02,189
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

999
01:10:02,293 --> 01:10:04,784
We're almost set.
- Roger.

1000
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:08,882
No.
- Watch the tree.

1001
01:10:19,018 --> 01:10:22,102
Oh, no.

1002
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:24,758
Just a big baby with his toy.

1003
01:10:31,322 --> 01:10:33,480
Coming through.

1004
01:10:33,574 --> 01:10:35,305
Get out of the way.

1005
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:38,866
Come on, Adam, put it down.
Put it down.

1006
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:41,861
Come on, sweetheart. Put it down.

1007
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,290
What's he doing now?

1008
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:49,672
Put us down.
Put us down.

1009
01:10:49,757 --> 01:10:51,655
He put it down.

1010
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:54,630
Pick us up.
Pick us up.

1011
01:11:00,184 --> 01:11:04,501
Oh, my God. We're gonna die. We're gonna
die. We're gonna die in a convertible.

1012
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:07,254
What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

1013
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:09,979
Okay. We're set.

1014
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:14,803
No. Wait.
- Hold it. Hold it.

1015
01:11:14,907 --> 01:11:17,832
We need him to get the kids down.

1016
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:20,830
Cut it off.

1017
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:26,325
I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God.

1018
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:31,695
Whatever you do,
don't look down.

1019
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:35,078
Nick, don't let go. Please.
- I won't.

1020
01:11:35,094 --> 01:11:37,367
I'm gonna pull you back up, okay?

1021
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,557
Nick. Mandy.
- Hold on.

1022
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,725
But you gotta help.
- Okay.

1023
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:46,179
Get the car, Adam.

1024
01:11:47,815 --> 01:11:49,671
Adam. Pick up the car.

1025
01:11:49,775 --> 01:11:52,150
Adam, get the car.
- Come on, Adam. Come on.

1026
01:11:52,254 --> 01:11:53,341
Come on, sweetheart.

1027
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:55,531
Come on. I got you.

1028
01:11:57,241 --> 01:11:59,946
Car fall down.

1029
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:09,874
Lock your door.

1030
01:12:32,068 --> 01:12:34,153
Thank you, Adam.

1031
01:12:38,407 --> 01:12:41,431
He put 'em in the pocket.
- Honey, we can't wait any longer.

1032
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:43,861
Let's do it.

1033
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:48,150
Everyone stand by now.
Attention, all casinos, wait...

1034
01:12:48,255 --> 01:12:49,606
...for my signal to turn off your lights.

1035
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,724
Marshal Brooks,
bring on the truck.

1036
01:13:01,597 --> 01:13:03,839
Nick, come on.

1037
01:13:10,064 --> 01:13:13,231
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.

1038
01:13:15,111 --> 01:13:18,562
Go, Golden Gate.

1039
01:13:18,656 --> 01:13:21,229
Las Vegas Club.

1040
01:13:21,325 --> 01:13:24,410
Now, hit the searchlights.

1041
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,198
Go, Brooks.

1042
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,283
Lucky Lady. Jackpot.

1043
01:13:33,379 --> 01:13:35,037
Come on, Adam.
- Come on, baby.

1044
01:13:35,141 --> 01:13:36,361
Come on, baby. Go for it.

1045
01:13:36,465 --> 01:13:39,135
Glitter Gulch. Golden Goose.

1046
01:13:39,218 --> 01:13:43,465
Ice cream.
- Coin Castle.

1047
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:47,423
Binion's Horseshoe. Vegas World.

1048
01:13:47,518 --> 01:13:49,458
This must be another
one of my dad's plans.

1049
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:51,418
Star Palace.
- Great.

1050
01:13:51,522 --> 01:13:55,223
4 Queens. The Fremont.

1051
01:13:58,487 --> 01:14:01,281
It's working, Wayne.
- Go, Adam.

1052
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:03,690
He really likes ice cream.

1053
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,543
Yes.
- It's working.

1054
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,153
Ice cream.
- Where are you guys?

1055
01:14:18,257 --> 01:14:21,258
This kid's gaining on me.

1056
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,372
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.

1057
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:54,231
Brooks said he caught the ice-cream
truck just outside of town.

1058
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,566
Next thing I know, he grabbed
it right off the truck.

1059
01:14:56,671 --> 01:15:00,612
What'd he do with it?
- What do you think he did with it?

1060
01:15:00,716 --> 01:15:03,323
You got another idea?
- I will. Come on. Let's go.

1061
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:06,713
Dr Sterling?
- Wayne.

1062
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:10,139
Do you remember how we got Adam to
hold still to have his picture taken?

1063
01:15:10,244 --> 01:15:11,748
I put him in my lap and I held him.

1064
01:15:11,853 --> 01:15:14,770
Yeah?
- Honey, he needs me.

1065
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:20,971
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

1066
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,428
No, Diane. It's a crazy idea...
- Wayne.

1067
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:28,348
For almost 20 years I've watched
you have one crazy idea after another.

1068
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:31,240
It's my turn to have just one.

1069
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:45,595
Fire.

1070
01:15:51,058 --> 01:15:53,728
My guitar.
- Uh-oh.

1071
01:15:53,811 --> 01:15:57,445
What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar.

1072
01:16:00,902 --> 01:16:04,624
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

1073
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,556
Diane, I should be doing this, not you.

1074
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,850
There's one thing every little kid knows.

1075
01:16:11,954 --> 01:16:14,811
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.

1076
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,356
But-But-But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

1077
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,566
Too little power and you'll
grow too slowly like Adam.

1078
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:24,279
And too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

1079
01:16:27,678 --> 01:16:29,920
Wayne, time to get large.

1080
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,936
Here's your soda, sir.

1081
01:16:35,019 --> 01:16:37,834
What do you need a Coke bottle for?
- I don't.

1082
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,097
Just the bottom.
- Oh.

1083
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:53,475
Tom, I'm here just outside the Hard Rock
Cafe. The giant baby is approaching.

1084
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:57,873
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?

1085
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,913
A giant what? Baby?

1086
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:09,842
Guitar.

1087
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:13,512
Oh, my God.
- Let's get out of here.

1088
01:17:27,655 --> 01:17:32,068
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

1089
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,730
Adam. Don't touch the guitar.

1090
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:39,040
I'll save ya.

1091
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:42,624
No, Adam.
Adam, put down the guitar.

1092
01:17:49,218 --> 01:17:52,617
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again.

1093
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:56,621
This is as fast as we can go safely, Doctor.

1094
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:04,504
Constance Winters live across
the street from the Hard Rock Cafe.

1095
01:18:04,609 --> 01:18:07,883
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

1096
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:10,380
He's trying to play a tune.

1097
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:26,485
Bring me into range and hold it steady.
- Doctor, wait a minute.

1098
01:18:26,589 --> 01:18:29,696
Now, if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

1099
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,143
Well, we'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

1100
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:49,193
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the aeroplane.

1101
01:18:49,278 --> 01:18:51,734
Aeroplane. Hi.

1102
01:18:51,822 --> 01:18:55,108
Hold it. Steady.

1103
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,844
They're shooting at Adam.
- I assume that little manoeuvre...

1104
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:01,895
...was an error, Captain.

1105
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:05,399
Now steady, or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

1106
01:19:05,503 --> 01:19:08,694
Hey. Pick on somebody your own size.

1107
01:19:15,137 --> 01:19:17,223
Ow.

1108
01:19:48,004 --> 01:19:50,308
All right, let's go again.

1109
01:19:53,342 --> 01:19:54,990
Dan, the...

1110
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:58,878
Hold it stead...

1111
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:01,927
Back off.

1112
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:04,259
Yes, ma'am.

1113
01:20:08,357 --> 01:20:10,895
You tell 'em.
That's my mom.

1114
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:15,398
I need a vacation.
- Whoa. Look at that mother.

1115
01:20:33,799 --> 01:20:36,919
Come here, baby.
- Mama.

1116
01:20:38,846 --> 01:20:41,171
Come to Mommy.

1117
01:20:47,271 --> 01:20:49,419
Come here, baby.
Come to Mommy.

1118
01:20:49,524 --> 01:20:53,984
Mom. Easy, Mom.

1119
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,172
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

1120
01:20:58,658 --> 01:21:01,890
Mommy's here.
- Everything it's got, Doctor.

1121
01:21:01,994 --> 01:21:04,080
Roger.

1122
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:10,716
You crying?
- Yeah. It's okay to cry...

1123
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,080
...when you're so happy.

1124
01:21:14,966 --> 01:21:20,992
The bearings in the generator are
about to burn out. We better do it.

1125
01:21:23,724 --> 01:21:28,386
Okay, now, look at Daddy.
Smile for Daddy.

1126
01:21:29,522 --> 01:21:32,772
There he is.
- Daddy.

1127
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:35,895
Wayne, 1450.
It's all she can take.

1128
01:21:39,073 --> 01:21:42,656
Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

1129
01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:48,035
Come on, Wayne.

1130
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:03,301
Look, Adam, there's Daddy.
- Daddy.

1131
01:22:03,389 --> 01:22:06,390
Honey, you did it.

1132
01:22:06,475 --> 01:22:08,331
Adam.

1133
01:22:08,436 --> 01:22:10,761
Adam.

1134
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:13,879
You gave us quite a scare, little man.
- I knew you could do it, honey.

1135
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:16,376
There he is.
Let me through.

1136
01:22:17,987 --> 01:22:21,261
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

1137
01:22:21,365 --> 01:22:24,497
Dr Hendrickson,
that looked like some sort of rifle...

1138
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:26,850
...that you were shooting at my baby.

1139
01:22:26,954 --> 01:22:30,771
They were tranquillizer cartridges. They
wouldn't have hurt him, I assure you.

1140
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:34,955
Oh. Tranquillizer cartridges.

1141
01:22:39,842 --> 01:22:42,574
Never cross Mommy.
- We got an emergency here.

1142
01:22:42,678 --> 01:22:45,975
Dr Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect...

1143
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,704
...of having to find a new career.

1144
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:52,151
Hey, big fella, is this
what you were lookin' for?

1145
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:58,024
Wayne. Nick and Mandy.

1146
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:02,453
Weren't they in Adam's pocket?
- In Adam's pocket.

1147
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:07,224
Don't tell me.
- Oh, my God.

1148
01:23:07,328 --> 01:23:10,946
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move.

1149
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,607
Don't worry. I have highly specialized
equipment to deal with this.

1150
01:23:15,711 --> 01:23:19,579
I'll need the helmet and I'll need the dog.

1151
01:23:19,674 --> 01:23:21,613
Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked...

1152
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:24,783
...to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski...

1153
01:23:24,887 --> 01:23:27,869
...is conducting a one-man search
to find some missing children.

1154
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:30,841
It was Szalinski's matter-expanding
machine that was responsible...

1155
01:23:30,945 --> 01:23:32,290
...for last night's amazing events.

1156
01:23:32,395 --> 01:23:36,345
Dr Clifford Sterling has just announced...

1157
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:41,675
I guess your father's about
the most famous guy in the world today.

1158
01:23:41,779 --> 01:23:45,058
And I guess you're about the bravest.

1159
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,391
That's for saving my life.

1160
01:23:49,495 --> 01:23:52,117
It wasn't much.

1161
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:55,308
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

1162
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:58,914
What I did wasn't so much.

1163
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:03,038
Ours if we want it

1164
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:07,001
Tonight has our initials on it

1165
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:09,536
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

1166
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,717
I think it may be a while before they find us.

1167
01:24:17,815 --> 01:24:21,804
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.

1168
01:24:23,112 --> 01:24:25,469
We're not all that different.

1169
01:24:25,573 --> 01:24:29,618
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...

1170
01:24:29,702 --> 01:24:32,726
I guess the world needs people
who are different.

1171
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:36,480
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

1172
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:40,202
We'll appear sometime

1173
01:24:40,296 --> 01:24:43,546
Maybe tonight is yours and mine...

1174
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:51,476
Are they okay?
- Yep. I think we better give 'em...

1175
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:52,746
...a couple of minutes though.

1176
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:56,895
What are we gonna do about that?
- Adam, look.

1177
01:25:02,109 --> 01:25:04,351
Big, Big, Big Bunny.

1178
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:09,388
What are we gonna do with this?

1179
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:13,975
Don't worry. I'll think of something.
Don't I always?

1180
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,309
Don't you trust me?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1181
01:25:16,413 --> 01:25:16,978
I don't know.

1182
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:19,919
Oh, come on. When have I ever...


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
