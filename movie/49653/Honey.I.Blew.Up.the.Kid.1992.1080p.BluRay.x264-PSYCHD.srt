内华达州 滨海社区

3
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,247
- 早上好 各位 近来怎样?
- 早，奥齐
Good morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.

4
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,810
Morning, Ozzie.

5
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,810
我听说他是个什么发明家
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

6
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,675
尼克 吃早饭了
Nick, breakfast.

7
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,722
尼克!
Nick.
- I'm coming.

8
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,516
来了

9
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,010
你的手长大了
Your hands are getting bigger now

10
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,681
胳膊和腿也长长了
Your arms and legs are longer now

11
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:38,980
甚至你的内在感觉也在长
You even sense your insides
grow when Mom and Dad...

12
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,157
- 韦恩
- 什么事 亲爱的?
Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

13
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,868
- 小宝宝在哪儿?
- 在婴儿围栏里
Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

14
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,912
他从围栏里跑出来了
He gets out of the playpen.
- No, I fixed it.

15
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,373
不会 我修好了

16
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,333
亲爱的 我不想烦你
Sweetheart, I hate to remind you, but
the last time you fixed the playpen...

17
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,169
可上次你修好围栏

18
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,796
他还是跑出来了
...he still got out of it.

19
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,048
好吧！他这次不会了
Well, he won't get out this time.

20
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,011
嘿 小宝贝是吧？
Hiya.
Will you, big buddy, huh?

21
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,014
修围栏对我来说轻而易举 不是吗?
I'm certainly capable of fixing
a playpen, aren't I?

22
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,974
毕竟你还只是个婴儿
You're just a little baby, after all.
- Your hat?

23
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:09,901
- 你的帽子?
- 是头盔
It's my helmet.
- New one?

24
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,256
- 新的?
- 对 是新的
Yeah, it's a new one.

25
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,521
看！它能给我刮胡子，看见了吗?
See, it shaves me.
See that?

26
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,149
那儿
There.

27
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,653
艾米 已经决定了，我跟你一起去，不用再说了
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

28
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,821
妈！首先
Mom, in the first place, I'm not
the first girl who has ever gone...

29
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,226
我不是第一个离家上大学的女孩
...away to college.

30
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,283
其次，我们...
And in the second place, we're...
- Mom.

31
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,826
- 妈！
- 抱歉

32
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,912
就这样

33
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,915
- 想听声音吗?声音?
- 是的 我想听声音
Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, yeah, I want to hear a noise.

34
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,292
- 这个?
- 好吧 这次...
This one?
- Yeah. Now, this time...

35
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,668
- 这个
- 好的
This one.
Okay.

36
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,425
- 听见没?
- 是的 听见了
Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.

37
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,052
- 还听吗?
- 当然
More?
Sure.

38
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,304
妈！假设你是个女孩
Mom, let's say you were a girl.
- I think I can visualize it.

39
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,389
我认为我能想像出来

40
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,601
你认为我很讨厌吗?
我是说 只看外表
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me, I mean.

41
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,812
妈！这是个反问句
用不着回答
It's a rhetorical question, Mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

42
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,315
我是某个特定的女孩吗?
Am I any girl in particular?
- No.

43
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,566
不是

44
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,651
只是个女孩或许 我不知道...
Just a girl I might, I don't know,
ask to go to the movies or something.

45
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,737
问她要去看电影什么的

46
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:06,033
尼克，你已经是一个英俊的小伙子了
Nicky, you are turning into
a very handsome young man.

47
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,701
你会和你爸爸一样帅
You're gonna be just like your dad.
- Honey...

48
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,119
亲爱的

49
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,747
你能帮我调整一下调节器吗?
...can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

50
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,129
好吧 如果我不在家，但是你和尼克想要出门
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone...

51
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,340
保姆的电话在厨房里
...the baby-sitter's number's in the kitchen.

52
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,803
- 他怎么了?
- 我想是为了一个女孩
What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

53
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,305
尼克? 我们的尼克?
Nick? Our Nick?

54
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,433
你知道 他已经长大了
难道你没注意到吗？
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

55
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,236
哦
Uh-oh.

56
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,738
- 我能修好
- 我先修理你 小坏蛋!
I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk.

57
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,989
尼克 住手!

58
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,186
Nick, stop.

59
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,078
- 亚当 这不好
- 对不起 妈妈
Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

60
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,789
好，希望你是真心的，过来
Yes, I should hope so.
Come on.

61
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,961
- 哦 天哪
- 你越来越重了
Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

62
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,048
你是怎么能溜出围栏的？
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

63
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,802
也许咱们不该把他关在围栏里
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

64
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,929
我说了我能修好
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.

65
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,848
我又不笨

66
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,852
我从来没有说过你笨
I never said you were stupid.

67
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,105
出租车来了
Taxi's here.

68
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,276
早餐怎么样?
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?

69
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:23,944
好吃吗?

70
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,325
嗯 棒极了
Mmm, fantastic.

71
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,786
出租车会把妈妈送去飞机场
The taxi's gonna
take Mommy to the airport.

72
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,998
然后妈妈会带艾米适应新学校
And then Mommy's gonna show Amy
her new room at school.

73
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,876
希望托儿所能把他搞的筋疲力尽
Hopefully they'll tire him out at day care.

74
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,211
那我回家他就能睡个午觉了
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

75
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,838
不许睡午觉!
No nap.
- Honey...

76
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,716
亲爱的, 我们别在两岁孩子面前说“不”
...we don't say the 'n' word
around two-year-olds.

77
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,884
亚当

78
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:51,458
好吧 亚当的早餐在冰箱里
...is in the freezer...

79
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,932
保姆的电话我贴在了冰箱上
Adam.
- And I put the baby-sitter's...
...number on the refrigerator.

80
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,517
还有什么事情来着?
Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting some...

81
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,006
- 我肯定我忘了什么
- 黛安 黛安 放心吧
Diane, Diane, relax.

82
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,771
你认为我不能处理这些事情吗?
Don't you think I can handle
things around here?

83
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,317
你当然可以 亲爱的
Of course you can, honey.

84
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,988
亲够了，伙计们
Break it up, guys.

85
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,366
爸，别担心，她到了那儿发现没什么事可做
Don't worry, Dad. She'll get there,
realize there's nothing to do...

86
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,410
就会马上回来的
...turn around,
and come right back.

87
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,370
再见
Bye.

88
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:22,077
再见 尼克
快点 艾米 我们得出发了
Bye, Nick.
- Come on, Amy. We gotta get going.

89
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,673
哦 别忘了在你上班时送尼克和亚当
Oh. Don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

90
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,050
天哪！时间
Gosh, the time. I got to get you
to work. I got a big test today.

91
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,260
先送你去打工， 我今天有个大实验

92
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,263
- 再见
- 再见 妈
Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

93
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,019
快点 快点
Come on. Come on.

94
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,523
加油 加油
Come on. Come on.

95
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,318
你行的，真是个好女孩
You can do it.
Atta girl.

96
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,248
沙兰斯基试验第1277号
Szalinski test number 1277.

97
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
第5组水晶
Crystal Group 5.

98
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,002
我们是不是该等下沙兰斯基?
Shouldn't we wait for Szalinski?

99
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,588
也许这能教会他不要迟到
Maybe this will teach him
to be here on time.

100
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,675
沙兰斯基不是主角，而是我
Szalinski isn't running the show.
I am.

101
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,305
这次最好能成功 所以专心点
This better work this time,
so concentrate.

102
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,274
4, 3, 2, 1, 0
...four, three, two, one, zero.

103
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,122
拿着
Here.

104
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,933
对不起 各位
Sorry, everybody. There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun,

105
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,394
一大块积雨云挡住了太阳

106
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,299
害的我的车失去了动力
and I-I lost power.

107
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,814
还有，我的儿子找了份暑期工
And my son got a job for the summer...
Wet and Wild. I had to drop him off.

108
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,190
我得去送他

109
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,359
你脸上粘着什么东西?
What's that stuff on your face?

110
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,114
哦 对不起 亨得利克森博士?
Oh, excuse me, Dr Hendrickson?
- I'm sick and tired of this.

111
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,116
我受够了这些!

112
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,951
现在, 我们取得了些成果
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments...

113
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:21,525
模仿沙兰斯基缩小物体实验已经获得成功
...shrinking matter.

114
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,498
但是颠倒程序，将物体放大
But reversing the process,
enlarging matter...

115
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,543
却让我们一点头绪都没有
...has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

116
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,297
克利福德·斯特林要求有成果
Clifford Sterling demands results.

117
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,299
他的董事会也要求有成果
His board of directors demands results,
the United States government...

118
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,038
美国政府也要有成果
...demands results...

119
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,054
- 作为项目主管的我，应该
- 对不起，亨得利克森博士
...and as project director, I...
- Excuse me, Dr Hendrickson.

120
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,513
我再和你说一遍,韦恩
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project co-director,

121
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,878
作为项目负责人 我也要求有成果
I intend to deliver results.

122
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,144
我自己就这一问题做了些试验 先生
L-I've been doing some work on my own
on the problem, sir.

123
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,395
- 是的 韦恩
- 我想你看下这些计算
Yes, Wayne.
I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...

124
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:48,677
- 你会发现...
- 韦恩  韦恩  韦恩  韦恩
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

125
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,817
当你把设备卖给斯特林实验室时
When you licensed your device
to Sterling Labs, you were promised...

126
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:55,308
我们保证给你派出国内最出色的人
...that the finest minds in the country
would be working on it, and they are.

127
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,780
我们做到了

128
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,448
- 我知道 先生
- 好 好
I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

129
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,283
但是如果你看这些记录
But I-I think if you look at these
notes, you'll find that although...

130
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,410
你会发现尽管...

131
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,733
曼蒂？
Mandy?
- Yeah, Rick?

132
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,650
- 什么事 里克?
- 是尼克
Nick.
- Nick.

133
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,278
尼克

134
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,075
嘿 尼克 你爸爸开太空船来了
Hey, Nick, your dad's here
in his spaceship. The Dweezil Wheels.

135
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,411
- 好傻的车
- 我们又来了

136
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,579
嘿, 尼克!要搭车吗
Hey, Nicky.
Want a ride?

137
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,626
嘿, 快看 怪车
Hey, look. It's the Nerdmobile.
- Hey, look at that.

138
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:53,705
哦 天呐
祝你飞行愉快
Oh, man.
- Have a nice flight.

139
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,175
- 真感谢你 老爸
- 谢什么?
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

140
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,262
没什么
Nothing.

141
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,558
爸！你在学校受欢迎吗?
Dad, were you ever popular in school?
- You bet.

142
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,601
当然

143
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,438
我连任两届天文俱乐部的主席
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

144
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:13,274
我们都很聪明
We were happenin' guys.

145
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,277
那么, 你妈说你喜欢一个女孩？
So Mom tells me that there's some girl?

146
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,445
什么?
What?

147
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,408
不 不 我 我只是随便问问
No. No, I was...
I was just wondering.

148
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,167
飞行愉快吗?
How was your flight?
Uh-huh. N-No, fine.

149
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,127
哦 不 很好

150
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,004
不 我们刚到家
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.

151
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,297
正在准备晚餐

152
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:42,304
什么声音? 呃 只是电话线路有点问题
What noise? Uh, it was just
a bad connection, that's all.

153
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,141
小宝宝呢? 他很好
The baby?
Well, h-he's fine.

154
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,559
他在围栏里吗
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it. He can't get out.

155
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,269
是，我修好了

156
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,937
他出不来

157
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,901
- 冰淇淋
- 艾米的宿舍怎么样?
Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

158
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,945
很好
Uh-huh. Yeah.

159
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,364
嘿，住手
Hey, stop it.

160
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,326
没什么事，只是狗
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

161
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,203
是的，一切都好
No, everything's fine.

162
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,581
你太多虑了
Boy, you worry too much.

163
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,375
什么? 鸡?
What? The chicken?

164
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,836
亲爱的 你留下的鸡看上去很好
Well, the chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

165
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,472
我在想正好妈妈和艾米都不在家
So I was thinking,
with Mom and Amy out of town...

166
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,850
咱们俩可以有机会聊聊 呃
...that this would give us guys
a chance to, uh, talk about, uh...

167
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,685
你知道 谈谈男人的事情
...you know, the birds and the bees.

168
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,694
给你 尼克
Here, Nicky.

169
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,547
知道我在想什么吗 宝贝？
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny? What?

170
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,631
想什么?

171
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,967
我们应该对尼克多关心点
I was thinking we got to be nice to
our brother Nick. You know why? No, why?

172
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,052
- 知道为什么吗?
- 不知道 为什么?

173
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,221
因为他刚搬来一个新地方
Well, because he moved away to
a new place now, and he's got to make...

174
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,127
他需要结交新朋友,就像你和我一样
...all new friends, just like me and you.

175
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
- 是吗?
- 是的
Yeah?
- Yeah.

176
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,394
- 我们现在唱歌怎么样？
- 好的
Shall we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,437
- 唱什么歌好呢？
- 字母歌
What song shall we sing?
- 'ABCs.'

178
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,439
- 唱"小星星"怎么样?
- 字母歌
How about 'Twinkle, Twinkle'?
- 'ABC.'

179
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,358
- 字母歌?
- 是的
'ABC'?
- Yeah.

180
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,194
- ♪ 一闪 一闪
- 要字母歌
Twinkle, twinkle...
- 'ABCs'.

181
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,654
来唱 ♪一闪 一闪 亮晶晶
Let's sing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.'

182
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,114
要字母歌
'ABCs.'

183
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,909
好吧, 先唱字母歌
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K, L-M-N-O-P
'ABCs'? Okay, first 'ABCs.'
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P

184
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,703
现在唱小星星好吗?
Now 'Twinkle, Twinkle,' okay?

185
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,538
好
Okay.

186
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:38,253
♪一闪，一闪，亮晶晶
Twinkle, twinkle little star

187
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,589
♪满天都是
How I won...

188
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,093
♪小星星
What you are...

189
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,305
如果成功了，你可就发大财了 查尔斯
...lt'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

190
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,807
会成功的，我会让它成功的
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

191
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,518
这些年来 我看到克利福德·斯特林
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself...

192
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,466
想出一个又一个疯狂的主意
...to one crazy idea after another.

193
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,024
我得告诉你，董事会对这个问题很担心
I have to tell you,
the board of directors is very worried.

194
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:03,807
请稍等片刻
亨得利克森
If you'll pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.

195
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,572
喂?
Hello?

196
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,873
那是什么?
是气球爆了，亨得利克森博士
What was that?
- It was a balloon popping,

197
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:09,688
Dr Hendrickson.

198
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,536
我哄儿子睡觉时突然有了灵感
I got the idea while singing my kid to sleep.

199
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,788
你瞧，如果你吹气球太用力
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force...

200
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,625
而没有足够时间膨胀 气球就会爆炸
...you don't allow the molecules time
to expand, and the balloon pops.

201
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,792
有问题吗?
Problem?
- No, Szalinski.

202
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,210
没有，沙兰斯基

203
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,670
哦 他
Oh, him.

204
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,926
为什么克利福德坚持让他参与这个项目
Why Clifford insists on keeping
him involved is absolutely beyond me.

205
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,011
要是由我一个人来负责
If I were running this project
by myself right now,

206
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,056
那么我们早就名声大振了
we'd be neck-deep in apples...
...the size of Buicks.

207
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,516
董事会有些成员同意你的看法
There are those of us on
the board who would agree with you.

208
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,478
...原子结构基本完整...
...fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure...

209
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:39,843
克利福德·斯特林也许没有意识到这一点
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

210
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:44,241
他对公司、对股东来说都过时了
...to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

211
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,238
我认为他的继任者应该是早就定好的,
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion...

212
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,285
特别是如果你能让这东西成功的话
...especially if you're the one to
actually make this thing work.

213
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,205
...因此给分子足够的时间使其膨胀...
...thereby allowing the
molecules time to expand...

214
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,458
而不破坏原子结构，你好?
...without tearing the atomic fabric.
Hello?

215
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,461
沙兰斯基？
Szalinsk... Szalinski...

216
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,381
干嘛不把你对气球的研究写下来?
...why don't you write up this, uh,
balloon research of yours?

217
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,466
我明天就可以交给你
I can do the math and have it
on your desk tomorrow.

218
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:08,914
不 不必了
No, that's not necessary.

219
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,220
好吧 周末愉快 沙兰斯基
All right, have a good weekend, Szalinski.

220
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,641
"周末愉快 沙兰斯基"?
'Have a good weekend, Szalinski'?

221
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,190
- 喂?
- 嗨，请曼蒂接电话好吗?
Hello?
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

222
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,942
好的，曼蒂，电话!
Sure.
Mandy, phone.

223
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,903
- 喂?
- 嗨 曼蒂?
Hello?
- Hi, Mandy?

224
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,578
我能修好
I'll fix it.

225
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,956
爸爸!
Daddy.
- Hey, what are you doing up, little guy?

226
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,916
嘿 你在干嘛 小家伙？

227
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,546
嘿 尼克 明天想和我一起工作吗?
Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?

228
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,451
嗯 当然
Yeah, sure.

229
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,091
好的，来吧，伙计
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.

230
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,010
再讲一个故事

231
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,594
那明天想跟我和尼克
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky...

232
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,721
去实验室玩吗?

233
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,748
...down to the lab and we'll play?

234
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,811
好的 伙计们
Okay, guys.

235
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,480
看见了吗 亚当 这就是爸爸工作的地方
See, Adam, this is where Daddy works.

236
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,774
- 要我帮你拿那个吗?
- 好的
Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

237
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,696
这事得小心点
Got to be a little bit discreet about this.

238
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,114
什么?

239
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:13,228
Huh?

240
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,409
- 沙兰斯基先生
- 嗨  史密提
Mr Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.

241
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,787
- 你好，你今天还上班吗?
- 呃 只是来整理一下东西
Hello. You working today?
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little bit.

242
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,255
- 哇
- 哇
Wow.
- Wow.

243
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,591
- 这才是实验室
- 实验室
This is some lab.
- Some lab.

244
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,052
比我们阁楼的那个强吧？
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

245
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,554
- 强多了
- 强多了
Way better.
- Way better.

246
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,767
对 请给我接亨得利克森博士?
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr Hendrickson, please?

247
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,066
你帮我输入下主要激光驱动程序
Call up a command directory
labeled 'primary laser drive.'

248
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,234
再告诉我强度一栏的显示

249
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,733
Tell me what it says under 'intensity.'

250
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,285
- 上面显示拒绝访问
- 拒绝访问?
It says 'access denied.'
- Access denied?

251
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,500
我得想办法降低激光强度
Got to figure out some way how
to lower the intensity of the laser.

252
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,670
嘿 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

253
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,008
我们或许可以散射它
We could diffuse it maybe.

254
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,306
是个好主意
That's a good idea.

255
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,272
现在设定最终目标
Now we'll set final target.
- Target what, Dad?

256
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,982
什么目标 爸爸？

257
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,907
- 借我用下行吗？
- 不行
Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

258
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,828
来吧 让我看看能不能把兔子先生真的变大？
Come on. Let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really Big Bunny, huh?

259
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,881
是的，先生，我认为他星期六来这不正常
Yes, sir. I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

260
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,634
你向我汇报是正确的 谢谢你
No, you did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

261
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,681
好了 我不玩了
Well, that's it for me.

262
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,684
嘿 你得戴上眼镜
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

263
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,769
好了
There you go.

264

Dang. Power surge.

00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,962
无法取消
Unable to abort.

274
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,464
乔,你那边怎么回事?
Joe, what's happening up here?

275
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,527
呃，沙兰斯基先生
您的安全等级
Uh, Mr Szalinski.
Uh, your security clearance...

276
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,657
没有亨得利克森博士的许可，你是不能够使用这些设备的
...denies you access to the equipment...
...without Dr Hendrickson's permission.

277
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,534
- 这个您是知道的 对吗？
- 知道 史密提
You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

278
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,705
呃 沙兰斯基先生
Uh, Mr Szalinski...

279
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,834
很抱歉我不得不...
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

280
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:58,343
你的宝宝...
真的开始长大了
That baby of yours.
Sure starting to get big.

281
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,550
再见，史密提
See you, Smitty.

282
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,767
我长大了
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

283
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,019
长大 长大 长大

284
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,272
爸, 你在自己的发明上工作
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission to work...

285
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,898
为什么还要别人许可?

286
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,985
这样 尼克 爸爸现在是一个团队的成员,
...on your own invention?
Well, Nick, Dad's a member
of a team now, and I'm working...

287
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:19,558
我和一些非常有才华的人共事
...with some real talented people.

288
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,030
但是，爸！这是你的发明啊
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.

289
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,366
不是他们的点子，是你的！

290
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,561
好吧 宝贝
Okay, bud. Looks like Daddy...

291
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,552
看来爸爸要多花点时间陪陪尼克了 好吗？?
...needs to spend a little quality time
with Nick, okay?

292
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,025
我要给你找个保姆
So I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.
You're gonna have yourself a good time.

293
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,068
你会过的非常愉快的

294
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,696
- 尼克
- 好的
Nick.
- Yeah.

295
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,370
你好像重了点?
You puttin' on a little bit of weight?

296
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,007
我长大了
I'm big.

297
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,513
听我说 爸爸要给你做顿又快又好吃的午餐
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

298
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,682
低热量的东西怎么样
Maybe kind of a low-cal thing.

299
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,060
你认为呢？
一定很棒
What do you think, huh?
It's gonna be good.

300
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,145
好的,你要知道什么?
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.

301
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,938
好的 听我说 坐好抓紧他

302
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,012
让兔子先生陪你一会
我要做事了...
This guy's gonna keep you company,
and I'm gonna make...

303
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,693
哦 保姆的电话，保姆、保姆
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

304
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,824
555-5654.
555-5654.

305
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:52,628
好了 午餐
这个怎么样？
Okay, so lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?

306
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,998
喂?

307
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,042
- 嗨 是曼蒂·帕克吗?
- 是我
Yeah?
- Hi, is this Mandy Park?

308
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,465
呃，三点半? 好的,沙文斯基先生
Uh, 3:30?
Sounds okay, Mr Schlitzminski.

309
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,966
是沙兰斯基，亲爱的
Uh, Szalinski, dear.
- Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

310
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,219
沙兰斯基，是的，我说的是这个

311
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,346
我每小时收费2块5
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,

312
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,544
当然，我什么事都做
I actually have to do anything...

313
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,102
但如果要我换尿布给孩子清洗什么的
需要另外加钱
...like change diapers
or clean up or something,
in which case, the price goes up.

314
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,021
哦 不 你只要看好他就行了 真的
Oh, no. All you have to do
is just-just watch him, really.

315
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,273
- 好吧 3点半见
- 好的
Okay, see yOu at 3:30.
- Okay.

316
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,370
好了
Okay.

317
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,989
这碗是夸克的还是你的?
Okay. Are these Quark's or yours?

318
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:31,744
待这别动
You just stay here, okay?

319
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,621
电话里她听上去很不错
She sounded great on the phone.
- I want to go to a restaurant.

320
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,538
- 我要去饭店吃
- 你要去饭店吃？
可我已经做好饭了，很棒的
You want to go to a restaurant?
But I just made this stuff.

321
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,548
好吧 我来当服务员 好吗？
Well, um, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh, let me take your order.

322
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,550
我来帮你点菜

323
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,844
- 你想吃点什么呢？
- 我要吃鸭子
What would you like?
- I want the duck.

324
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,763
鸭子，鸭子，今晚的鸭子不太好
Duck. The duck...
The duck is not very good tonight.

325
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,723
我给你推荐个特餐怎么样？
Uh, can I recommend the special?

326
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,518
- 好的
- 太好了 我们今天有例汤
Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have soup du jour.

327
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,271
有汉堡，还有炸薯条
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

328
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,565
- 你想尝尝吗
- 好的
Would you like 'em?
- Okay.

329
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,109
- 好的，我马上回来
- 好的
All right.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

330
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,470
嘿 尼克 想看电影吗?就我们俩
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

331
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,514
好啊 正好有部片子我想看
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert Six
I wanted to see.

332
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,601
太好了，去看吧，可以让我们忘掉烦恼
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

333
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,144
我查查时间表
I'll check show times.
- Okay, and then maybe afterwards,

334
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,604
好的 或许看完电影之后

335
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,387
我们可以去吃点东西
we can get a bite to eat or something.

336
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,734
大、大兔子
Big, Big Bunny.

337
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,161
什么声音？
What's that?

338
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,624
它怎么了？
What's gotten into him?

339
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,552
爸 怎么搞的？
Dad, how?
- Where were you in the lab this morning?

340
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:13,500
你刚才在实验室看好亚当了吗？
Were you watching Adam?

341
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:14,555
他在仪器旁边
He was off to the side.
- But at the moment of discharge,

342
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:16,670
激光发射的那个时候，他在哪？
where was he?

343
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,144
发射前我看他在推车上 不在吗?
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side. Wasn't he?

344
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,772
我不这么认为
Somehow, I don't think so.

345
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,199
哼
Boo.

346
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,794
别担心 亚当
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make everything okay.

347
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,587
爸爸会把你变回去的

348
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,178
好吧 我们得把他带回实验室
Okay, we got to get him back to the lab,
analyse the data...

349
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:56,626
分析数据 把程序颠倒过来
...and reverse the process.

350
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,682
- 有个问题,爸!
- 什么?
One thing, Dad.
- What?

351
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,725
你不觉得我们带着个七尺高的婴儿
Do you think the security guard might
get suspicious with us walking in...

352
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,561
会让保安怀疑吗？

353
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,729
哦，有道理
...with a seven-foot baby?
Good point.

354
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,718
只能遮住你的脸和头发
This will cover your head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.

355
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,303
拿去，亚当把它戴上

356
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:37,972
好啦

357
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,349
他看上去像穿错衣服的养蜂人
There. He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

358
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,060
好吧
All right. Okay.
Now just act natural.

359
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,563
表情自然点

360
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,149
快点 孩子
Come on, bud.
Atta boy.

361
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:55,531
史密提! 我忘记拿钥匙，我的车钥匙！
我没法开车了
Smitty. Smitty. Um, I forgot the,
um, the keys, uh, to my van,
and I couldn't-couldn't start the van.

362
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,743
我忘在实验室了，我也不会动用里面任何设备的
It's in the lab.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going...
...to use anything in there...

363
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,912
因为你知道的，我的安全级别不够
你之前提到过的
...because of my security, you know,
access... a-access thing,
which you mentioned earlier.

364
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,998
所以我只是进去拿我的钥匙
So I'm just gonna get
the keys in the lab now.

365
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:10,555
亚当
Adam.

366
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,300
快点 下来
Come on, down.

367
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,388
沙兰斯基
Szalinski.
- Go back up.

368
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,806
快上去

369
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,351
我只是路过想顺便
Just stopped by to do
some, uh, computations...

370
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,936
在数据库里做点检查
...in the... in the database.

371
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,938
数据库被删除了
The database has been erased.
Our entire experiment, gone.

372
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,774
我们整个实验的数据都没了

373
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:30,900
快回去 回去
Get back. Back.

374
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,318
- 删除了?
- 所有38G资料
Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.

375
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:33,682
- 怎么可能
- 当然可能
It can't be.

376
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:37,310
因为你用这破玩意堵住了过滤器
Sure it can, if the main controller was
trying to compensate laser intensity...

377
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,909
想使主控制器减少激光强度 你这白痴
...for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot...

378
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,245
造成了整个电力系统的超载
...causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

379
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,955
那是谁?
Who was that?
- Who?

380
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,375
- 站住
- 谁?

381
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,211
- 戴帽子的
- 呃 我的一个朋友
The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a-a friend of mine.

382
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,880
- 他在说些什么啊？
- 是南斯拉夫语
Well, what language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

383
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,840
你把外国人带到实验室
You let a foreigner into the lab.
- He's not a foreigner. He's my wife's

384
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,372
他不是外国人, 他是我老婆的叔叔亚纳什,来自南斯拉夫
Uncle Yanosh from Yugoslavia.

385
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,470
他是亲戚 他只是想看看实验室
He's family, and he just wanted to see
the lab, and I... and I brought him here.

386
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,596
我就把他带来了

387
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,640
他可是个天才
没看见他头那么大吗？
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

388
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,518
智商高达225 超大头盖骨
225, the IQ on that man.
An extended brainpan.

389
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,895
- 超大头盖骨?
- 要尿尿
Extended brainpan?
Bafroom.
- No bathroom right now, Adam.

390
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,316
- 他刚才说"尿尿"?
- 是Bafoom，南斯拉夫语
Did he say 'bathroom'?
- Bafoon. Bafoon. Yugoslavian.

391
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,318
是感谢的意思
It's a term of, uh, of appreciation.

392
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,279
“Bafoom:谢谢你星期六带我
'Bafoon: Thank you for bringing me down
here on a Saturday to the lab...

393
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,687
到这实验室来参观”就这个意思
...to look around,' that's all.

394
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,702
用备用电机启动系统需要多长时间?
How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?

395
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,121
这不关你的事，你被开除出这个项目了
Well, that doesn't concern you.
You're off the project.

396
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,290
你无权作此决定
You don't have the authority
to make that decision.

397
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,626
好吧, 也许不能，那你何不直接打电话给克利福德·斯特林
Well, maybe I don't.

398
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,002
向他申述
So why don't you call Clifford Sterling
personally and plead your case.

399
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,130
但是 得知这次你给实验室造成了
However, after this morning's little
escapade, and the time and money...

400
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,119
时间和金钱上的损失以后
...it'll cost Sterling Labs...

401
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,050
我不认为老家伙还会同情你
I don't think the old man
will have a great deal of sympathy.

402
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,969
我想你还是不要自找没趣了
So I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment of having...

403
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,512
省的我叫警卫...

404
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,763
送你出去

405
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,384
...to be escorted to the gate.

406
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,146
开始数据恢复工作
Start working data restoration backwards
from 8:56 this morning...

407
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:55,013
恢复今早8点56分后到系统崩溃的那段时间的数据
...to the exact time the system crashed.

408
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,278
我要知道他到底都做了些什么
I want to know what he was up to.

409
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,787
你为什么不告诉他们 爸爸？
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then...

410
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,279
我的意思是,至少让他们知道
他们办不到的事情你办到了
...they'd know that you were able to
make it work when nobody else could.

411
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,670
听着，尼克！还记得我跟你们唠叨了两天
Look, Nick. Remember we made you kids
promise never, ever to tell anyone...

412
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,839
让你们永远不要将你们被缩小的事告诉任何人吗？
...you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?

413
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:17,828
记得
Yeah.

414
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,092
那是因为我不想让你们变成研究对象
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,

415
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,262
接受数不清的实验和无休止的观察
to undergo countless tests...

416
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,764
天知道还有什么
...to go through endless observations
and who knows what else.

417
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,392
亚当怎么办?
我们该怎么做?
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

418
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,562
我不知道
I don't know.
What I do know is...

419
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,398
我知道的就是

420
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,319
我们得在你妈妈回来之前搞定一切
...we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

421
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,420
嘿 我回来了
Hi, guys.
I'm home.

422
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,914
这东西哪来的?
Where'd this come from?

423
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,175
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?
- I don't know.

424
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,593
我不知道

425
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,388
我们要不逃到墨西哥躲起来
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

426
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,141
等他长大了再回来 我意思是岁数大了
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean, older.

427
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,228
- 可能她就不会注意了
- 不行
Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

428
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,397
最好的办法就是诚实 尼克
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

429
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,484
我来向她解释
I'll just explain.

430
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,611
好吧
Sure. It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

431
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,905
反正这种事在咱们家发生...

432
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,865
也不是第一次了
...to our family.

433
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:30,108
我会告诉她真相
I'll just tell the truth.
- Then beg for mercy.

434
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,298
- 再求她原谅
- 彩色车车
Coloured car.

435
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,220
- 你搞什么鬼?
- 嗯...
What was that all about?
- Um, I had a little trouble...

436
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:47,876
嗯 车出了点毛病
...with the van.

437
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:51,809
我想按停车的 结果按了倒车钮
L-I-I thought I put it in, uh, in-in
park, and it went into reverse...

438
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,687
因为"P" 和"R" 看起来差不多...
你这么早就回来了
'cause the 'P' and the...
and the 'R' look...

439
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,604
来吧，大家伙
You're back early.
- Yeah, I-I took a cab from the airport.

440
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,346
是的，我从机场打车回来的，知道吗,我真的是很傻
You know, it really was silly.

441
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,818
艾米根本不需要我
Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man in the loud sport coat?

442
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,112
那个穿运动服的人是谁？

443
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,446
别动 不 不 那些是尼克的
Stop. No. No, those are Nick's.

444
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,074
好吧 黛安 我正要和你谈这事呢
Well, Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Now, the-the...

445
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:10,077
- 坐下，坐下!
- 妈妈
Sit down.
- Mom.
Sit down.

446
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,831
你知道有时我发明的东西
You know how sometimes
the-the things that I invent...

447
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,208
并不完全和我设想的一致?
...don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

448
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,586
亲爱的 告诉我吧
Sweetheart, you can tell me.
How bad can it be?

449
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,170
到底

450
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,089
还能有多糟？
After all, it's not like you did
something to one of the kids again.

451
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,758
只要不再像上次那样把孩子变小

452
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,347
- 韦恩，亚当在哪?
- 呃
Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

453
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,141
车上那个人是谁？
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?

454
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,935
这个兔子是哪来的？

455
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,188
- 好吧，我坦白，我闯祸了
- 闯什么祸?
All right, I confess. I did it.
- Did what?

456
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,274
我在这儿
Peekaboo.

457
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,360
我把孩子放大了
I blew up the baby.

458
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,073
妈妈摔倒了
Mama fall down.
Mama?

459
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,575
妈妈?

460
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,745
- 她怎么样?
- 和以前一样
How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

461
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,663
妈妈睡着了？
Mama sleeping?

462
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,916
我要杀了韦恩
I'll kill Wayne.
- You don't want to kill Wayne.

463
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,918
你不想杀韦恩

464
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,128
我要杀了韦恩
I want to kill Wayne.

465
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,671
他在干嘛?
What's he doing?
- He's playing with his toys.

466
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,590
他在玩他的玩具

467
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,175
快让他住手
Well, make him stop.

468
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:11,230
"让他住手"
'Make him stop.'

469
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,142
我怎么早没想到?
Why didn't I think of that?

470
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,353
亚当
Adam.

471
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,855
亚当 别闹了!
Adam, stop fooling around.

472
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,191
- 接着
- 亚当
Catch.
- Adam.

473
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,861
- 那是个真的火箭
- 我们出去走走 亚当
That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

474
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,447
- 玩球 尼克
- 别拿东西扔尼克!
Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick.

475
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,032
接着,玩球
Catch it.
- This is your last warning.

476
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,241
这是你的最后警告

477
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,913
好吧 我再给你一次机会
Okay, I'll give you one more warning.

478
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,537
亲爱的，嘘，嘘，看上去也没那么糟
Honey, shh, shh.
It's not as bad as it seems.

479
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,343
几乎是不可能的 对吗？
It almost couldn't be,
could it?

480
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,097
好了, 我终于把他弄进房间了
Well, I finally got him in his room.

481
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,226
告诉他呆在屋里把门关上
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

482
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,187
我已经关上了
I did close the door.

483
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,481
他刚刚打开了
He just opened his door.

484
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,736
- 他决定和我们分享
- 我把它拆了
And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.

485
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:09,768
哦 宝贝
Oh, baby.

486
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,074
亚当 把门放下 亲爱的
Adam, put the door down,
sweetheart.

487
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,034
把门给爸爸好吗 亚当?
Why don't you give
the door to Daddy, Adam?

488
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,413
- 把门给爸爸 亚当
- 我来修 我来修
Give Daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

489
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,666
要让社区居民委员会看看
Wait till the Vista Del Mar
Standards Committee sees this.

490
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,587
别小题大作了 只是个信箱而已
Maybe we shouldn't bother with it.
It's just a mailbox.

491
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,716
小事情有时候也会出大问题 帕蒂
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

492
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,844
- 放开门 亚当
- 不 是我的门
Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

493
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:36,018
- 别伤着人
- 都住手!
Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go.

494
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,984
我来修!
I fix it.

495
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:50,863
别修了！亚当，把妈妈的咖啡桌放下
Don't fix it, Adam.
Just put down Mommy's coffee table.

496
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,366
- 小心 宝贝
- 慢点 亚当
Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Ad-Ad-Adam.

497
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,493
噢

498
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:58,037
- 轻点 轻点
- 别动我的古董椅子!
Not my antique chair.
- Gentle. Gentle.

499
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:03,238
他们在装修吗?
回来，回这来
They remodelling in there?
- Come back. Come back here.

500
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,961
亚当 亚当!
Adam. Adam.

501
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,464
亚当 坐下
Adam, sit down. Sit down, Adam.
- He's on this side.

502
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,841
- 他到这边来了
- 拦住他, 爸！他在你那

503
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,260
- 哦 亚当
- 这不是玩游戏
He's yours.
- Oh, Adam.
This is not a game.

504
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,012
我们抓到他该怎么办?
What do we do when we catch him?
- Adam, Adam, hang on.

505
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,346
亚当，撑住

506
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:20,017
好的 等等 你们去那边 我走这边
Okay, wait. Okay.
You guys go that way. I'll go this way.

507
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:26,361
嘿 小家伙
Hi, little guy.

508
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,816
亚当 放下爸爸!
Adam, put Daddy down.
Adam, put Daddy down.

509
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,359
亚当 放下爸爸!

510
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,573
- 吉他
- 别进我的房间!
Guitar.
- Not my room.

511
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,869
亚当 放下我的吉他
放下
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

512
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,041
回这来，回来
Get back here.
- Come on.

513
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,796
他不是婴儿，他是个怪物
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

514
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,034
他会弄坏我的吉他!
He's gonna break my guitar.

515
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,013
回来，亚当
把吉他还给我!
Come back here. Come back here.
- Come back, Adam.
Give me back my guitar.

516
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,265
还给我，小捣蛋！
Give it back, you brat.

517
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:02,976
另一边
Other way.

518
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,897
- 吉他没有了
- 拿到了 拿去 藏起来
Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

519
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,653
他对准了什么东西
He targeted something.
But it's gonna take a lot more enhancing...

520
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,780
但是还要更多放大才能看清楚

521
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,034
你猜这里是什么?
What do you suppose this is here?
- Condensation on the lens?

522
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:23,193
- 镜头的水蒸气？
- 不是，更像固体
No, no, it's much too solid.
- How can you be sure?

523
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:27,906
- 你怎么能确定?
- 我肯定它不是水蒸气
是一团东西 我能看出来
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.

524
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,461
到这来跟爸爸玩
Play in here with Daddy.

525
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,840
- 玩什么?
- 玩什么都行
Play what?
- Play anything.

526
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,550
- 这能让他分心
- 好极了!
This should distract him.
- Great.

527
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,582
That's what it's all about

528
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:40,836
You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

529
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,589
You put your right foot in
and you shake it all about...

530
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,413
You do the Hokey Pokey
and you turn yourself around

531
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,398
跳舞 亚当
Yeah.
Dance, Adam.
- That's what it's all about...

532
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,818
很好，这只脚，亚当
Good. This foot, Adam.
- You do the Hokey Pokey...

533
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,862
很有趣吧  韦恩?
Isn't this fun, Wayne?
- That's what it's all about

534
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,352
亚当，来拍拍手，拍拍手
Clap your hands. Clap your hands.

535
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,686
You put your left foot in
- Put your left foot in. Good boy, Adam.

536
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,118
把脚放进来
You put your left foot out...
You put your left foot in
and you shake it all about

537
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
为什么关上百叶窗?
Why are you closing the shutters?

538
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,874
让邻居看见有个七尺高的巨型宝宝
So one of the neighbours doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby...

539
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,458
他们肯定要去通知“世界之最”不可
...and call the National Inquirer.

540
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,378
- 门铃
- 是谁?
That's what it's all about
- Doorbell.
Who's that?

541
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,671
一个邻居
One of the neighbours.
- So far, your plan's working perfectly.

542
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,840
现在来看 你这招还能管用

543
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,093
嗨！
Hi.
- Hello.

544
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:19,750
你好，我们听见喊叫声和嘈杂声
Hello.

545
00:36:19,854 --> 00:36:22,210
We heard shouting and a lot of noise...

546
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,892
所以想来看看是不是一切正常
...so we were just wondering
if everything was all right.

547
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,519
哦，是的，一切都好
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.

548
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,479
我们只是在玩闹

549
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,689
亚纳什叔叔
Uncle Yanosh.
- Uncle Yanersh.

550
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,316
亚纳什叔叔

551
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,973
You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out

552
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,820
别太用力，地板都踩裂了
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor.

553
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,656
- 再见
- 爸爸 帮帮我 他抱住我了
Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

554
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,533
我的肋骨要断了
He's breaking my ribs.
Oh, don't do that, Adam.

555
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,410
别这样，亚当

556
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:48,207
天哪，好像有三只眼睛
My God, it appears to have three eyes.

557
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,500
是一种新生物物种
A new life-form of some sort?

558
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,461
放大窗口比例
Try scaling up the window.

559
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:59,159
是个大发现
可能非常大
This could be big.
- This could be very big.

560
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,847
好吧，我认为你干的很好
Well, I think you did a great job with
these. This should really distract him.

561
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,807
那样很能分散他的注意力

562
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,353
- 是啊 他喜欢噪音
- 给你 宝贝
Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

563
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,063
好
Yeah. You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

564
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,941
你知道吗，尼克?无论你怎么说

565
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,944
这还是个围栏，亚当他不喜欢被关在围栏里
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

566
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,031
是的，但你得承认，妈妈
Yeah, but you have to admit, Mom,
not many guys could come up with...

567
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,439
这没有多少人能在半小时内完成这工作
...something like this in half an hour.

568
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,578
- 布谷
- 不，不，亚当
Cuckoo.
- No. No. Adam.

569
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,914
亲爱的,离那钟远点
Sweetheart, no, no, no.
Stay away from that, sweetheart.

570
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,874
亚当 拜托 别碰那东西
Adam, please,
please don't touch that.

571
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,543
亚当，不要，别碰妈妈的布谷钟
Adam, no, don't touch Mommy's cuckoo.

572
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,587
过来这里 亚当
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here and play with Nicky.

573
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,756
来这里,来和尼克玩

574
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,800
和尼克玩，亚当
Play with Nicky, Adam.

575
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,804
等你有时间 帮我看看这个
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

576
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,432
韦恩?
Wayne?

577
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,144
好吧...有些数据表明，在原子的内部...
Well, some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

578
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,647
好了，宝贝，说实话，好吗？
Please, honey, the truth, okay?
- The truth, Diane, is that...

579
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,699
说实话，黛安, 没有那些数据,
...without the access to the data
at the plant, I don't know...

580
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:00,225
我不知道我能做些什么
...that there's anything I can do.

581
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,989
我只知道发生了什么 但我不知道为什么
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

582
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:04,825
对不起 亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.
- Hey, Mom, look.

583
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,275
嘿！妈妈，看啊，我终于找到让他安静下来的方法了
I finally found a way to keep him quiet.

584
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,038
这里面有12支雪糕
There were 12 ice cream bars in there.

585
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,419
这下他可吃不下晚饭了
Well, he's ruined his dinner.
- Not necessarily, Mom.

586
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,212
恐怕不会，妈

587
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,048
看他的体重，他新陈代谢会很快的
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

588
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,884
也许我该闭嘴
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

589
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,307
好了，男孩们，我们出发吧
Okay, boys, we're going out.

590
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,769
- 黛安  你要干什么?
- 我要带他去实验室
Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

591
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,980
也许那边有人能够...
Maybe there's somebody there who...

592
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,523
有人知道他们在干吗?
Who knows what they're doing?

593
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:42,017
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now...

594
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:42,112
我很抱歉,但我现在所关心的

595
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,489
就是让宝宝缩小并恢复原状
...is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

596
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,825
快点, 尼克，帮我把他弄上车
Come on, Nicky.
Help me get him out to the van.

597
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,244
缩小?黛安，等等，我有主意了
Shrink?
Diane, wait. I got an idea.
My original machine...

598
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,444
我原来那部机器在实验室的仓库里
...it's in the lab security warehouse.

599
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,999
太好了
Yes.

600
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,959
我们这次是秘密行动
This'll have to be a covert operation.

601
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,296
黛安，你跟我走，尼克，你留下看着宝宝
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with the baby.

602
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,590
哦 不 我们不能把他们单独留在这儿
Oh, no.
We are not leaving them here alone.

603
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,258
黛安 不能把他带去实验室
Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

604
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,053
天知道亨得利克森会怎么对待他
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.

605
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:07,250
看看他,他已经很累了
Look at him.

606
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,140
我们出去这段时间他能睡个午觉
He's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.

607
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,350
不要午觉!
No nap.

608
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,688
看我拿的什么
Look who I got: Really Big Bunny.

609
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,982
好大的兔子

610
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,152
嗨 亚当
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.

611
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,487
你好 亚当

612
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,489
你很累了是不是 亚当?
You're real tired,
aren't you, Adam?

613
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,575
是的 他看起来真的很累
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

614
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,994
我们唱歌好吗?
Should we sing the song?

615
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,707
♪一闪，一闪，亮晶晶
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

616
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,087
♪满天都是小星星
How I wonder what you are

617
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,424
♪挂在天空放光明
Up above the world so high

618
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,553
♪就像千万小眼睛
Like a diamond in the sky

619
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,891
♪一闪，一闪，亮晶晶
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

620
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,394
- ♪满天都是...
- 这是我的!
How I won...
- Mine.

621
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,561
- 放手!
- 给我!
Let go.
- Gimme.

622
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,189
亚当·沙兰斯基 立刻放开那只兔子!
Adam Szalinski, you let go

623
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:00,941
把爸爸放开，亚当
Put Daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt Daddy.

624
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,692
不可以这样对爸爸

625
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,444
对不起 妈妈
Sorry, Mama.

626
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,738
好 我来做结构分析
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

627
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,951
亨得利克森博士，我们能辨认出头发，骨头，还有金属
Dr Hendrickson, we can make out hair,
bone and metal, all sort of intertwined.

628
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,494
各种交织在一起

629
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,330
我想你应该看看这个，是的，先生
I think you should take
a look at this. Yes, sir.

630
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,207
他马上过来
He's on his way.
- We'll show him...

631
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:19,614
我们先让他看看角蛋白分析
...the keratin analysis first.

632
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,837
- 先分析重叠图像
- 还不够清晰
Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

633
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,673
- 我想足够了
- 为什么不问问他?
I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

634
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,144
别担心 我们一小时内回来 快点
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour. Come on.

635
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,728
- 来吧
- 再见
Bye-bye.

636
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,542
这是我们最新的图像
This is our latest image, superimposing
structural and keratin analysis.

637
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,920
我们已经做了图像重叠和角蛋白分析

638
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,089
- 正如你看到的 它像是
- 好吧 过去点
And as you can see, there appears to...
- All right. Just move over.

639
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,928
是个孩子和绒毛玩具
It's a baby and a stuffed bunny.

640
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,057
沙兰斯基
Szalinski.

641
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,352
看来我得去拜访他一下
I'm gonna pay him a little visit.

642
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,479
继续工作
Back to work.
- I knew it was a baby.

643
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:07,701
我就知道这是个孩子
只是不确定这是只兔子
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

644
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:30,131
这需要点时间
This'll just take a second. They stored
all my stuff in one large crate.

645
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,008
他们把我所有的东西都放在一个大箱子里

646
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,636
- 应该很容易找到
- 哦 韦恩
It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

647
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,269
或许是按字母顺序或是别的
Maybe it's in
alphabetical order or something.

648
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:44,843
要不是怎么办?
What if it's not?

649
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,856
我本来是想带尼克去看电影

00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,863
我从一开始就提醒你要提防着沙兰斯基
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

785
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,990
对 你说过 查尔斯
Yes. Yes, you did, Charles.

786
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,075
说点安慰你的话
If it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors believed...

787
00:52:41,932 --> 00:52:43,066
董事会一直相信你是对的
...that you were right all along.

788
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,330
斯特林博士！斯特林博士！
我能把儿子恢复原样
Dr Sterling. Dr Sterling, sir.
I can reverse my son's growth.

789
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,416
给我一次机会，先生！我能让他恢复正常
Just give me a chance, sir.

790
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,834
- 你能?
- 用什么 沙兰斯基?
You can?
- Yeah, with what, Szalinski?

791
00:52:50,947 --> 00:52:51,992
用可口可乐瓶?
Coca-Cola bottles?

792
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,714
哼? 也许是口香糖或是绳子？
Hmm? Maybe some, what,
chewing gum and twine?

793
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,550
你以为你是谁 敢这样跟他说话？
Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?

794
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:58,759
黛安 让我来处理
Diane, let me handle this.

795
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,428
你以为你是谁 敢这样跟他说话？
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

796
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:01,543
克利福德先生,现在的情况必须要我
Clifford...

797
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,837
...the situation demands
that I bring in the people...

798
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,267
找些专家和有资格的人
...with the expertise and the credentials.

799
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,146
等等 你认为我只是一个满脑子疯狂主意
Wait a second. You think I'm just
some guy from Fresno...

800
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:12,481
躲在阁楼的乡巴佬吗？
...who tinkered with crackpot
ideas in his attic?

801
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,567
好吧，让我告诉你
Well, let me tell you something.

802
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,361
整个国家的基础都是建立在
This whole country is built on
the shoulders of people who tinkered...

803
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:21,730
那些满脑子疯狂主意的
躲在阁楼、地下室和后院的乡巴佬的肩上
...with crackpot ideas in attics
and basements and backyards.

804
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,035
亚历山大·格林汉姆·贝尔在只有两个房间的公寓里工作
Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.

805
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,870
年轻人 想说服我
Young man, don't presume...

806
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,164
别站在那儿用那些伟大的理想和伟大的发明家
...to stand there and lecture me
about great minds...

807
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,498
来给我上课
...and great inventors.

808
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,211
无论这些年我做了什么 我从来都不是傻瓜...
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

809
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,172
也从不和傻瓜搅在一起
...or been involved with anyone else who is.

810
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,633
我现在当然也不想破例
I certainly don't intend to start now.

811
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:41,177
- 查尔斯?
- 是的，克利福德先生?
Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?

812
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:42,834
- 你被解雇了
- 什么？
You're fired.

813
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,347
你被解雇了
What?
- You're fired.

814
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,186
那么，沙兰斯基 你打算怎么做
So Szalinski, what have you got in mind,
so we can get that kid of yours...

815
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:53,720
才能在睡觉前让你的孩子恢复正常？
...back to normal size by bedtime?

816
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,857
先生 设备原型在我车上...
Well, sir, the prototype's in the van...
- Hold on, folks. We've got a problem.

817
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,026
等等,先生们,我们有麻烦了

818
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:00,738
你儿子跑了 他现在有50英尺高
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

819
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,574
不可能！我儿子才14英尺高
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

820
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,785
- 我来开车
- 那也很高了
I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

821
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,914
给我接泰伦斯·惠勒
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.

822
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,540
有急事

823
00:54:13,845 --> 00:54:15,881
他逃跑了?
他挣脱了，还把卡车翻了个底朝天
He broke out?
- He busted out of the truck...

824
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:17,536
...and knocked it completely over.

825
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:18,464
那他现在在干吗?
What's he doing now?
- He's just standing there.

826
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:20,664
他就站在那儿，还在微笑
But he's smiling.

827
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:21,968
亚当 坐下
Now, Adam, sit down.
- Nick, I don't think sitting's...

828
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:24,209
尼克，我不认为坐下是个好主意
...such a good idea.

829
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,805
噢，玩具
Ooh, toys.

830
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:30,757
他干了什么?
He did what?
- Put your son and the baby-sitter...

831
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,300
把你儿子和保姆放进口袋里走了
...in his pocket and left.

832
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,020
他老是这样
He's always doing that. I find
the strangest things in his pockets.

833
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,438
我在他口袋里总能发现奇怪的东西

834
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,191
韦恩 你认为是什么导致这种生长现象?
Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?

835
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:38,890
我不知道
I don't know.

836
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,237
他们沿着铜矿公路运送他
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

837
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,656
沿路两边都是高压电线
That runs alongside high-voltage lines.
- Oh.

838
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,782
哦?

839
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,243
昨天我给他做午餐时 他坐在微波炉前
And yesterday when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

840
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,079
你还说过他在看电视突然变大
And you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.

841
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,665
- 当然!
- 我不明白你们在说什么
Of course.
I don't understand any of this.
- Electromagnetic flux.

842
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,667
电流磁场

843
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,544
所有使用中的电器周围
Around every operating
electrical device, there's a flux.

844
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,129
都有磁流

845
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,964
就像一个电磁力场
Like an electromagnetic force field.
- That's what's causing the baby to grow.

846
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,008
这正是造成婴儿猛长的原因

847
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,385
那这个电磁...
Would this electromagnetic, uh...
Would it surround neon lights too?

848
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,762
霓虹灯附近也有电磁场吗？

849
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,930
对, 怎么?
Yeah, why?
- Your kid. He's headed toward Las Vegas.

850
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:11,142
你儿子，他正朝拉斯维加斯走去

851
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,477
噢，不
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

852
00:55:13,997 --> 00:55:16,083
Uh-oh.

853
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,860
你没有被解雇，绝对没有
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

854
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,903
这正是我期待已久的机会
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for. At last.

855
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,906
斯特林终于做的太过分了

856
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:29,532
Sterling has gone too far this time.

857
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,412
今晚会开董事会
The board is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.

858
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,205
在那之前，我要你继续这事

859
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,000
无论如何 都要把局面给我控制住
Whatever it takes, just get
the situation under control.

860
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,378
好的，我有一个想法，先生
但我需要军方配合
Yeah, I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

861
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,713
好的，我来想办法
Fine. I'll get the clearance. Charles,
Just-Just-Just handle this for us.

862
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,631
查尔斯,不过...
你一定要为我们处理好这事

863
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,384
我们... 我们做的才是对的
We'll... We'll do the right thing by you.

864
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:04,904
据警方通报，有一个巨型生物
Police reports just in say that
some kind of large creature...

865
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:13,402
逃离了政府管制
正向市中心方向移动
...has just escaped from a government
caravan and is heading toward the city.

866
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,000
沙兰斯基太太 如果他朝亮光走
Mrs Szalinski, if he heads for
the lights, he has to come this way.

867
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,585
一定会走这条路

868
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,337
据我的计算
According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still for 12.2 seconds.

869
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,255
他会保持12.2秒静止不动

870
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,371
怎么?
What?

871
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,884
他长大了 需要增加照射时间
His increased mass requires
a longer period of exposure.

872
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,469
你怎么能指望一个2岁大的孩子
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old to hold...

873
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:31,336
会保持12秒一动不动?
...still for 12 point anything seconds?

874
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:32,223
她说的对 博士
She's right, Doctor,
we tried to have his picture...

875
00:56:33,771 --> 00:56:35,215
上个月我们想给他照张相，都没成功
...taken a month ago. Total bust.

876
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,519
我们正在接近现场，丹
We're just pulling up now, Dan.
There are a lot of police cars gathered.

877
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,270
这里聚集了很多警车

878
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,056
我去问问情况
马上叫医护人员!
We'll find out what's going on.
- Call the paramedics now.

879
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,819
好了，就在这拍摄
All right, here's a shot.
Okay.

880
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,572
我是康斯坦丝·温特斯 在现场向您报道
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site...

881
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,949
这肯定会成为
...of what will certainly become the
most important news story of the decade.

882
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,493
这10年以来最重大的新闻

883
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,830
丹，我看见一个巨人...
Dan, I'm seeing a giant.

884
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:04,015
哦 我的天哪
Oh, my God.

885
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,387
哦 亚当
Oh, Adam.

886
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,307
亲爱的 他看起来不错
Well, honey, he looks okay.
- Let me see.

887
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,143
让我来看看

888
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,603
你觉得这会影响他的人生吗？
Do you think this is gonna
affect him for life? I mean,

889
00:57:20,743 --> 00:57:22,596
我想这种事会毁了这孩子
something like this could ruin a kid.

890
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,775
亲爱的，我想这能帮他从不同的角度
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,

891
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,777
来审视人生
help him see the big picture.

892
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,822
宝贝，他们在那儿
Baby.
There they are.

893
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:33,367
- 大家就位
- 我和你一起，伙计
Let's move into position.
- I'm with you, pal.

894
00:57:54,482 --> 00:57:55,916
- 救命!
- 把我们从这弄下来!
Help.
- Get us down from here.

895
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:57,224
- 弄下来!
- 我们在上面!
Get us down.
We're up here.
- We're up in the pocket.

896
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,434
我们在口袋里!

897
00:57:58,443 --> 00:57:59,591
This is Constance Winters...

898
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,937
...在向你实况直播，刚查明这个巨大宝宝名字叫
...reporting live
on the progress of the giant baby...

899
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,566
亚当·沙兰斯基 来自滨海社区
...who has just been identified...
...as Adam Szalinski from Vista Del Mar.

900
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,532
州长来电话找您 先生
Let's go.
- The governor's on the phone...

901
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,536
他只是个很大的婴儿

902
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,958
我们可以用绳索枪 用绳子捆住他
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

903
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,878
绝对不行！不许向我的宝宝射任何东西
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

904
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:27,254
宝宝? 看看他
Baby? Look at him.
- Hey, we're his parents, okay?

905
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:30,664
嘿 我们是他父母！我们会处理这事
We'll handle this.

906
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,517
- 黛安?
- 什么事 韦恩?
Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?

907
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:34,706
咱们怎么办?
How do we handle this?

908
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:41,800
准备!
注意！当心!
Ready.
- Watch out. Look out. Look out.

909
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,853
妈妈
Mommy. Mom.

910
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,231
妈!

911
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,275
- 尼克，你没事吧?
- 亚当，把你哥哥放下来
Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

912
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,444
亚当，宝贝，妈妈在这
Adam, baby, Mommy's here.
- Nicky, I'm gonna get you...

913
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:52,144
尼克，我现在就把你弄下来!
...out of here right away.

914
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,739
好的，爸爸，快点！
Okay, Dad, but hurry.

915
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,025
我们可以找辆消防车过来，用云梯上去救他们
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

916
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,287
云梯还到不了他的膝盖
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

917
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:10,130
亚当，现在慢慢坐下来
Adam, now sit down really slowly.

918
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,840
有办法了! 大兔子
I got it. Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.

919
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,384
我需要个大兔子

920
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,678
- 我需要一个大笨蛋？
- 不，是兔子！
I need something called Big Dummy?
- No, Bunny.

921
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,264
- 兔子?
- 他最爱的玩具!
Bunny?
- It's his favourite toy.

922
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,015
那是孩子最喜欢的玩具
It's the kid's favourite toy.

923
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:34,738
直升机正飞来了 下面吊着像是
A helicopter is approaching
with what looks like...

924
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,908
巨大毛绒玩具一类的
...a giant stuffed animal of
some sort hanging from it.

925
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,871
- 谢谢
- 亲爱的 这很危险!
Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous.

926
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,332
- 别担心
- 飞行员在等你，韦恩
Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

927
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,001
已经预热好了
It's all primed. Be ready
to activate as soon as he's down.

928
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,003
准备好他一下来就启动

929
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:50,254
我不会有事的
I'll be fine.

930
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,970
我很肯定爸爸有办法救我们
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

Don't say it.

01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,101

你没事吧？干的好 伙计
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

975

他朝市中心走去
He's headed for the strip.
- You little devil.

976
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:17,985
小捣蛋鬼

977
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,703
他朝市中心走去
He's heading toward the city. We'll
follow and bring you a live update.

978
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,580
我们会跟着他并给您最新的直播

Adam Szalinski, this is your
Mommy talking. You stop right now.

980
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,500
立刻给我停下来

981
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,878
恐怕这没什么用 沙兰斯基太太
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs Szalinski. I'm sure he expects...

982
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,286
他肯定认为妈妈应该比他更大
...his mommy to be bigger than he is.

983
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,631
现在在他的眼里...
To him you're just...
Well, you're nothing more...

984
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,925
你只是个会说话的玩具

985
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:45,210
...than a little talking doll.

986
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,889
现在没什么能阻止他了
Nothing can stop him now.

987
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,809
我不知道他们想要干嘛
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want, but...

988
01:02:51,627 --> 01:02:52,926
但咱们必须合作
...we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

989
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,855
- 好吧 去通知大家
- 是 长官
All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

990

Dr Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

991

上尉 希望咱们能尽快结束混乱
Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.

992
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:02,561
正如你知道的 先生
Just so you're aware, sir.

993
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,990
我得到的命令是没有最终授权前我们不能随便行动
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

994
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:06,408
坦白讲，上尉
Frankly, Captain, I'm not under
the jurisdiction of the state militia.

995
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,035
我不属于军方辖制

996
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,495
你的命令和我没关系
Your orders mean nothing to me.

997
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,371
巨人宝宝正向市中心走去
A giant infant is heading toward the city.

998
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,873
这宝宝有50英尺高
The baby is over 50 feet tall and
appears to be growing even bigger...

999
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:15,407
而且还在以惊人的速度长大
...at an alarming rate.

1000
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,752
好吧，行动吧，上尉！立刻！
All right, let's move it, Captain, now.
- Lf it's okay with you,

1001
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:19,619
如果你不介意 我就坐着了
I'll just sit tight.

1002
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,757
..随事态发展将会有更多的新闻
More on this story as it develops.

1003
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,554
我的脚好像碰到什么东西
There's something down by my foot.

1004
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,223
看这个
Look at this.
- Wow.

1005
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:33,618
哇, 看看还有什么别的
Let's see what else is down here.

1006
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,229
麦片
Cereal. Hey cool, want some?

1007
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,564
嘿 真棒 来点吗？

1008
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,399
不，谢谢！我在节食
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

1009
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:42,622
来个葡萄干
Have a raisin.

1010
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:46,031
为了您的安全 请离开街道
Please clear the streets for your own safety.

1011
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,618
请待在家里，这是紧急情况
Please stay indoors.
This is an emergency.

1012
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,496
所有行人都会有危险
All pedestrians are in grave danger.

1013
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:54,623
请离开街道!
Please clear the streets.

1014
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,381
这是紧急通知，这不是演习
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.
This is not a test.

1015
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,300
一个巨大的人类宝宝正朝本市走来
A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city.

1016
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,678
这巨人正以极快的速度成长
The giant appears
to be growing at a tremendous rate...

1017
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:10,670
已经达到100英尺
...and has now reached 100 feet.

1018
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:12,839
发生什么事了？
是韦恩·牛顿来了吗?
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

1019
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,476
不，韦恩·牛顿不够格
No, they don't do this for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.

1020
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:22,307
- 一定是比他还大牌的人
- 听着，宝贝
亲爱的，在这城里没人比韦恩·牛顿更大牌了
Listen, babe, there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

1021
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,777
当然，也可能我弄错了
Of course, I could be wrong.
- Peekaboo.

1022
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,696
我在这呢!

1023
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,183
- 是他变大了还是我们缩小了？
- 真不可思议
Is he growing or are we shrinking?
It's amazing. He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

1024
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,686
几分钟时间他又长了一倍

1025
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:08,488
亚当! 放我们下来
Adam. Put us down.
You put us down now.

1026
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,657
立刻放我们下来!

1027
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,535
你好啊 伙计
Howdy, partners.

1028
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,039
欢迎来到拉斯维加斯
Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.

1029
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,791
嗨，伙计

1030
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,388
- 你还好吗?
- 是 我没事
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1031
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,603
他现在向佛瑞蒙大街走去
He's toddling down the centre
of Fremont Street.

1032
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:41,939
他知道不该单独上街
He knows not to go in the street by himself.

1033
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,982
很难说他到底能长多高
There's no telling how huge he might get.

1034
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,817
尤其是他继续走近那些灯
Especially if he touches any of those lights.

1035
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,736
我们得让他离开那儿
We've got to get him away from them.

1036
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,280
不可能 根本没法让他走开
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

1037
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,950
除非他看到他更想要的东西
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

1038
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,285
叫你的人靠边，我想韦恩有主意了
Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.

1039
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,079
拦住那辆冰淇淋车

1040
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,801
Follow that ice-cream truck.

1041
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,840
我需要一个很大的扩音器
We'll need a really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an ice-cream truck...

1042
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:11,218
谁能把冰淇淋车开的飞快?

1043
01:06:14,194 --> 01:06:16,380
我们用对讲机保持联络
We'll be with you on the walkie-talkie.

1044
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,475
我是普莱斯顿·布鲁克斯,联邦治安官
我们现在要征用这辆车
Preston Brooks, US Marshals. We're
commandeering this vehicle. Come on.

1045
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,435
- 上车！
- 稍等!

1046
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:24,907
Hey, wait a minute.

1047
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,567
- 这是什么?
- 一个镇静剂发射器
What's that?
- It's a tranquillizer cannon.

1048
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,236
用来对付大型的哺乳动物
It's used on large mammals.

1049
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,905
镇静剂能在几秒内将目标控制
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

1050
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,365
就像打针一样
It's like a normal injection, but
on a slightly larger scale, of course.

1051
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,367
当然，只是比例大了很多

1052
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:38,120
老实说，先生，我自己也有小孩
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem...

1053
01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:39,736
这些看来这好像不太合乎逻辑
...like the type of...

1054
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,831
当然了，上尉
Well, naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.

1055
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,542
这是，这只是最后的手段

1056
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:46,712
我是布雷德利·斯旺勒

1057
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,213
正在著名的灯光峡谷做现场直播
Reporting live from the famous Glitter
Gulch where certainly the biggest story...

1058
01:06:50,247 --> 01:06:51,081
马上将会发生本年度最大的新闻
...of the year is unfolding.

1059
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,010
赌场老板有些失望
Casino owners are understandably upset.
They've been ordered...

1060
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,469
他们被迫撤离该地区...
...to evacuate the area.

1061
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,388
目前有两个关键人物可以回答我们的许多问题
The answers to many of our questions lie
with two key players in this drama...

1062
01:06:57,525 --> 01:06:58,595
斯特林实验室的克利福德·斯特林博士
Dr Clifford Sterling
of Sterling Laboratories...

1063
01:06:58,699 --> 01:06:59,506
据我们所知，这个孩子叫
What we do know is that a baby...

1064
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:00,767
亚当·沙兰斯基
...by the name of Adam Szalinski
has somehow measured over 100 feet tall.

1065
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,228
他身高已经超过了100英尺

1066
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,773
别鼓掌了
Stop the clapping.

1067
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,236
我有办法了
I got a plan.
- Great.'Cause I'm...

1068
01:07:12,706 --> 01:07:14,187
太好了 因为我已经开始晕机了
...starting to get airsick.

1069
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,824
我们把线从口袋底拉出来
We'll pull the thread out
of the bottom of the pocket and...

1070
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:18,650
然后把它作为绳索 滑下去
...use it as a rope to slide down.

1071
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,580
现场一片混乱
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

1072
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,207
不过目前为止，所有赌场都还在那
But so far all the casinos are still standing.

1073
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:37,679
小心!
Watch out.

1074
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:51,735
嗨！
Hi.
- Hey. Hey, don't. What are you doin'?

1075
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,945
嘿，别这样！ 你在干吗？

1076
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,323
停车 停车
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1077
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,745
我们快跳吧
We'll have to jump.

1078
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:04,664
抓紧绳子
Hold on.

1079
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,152
别往下看
看着点换挡器 跳！
Don't look down. Watch out
for the gearshift. Jump.

1080
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,718
- 快开!
- 我在开!
Go.
- I'm trying.

1081
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:19,961
我在开!我在开!
Truly, I'm trying.
- Stayin'alive...

1082
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,599
- 快点 想想办法！
- 我只会开自动档的
Hurry. Hurry, do something.
- Stayin'alive

1083
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,268
咱们得快离开这
I'm used to an automatic.
Stayin'alive
- We've gotta get out of here.

1084
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,690
玩具车
Toy car.

1085
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,275
系好安全带!
Buckle up.

1086
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:47,290
从路上离开!
Adam, get him away from me.
- Adam.

1087
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,334
亚当 别吃掉我们！
Adam. Adam. Don't eat us.

1088
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,878
哇
Whoa.

1089
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,510
我们正在灯光峡谷直播
We're here live in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski...

1090
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,345
就站在亚当·沙兰斯基的下面

1091
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:03,473
他把一辆黄色小跑车举到空中
...who has lifted a small yellow
sports car into the air...

1092
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,684
车上有三个不明身份的人
...with three unidentified persons in it.

1093
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,352
从我这看
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,

1094
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:09,469
其中两个像是年轻人 一男一女
a boy and a girl...

1095
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,439
和一个穿着印第安服装的男子
...and a man dressed in an Indian costume.

1096
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:16,424
他在干什么?
What's he doing?
- He's taking something out...

1097
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:19,276
他在从口袋里掏东西，一颗薄荷糖
...of his pocket. A peppermint.

1098
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:19,656
伙计!

1099
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,741
哇哦! 哇哦!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1100
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:35,755
嘿, 伙计
Howdy, partners.

1101
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,676
哦，天哪！

1102
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,472
那车在他手上就像玩具
That car is like a toy to him.

1103
01:09:45,568 --> 01:09:48,735
希望这车有安全气囊
I hope this thing has air bags.

1104
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,774
想想办法 尼克! 让他停下来
Do something, Nick. Tell him to stop.
- I can't. He's too big.

1105
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,276
我没办法 他太大了

1106
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:58,528
快让他离开灯
We gotta get him away from those lights
before he touches any of them.

1107
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,738
否则会把他们弄碎的

1108
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,948
布鲁克斯 冰淇淋车怎么样了?
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

1109
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,409
- 快好了
- 收到
We're almost set.

1110
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,412
不!
No.

1111
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:08,872
小心树!

1112
01:10:19,018 --> 01:10:22,102
- 哦 不！我要吐了!
- 别!
Oh, no.

1113
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,095
只是个大孩子在玩玩具
Just a big baby with his toy.

1114
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:33,104
过来啦!
Coming through.

1115
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,731
都让开!
Get out of the way.

1116
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,901
- 听话 亚当 放下
- 把他放下 宝贝
Come on, Adam, put it down.
Put it down.

1117
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:41,861
Come on, sweetheart. Put it down.

1118
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:41,238
哇!

1119
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,407
他要干什么?
What's he doing now?

1120
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,786
把我们放下!把我们放下!
Put us down.
Put us down.

1121
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,081
他放下了
He put it down.

1122
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,291
把我们拿起来!把我们拿起来!

Pick us up.

1123
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,466
哦 天哪 我们要死了
Oh, my God. We're gonna die. We're gonna
die. We're gonna die in a convertible.

1124
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,930
- 车还没好吗?
- 布鲁克斯? 发生什么了?
What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

1125
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:08,181
好了
Okay. We're set.

1126
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,225

1127
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,437

- 停下 停下!
No. Wait.

1128

先让他把孩子弄下来
We need him to get the kids down.

1129
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:20,830
把音乐关掉!
Cut it off.

1130
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,365
- 我受不了了
- 哦 天哪
I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God.

1131
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,575
噢!

1132
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,288
不管怎样 别往下看

- 还有别的主意吗?
- 会有的 快点 咱们走
You got another idea?
- I will. Come on. Let's go.

1178
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,709
- 斯特林博士
- 韦恩!
Dr Sterling?
- Wayne.

1179
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:07,879
你还记得
Do you remember how we got Adam to
hold still to have his picture taken?

1180
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:09,255
我们怎么给他照的相吗？

1181
01:15:10,244 --> 01:15:11,748
- 我把他放在两腿中间紧紧抓住他
- 是吗?
I put him in my lap and I held him.

1182
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,302
亲爱的 他需要我
Yeah?
- Honey, he needs me.

1183
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:19,140
问题是对亚当来说，他的妈妈应该比他的个子更大
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

1184
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,428
不 黛安 你疯了吗？
韦恩!
No, Diane. It's a crazy idea...
- Wayne.

1185
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,899
20年来 我看你不断的冒出各种疯狂的念头
For almost 20 years I've watched
you have one crazy idea after another.

1186
01:15:28,066 --> 01:15:30,026
现在轮到我有一个了
It's my turn to have just one.

1187
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:40,537
噢!

1188
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,874
火
Fire.

1189
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:53,299
- 我的吉他
- 哦!
My guitar.
- Uh-oh.

1190
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:56,261
- 又怎么了?
- 亚当，别碰那个吉他!
What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar.

1191
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,935
我开始预热激光了，600伏
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

1192
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:09,148
黛安 应该让我去 不是你
Diane, I should be doing this, not you.

1193
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,442
有个道理是每个小孩子都懂的
There's one thing every little kid knows.

1194
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,819
爸爸说的是好玩
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.

1195
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:14,404
妈妈说的就是当真

1196
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:16,948
可是，这个设备从没用来放大过人
But-But-But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

1197
01:16:17,115 --> 01:16:19,409
激光量过小，你会和亚当一样长的太慢
Too little power and you'll
grow too slowly like Adam.

1198
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,078
- 激光量过大 你会
- 我相信你，韦恩·沙兰斯基
And too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

1199
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,627
韦恩 是时候变大了
Wayne, time to get large.

1200
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,507
这是你要的苏打水， 先生
Here's your soda, sir.

1201
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,259
你要可乐瓶干什么?
What do you need a Coke bottle for?
- I don't.

1202
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,097
不是，我只要瓶底
Just the bottom.
- Oh.

1203
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:40,138
哦

1204
01:16:48,605 --> 01:16:51,232
汤姆,我刚就在硬石咖啡厅外面
Tom, I'm here just outside the Hard Rock
Cafe. The giant baby is approaching.

1205
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,026
那巨大宝宝正在接近

1206
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,236
喂? 我听不清
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?

1207
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,913
灯关了?
一个巨大的什么? 宝宝?
A giant what? Baby?

1208
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,540
吉他!
Guitar.

1209
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:13,512
Oh, my God.
- Let's get out of here.

1210
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:30,104
为了您的安全 请留在室内
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

1211
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,397
离开大街！

1212
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:34,067
亚当! 别碰那吉他!
Adam. Don't touch the guitar.

1213
01:17:36,205 --> 01:17:39,040
I'll save ya.

1214
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,491
不要, 亚当!
亚当，放下那吉他!
No, Adam.
Adam, put down the guitar.

1215
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:52,126
这玩意不能再快点了吗？
孩子可能还在长!
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again.

1216
01:17:52,377 --> 01:17:55,380
这已经是最快的速度了 博士
This is as fast as we can go safely, Doctor.

1217
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,511
康斯坦丝·温特斯从街对面的硬石咖啡厅里
Constance Winters live across
the street from the Hard Rock Cafe.

1218
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,429
为您做直播

1219
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,183
他以为那吉他是个真的乐器
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

1220
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,602
他想用它弹个曲子
He's trying to play a tune.

1221
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,742
再靠近点 开稳点
Bring me into range and hold it steady.
- Doctor, wait a minute.

1222
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,202
博士 等一下

1223
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:29,372
如果我们击中他 他倒下会压向人群的
Now, if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

1224
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,374
那我们只有求上天保佑了
Well, we'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

1225
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,890
亚当，把吉他放下，去抓飞机
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the aeroplane.

1226
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,394
飞机 你好
Aeroplane. Hi.

1227
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,645
稳住
Hold it. Steady.

1228
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,772
别晃

1229
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,235
他们向亚当开枪了!
They're shooting at Adam.
- I assume that little manoeuvre...

1230
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:01,895
上尉，刚刚那次就当是你的失误
...was an error, Captain.

1231
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,949
现在稳住了 否则我肯定这是你最后一次飞行任务
Now steady, or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

1232
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,035
去找个和你一样大的人较量吧
Hey. Pick on somebody your own size.

1233
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,335
哇!
Ow.

1234
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,327
好吧 再来一次
All right, let's go again.

1235
01:19:53,342 --> 01:19:54,990
丹...
Dan, the...

1236
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,459
稳住
Hold it stead...

1237
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,047
退后
Back off.

1238
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,757
是，女士
Yes, ma'am.

1239
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,306
告诉他们 那是我妈妈!
You tell 'em.
That's my mom.

1240
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,141
我需要个休假
I need a vacation.
- Whoa. Look at that mother.

1241
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:14,977
哇 看那是他妈妈

1242
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,164
过来 宝贝
Come here, baby.
- Mama.

1243
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,582
妈妈!

1244
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,877
到妈妈这来
Come to Mommy.

1245
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:49,011
过来，宝贝，到妈妈这来
Come here, baby.
Come to Mommy.

1246
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,930
妈妈!
Mom. Easy, Mom.

1247
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:53,558
妈妈 慢点

1248
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,227
一切都过去了，宝贝
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

1249
01:20:58,312 --> 01:20:59,814
妈妈在这
Mommy's here.
- Everything it's got, Doctor.

1250
01:21:01,994 --> 01:21:04,080
- 所有准备就绪 博士
- 收到
Roger.

1251
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,322
你在哭吗?
You crying?
- Yeah. It's okay to cry...

1252
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,080
是的 当你特别高兴的时候也是可以哭的
...when you're so happy.

1253
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:16,664
发电机的轴承快烧坏了
The bearings in the generator are
about to burn out. We better do it.

1254
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,874
我们最好来吧

1255
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:25,339
好的，现在看着爸爸
Okay, now, look at Daddy.
Smile for Daddy.

1256
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,967
对爸爸笑一个

1257
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:31,554
- 他在那儿
- 爸爸
There he is.
- Daddy.

1258
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,473
韦恩 1450已经是最大极限了
Wayne, 1450.
It's all she can take.

1259
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,647
- 笑一个，亚当
- 笑个，亚当
Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

1260
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,528
快点，韦恩
Come on, Wayne.

1261
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,668
- 快看 亚当 爸爸在那
- 爸爸
Look, Adam, there's Daddy.
- Daddy.

1262
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:04,837
亲爱的 你成功了
Honey, you did it.

1263
01:22:06,475 --> 01:22:08,331
亚当
Adam.

1264
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:09,550
亚当
Adam.

1265
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,969
你着实把我们吓了一跳 小家伙
You gave us quite a scare, little man.
- I knew you could do it, honey.

1266
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,471
我就知道你能做到 亲爱的

1267
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:15,640
他在那儿! 让我过去
There he is.
Let me through.

1268
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:20,561
好吧, 沙兰斯基，你成功了，谁能想到呢？
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

1269
01:22:21,365 --> 01:22:24,497
亨得利克森博士
Dr Hendrickson,
that looked like some sort of rifle...

1270
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:26,850
刚刚没看错的话，你好像用枪打我的孩子
...that you were shooting at my baby.

1271
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,194
那是镇静剂
They were tranquillizer cartridges. They
wouldn't have hurt him, I assure you.

1272
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,363
他们不会伤害他的，我保证

1273
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:31,697
哦
Oh. Tranquillizer cartridges.

1274
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,200
镇静剂

1275
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,040
永远别惹妈妈
Never cross Mommy.
- We got an emergency here.

1276
01:22:42,678 --> 01:22:45,975
我们需要辆救护车，亨得利克森博士需要帮助
Dr Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect...

1277
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,704
让他另谋高就，把他吓晕过去了
...of having to find a new career.

1278
01:22:47,672 --> 01:22:50,341
嘿 大家伙 这是你刚在找的吗？
Hey, big fella, is this
what you were lookin' for?

1279
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:51,592
噢

1280
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,263
韦恩! 尼克和曼蒂呢!
Wayne. Nick and Mandy.

1281
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,183
他们在...
Weren't they in Adam's pocket?
- In Adam's pocket.

1282
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,726
在亚当的口袋里!

1283
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,857
- 别告诉我...
- 哦 天哪
Don't tell me.
- Oh, my God.

1284
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,442
亲爱的，我把孩子缩小了
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move.

1285
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:10,194
所有人都别动

1286
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:11,862
别担心
Don't worry. I have highly specialized
equipment to deal with this.

1287
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:14,240
我有特殊的设备能找到他们

1288
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,410
我需要头盔和我的狗
I'll need the helmet and I'll need the dog.

1289
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,372
早上好，拉斯维加斯，所有车辆不准
Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked...

1290
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,542
接近硬石咖啡厅，发明家韦恩·沙兰斯基
...to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski...

1291
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:27,545
正在独自寻找他失踪的孩子
...is conducting a one-man search
to find some missing children.

1292
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:30,297
沙兰斯基的物体放大仪器
It was Szalinski's matter-expanding
machine that was responsible...

1293
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,049
昨晚引起了惊人的事件
...for last night's amazing events.

1294
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,176
克利福德·斯特林博士刚刚宣布
Dr Clifford Sterling has just announced...

1295
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,098
我猜你爸爸今天是世界上最出名的人
I guess your father's about
the most famous guy in the world today.

1296
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,269
而你是最勇敢的人
And I guess you're about the bravest.

1297
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,391
谢谢你救了我的命
That's for saving my life.

1298
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,317
这算不了什么
It wasn't much.

1299
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:54,447
我不是说你的生命不算什么
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

1300
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,534
我是说，我所做的算不上什么
What I did wasn't so much.

1301
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:03,038
Ours if we want it

1302
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:07,001
Tonight has our initials on it

1303
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:09,128
他们要多久才能找到我们呢？
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

1304
01:24:09,295 --> 01:24:12,423
我想还得过一会吧
I think it may be a while before they find us.

1305
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,388
你和别人不同，尼克
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.

1306
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:21,307
就像你爸爸

1307
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,769
我们没什么不同的
We're not all that different.

1308
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,395
你是的
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...

1309
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,814
不过话又说回来了...

1310
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,901
我猜这个世界上需要不同的人
I guess the world needs people
who are different.

1311
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:35,988
人们看问题的方法不同
可以这样说
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

1312
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:40,202
We'll appear sometime

1313
01:24:40,296 --> 01:24:43,546
Maybe tonight is yours and mine...

1314
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,794
他们都好吗?

1315
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:52,421
都没事，我想再给他们几分钟
Are they okay?
- Yep. I think we better give 'em...
...a couple of minutes though.

1316
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,340
那个东西你打算怎么处理?
What are we gonna do about that?
- Adam, look.

1317
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,092
亚当 你看

1318
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,682
大，大兔子
Big, Big, Big Bunny.

1319
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:08,979
我们该拿这东西怎么办？
What are we gonna do with this?

1320
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,732
别担心，我会有办法的，我不是一直都有吗？
Don't worry. I'll think of something.
Don't I always?

1321
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:16,570
- 你不相信我吗?
- 我不知道，我不知道
Don't you trust me?
- I don't know. I don't know.
