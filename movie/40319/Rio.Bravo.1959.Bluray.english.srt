1
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,909
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,787
Maybe so, but don't turn around, sheriff.

3
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,373
Now what're you gonna do, sheriff?

4
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,301
You can do just about what you want,
Chance.

5
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,514
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,351
No.

7
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,729
Give me a hand.

8
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,822
- What is all this?
- Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,076
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,787
Who the devil do you think
you're ordering around here?

11
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:14,290
First Burdette's men stop me and
now you stand there and try to...

12
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,920
- Say, seems like I ought to know you.
- I think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,381
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,842
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,137
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachín?

16
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,224
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachón.

17
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,768
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,814
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,566
You know what "borrachón" means?

20
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,609
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,278
It means drunk.

22
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,823
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me Dude.

23
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,158
Now are you gonna tell your men or do I?

24
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,036
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,794
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,588
Pass the word.

27
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,538
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,875
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,210
Next thing,
you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,920
- Pat, I will tell you.
- What?

31
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,548
- Stop your wagons.
- Oh, I give up.

32
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,389
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,434
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,895
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:02,607
Oh, listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,567
- Now, will you please...?
- Hey, Chance!

37
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,446
What do you wanna do about this outfit?
Do you wanna take their guns?

38
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,156
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,533
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,244
- Where'd you take him on?
- Fort Worth.

41
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,747
- What does he do?
- I speak English, sheriff...

42
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,083
...if you wanna ask me.

43
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,922
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,757
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,095
- Pretty young for that, aren't you?
- Just how old do you have to be, sheriff?

46
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,682
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

47
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,685
- Rocky Ryan?
- Well, that's his boy.

48
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,270
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

49
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,607
Well, he better be,
packing a pair of guns.

50
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:49,278
Now, sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

51
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,406
I could let you have them both.

52
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,616
They wouldn't do me too much good.

53
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,619
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

54
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:00,581
- Stumpy, didn't I tell...?
- I know. I'm going. I'm going.

55
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,087
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

56
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,132
Thanks, sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

57
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:10,967
Well, then don't start any.

58
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,553
I won't, unless I tell you first.

59
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,346
That's good enough.

60
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,099
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

61
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,851
I ought to do just that.

62
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,603
- What?
- I'm just guessing, you understand.

63
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,732
It seems to me that you've already
got some trouble here.

64
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,150
You're guessing right.

65
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,154
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

66
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,656
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

67
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,074
No, I wouldn't.

68
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,493
They could put them over there
by the creek.

69
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,495
Near the Burdette warehouse.

70
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,707
If it's gonna blow
that's just as good a place as any.

71
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,127
Show them the way, Dude.
You can go along, Colorado.

72
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,421
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

73
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,300
Go ahead.

74
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,213
Well?

75
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:11,068
Let's get out of the
middle of the street.

76
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,700
Well, now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

77
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,871
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

78
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,624
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

79
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,420
- Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
- That's right.

80
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,881
What are you holding him for?

81
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,259
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

82
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,887
- Murder?
- No other word for it.

83
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,890
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

84
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,142
What does Nathan say about this?

85
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,479
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

86
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,897
You saw part of it.

87
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:53,277
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

88
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,198
Those men over there watching us...

89
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,908
...they're his.

90
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,036
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

91
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,871
Who you got helping you?

92
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,833
You met half of them.

93
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,628
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

94
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,548
Stumpy. You know him.

95
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,342
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

96
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,013
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

97
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,807
That's what I got.

98
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:28,771
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

99
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,400
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

100
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,862
Guess I better see they did it.
I'll see you later.

101
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,294
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

102
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,962
You don't look so good.

103
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,714
I feel worse.

104
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,883
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

105
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,467
I thought you would.

106
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,304
Got some in here. Cold.

107
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,389
Just as long as it's beer.

108
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,315
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

109
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,611
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

110
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,032
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

111
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,283
You'd be in trouble?

112
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,535
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

113
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Don't you never think of me?

114
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,457
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

115
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,501
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

116
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,879
I told you why I want you back in there...

117
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,591
...and you're gonna stay there with
that cage locked when I'm not around.

118
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,259
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

119
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,011
Those windows, did you fix them?

120
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,388
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

121
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,015
Nothing could get in here now.

122
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,684
- Not even some fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

123
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,020
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

124
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,566
Five, six days breathing the same air as
Burdette is apt to make a killer out of me.

125
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,027
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

126
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,447
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

127
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,866
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

128
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,036
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

129
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,664
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

130
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,457
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

131
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,585
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

132
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,713
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

133
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,384
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

134
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,719
What do you want?

135
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,722
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

136
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,725
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

137
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,937
How you holding up, borrachón?

138
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,730
Got the shakes yet?

139
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,777
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

140
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,905
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

141
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,244
- Chance, you gonna let him do that to me?
- I'll do better than that.

142
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,622
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

143
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,921
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

144
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,842
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

145
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,262
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him sleep in it.

146
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,433
Want another beer?
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

147
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,102
No, it wasn't wasted,
except I missed him.

148
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,564
- I don't need any more.
- Hey, in the jail.

149
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,154
That's far enough. What do you want?

150
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:26,449
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the sheriff.

151
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,451
Hey, Chance, you expecting a package?

152
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,077
Be right out.

153
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,621
- Stumpy?
- Yeah?

154
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,124
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

155
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,544
If you don't come back,
me and Joe'll have us a good cry.

156
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,629
Just keep that door locked.

157
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,550
- Thanks for your trouble.
- No trouble at all.

158
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,053
Wheeler said, "Just be careful coming up."

159
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,347
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

160
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,308
Yeah.

161
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,311
There's another one over by the church.

162
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,980
Any use in arresting them?

163
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,524
For just standing around?

164
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,818
All I'd do is get another one.

165
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,321
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

166
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,492
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

167
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,160
Remember that.

168
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,793
Señor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for...

169
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,044
What you have here?

170
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,129
The package you've been waiting for.

171
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,464
Just in time, señor.

172
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,635
- Carlos! Carlos! Where are you at?
- I'm over here.

173
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,595
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

174
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,516
If you break the dishes, you'll see what
happens. Every day is the same thing...

175
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,601
Carlos. Oh, Señor Chance.

176
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,686
I just ask Carlos if he's...

177
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,272
Carlos, what is wrong?

178
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,484
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

179
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,111
What have you been doing?

180
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,695
What have I been doing?

181
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,366
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

182
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,909
We have important business.

183
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,245
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

184
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,373
Consuelo, look at me. Am I fat?

185
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,501
- I did not say you are fat.
- Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

186
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,294
You already say too much.

187
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,755
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

188
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,048
Come, señor.

189
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,640
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

190
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,392
I'm going to see.

191
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,853
You take chances, my friend.

192
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,312
Because I know woman.

193
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,648
She will be mad or she will be sorry.

194
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,359
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

195
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,987
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

196
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,030
You do not have women.

197
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,615
So you do not know, señor.

198
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,660
But me, Carlos Robante, I know.

199
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,497
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

200
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,710
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

201
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,756
If I had bought this myself, señor,
everyone in town would have known.

202
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,969
And it's not the sort
of thing that Consuelo

203
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,345
would like to have
known by everyone.

204
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,810
You see?

205
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,563
And they're not beautiful, señor?

206
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,691
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

207
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,693
You sure you want me to do that?

208
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:08,986
No. No, señor.

209
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,822
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

210
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,658
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

211
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,872
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

212
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,627
What are you doing here?

213
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,590
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

214
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,218
- Didn't you come in on the stage?
- That's right.

215
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,886
Why aren't you on it?

216
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,805
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

217
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,142
Chihuahua! I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

218
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,312
- The stage, she did not go.
- Why?

219
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,814
- Something happened with the wheel.
- Where's Jake?

220
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:46,982
Near the corral.

221
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,693
He must fix the wheel
before he can leave.

222
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,236
That's just fine.

223
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,407
Hey, sheriff, you forgot your pants.

224
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,670
You reckon they'd try anything tonight?

225
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,340
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

226
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,175
That ain't no kind of answer.

227
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,803
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

228
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,558
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Well, what I wanna know is when.

229
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,227
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

230
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,157
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

231
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,075
I'm full of beer.

232
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,037
It doesn't do any good.

233
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,914
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

234
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,088
Stumpy.

235
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,091
We're gonna take a turn
around the town.

236
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,887
- You be all right?
- Of course I'll be all right.

237
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,764
Then get in there where you belong.

238
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,558
I'm going. I'm going.
But you remember one thing:

239
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,936
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

240
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,606
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

241
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,274
We'll holler.

242
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,451
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

243
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,786
Usually do.

244
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,706
Don't wanna do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

245
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,458
Well, aren't we?

246
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,587
I just can't take it sitting in there.

247
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,090
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

248
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,259
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

249
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,012
You'd think you invented the hangover.

250
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,973
I could sure take out a patent
for this one.

251
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,978
Take that side.

252
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,435
- Good evening.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,803
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

254
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,847
Don't shoot, sheriff.

255
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,724
Just getting a little air.

256
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,468
I'm getting jumpy.

257
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,137
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

258
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,266
- Get back over there where you belong.
- Yes, Papa.

259
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,157
- Carlos.
- Señor Chance. I been looking for you.

260
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,410
- It is very bad, señor.
- What's wrong?

261
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,662
- Your friend Señor Wheeler.
- What about him?

262
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,541
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

263
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,252
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

264
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,672
He say, "Why they don't help you?"
That you should have some more help.

265
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,340
He's right, Señor Chance.

266
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,176
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

267
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,137
- You tell him.
- ls he in there?

268
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,763
Sí, I think.

269
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,350
Chance, he's over there.

270
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,855
- The queens full.
- That's good. Beats me.

271
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,990
Spare a minute, Pat?

272
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,491
Good evening, sheriff.

273
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,827
- Deal me out.
- Evening.

274
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,299
- You two know each other.
- Yeah.

275
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,051
No, thanks, Carlos.

276
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:33,513
- Chance, I've been wanting to talk to you.
- You've been talking too much, Pat.

277
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,183
- What do you mean "talking too much"?
- Anybody that...

278
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,561
...sides in with me
right now's liable to

279
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,771
find themselves up to
their ears in trouble.

280
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,899
Is that why you haven't asked
for any deputies?

281
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:47,569
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

282
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:52,741
I was talking about why you haven't asked
for any new deputies. You could get some.

283
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,910
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

284
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,912
Suppose I got them, what'd I have?

285
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,289
Some well-meaning amateurs.

286
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,167
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

287
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,921
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

288
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,716
Only thing they're worried about
is earning their pay.

289
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,263
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

290
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,224
A lot of people'd get hurt.

291
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,393
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

292
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,770
He isn't worth one of those
that'd get killed.

293
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,939
Then what are you gonna do?

294
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,025
All you got for help's that old man
down at the jail and this...

295
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,611
Borrachón's the name, Mr. Wheeler.

296
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,823
I'll go outside
so you can talk more freely.

297
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,954
Wasn't good, Pat.

298
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,541
- Let's sit down.
- Yeah, I know.

299
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,628
I shouldn't have said it.
I meant nothing by it.

300
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,589
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

301
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,592
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

302
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,720
...without something
to help hold him up.

303
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,596
How long you been coming here?

304
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,140
Going on two years.

305
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,060
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

306
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,687
Dude was good.

307
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,147
He was my deputy.

308
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,482
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

309
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,860
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

310
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,945
- What...?
- A girl.

311
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,322
Just a girl that came through on the stage.

312
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,409
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

313
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,828
I tried and he damn near killed me.

314
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,249
Anyway, he was hooked.
Went away with her.

315
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,877
Six months later
he came back without her.

316
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,380
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachón.

317
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,424
- That's Spanish for...
- Yeah, I know.

318
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,176
He told me.

319
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,013
So for two years he's been drinking...

320
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,769
...all he could buy, or somebody'd
buy for him till last night.

321
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,521
And how long do you think that'll last?

322
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,856
I don't know.

323
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,651
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him, huh?

324
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,197
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

325
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,825
I'm supposed to be your friend too.

326
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,620
Why don't you let me help you?
Deal me in.

327
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,372
- You're not good enough.
- I don't know! I'm as good...

328
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,709
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

329
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,796
- No, thanks, Pat, you keep out of it.
- Hey, that's an idea.

330
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,673
- What?
- Ryan. Colorado you call him.

331
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,510
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

332
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,388
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

333
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,724
We'll see what he says.

334
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,580
- Good evening, sheriff.
- Any luck, kid?

335
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,500
- It's a pretty fast game.
- Son, I...

336
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,003
...asked you over here
because the sheriff's a friend of mine.

337
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,923
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

338
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,927
- To go against the Burdettes, sheriff?
- That's right.

339
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,054
I told him you were one of the best.

340
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,474
Well...

341
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,436
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

342
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,605
That's minding my own business.

343
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,274
No offense, sheriff.

344
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,818
No offense.

345
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,826
Well, I never expected that.

346
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,786
He showed good sense.

347
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,539
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you...

348
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,791
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

349
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,418
I appreciate it.

350
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,004
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

351
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,924
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

352
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,805
Enough for me for a while.

353
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,181
You leaving?

354
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,268
- Maybe I'll have some luck now.
- Maybe.

355
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,312
If you play your cards right.

356
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,439
Hope you leave
some of your luck with me.

357
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,317
I'll come back
and give it to you next time.

358
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,943
We'll ante up.

359
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,239
- Dude?
- Yeah?

360
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,326
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

361
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,348
Oh, hi, sheriff.

362
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,643
I'm sorry about those pants.

363
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,811
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

364
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,731
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

365
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,359
Sure.

366
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,366
Well, sheriff, what is it?

367
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,036
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

368
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,039
It's three cards short.

369
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,125
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

370
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,045
Why...?
Well, why do you tell me?

371
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,841
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

372
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,386
- And did you talk to him?
- He's still there.

373
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,845
You were leaving.

374
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,974
And I was a winner.

375
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,393
Is that all you've got to go on?

376
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,605
No. Here's a handbill...

377
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,318
...about a gambler
they're interested in catching up with.

378
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,195
You know him?

379
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,531
It says he had a girl with him.

380
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,494
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

381
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,708
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

382
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,921
Now, the man isn't our...

383
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,258
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

384
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,803
Yes, I could be.

385
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,597
As a matter of fact, I am.

386
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,437
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

387
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,919
You'd better give me
the money you won.

388
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,233
I'll see that it gets
back to the right people.

389
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,153
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

390
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,116
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

391
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,828
But I'm not gonna make it that easy.

392
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:15,790
You've made me mad, sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

393
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,126
So you're gonna have to prove
I've got them.

394
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,795
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

395
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,630
- Search you?
- That's right.

396
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,759
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

397
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,429
Let's see,
the cards could be in my purse...

398
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,222
...but they're not.

399
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,684
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

400
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,458
All right, all right.

401
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,063
I don't wear anything
like those red pants.

402
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,274
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

403
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,277
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

404
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,280
- That's about enough.
- You have to prove I've got those cards.

405
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,408
- You keep going and I'm apt to do it!
- I'm not so sure.

406
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,787
I think you're embarrassed.

407
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,081
- And if you're not...
- If he's not...

408
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,332
...he ought to be.

409
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,000
What're you doing here?

410
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,002
I don't think she has the cards.

411
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,588
If that's what you're looking for.

412
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,673
How do you know?

413
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,176
I think the fellow in the checkered vest
has them.

414
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,844
Well, why didn't you find out?

415
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,847
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

416
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,391
Now I'm telling you.
I'm gonna see if he's got them.

417
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,018
Wait a minute.

418
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,313
- You wanna come along?
- I do.

419
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm interested too.

420
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,419
Ace high straight.

421
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,048
Looks like I got the lady's luck.
How come...?

422
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,342
All right, keep your hands on the table.

423
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,010
Right where they are.

424
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,639
Put your hands back.

425
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,182
Where they were.

426
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,239
Hold out.

427
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,867
He's all yours, sheriff.

428
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,243
Get up.

429
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,537
Get up!

430
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,041
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

431
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,669
Carlos, lock him in his room.

432
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,255
Let him out in time for the stage.

433
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,675
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

434
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,427
Thanks, Colorado.

435
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:36,264
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

436
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,569
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

437
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,988
Is that all, sheriff?

438
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,116
Well, I'm not gonna apologize,
if that's what you mean.

439
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,328
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

440
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,537
That's right.

441
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,874
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

442
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:06,294
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

443
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:07,962
Made a joke of it.

444
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,757
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

445
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:14,135
Tell me, sheriff,
what should I have done?

446
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,179
- Well...
- I'd like to know.

447
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,599
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

448
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,601
I'd like to know what to do about it.

449
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:26,397
Well, you could quit playing cards...

450
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,982
...wearing feathers.

451
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,484
No, sheriff.

452
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,862
No, I'm not gonna do that.

453
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,951
You see, that's what I'd do...

454
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,330
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

455
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,935
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

456
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,979
Not since he went up the street.

457
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,022
I think that's him coming now.

458
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,746
Get him out of here!

459
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,963
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

460
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,259
Got him in the back.

461
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,052
He's dead.

462
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:44,517
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

463
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,062
Don't get many friends like that.

464
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,232
You were smart, Colorado.

465
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,485
- No one's come out of the stable.
- I wanna go with you.

466
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,238
Wanna help get the man
that killed your boss?

467
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,241
- Wouldn't you?
- I wouldn't have let him get shot.

468
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,994
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

469
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,121
Stay out, we don't need you.

470
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,041
You wanna do something,
get him out of the street.

471
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,757
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

472
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,425
How you going in?

473
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,803
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

474
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,765
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

475
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,434
- No, there isn't.
- I thought so.

476
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,728
I'll let you know when I get there.

477
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,169
Chance, you all right?

478
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,604
Chance, out here.

479
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,857
You all right?

480
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,025
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

481
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,027
He came out the door, running fast.

482
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,363
- You missed him.
- I couldn't get a good shot.

483
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:05,908
- Might've winged him.
- Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

484
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,452
He hasn't got away yet...

485
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,329
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

486
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,707
- He's still in there.
- How do you know?

487
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,544
Can see both doors from here.
And there ain't any others.

488
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,046
I'm an expert on saloons.

489
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,258
- Get a chance to see who he was?
- No, but we'll know.

490
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,387
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

491
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,432
You figure we're going in there after him?

492
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,309
- Aren't we?
- We used to.

493
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,729
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

494
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,064
Maybe more.

495
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,068
You take the back door,
I'll go in the front.

496
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,988
- I'd like to try...
- You'd like to try what?

497
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,575
I been going in the back door.

498
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,244
They haven't been letting me in the front.

499
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,916
- Think you're good enough?
- I'd like to find out.

500
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,584
So would I.

501
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,587
I'll let you know when I get around back.

502
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,235
Begin with you, Charlie.

503
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,154
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

504
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,991
Pick it up by the barrel.

505
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,659
Easy.

506
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:15,496
Thought you were gonna ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

507
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,998
Shotgun first.

508
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,000
Set it down.

509
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,669
Back up.

510
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:31,012
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

511
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:41,147
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

512
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,192
You're gonna stand up
and stand real still.

513
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,194
Now!

514
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:56,704
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

515
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,706
...drop them and step back.

516
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,501
Come on.

517
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,719
There's no reason
for you to move, Charlie.

518
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:20,061
- What's this all about?
- We're looking for a man that ran in here.

519
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,854
Nobody's run in here.

520
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,190
We'll remember you said that.

521
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,861
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

522
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,864
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

523
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,590
Who saw a man run in here?

524
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,176
I did.

525
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,805
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

526
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,308
Clean as a whistle.

527
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,019
Dude, you been seeing things again.

528
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,854
You better have a drink.

529
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:10,736
Dude. Maybe this'll help.

530
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,572
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

531
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,991
I thought you would.

532
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,667
You want that gun, pick it up.

533
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,004
I wish you would.

534
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,802
He stepped in a puddle, all right.

535
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,430
He's the fellow we wanted.

536
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,350
I guess this is his.

537
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,811
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

538
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,232
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

539
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,110
That's earning money the hard way.

540
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,115
Paid killer.

541
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,411
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

542
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,749
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

543
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,459
Nobody paid me.

544
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:50,002
Nobody!

545
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:53,047
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

546
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,049
Chance.

547
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:58,302
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
Get up!

548
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,430
You're all in it.

549
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,141
The whole lot of you.

550
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,228
You're gonna get out of town.

551
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,730
Take your boy here with you.

552
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,275
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

553
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:17,571
You can tell him anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

554
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,740
...because they're gonna earn it.

555
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,910
Charlie, I want you to...

556
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,540
You finished yet, Dude?

557
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,835
- You in a hurry?
- Not especially.

558
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,223
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

559
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,684
- Yeah, Dude, I...
- You want it back?

560
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,645
- Sure.
- You know how to get it?

561
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,649
Yeah.

562
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,709
That's all for me, Chance.

563
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,004
- Charlie, come here.
- Yeah, sheriff.

564
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,463
You're going with us.

565
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,465
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

566
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,302
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

567
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,721
All right, back up and give him room.

568
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,769
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

569
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,821
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

570
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,907
Why, you're crazy!

571
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,367
And you are too. What happened?

572
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,411
He was hiding in the loft.

573
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,414
- Who got him?
- Dude did. One shot.

574
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,334
I wish I could've seen that.

575
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,336
I wish Wheeler could've too.

576
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,505
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

577
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,675
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

578
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,969
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

579
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,430
You were good in there tonight.

580
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,515
Good as you've ever been.

581
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,894
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

582
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:16,023
They were laughing at you.
Borrachón talking big.

583
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,610
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

584
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,112
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

585
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,157
- Listen to him.
- Don't get too cocksure.

586
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,201
What a stinker!
Spit in his eye, Dude.

587
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,745
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

588
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,373
If he were to change,
that would worry me.

589
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,877
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

590
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,546
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

591
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:43,384
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

592
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,387
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

593
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,514
I could've sure used a drink then.

594
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:51,725
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

595
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,062
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

596
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,357
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

597
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,820
Chance, nobody please you no how?

598
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,905
You got a light, Stumpy?

599
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,409
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

600
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,077
Let him in.

601
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,123
Come on in.

602
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,753
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

603
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,630
Dude did.

604
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,758
Thanks, Dude.

605
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,512
Gonna bury him in the morning.

606
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,098
I've just been to the undertaker's
with him.

607
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,600
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

608
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,728
I took out $60 he owed me.

609
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,022
You got yours.

610
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,815
How about the rest?

611
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:41,817
Did he owe them too?

612
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:43,235
Probably did.

613
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,821
I didn't think about that.

614
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,949
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

615
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,619
- Does that mean you hold the wagons too?
- That's right.

616
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,496
Meantime, I'm broke.

617
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,542
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

618
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:02,171
...I'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

619
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,716
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

620
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,010
No offense again, sheriff.

621
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,975
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

622
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,936
Yeah, he ain't like
the usual kid with a gun.

623
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,148
I wonder if
he's as good as Wheeler said.

624
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,650
I'd say he is.

625
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:27,529
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

626
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,292
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I was beginning to think you didn't.

627
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,752
I wanted to talk to you.

628
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,171
Don't tell me you're still looking
for an apology.

629
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,925
No. No, I was thinking of making one.

630
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,469
I was pretty much of a...

631
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:53,722
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

632
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,808
My only excuse is...

633
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,061
...I didn't know about all
the trouble you were in.

634
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:09,655
I'm gonna have a drink. How about you?

635
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,491
Thanks, I'd like one.

636
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,496
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

637
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,957
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

638
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,211
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that too?

639
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,796
Yes, he told me.

640
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:31,301
How does...?
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

641
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,763
Gets lazy. Gets tired...

642
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,765
...of selling his gun all over...

643
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,725
...decides to sell it in one place.

644
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,936
I'd say you made a poor sale.

645
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,730
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

646
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:47,693
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

647
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:51,905
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

648
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,449
She gets married.

649
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:58,120
- Handbill says he was a cheat.
- He wasn't a cheat then.

650
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:02,374
That came later, after his luck turned.

651
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,752
It was probably my fault he cheated.

652
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,921
He liked to buy me things.

653
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,883
- Then why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

654
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:14,428
He left me rather suddenly.

655
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,182
He was caught just like that man tonight...

656
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,185
...only his luck had run out.

657
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,061
He was shot.

658
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:25,856
You've had a rough time.

659
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:30,944
You're wrong, sheriff.
I've had a good time.

660
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,447
I liked gambling.

661
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,783
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

662
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:42,456
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

663
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,585
If I had known, it might have been rough.

664
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,921
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

665
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,589
When did this happen?

666
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,883
About four months ago.

667
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:58,430
Since then I've been working...

668
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,683
...to get enough money for stage fare.

669
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:05,145
- You going home?
- I haven't any.

670
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,605
Señor Chance!

671
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:09,358
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

672
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,861
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

673
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,906
But tonight, señor, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

674
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,242
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

675
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,661
Don't want anybody else helping me.

676
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,623
Señor Chance, this is my hotel...

677
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,833
...and you are a guest under my roof.

678
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:31,338
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do, señor.

679
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,883
- All right, Carlos.
- What you do?

680
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,719
- I'll sleep in the jail.
- But you can't sleep...

681
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,765
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

682
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,685
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

683
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,229
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

684
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,897
- One thing.
- What?

685
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:51,358
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

686
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,152
- But it's not enough.
- Will you?

687
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,906
I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

688
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:00,200
I don't want to meddle in your business.

689
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,702
I'm gonna turn in.

690
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,017
If I don't see you in
the morning, so long.

691
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:05,747
So long.

692
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:09,084
By the way, where are you going?

693
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:12,212
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

694
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,383
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

695
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,512
I know the sheriff that got these out.

696
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,558
I'll write him a letter,
get them called in.

697
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,854
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

698
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,823
Well...

699
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,118
Thanks.

700
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,869
- Carlos!
- Señor.

701
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:28,914
It's after 7. Why didn't you wake me up?
You said you would.

702
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:30,248
- The girl.
- The girl?

703
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,251
- That one with the feathers.
- What's she got to do with it?

704
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:34,961
She told me not to wake you.

705
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,297
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

706
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:40,550
- Sitting outside my room in a chair?
- All night long.

707
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,844
She was still there
two, three minutes ago.

708
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,556
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you, señor.

709
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,475
Well, you can tell her...

710
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,520
- The fool!
- Tell her she's a fool?

711
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,564
No! I'll tell her myself.

712
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,441
You tell her she's a fool?

713
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,110
I didn't say I was.

714
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:01,321
He say, "Not to wake him up."

715
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,573
She say, "To wake him up."

716
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,700
Me, I'm in the middle.

717
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:11,331
- Who is it?
- It's me, the sheriff.

718
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,083
Oh, just a minute.

719
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:21,466
Come on in.

720
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,888
Hi.

721
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,142
- Did you get a good night's sleep?
- Who, me?

722
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,436
Yes, you.
There's nobody else in the room.

723
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,397
Carlos had to go and talk.

724
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,171
I couldn't sleep anyway.

725
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:39,901
I was just as well off
out there in the hall.

726
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:43,613
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

727
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,781
Fool women.

728
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,992
- Didn't you hear me say that...?
- I know.

729
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,203
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

730
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,998
- Why did you do it?
- You weren't supposed to know.

731
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:55,667
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

732
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:59,838
- He didn't wake me up!
- Don't blame him, that was my fault.

733
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:02,549
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

734
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:05,010
You got some sleep, I lost some.

735
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:08,305
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

736
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:09,890
...you'd better go on.

737
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,058
I'm gonna get some sleep too.

738
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,060
Well, you can't go to bed now.

739
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,770
I can't?

740
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,899
Well, you just see whether or not
I can go to bed now...

741
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,234
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

742
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,112
- What did you say?
- The stage, it leaves in an hour.

743
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,740
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- I just did!

744
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:31,495
Well, then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

745
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,872
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

746
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,624
You're doing most of the talking.

747
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,376
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

748
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,462
- Will you just go on and go?
- I'm going.

749
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,297
Then do it, don't talk any more.

750
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,258
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

751
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,928
So, just go on
and let me get on the stage.

752
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,139
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

753
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,433
But I just wanted to...

754
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,937
You could have at least let me finish.

755
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:01,650
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

756
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,570
I guess I talk too much.

757
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,031
You tell her?

758
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,450
- Tell her what?
- That she's a fool.

759
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,578
She's going on the stage?

760
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:16,081
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.

761
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:18,625
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

762
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,044
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

763
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,462
I hold you responsible.

764
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,881
Responsible, me? Yes.

765
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,471
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

766
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:32,889
So I see.

767
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,643
There's a lot of people in town today.

768
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,562
Did you hear why?

769
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:43,233
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

770
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:45,402
Most likely they here to watch.

771
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,656
Well, if he does,
they may see something.

772
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:52,617
- I don't like it.
- Neither do I.

773
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,043
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.

774
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:05,005
Sure enough.

775
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,157
That's far enough.

776
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,492
I got orders to take your guns.

777
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:37,287
Suppose we don't wanna give them up?

778
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:40,165
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

779
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:43,418
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

780
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:47,380
You won't need a gun no more
because you'll be the first man I'd get.

781
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,882
Come on, let's go.

782
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,051
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

783
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,931
- Hold it, Harris!
- He cut my rein.

784
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,226
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

785
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,902
Now just hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

786
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,445
Hang up your guns.

787
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:21,164
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

788
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,501
- Not bad, Mr. Burdette.
- How does that happen?

789
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:28,088
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

790
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,632
If you mean being sober...

791
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,718
...I'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

792
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,095
I don't follow you.

793
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,722
You don't have to follow me,
Mr. Burdette. Matt!

794
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,142
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

795
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,354
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence too.

796
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:51,611
- You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
- All right, Mr. Burdette...

797
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:54,406
...let's get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

798
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,449
You should enjoy it, Dude.

799
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,286
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

800
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:21,975
Stumpy!

801
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,269
Burdette and his men are coming in.

802
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,980
Well, don't put down
no red carpet for them.

803
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,607
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

804
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:30,984
You do that.

805
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:35,572
Good morning, sheriff.

806
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,657
Hello, Burdette.

807
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,160
Been expecting you.

808
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,245
I want to see my brother.

809
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,788
You can come in.

810
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:48,710
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

811
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:51,004
Go on across the street with the others.

812
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,672
Do as he says.

813
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,426
What're all those people doing in town?

814
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,136
I didn't ask.

815
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,849
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

816
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:06,186
But I think they're watching to see
what you're gonna do.

817
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:12,233
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

818
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:16,321
Now do you wanna keep talking to me
or see your brother?

819
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,698
See my brother.

820
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,869
We're coming in, Stumpy.

821
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:26,372
Well, come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

822
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,174
All right, Stumpy, open up.

823
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:38,343
What's the password?

824
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:42,347
- Come on.
- Oh, I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

825
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:46,351
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Well, look who's here.

826
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,895
Place is getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

827
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:50,396
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

828
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:54,067
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

829
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:55,235
Nathan.

830
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,196
Well, Joe.

831
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,740
Looks like they gave you a going-over.

832
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,492
Our friend here.

833
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:04,786
Why?

834
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,581
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

835
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,291
It wasn't murder.

836
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,336
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

837
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:17,549
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

838
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,886
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

839
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,972
But you knew that already...

840
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:27,392
...otherwise you wouldn't have
set things up the way you did.

841
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,935
Just what have I done?

842
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:32,105
You're a rich man, Burdette.
Big ranch.

843
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:35,108
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

844
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:37,318
And you got a brother.

845
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,988
He's no good, but he's your brother.

846
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:44,242
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

847
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,952
I don't like that kind of talk.

848
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,413
- You're accusing me...
- Let's get this straight.

849
01:01:48,581 --> 01:01:50,081
You don't like.

850
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,125
I don't like a lot of things.

851
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:55,628
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

852
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,966
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

853
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,303
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

854
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,555
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

855
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:09,517
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

856
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,897
What're you gonna do about it?

857
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:17,734
I thought you'd get around to that.

858
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,904
I'm gonna sit here
with your brother in my lap...

859
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,823
...until the United States marshal
gets here.

860
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:25,992
That'll be about six days.

861
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:29,537
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

862
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:33,416
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

863
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,168
Now I'm running out of breath.

864
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:36,836
You talk if you want to.

865
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,590
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

866
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:43,343
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

867
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,555
- You can get me out of here any...
- Shut up, Joe!

868
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,767
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

869
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:55,396
He sees Stumpy here sitting around
the corner locked in with you.

870
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,775
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

871
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,694
If any trouble starts around this jail...

872
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,823
...before anybody can get to you,
you're gonna get accidentally shot.

873
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,701
I can practical guarantee that.

874
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:12,789
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

875
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:17,710
Four hundred and sixty acres
might be little to you, Nathan.

876
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,046
But it was a lot of country to me.

877
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:24,050
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

878
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,386
He's smarter than I thought.

879
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:30,223
You know,
a court might just call that murder too.

880
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,684
Oh, hell, what's the difference?

881
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,852
We'd all be dead by then.

882
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:37,355
You got anything else
you wanna say, Burdette?

883
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,234
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

884
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:44,404
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

885
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,407
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

886
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,409
I want to make that clear.

887
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,327
Well, I'll help you make it clear.

888
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,122
I don't think
Joe's got a friend in the world.

889
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:58,584
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

890
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,379
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

891
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,090
You made it clear.

892
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,426
All right, Stumpy.

893
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,428
- Nathan.
- Just sit tight, Joe.

894
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,513
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

895
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:14,225
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

896
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,186
Now sometimes it takes
quite a spell to find out.

897
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,569
- He didn't have much to say, did he?
- No.

898
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,952
What'd you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

899
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,537
Anything they're gonna do...

900
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,415
...is planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

901
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:40,918
Throwing him in with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

902
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,378
I never thought of that.

903
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:44,797
- What do you think'll happen?
- I don't know.

904
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,966
You can think, can't you?
Any man can...

905
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:51,054
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

906
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,681
Careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.

907
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:57,143
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

908
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:01,314
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

909
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:04,317
I gotta fix your supper for you tonight.

910
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,740
Señor Chance. Señor Chance.

911
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:12,325
It's me, Carlos.

912
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:13,826
Come on in.

913
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:16,788
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

914
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,372
Did the girl get...?

915
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,958
What happened to your eye?

916
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:25,171
- You told me to put the lady on the stage.
- Oh, she did that? What did you do?

917
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,799
- She did not do it.
- I thought you said she did.

918
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,947
I say, "You tell me to
put her on the stage.

919
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:31,928
" Consuelo, she hit
me in the eye.

920
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:35,264
- Wait, I'm a little mixed up.
- Do not talk. I tell you.

921
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,225
- Go ahead.
- It is better if I tell you.

922
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,895
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage is ready, but she don't come.

923
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,523
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said she ain't coming.

924
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,192
- I go and get her, she said she don't go.
- Did she go?

925
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,861
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

926
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:51,989
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I say, "That may be."

927
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:55,535
I pick her up. Then Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

928
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:59,038
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

929
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,748
- Did she go on the stage?
- Please.

930
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:04,252
Consuelo tell me, "Put her down."
I said, "I am responsible."

931
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:07,672
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.

932
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,091
- What did you do?
- "Do"? What can I do?

933
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:11,592
My arms is full of the lady.

934
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,908
I can do nothing.
I drop her on the floor.

935
01:06:13,909 --> 01:06:16,055
She yells.
And she said I tried to kill her.

936
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,723
Did the girl get on the stage?

937
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,560
No, she did not go!
But Jake say he couldn't wait.

938
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,353
- Why?
- He say he must leave.

939
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:25,022
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

940
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,151
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

941
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,946
Please, Señor Chance. You come and tell
Consuelo what "responsible" means.

942
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,698
Stumpy, we're going out.

943
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,909
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

944
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,420
The door's unlocked.

945
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,636
Well, I didn't go.

946
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,388
I can see that.

947
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,017
I don't know...

948
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:05,104
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

949
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:08,065
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

950
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,776
It was me saying it.

951
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:14,488
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, sheriff?

952
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:19,076
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

953
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,287
Chance, John T.

954
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,706
"T" for trouble.

955
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,626
I always make you mad, don't I, John T.?

956
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,713
Well, then, don't make me
tell you why I stayed.

957
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:34,967
I won't make it any harder for you.

958
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,845
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

959
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,723
You don't owe me a thing.

960
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,351
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

961
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,979
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

962
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:51,817
No, you won't even have to tell me.

963
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,820
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

964
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,740
Is that fair, John T.?

965
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,665
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

966
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:11,420
But just say something.

967
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:17,051
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

968
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:18,511
But I am.

969
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:22,682
That's all I wanted to hear.

970
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:44,787
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

971
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,790
It's better when two people do it.

972
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,378
Well, I've kept you long enough.

973
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,381
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

974
01:10:57,838 --> 01:10:59,004
Hi, Chance.

975
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:03,008
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

976
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:05,761
Anything happen when Burdette left?

977
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,555
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

978
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,515
What was the shot when they came in?

979
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:12,935
- That gunslinger of his was on the prod.
- What did he do?

980
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:16,021
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

981
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,524
I took care of that.
What happened here?

982
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:19,900
Not much.

983
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,530
That tune, it's been playing it all day.

984
01:11:24,698 --> 01:11:26,073
What is it?

985
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:29,493
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

986
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,705
Evening, sheriff.

987
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:34,957
Colorado. What do you want?

988
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,959
Just curious again.

989
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,044
How'd you come out with Burdette?

990
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,088
He wanted to talk to his brother.

991
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,549
- What'd he have to say?
- Nothing.

992
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,468
You mean he didn't say anything?

993
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,303
Why are you so interested?

994
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:49,472
Because he's talking now.

995
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,223
Hear that music?

996
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,184
He told the man to play it.

997
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:55,394
What is it?

998
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,522
They call it "The Deguello,"
"The Cutthroat Song."

999
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,816
The Mexicans played it
for those Texas boys...

1000
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:03,319
...when they had them
bottled up in the Alamo.

1001
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:06,238
Played it day and night
till it was all over.

1002
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:08,741
Now do you know what he means by it?

1003
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,242
No quarter.

1004
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:14,580
- No mercy for the losers.
- You'll be hearing a lot of it.

1005
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:17,249
I guess we made him talk after all.

1006
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,877
Just thought you'd like to know, sheriff.

1007
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,354
Stumpy!

1008
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:23,607
- What?
- They don't need any help with that tune.

1009
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:26,235
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

1010
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:36,161
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1011
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:40,416
I watched it clear through the valley.

1012
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,170
In about six days
the marshal will get here.

1013
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,922
That's what I figured.

1014
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,886
Oh, the girl wasn't on the stage.

1015
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:56,724
I know that.

1016
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:00,686
Tell her she could stay?

1017
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,271
No, she...

1018
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:06,150
Yes, I did. What about it?

1019
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,027
Nothing, nothing at all.

1020
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:09,862
You were going to say something.

1021
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,780
I remembered in time.

1022
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:17,328
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1023
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:20,873
I remember you told me she was no good.

1024
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,251
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

1025
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,712
So naturally I figured you're an expert.

1026
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,673
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1027
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,552
I just hope
you have better luck than I had.

1028
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:39,725
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1029
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:41,560
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1030
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,728
Maybe.

1031
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,229
But I doubt it.

1032
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,067
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1033
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,112
If you go by the hotel pick up
some coffee and sugar, would you?

1034
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,530
Joe complaining?

1035
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,366
Him? He don't get no sugar.

1036
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,910
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

1037
01:14:58,078 --> 01:15:00,037
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1038
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:04,375
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1039
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,752
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1040
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,673
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

1041
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,175
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1042
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:17,137
- I forgot all about them.
- Your memory is no better than mine.

1043
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,765
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

1044
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:22,476
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

1045
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,944
Where'd you get these?

1046
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:35,239
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

1047
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,660
I didn't...

1048
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,122
I don't know how to...

1049
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:47,751
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee.

1050
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:50,170
Ain't you gonna tell me
to get back in there?

1051
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:53,090
No, stay out here and get shot.

1052
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,509
I might do that just for spite.

1053
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,678
Might get a laugh out of you.

1054
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,848
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1055
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:22,661
- Feels good.
- Come on.

1056
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:25,330
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1057
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,999
Same as before.

1058
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:29,835
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

1059
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:31,211
No hurry.

1060
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:34,423
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1061
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:38,343
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

1062
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,595
No need of that.

1063
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:42,681
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1064
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,309
I got them at the hotel.

1065
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,228
You been keeping them all this time?

1066
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,356
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1067
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:56,904
You could use a bath and a shave too.

1068
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,699
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1069
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:05,204
- Chance?
- Yeah?

1070
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:06,705
They'll fit.

1071
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:08,707
Thanks.

1072
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:41,198
There you are.

1073
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:43,659
Thank you.

1074
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:51,834
How about you, John T.?
Shall I work on you?

1075
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:54,044
I do my own shaving.

1076
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,171
I thought you did.

1077
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,549
I was just reminding you.

1078
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,349
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1079
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,436
You sure could.

1080
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,316
I'll let you keep it for me.

1081
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,738
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1082
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,782
Anytime, because I'll be here.

1083
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:27,119
Oh, I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

1084
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:30,497
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1085
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:33,458
You in a hurry, John T.?
I'd like to talk to you.

1086
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:36,336
- I'll wait for you.
- Thanks, Dude.

1087
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:39,464
- I just wanted to ask you...
- What's this about a job?

1088
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:43,510
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1089
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:45,470
Tending bar?

1090
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,306
Among other things.

1091
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,557
You...

1092
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,310
- You think I shouldn't?
- Why ask me?

1093
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,312
The way you said "tending bar."

1094
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:56,273
- All right, I won't do it.
- I didn't say not to.

1095
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:57,816
But you don't like the idea.

1096
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,611
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1097
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,779
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1098
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,573
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?

1099
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:07,618
- You'd make anybody mad.
- I suppose I would.

1100
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:12,372
Well, as long as you haven't anything
against it, I'll take the job.

1101
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:13,582
Well, go ahead.

1102
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,292
Thanks, I will.

1103
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:18,462
What were you gonna ask me?

1104
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:22,007
- Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
- What were you going to ask?

1105
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:24,676
Whether you were gonna sleep
in the hotel tonight.

1106
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:28,597
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

1107
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:30,515
Oh, I know. I've given that up.

1108
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,478
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1109
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:36,521
Anyone looking
wouldn't look there first.

1110
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,358
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1111
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:43,403
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

1112
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:47,199
Just an idea. You can think about it.

1113
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:50,369
When you're in a little better humor.

1114
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,297
Chance! Señor Chance!

1115
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,383
The shot came from the jail.

1116
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:16,561
Chance, look out!

1117
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:17,938
Don't go in there.

1118
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:20,399
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1119
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:23,235
Stumpy! You all right?

1120
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:26,989
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

1121
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,282
And I'm that fellow.

1122
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:33,203
Coming in.

1123
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,540
Look what he did to my hat.

1124
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,169
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1125
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,589
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1126
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,718
- Fool almost blowed my head off.
- How'd I know it was you?

1127
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,262
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

1128
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,682
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1129
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:54,850
Look at this hat.

1130
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:57,811
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

1131
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,105
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

1132
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:02,774
Okay, I know.
Just stop talking, will you?

1133
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:05,527
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1134
01:21:05,695 --> 01:21:07,029
You could have hollered.

1135
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,365
Just because you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1136
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,869
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1137
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,288
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1138
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,916
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

1139
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,586
- ...and now you expect...
- Shut up!

1140
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:27,716
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1141
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,635
Don't let me tell you again.

1142
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,821
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

1143
01:21:50,073 --> 01:21:53,033
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I...

1144
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,036
All right, I'm wrong.

1145
01:21:56,204 --> 01:21:59,122
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1146
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,333
He's the one that's scared.

1147
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:04,753
We've been pampering you too much.

1148
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,631
You better get some sleep.

1149
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:20,352
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

1150
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,229
You see that door there?

1151
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,856
That look like I done it on purpose?

1152
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,651
It's gonna get cold here at night.

1153
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:31,613
And I'm gonna leave it get cold.
Because I ain't gonna fix that door.

1154
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,034
It wasn't my fault.

1155
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,121
Were it?

1156
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:46,211
I know.

1157
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:49,923
I'll fix the door.

1158
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,231
Hi, sheriff.

1159
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,827
Well, how do you like your new job?

1160
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,288
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1161
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,458
You through for the day?
Going to bed?

1162
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,960
I thought I would.

1163
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:29,254
- Can I make you some coffee?
- No, thanks.

1164
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:30,922
- Anything to eat?
- Nope.

1165
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,424
How about a drink?

1166
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,427
I'll take a drink.

1167
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:39,264
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1168
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,309
Tired, aren't you, John T.?

1169
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,520
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1170
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,355
All I want is that drink.

1171
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:51,860
Then this is all I can do for you?

1172
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,947
I thought you said I could think about it.

1173
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:59,576
You're right. I did.

1174
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:01,828
Put it on the tab.

1175
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,248
And in case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1176
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,545
Get a good night's sleep.

1177
01:24:11,339 --> 01:24:13,340
You're not helping me any.

1178
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:15,086
- Good morning, Dude.
- Good morning.

1179
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,671
Have a good night?

1180
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:18,423
All right, I guess.

1181
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:20,592
- Eat anything?
- Well, I...

1182
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,218
This morning?

1183
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,095
Stumpy fixed something.

1184
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:27,140
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1185
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,934
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

1186
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:33,188
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

1187
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,939
Think you can stand your watch?

1188
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,442
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

1189
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,005
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

1190
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,799
Where's his hat?

1191
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:52,475
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

1192
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:07,365
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1193
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:09,576
Oh, he's suffering thunderation, Chance.

1194
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:14,205
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

1195
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:16,374
Well, ain't pretty.

1196
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,710
He's gotta sweat it out.

1197
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,921
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

1198
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,298
He ain't done it yet.

1199
01:28:23,466 --> 01:28:26,217
Why are you so goddarned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1200
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:29,554
- You got any tobacco?
- No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1201
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:32,223
He used it up fast.
You gotta get some for yourself.

1202
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:35,101
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

1203
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:39,189
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1204
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,900
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1205
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,820
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

1206
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,615
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

1207
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,950
Considering what I have to do around here.

1208
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:55,371
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the nursemaiding that killer back there.

1209
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:58,166
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

1210
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,168
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1211
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:02,629
You're a treasure.

1212
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,255
Well...

1213
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,842
- I don't know what I'd do without you.
- Yeah, well...

1214
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:12,805
Go back to being yourself.
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1215
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:50,426
He's coming down the street now.

1216
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:56,432
Good morning, sheriff.

1217
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,309
Colorado.

1218
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:01,312
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1219
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,814
About what?

1220
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:05,858
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

1221
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:08,278
...if trouble started around the jail.

1222
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,823
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me too.

1223
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:14,325
- Would you have said it any different?
- No.

1224
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,996
He was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

1225
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:20,707
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

1226
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,458
I don't suppose so.

1227
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:25,587
But you can be sure
he's gonna try it a different way.

1228
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,589
Got enough left there for another?

1229
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,465
Sure. Help yourself.

1230
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:32,552
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1231
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,512
Only when I carry it.

1232
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,140
How come you carry a rifle?

1233
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:41,227
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1234
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:48,234
I don't suppose you have a match either?

1235
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,028
All out of them too.

1236
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:51,529
I'll get some.

1237
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,958
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1238
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,252
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1239
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,713
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1240
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:10,465
Around the corner.

1241
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,967
About three or four doors to the right.

1242
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,178
Stay away from that rifle, sheriff.

1243
01:31:15,346 --> 01:31:17,305
You can see we've still got our guns.

1244
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:19,557
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1245
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:21,225
Unloosen that belt.

1246
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,565
- What've you done to him?
- Don't worry about him.

1247
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:29,567
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1248
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:32,904
He ain't gonna be and neither are you
unless you do as you're told.

1249
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:35,365
- Stay back here.
- We're going down to the jail.

1250
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:37,325
You'll turn Burdette loose...

1251
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:40,870
...or you and your deputy are gonna
quit worrying about this whole thing.

1252
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:42,163
Take your choice.

1253
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:44,415
Are you just gonna stand here?

1254
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,418
If you wanna get him shot,
just go out there.

1255
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,420
What'll it be?

1256
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:55,343
If you wanna do something,
when I get out on the porch...

1257
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:58,096
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

1258
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,264
And duck after you throw it.

1259
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,691
Just keep coming, mister.

1260
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,360
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1261
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:32,171
Grab that horse.

1262
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:42,473
- Colorado, where's he going?
- He's gonna see if Dude's all right.

1263
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,739
Chance, over here.

1264
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,664
You look a little used.

1265
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:09,000
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1266
01:33:09,293 --> 01:33:12,503
They had me cold.
Gonna make me open the jail.

1267
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,005
What happened?

1268
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,091
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1269
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:20,011
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1270
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,221
I can get up by myself!

1271
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:24,682
I let them get me.

1272
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:28,186
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

1273
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,313
...and it was easy for them.

1274
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:35,318
I'm good when I'm sober.
Boy, real good.

1275
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,446
I should have known better.

1276
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:42,200
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1277
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,786
- Where're you going?
- Get your hands off of me.

1278
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,329
I said, where're you going?

1279
01:33:46,497 --> 01:33:49,373
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

1280
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,542
One bad night and I'm done for.

1281
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:55,546
An old man takes a potshot at me
and I'm finished.

1282
01:33:56,173 --> 01:33:59,217
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1283
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:00,468
Look at me.

1284
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:02,553
I got them so bad.

1285
01:34:03,347 --> 01:34:05,723
What can a man do with hands like that?

1286
01:34:06,642 --> 01:34:11,187
- I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.
- All right, quit.

1287
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:13,523
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1288
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,566
If you wanna quit, quit.

1289
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:17,735
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

1290
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,612
One thing, though.

1291
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:24,784
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1292
01:34:24,952 --> 01:34:27,328
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1293
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:32,416
I'm sorry.

1294
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:35,086
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

1295
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:39,674
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1296
01:34:40,968 --> 01:34:42,426
Maybe you're right.

1297
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:45,763
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1298
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,270
Here are your guns.

1299
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:56,232
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

1300
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,234
You get something out of it.

1301
01:34:59,278 --> 01:35:03,114
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

1302
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:13,291
- I think this is your horse, señor.
- Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1303
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,835
I guess Dude's all right.

1304
01:35:16,003 --> 01:35:17,295
Anyway, he's walking.

1305
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:20,756
I'm so glad. I was afraid.

1306
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,259
My stomach seems...

1307
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:25,678
Come on, maybe a drink'll help.

1308
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:41,944
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

1309
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:46,073
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1310
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:53,122
Oh, Señor Chance.

1311
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:56,292
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1312
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:59,003
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

1313
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,089
There's another one
down by the bridge.

1314
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:03,007
Send in your bill and
the county'll pay you.

1315
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,425
No need for that.

1316
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:08,179
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

1317
01:36:08,347 --> 01:36:09,555
Price is going up.

1318
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:12,183
- What?
- Nothing, Bert.

1319
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:14,977
Bring their guns and other stuff
to the jail.

1320
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,355
- It will be done.
- Here is your gun, señor.

1321
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,774
Thank you, Carlitos.

1322
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:21,442
Where's Colorado?

1323
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,111
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl, Feathers.

1324
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:28,532
Better give me another, Colorado.

1325
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:33,537
- Yes, ma'am.
- Look at me, Colorado. Take a good look.

1326
01:36:34,206 --> 01:36:37,583
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1327
01:36:38,168 --> 01:36:39,377
No, ma'am.

1328
01:36:39,836 --> 01:36:41,629
Yeah, well, you'd be a liar then.

1329
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:44,757
Better go easy on that stuff.

1330
01:36:44,925 --> 01:36:47,093
- That makes three you've had.
- Yep.

1331
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:51,931
You'd be lying because that's what I am,
a softheaded idiot.

1332
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:55,893
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

1333
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:58,938
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me...

1334
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:04,068
Hi, sheriff.

1335
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:06,946
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1336
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:10,408
He's all right. So am I, thanks to you.

1337
01:37:11,076 --> 01:37:13,078
Thank the lady here.

1338
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:15,079
Sure, thank the lady.
She did a big thing.

1339
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:19,250
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

1340
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:21,252
Or was it four?

1341
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:22,962
Why'd you make me do it?

1342
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,923
- I made you do it?
- Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1343
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:28,217
He wasn't gonna do
what those men told him.

1344
01:37:28,385 --> 01:37:29,552
Not him.

1345
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,264
You were just gonna get yourself killed,
that's all.

1346
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:34,932
Somebody had to...

1347
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,726
What were you gonna do, sheriff?

1348
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,061
I'm glad I didn't have to
make up my mind.

1349
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:41,856
You weren't going down to that jail,
John T.

1350
01:37:42,024 --> 01:37:43,774
So somebody had to help you.

1351
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:46,569
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1352
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:50,406
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

1353
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,491
It was my own idea.

1354
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:55,786
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

1355
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:57,121
I know you did.

1356
01:37:57,664 --> 01:37:59,915
- I'm glad you didn't.
- What?

1357
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,792
I'm glad you didn't go.

1358
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:08,924
What'd you...? What'd you have to
say a thing like that for?

1359
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:13,763
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1360
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,641
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

1361
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,393
And neither do I.

1362
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:22,813
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1363
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:25,274
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1364
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:33,282
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

1365
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:38,329
I don't know why I should go though,
because we're all fools.

1366
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:41,665
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1367
01:38:43,168 --> 01:38:44,835
Well, I'm going, anyway.

1368
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,838
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

1369
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:50,382
Just a bunch of idiots.

1370
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,470
How did she get mixed up in this?

1371
01:38:55,055 --> 01:38:56,806
She didn't feel too good.

1372
01:38:56,973 --> 01:39:00,643
- She had a couple of drinks.
- I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1373
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:05,481
Oh, she was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

1374
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:10,486
I told her to throw that flowerpot through
the window and I went out instead.

1375
01:39:10,654 --> 01:39:13,280
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me?

1376
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:15,616
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1377
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:18,035
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

1378
01:39:18,328 --> 01:39:20,162
But you saved my neck.

1379
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:22,706
Burdette isn't gonna kiss you for that.

1380
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,375
So you're in.

1381
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:29,130
Now, don't tell me you didn't think
about that. Before you did it, I mean.

1382
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:32,258
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1383
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:34,218
How do I get a badge?

1384
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:36,262
Come on, I'll get you one.

1385
01:39:37,222 --> 01:39:40,349
Oh, I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1386
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:45,604
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

1387
01:39:46,356 --> 01:39:49,567
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

1388
01:39:53,363 --> 01:39:57,533
You telling me they was gonna bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

1389
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,118
Why, they're crazy.

1390
01:39:59,286 --> 01:40:00,578
Goddarn fools.

1391
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,664
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

1392
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:07,418
...what do they think I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do.

1393
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:09,879
I'm gonna start blasting.

1394
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,423
Where'd you get that hat?

1395
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:15,551
- Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.
- For a what?

1396
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:18,179
- Stumpy, we're coming in.
- Well, come ahead.

1397
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,347
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1398
01:40:23,268 --> 01:40:26,270
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

1399
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:28,314
In the right-hand drawer there.

1400
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:31,025
You know where the book is,
the one with the oath?

1401
01:40:31,193 --> 01:40:34,695
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

1402
01:40:34,863 --> 01:40:37,615
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1403
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,951
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy...

1404
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,163
Found yourself another knothead
who don't know when he's well off?

1405
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:47,124
...in the county of Presidio
of the great state of Texas?

1406
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:48,292
I do.

1407
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:51,378
And that includes taking orders from me.

1408
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:54,381
All right, sheriff.
How about giving me one?

1409
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,717
Get over at the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1410
01:40:56,885 --> 01:40:58,385
Move in here.

1411
01:40:59,054 --> 01:41:00,721
What're you laughing about?

1412
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:02,848
What I got myself in for.

1413
01:41:04,476 --> 01:41:06,310
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1414
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,812
- How good do you think he is?
- He's all right.

1415
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,232
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1416
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,568
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

1417
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:17,279
- Then he got another one.
- Good enough. Good enough.

1418
01:41:17,447 --> 01:41:19,240
Is he as good as I used to be?

1419
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,119
It'd be pretty close.

1420
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,789
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

1421
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,920
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1422
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,298
What's he talking about? "Him for me"?

1423
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:39,093
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

1424
01:41:39,261 --> 01:41:40,970
You heard him, he's quitting.

1425
01:41:43,348 --> 01:41:44,848
What's got into you?

1426
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:47,559
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

1427
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,645
Shaking worse all the time.

1428
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:52,731
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

1429
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:56,694
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1430
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:58,529
He can take the whole bottle.

1431
01:41:58,947 --> 01:42:00,447
Well, go ahead.

1432
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:27,057
Stumpy.

1433
01:42:29,019 --> 01:42:30,185
Don't close it.

1434
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,167
Didn't spill a drop.

1435
01:42:56,963 --> 01:42:58,547
Shakes are gone...

1436
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:01,550
...just because of a piece of music.

1437
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:07,556
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1438
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:12,561
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1439
01:43:13,605 --> 01:43:17,024
Chance, give me another shot at it...

1440
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:20,319
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1441
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:26,492
You heard him.

1442
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,290
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1443
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:36,001
I ain't gonna wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

1444
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:38,462
You two's enough to drive a man to it.

1445
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:43,884
I think I'll go watch the road again.

1446
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,137
Unless you need me for something else.

1447
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:50,516
Did you forget this?

1448
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,602
You could clean up a little.

1449
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:56,146
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1450
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:58,649
I'm better than I look.

1451
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:00,818
I'll do that tonight.

1452
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:04,988
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1453
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:09,743
Nothing in his stomach.

1454
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:11,954
Nothing but guts.

1455
01:44:12,122 --> 01:44:14,957
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1456
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:17,876
We know about him.
He's gonna be all right, but I ain't.

1457
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:20,879
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

1458
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:22,172
Where're you going?

1459
01:44:23,174 --> 01:44:25,759
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better...

1460
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:27,928
I know, get back in my hole.

1461
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:31,348
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1462
01:44:31,516 --> 01:44:34,309
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1463
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:38,814
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1464
01:44:38,982 --> 01:44:40,566
Close the window!

1465
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:44,987
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

1466
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:47,865
Never can satisfy him.

1467
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:54,705
The sun is sinking in the West

1468
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:59,376
The cattle go down to the stream

1469
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:04,214
The red wing settles in her nest

1470
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:10,304
It's time for her cowboy to dream

1471
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:13,348
Purple light

1472
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:16,643
In the canyon

1473
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:23,609
That's where I long to be

1474
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:29,823
With my sweet girl companion

1475
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:35,787
Just my rifle, pony and me

1476
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:41,835
Gonna hang my sombrero

1477
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:48,634
On the limb of a tree

1478
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:54,264
Coming home, sweetheart darling

1479
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:59,978
Just my rifle, pony and me

1480
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,940
Whippoorwill

1481
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:04,942
In the willow

1482
01:46:06,361 --> 01:46:10,906
Sings a sweet melody

1483
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:13,617
Riding to

1484
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:15,118
Riding to

1485
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,204
Amarillo

1486
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:18,372
Amarillo

1487
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:24,086
Just my rifle, pony and me

1488
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:27,881
- No more cows
- No more cows

1489
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:30,759
- To be roping
- To be roping

1490
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:33,762
- No more strays
- No more strays

1491
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:36,348
- Will I see
- Will I see

1492
01:46:36,516 --> 01:46:38,100
Round the bend

1493
01:46:38,268 --> 01:46:39,434
Round the bend

1494
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:41,311
She'll be waiting

1495
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,063
She'll be waiting

1496
01:46:43,231 --> 01:46:49,069
- For my rifle, pony and me
- For my rifle, pony and me

1497
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:54,658
- For my rifle, my pony
- For my rifle, my pony

1498
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:58,787
- And me
- And me

1499
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:01,957
That's real pretty.
Go on, play some more.

1500
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:05,085
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1501
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:12,426
I wish I was an apple

1502
01:47:12,594 --> 01:47:13,594
That's a good one.

1503
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,096
Hanging in the tree

1504
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:18,849
And every time my sweetheart'd pass

1505
01:47:19,017 --> 01:47:20,976
She'd take a bite of me

1506
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:23,895
She told me that she loved me

1507
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,940
She called me "sugar plum"

1508
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:29,526
She threw her arms around me

1509
01:47:29,694 --> 01:47:31,653
I thought my time had come

1510
01:47:31,863 --> 01:47:34,364
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1511
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:36,825
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1512
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,995
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1513
01:47:40,163 --> 01:47:42,456
I'll marry you sometime

1514
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,877
I wish I had a needle

1515
01:47:47,045 --> 01:47:49,421
As fine as I could sew

1516
01:47:49,589 --> 01:47:54,468
I'd sew her in my pocket
And down the road I go

1517
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:57,304
Cindy hug and kiss me

1518
01:47:57,472 --> 01:48:00,015
She wrung her hands and cried

1519
01:48:00,183 --> 01:48:04,645
She swore I was the prettiest thing
That ever lived or died

1520
01:48:04,812 --> 01:48:07,356
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1521
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:10,067
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1522
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:12,736
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1523
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:19,910
I'll marry you sometime

1524
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:23,413
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1525
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:26,458
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

1526
01:48:26,626 --> 01:48:28,293
I can't argue with you.

1527
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:30,504
- You're right, Stumpy.
- Right about what?

1528
01:48:30,672 --> 01:48:34,007
- I should have thought of it before.
- Thought about what?

1529
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:37,844
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't gonna rush this jail.

1530
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,222
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1531
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:42,683
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

1532
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,434
Only be three or four days.

1533
01:48:45,103 --> 01:48:47,604
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1534
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:49,940
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1535
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:52,192
- Water and firewood?
- Filled up this morning.

1536
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:55,779
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

1537
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,115
- Less you got plenty.
- He ain't.

1538
01:48:58,449 --> 01:49:00,826
- And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
- Thanks, Stumpy.

1539
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:02,619
There's another thing now...

1540
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:06,957
...if we're all gonna be in here
three or four days, close together like...

1541
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:11,461
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

1542
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,088
...do what he said he'd do.

1543
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:16,967
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

1544
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:18,135
All right, Stumpy.

1545
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:22,097
Me, I like roses, but this fellow ain't
no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

1546
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:24,641
I'm gonna take a bath. I said I would.

1547
01:49:24,809 --> 01:49:27,477
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1548
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,521
I was just wondering when.

1549
01:49:29,856 --> 01:49:32,315
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

1550
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:34,943
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1551
01:49:35,111 --> 01:49:38,780
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

1552
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:43,618
How do you do that?

1553
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:46,496
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1554
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:48,874
Carlos, open up.

1555
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:50,834
Coming. Coming.

1556
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:55,797
Buenos tardes, Señor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

1557
01:49:55,965 --> 01:50:00,177
Yeah. Carlos, I'm sleeping
over at the jail tonight. All of us are.

1558
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:03,847
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

1559
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,475
- And some beer too.
- You feeling better?

1560
01:50:06,642 --> 01:50:07,684
Much better.

1561
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:09,853
- That's all you need?
- That's all.

1562
01:50:10,021 --> 01:50:14,191
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

1563
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:20,530
Now don't make any noise.

1564
01:50:23,367 --> 01:50:24,701
Open your mouth.

1565
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:51,728
Hi, Feathers.

1566
01:50:51,896 --> 01:50:54,147
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1567
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:56,900
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1568
01:50:57,068 --> 01:50:59,736
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1569
01:51:00,571 --> 01:51:01,696
Who's Stumpy?

1570
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:03,323
The fellow that likes roses.

1571
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,617
No, he watches the jail.

1572
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:07,869
- Hurry it up.
- Right away.

1573
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:10,914
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1574
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:14,751
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

1575
01:51:14,919 --> 01:51:16,586
Are you sorry you didn't?

1576
01:51:18,089 --> 01:51:19,297
Are you?

1577
01:51:19,966 --> 01:51:22,092
I know an easy way of telling you.

1578
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,680
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1579
01:51:27,265 --> 01:51:28,849
Chance, give me a towel, will you?

1580
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:31,101
- I'm busy.
- What'd you say?

1581
01:51:31,269 --> 01:51:32,894
Somebody's telling me something.

1582
01:51:33,062 --> 01:51:35,856
I can't hear...
Give me a towel, will you?

1583
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:39,776
He's a big help.

1584
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:41,945
I'll finish telling you later.

1585
01:51:43,406 --> 01:51:45,448
Purple light

1586
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:52,163
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1587
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:54,833
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1588
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:58,295
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

1589
01:51:58,546 --> 01:52:00,380
I don't wanna go up and get him.

1590
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:03,174
- Burdette wants him alive.
- Then don't talk so loud.

1591
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:06,553
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

1592
01:52:06,721 --> 01:52:08,972
- That might just work.
- What?

1593
01:52:09,682 --> 01:52:11,308
The stairs are pretty dark.

1594
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:14,060
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

1595
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:17,480
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

1596
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:35,665
The sun is sinking in the West

1597
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:38,501
- Hurry it up, will you?
- Be right out.

1598
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:43,840
Well, if you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1599
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:46,843
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in awhile...

1600
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:50,972
- ...and see if you needed anything.
- I don't want you anyplace around there.

1601
01:52:51,349 --> 01:52:52,891
I was afraid of that.

1602
01:52:53,726 --> 01:52:56,561
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1603
01:52:57,313 --> 01:52:58,939
That's a long time, you know.

1604
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:01,691
You'll live through it.

1605
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:05,153
Yeah, you do the same.

1606
01:53:16,749 --> 01:53:20,001
All ready. You both better get out there.
You too, Pedro.

1607
01:53:20,336 --> 01:53:22,212
Leave the door open a little.

1608
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:24,464
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1609
01:53:25,675 --> 01:53:28,635
Now, lady, we want you
to call the sheriff down here.

1610
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:31,137
No! No!

1611
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:32,639
Maybe this'll help.

1612
01:53:33,432 --> 01:53:33,932
Please don't. Don't!

1613
01:53:33,933 --> 01:53:36,685
Please don't. Don't!

1614
01:53:43,901 --> 01:53:46,111
- He's out cold.
- Get upstairs, quick!

1615
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:51,992
- Hold it, Dude.
- Watch him.

1616
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:56,871
Just keep coming, lady.

1617
01:53:57,915 --> 01:54:00,000
All right, everybody downstairs.

1618
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:10,927
All right, get on your feet.

1619
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:19,602
Come on, get up!

1620
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:28,069
Can you walk?

1621
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,699
- Where are we going?
- That's up to you.

1622
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,035
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

1623
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:37,620
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1624
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:38,872
Take your choice.

1625
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,957
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1626
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,878
- You'll just get Joe killed.
- Not if he knows we got you two.

1627
01:54:45,046 --> 01:54:46,880
Chance, they got us. We're licked.

1628
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:50,633
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

1629
01:54:50,843 --> 01:54:53,553
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm telling you to do it now.

1630
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:57,182
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

1631
01:54:57,349 --> 01:54:59,642
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

1632
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,686
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I do.

1633
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:04,689
I'm thinking good too.
Now do what I tell you.

1634
01:55:06,233 --> 01:55:08,485
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

1635
01:55:08,652 --> 01:55:10,445
All we want is Joe.

1636
01:55:13,324 --> 01:55:16,409
- You still think it's a good idea?
- I still think it's good.

1637
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:20,830
We'll go over to the jail.

1638
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:22,499
Take the shells out of his gun.

1639
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:24,042
I unloaded his pistol.

1640
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,544
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1641
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:30,507
Now look, sheriff,
we're going out of here natural-like.

1642
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,426
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

1643
01:55:33,594 --> 01:55:35,220
...think something's wrong.

1644
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:39,140
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1645
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:41,976
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

1646
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:46,147
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1647
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:49,275
Some of those you killed were
friends of mine.

1648
01:55:49,485 --> 01:55:50,693
Give him his rifle.

1649
01:55:54,073 --> 01:55:55,365
You first.

1650
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:33,862
Hold it.

1651
01:56:34,697 --> 01:56:38,491
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1652
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:42,078
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1653
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:43,788
It took you long enough.

1654
01:56:43,956 --> 01:56:46,040
Steve, cover from out here.

1655
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:57,260
All right, open up.
We're gonna let Joe go.

1656
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,179
How come?

1657
01:56:59,471 --> 01:57:01,681
His friends here put up bail.

1658
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,684
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

1659
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:07,520
I forgot.

1660
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:18,531
Easy.

1661
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,743
- This fellow'll talk all right.
- Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1662
01:57:21,911 --> 01:57:24,245
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1663
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:28,708
Now watch yourself.

1664
01:57:28,876 --> 01:57:30,960
There's two of them holding Dude.

1665
01:57:33,464 --> 01:57:34,839
The window.

1666
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,311
All right, Colorado.

1667
01:57:56,570 --> 01:58:00,031
- In here, Señor Chance.
- They've gone.

1668
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:02,450
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

1669
01:58:02,618 --> 01:58:05,870
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1670
01:58:08,999 --> 01:58:10,667
They've gone all right.

1671
01:58:12,002 --> 01:58:13,753
We gonna go after them?

1672
01:58:15,047 --> 01:58:21,344
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1673
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:23,179
You ought to remember that.

1674
01:58:23,347 --> 01:58:24,973
You thought it was funny.

1675
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,850
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

1676
01:58:28,269 --> 01:58:29,560
I didn't think.

1677
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:32,021
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

1678
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:34,899
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1679
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:37,235
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1680
01:58:37,403 --> 01:58:39,570
He sent them over there, all right.

1681
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:42,865
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do too.

1682
01:58:44,243 --> 01:58:46,202
That's why they're not happy about it.

1683
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:49,706
- What're you gonna do?
- It's what Burdette'll do.

1684
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:52,959
Carlos. Get ahold of Burdette.

1685
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:56,504
I don't care how.
Tell him I wanna talk to him.

1686
01:58:56,672 --> 01:59:00,216
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I wanna talk to him.

1687
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:02,385
We'll be at the jail.

1688
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:10,685
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1689
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:17,567
Come on, Colorado.

1690
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:20,028
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1691
01:59:49,892 --> 01:59:52,101
Señor Chance. It's me, Carlos.

1692
01:59:56,774 --> 01:59:58,608
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1693
01:59:58,776 --> 02:00:00,568
He say he don't wanna talk to you.

1694
02:00:00,736 --> 02:00:03,571
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1695
02:00:03,739 --> 02:00:05,782
- A trade?
- Dude for Joe.

1696
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:07,867
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

1697
02:00:08,035 --> 02:00:10,036
- The... What you call...?
- Warehouse?

1698
02:00:10,204 --> 02:00:12,288
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1699
02:00:12,456 --> 02:00:16,000
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1700
02:00:16,168 --> 02:00:17,835
He said to let him know.

1701
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:24,634
Tell him we'll be there.

1702
02:00:24,802 --> 02:00:27,220
Chance! You're crazy! You can't do that!

1703
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:30,556
- Not even if Dude was your own brother.
- What can I do?

1704
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:34,102
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

1705
02:00:34,269 --> 02:00:37,021
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1706
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:40,066
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1707
02:00:40,234 --> 02:00:42,152
I'd like to add my two
cents worth, sheriff.

1708
02:00:42,153 --> 02:00:44,070
Go ahead.

1709
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:46,781
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1710
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:49,242
Let's say we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1711
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:52,203
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

1712
02:00:52,371 --> 02:00:56,332
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

1713
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,834
The brakes'll be off then.

1714
02:00:58,001 --> 02:01:00,336
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1715
02:01:00,504 --> 02:01:01,879
You're right, Colorado.

1716
02:01:02,798 --> 02:01:04,882
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

1717
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:07,009
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1718
02:01:07,261 --> 02:01:08,803
- I'm not worried.
- Me neither.

1719
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:11,013
You'll just wait for the marshal to come.

1720
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:13,891
- He's still gonna want you and Dude.
- I'd say so.

1721
02:01:14,059 --> 02:01:16,727
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

1722
02:01:16,895 --> 02:01:20,022
When you make the trade then
Burdette's gonna get the both of you.

1723
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:21,899
After a little argument.

1724
02:01:22,067 --> 02:01:25,695
- But why at all? Why the both of you?
- Dude ought to have a chance.

1725
02:01:25,863 --> 02:01:28,573
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1726
02:01:28,907 --> 02:01:30,158
Will he?

1727
02:01:30,993 --> 02:01:32,869
You're gonna have me crying.

1728
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:37,874
Fellow's gotta be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

1729
02:01:40,002 --> 02:01:41,377
Go ahead, Carlos.

1730
02:01:57,478 --> 02:01:58,853
Well...

1731
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:01,397
Burdette's here.

1732
02:02:04,318 --> 02:02:05,818
About time to go.

1733
02:02:06,153 --> 02:02:08,738
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

1734
02:02:08,906 --> 02:02:10,072
Look out here.

1735
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:13,367
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1736
02:02:13,577 --> 02:02:17,371
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

1737
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:19,582
Besides, you're not going.

1738
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:22,919
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1739
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:24,629
I'm going along now.

1740
02:02:24,796 --> 02:02:26,047
Why?

1741
02:02:26,882 --> 02:02:28,883
Let's just say I'd like a closer look.

1742
02:02:32,513 --> 02:02:35,306
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1743
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:38,351
Why? Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why.

1744
02:02:39,019 --> 02:02:40,144
I'll give you one.

1745
02:02:40,312 --> 02:02:44,273
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

1746
02:02:44,441 --> 02:02:47,860
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

1747
02:02:48,445 --> 02:02:50,780
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1748
02:02:51,615 --> 02:02:54,742
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1749
02:02:55,577 --> 02:02:58,579
Well, you give me a reason.

1750
02:03:02,501 --> 02:03:07,797
Now, do you want that I should bring
Joe out, or you wanna do that yourself?

1751
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:09,882
Bring him out.

1752
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:20,017
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1753
02:03:20,978 --> 02:03:22,395
Yeah.

1754
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:31,153
I told you I'd get out of here.

1755
02:03:31,697 --> 02:03:35,032
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

1756
02:03:35,993 --> 02:03:37,618
See you, Stumpy.

1757
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:44,584
See you.

1758
02:04:36,762 --> 02:04:38,387
That's far enough, Joe.

1759
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:45,102
Through the barn.

1760
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:01,577
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1761
02:05:24,935 --> 02:05:26,560
You want a closer look?

1762
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:29,271
This is close enough.

1763
02:05:29,773 --> 02:05:32,942
Take that window.
Watch Joe.

1764
02:05:50,961 --> 02:05:52,294
Burdette!

1765
02:05:55,549 --> 02:05:56,882
Burdette!

1766
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:58,968
Nathan Burdette!

1767
02:06:04,641 --> 02:06:07,351
We're ready. Joe's here.

1768
02:06:07,811 --> 02:06:09,437
We're ready too.

1769
02:06:10,522 --> 02:06:11,647
Start Dude.

1770
02:06:12,607 --> 02:06:14,316
I'll start Joe.

1771
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:15,735
Go ahead.

1772
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:21,490
All right, Joe.

1773
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:27,455
You can start walking very slow.

1774
02:06:29,166 --> 02:06:31,292
And stop if I say stop...

1775
02:06:32,627 --> 02:06:33,919
...or I'll stop you.

1776
02:06:35,005 --> 02:06:36,338
Bring him out.

1777
02:06:41,303 --> 02:06:42,595
Go ahead.

1778
02:06:43,346 --> 02:06:44,638
Slow.

1779
02:07:26,389 --> 02:07:27,515
Look out!

1780
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:46,575
You want me to go help Dude?

1781
02:07:46,743 --> 02:07:48,661
He'll take Joe all right.

1782
02:07:50,539 --> 02:07:52,706
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1783
02:07:53,583 --> 02:07:54,750
He'll take him.

1784
02:08:00,465 --> 02:08:02,007
You're right. He did.

1785
02:08:03,218 --> 02:08:06,262
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1786
02:08:06,888 --> 02:08:08,597
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1787
02:08:08,765 --> 02:08:10,641
Stay right where you are.

1788
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,101
We'll throw you a gun.

1789
02:08:12,269 --> 02:08:13,853
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1790
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:29,201
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1791
02:08:29,995 --> 02:08:32,204
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1792
02:09:05,488 --> 02:09:07,156
That ought to start something.

1793
02:09:08,116 --> 02:09:09,116
It will.

1794
02:09:12,037 --> 02:09:13,329
On your left!

1795
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:18,918
Two of them made it to that shack.

1796
02:09:19,169 --> 02:09:22,504
If they get across that creek, we'll be
in bad shape. They'll get behind us.

1797
02:09:22,672 --> 02:09:24,965
I don't know how
we're gonna stop them from here.

1798
02:09:30,972 --> 02:09:32,306
Is that who I think it is?

1799
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:33,682
Old Stumpy.

1800
02:09:34,225 --> 02:09:35,935
The fellow I left behind.

1801
02:09:37,062 --> 02:09:39,563
Hey, Señor Chance.
Don't shoot, it's me.

1802
02:09:39,731 --> 02:09:41,649
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1803
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:44,693
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them, señor.

1804
02:09:44,861 --> 02:09:46,362
Who'll turn up next?

1805
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,530
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

1806
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:54,286
Chance, Stumpy's sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1807
02:09:55,372 --> 02:09:56,705
I go tell him, señor.

1808
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,793
You stay here. I'll go get him.
Give me those shells.

1809
02:10:27,195 --> 02:10:29,405
Stumpy, get out of there.

1810
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:32,825
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1811
02:10:32,993 --> 02:10:34,576
You got a good seat, all right.

1812
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:36,745
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1813
02:10:37,038 --> 02:10:38,747
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1814
02:10:39,165 --> 02:10:41,041
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1815
02:10:41,376 --> 02:10:44,920
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1816
02:11:02,605 --> 02:11:04,648
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1817
02:11:04,816 --> 02:11:07,401
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

1818
02:11:08,862 --> 02:11:10,612
I brung us some dynamite.

1819
02:11:11,197 --> 02:11:12,656
That's a good idea.

1820
02:11:12,824 --> 02:11:15,200
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1821
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:21,331
Can you shoot
as good as you say you can?

1822
02:11:21,499 --> 02:11:23,917
- Can you throw?
- Near as far as you can shoot.

1823
02:11:24,085 --> 02:11:26,211
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1824
02:11:30,216 --> 02:11:31,467
Dude!

1825
02:11:32,343 --> 02:11:33,469
Over here.

1826
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:35,888
Get ready.

1827
02:11:36,056 --> 02:11:37,431
Let her go!

1828
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:45,606
That was a good one.

1829
02:11:46,691 --> 02:11:48,192
Oh, stop cackling.

1830
02:11:48,693 --> 02:11:50,861
Get one a little farther out there.

1831
02:11:51,029 --> 02:11:52,529
There you go again!

1832
02:11:53,323 --> 02:11:55,991
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

1833
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,326
I'd throw them myself.

1834
02:11:57,494 --> 02:11:59,912
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1835
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,413
Let her go.

1836
02:12:06,544 --> 02:12:09,254
Hey, Dude, how do you like them apples?

1837
02:12:09,422 --> 02:12:10,839
Hey, that's all right.

1838
02:12:11,007 --> 02:12:12,132
Throw one for me.

1839
02:12:12,675 --> 02:12:14,676
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1840
02:12:14,844 --> 02:12:17,096
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1841
02:12:17,263 --> 02:12:18,347
Throw it!

1842
02:12:18,515 --> 02:12:20,015
Here you are, Dude.

1843
02:12:26,106 --> 02:12:27,606
Took you two.

1844
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:29,608
I didn't allow for the wind.

1845
02:12:29,776 --> 02:12:31,944
Can't you throw them any farther?

1846
02:12:32,112 --> 02:12:34,363
I can if you wanna blow
the whole place down.

1847
02:12:34,531 --> 02:12:37,407
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1848
02:12:46,126 --> 02:12:48,168
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1849
02:12:48,545 --> 02:12:50,879
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

1850
02:12:51,047 --> 02:12:52,256
Look at them quit!

1851
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:10,399
Sure is quiet out there.

1852
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:11,733
Did you find anything?

1853
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:15,904
There isn't a Burdette man left in town
outside of those who got locked up.

1854
02:13:16,072 --> 02:13:18,699
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1855
02:13:18,867 --> 02:13:21,118
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1856
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:24,204
What do you wanna do about them?

1857
02:13:24,372 --> 02:13:26,915
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

1858
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:29,710
- We'll wait for the marshal.
- Wait for the marshal?

1859
02:13:29,878 --> 02:13:33,463
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

1860
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:36,633
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

1861
02:13:36,801 --> 02:13:37,885
And that's a question.

1862
02:13:38,052 --> 02:13:40,721
I'm fed up feeding them.
I ain't gonna watch them neither.

1863
02:13:40,889 --> 02:13:43,849
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

1864
02:13:44,017 --> 02:13:46,476
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

1865
02:13:46,644 --> 02:13:49,271
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1866
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:51,440
I'll watch them for you
if you wanna go out.

1867
02:13:51,608 --> 02:13:53,108
- Would you?
- Sure.

1868
02:13:53,276 --> 02:13:56,653
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1869
02:13:56,821 --> 02:13:57,988
I don't think it would.

1870
02:13:58,448 --> 02:14:02,284
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me neither.

1871
02:14:02,452 --> 02:14:04,036
I don't think it would.

1872
02:14:04,954 --> 02:14:06,246
Well, should I go?

1873
02:14:06,497 --> 02:14:07,539
Go ahead.

1874
02:14:07,999 --> 02:14:09,124
Go ahead.

1875
02:14:09,292 --> 02:14:11,210
- You ain't gonna give me an argument?
- No.

1876
02:14:11,377 --> 02:14:13,128
Don't care whether I go or not.

1877
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:27,726
- Chance.
- Yeah?

1878
02:14:27,894 --> 02:14:29,811
Have you seen that girl yet?

1879
02:14:30,688 --> 02:14:32,981
I said, have you seen that girl yet?

1880
02:14:33,733 --> 02:14:35,317
No, I...

1881
02:14:35,818 --> 02:14:36,818
The job.

1882
02:14:38,029 --> 02:14:39,404
Didn't have time.

1883
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,825
Well, the Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1884
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,494
Should be leaving soon.

1885
02:14:45,662 --> 02:14:47,829
- You mean she's going on it?
- I don't know.

1886
02:14:47,997 --> 02:14:49,915
I don't think you do either.

1887
02:14:50,083 --> 02:14:52,000
But if it was me, I'd find out.

1888
02:14:52,168 --> 02:14:54,586
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

1889
02:14:55,171 --> 02:14:57,506
She might be leaving and she might not.

1890
02:14:58,132 --> 02:15:00,217
She might need help making up her mind.

1891
02:15:00,385 --> 02:15:01,927
But you're the expert.

1892
02:15:02,095 --> 02:15:04,680
Me, I don't know anything about women.

1893
02:15:05,390 --> 02:15:08,475
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

1894
02:15:12,563 --> 02:15:14,064
Well, a man forgets.

1895
02:15:15,358 --> 02:15:17,276
Sometimes...

1896
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:20,487
Sometimes it isn't easy.

1897
02:15:22,532 --> 02:15:25,534
Something happens, he just forgets.

1898
02:15:27,161 --> 02:15:30,414
In case you're interested, I have.

1899
02:15:31,291 --> 02:15:32,708
I don't even want a drink.

1900
02:15:34,127 --> 02:15:35,544
It's about time.

1901
02:15:36,129 --> 02:15:38,547
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

1902
02:15:38,715 --> 02:15:41,883
If you wanna jump in,
I'll take care of you.

1903
02:15:42,885 --> 02:15:45,053
What is this now?
You're gonna take care of him.

1904
02:15:45,221 --> 02:15:47,472
- Tell me about it.
- Sheriff's got himself a girl.

1905
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:48,682
Shut up.

1906
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:52,644
We ain't gonna go through that again?
You gonna do the same thing Dude done?

1907
02:15:52,812 --> 02:15:55,897
- Keep still.
- Why don't somebody tell me these things?

1908
02:15:56,065 --> 02:15:59,067
- Where you going? Where you going?
- Let him go, Stumpy.

1909
02:16:01,321 --> 02:16:03,613
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

1910
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:05,991
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

1911
02:16:06,284 --> 02:16:08,994
- She got him on the run?
- She sure has.

1912
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:11,330
I can just see him.

1913
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:13,415
Laying down the law to her.

1914
02:16:13,583 --> 02:16:15,959
"I told you to get back in there!"

1915
02:16:16,627 --> 02:16:19,421
And then getting told off hisself.

1916
02:16:25,762 --> 02:16:28,096
Señor Chance.
Everything is all right?

1917
02:16:28,264 --> 02:16:30,682
- I am so happy.
- Thank you, Consuelo.

1918
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:32,309
You look for the girl?

1919
02:16:32,477 --> 02:16:33,769
She's in there.

1920
02:16:34,604 --> 02:16:36,897
"No got time."

1921
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:45,030
Hi, John T.

1922
02:16:45,782 --> 02:16:48,450
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

1923
02:16:50,912 --> 02:16:52,245
There.

1924
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:57,125
Well, it's all over, isn't it, John T.?

1925
02:16:57,293 --> 02:16:58,794
Where'd you get those things?

1926
02:17:00,004 --> 02:17:01,922
I wore them the last place I worked.

1927
02:17:03,633 --> 02:17:06,134
Well, why are you wearing them now?

1928
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,261
Tonight's a big night.

1929
02:17:08,429 --> 02:17:10,806
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

1930
02:17:10,973 --> 02:17:12,140
I'm gonna do a song.

1931
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:14,476
You need a rig like that to sing?

1932
02:17:14,977 --> 02:17:16,478
You haven't heard me sing.

1933
02:17:16,646 --> 02:17:20,482
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

1934
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:23,026
But you don't like them.

1935
02:17:23,194 --> 02:17:26,321
- I didn't say that.
- You don't want me to wear them.

1936
02:17:26,489 --> 02:17:27,948
I didn't say that either.

1937
02:17:28,116 --> 02:17:31,952
- Is it because they show so much of me?
- They certainly do that.

1938
02:17:33,996 --> 02:17:37,165
You're a stubborn, stubborn man, John T.

1939
02:17:38,876 --> 02:17:41,169
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

1940
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:43,672
And other times...

1941
02:17:44,674 --> 02:17:47,843
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

1942
02:17:48,094 --> 02:17:49,511
You like what you see.

1943
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:52,597
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

1944
02:17:53,266 --> 02:17:56,685
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

1945
02:17:57,728 --> 02:17:59,563
And I haven't helped much.

1946
02:18:00,773 --> 02:18:04,943
I wore these before I met you.
I wanted you to know it.

1947
02:18:05,528 --> 02:18:08,071
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

1948
02:18:08,781 --> 02:18:13,368
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

1949
02:18:14,036 --> 02:18:15,537
But it didn't work.

1950
02:18:16,205 --> 02:18:17,873
You didn't even get mad.

1951
02:18:21,502 --> 02:18:24,421
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

1952
02:18:25,089 --> 02:18:28,884
That I'd know, but I don't know.

1953
02:18:30,052 --> 02:18:32,095
So you're gonna have to talk.

1954
02:18:33,181 --> 02:18:36,057
I'm hard to get, John T.

1955
02:18:36,225 --> 02:18:38,143
You're gonna have to say you want me.

1956
02:18:38,311 --> 02:18:40,896
- Where you going?
- Downstairs.

1957
02:18:41,063 --> 02:18:42,397
You better not.

1958
02:18:43,107 --> 02:18:44,900
Why had I better not?

1959
02:18:45,151 --> 02:18:46,485
Because I'm still sheriff.

1960
02:18:46,652 --> 02:18:49,404
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

1961
02:18:53,910 --> 02:18:55,285
John T.

1962
02:18:57,663 --> 02:19:00,373
I've waited so long for you to say that.

1963
02:19:01,042 --> 02:19:02,584
I thought you were never...

1964
02:19:02,752 --> 02:19:04,920
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

1965
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:07,255
Just when I think
you're gonna say one thing...

1966
02:19:07,423 --> 02:19:10,509
Get those darn things off.
I'll wait outside.

1967
02:19:10,676 --> 02:19:13,845
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

1968
02:19:14,597 --> 02:19:16,431
Besides I want you to stay here...

1969
02:19:17,141 --> 02:19:19,643
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

1970
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:22,187
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

1971
02:19:22,772 --> 02:19:24,773
What I had to go through!

1972
02:19:25,149 --> 02:19:28,610
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

1973
02:19:28,778 --> 02:19:32,239
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never gonna say it.

1974
02:19:32,406 --> 02:19:35,116
- Say what?
- That you loved me.

1975
02:19:35,284 --> 02:19:37,077
I said I'd arrest you.

1976
02:19:37,245 --> 02:19:40,956
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

1977
02:19:41,332 --> 02:19:44,209
Oh, we're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

1978
02:19:44,377 --> 02:19:46,461
Me, I just talk all the time.

1979
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:48,463
You most certainly do.

1980
02:19:48,631 --> 02:19:51,341
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

1981
02:19:51,509 --> 02:19:53,885
Either that or start talking too.

1982
02:19:56,138 --> 02:19:57,806
Tell me something.

1983
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:02,060
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

1984
02:20:02,562 --> 02:20:05,689
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

1985
02:20:05,856 --> 02:20:07,440
Oh, I like that.

1986
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,818
You're getting better already.

1987
02:20:09,986 --> 02:20:13,321
Shall I...? Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

1988
02:20:28,254 --> 02:20:30,256
Do you think I'll ever
get to be a sheriff?

1989
02:20:30,257 --> 02:20:32,257
Not unless you mind
your own business.

1990
02:20:59,118 --> 02:21:01,119
