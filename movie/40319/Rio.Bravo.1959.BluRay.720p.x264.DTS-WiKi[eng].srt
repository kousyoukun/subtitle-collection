1
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:45,019
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,897
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.

3
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,483
Now what're you going to do, Sheriff?

4
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,411
You can do just about what you want.

5
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:06,583
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,044
No.

7
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,839
Give me a hand.

8
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,183
- What is all this?
- Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,353
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,939
Who the devil do you think you're ordering
around here?

11
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:14,400
First Burdette's men stop me
and now you stand there and try...

12
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,030
- Say, seems like I ought to know you.
- Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,491
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,036
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,289
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachin?

16
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:31,376
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachon.

17
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,379
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,966
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,717
You know what borrachon means?

20
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,761
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:43,388
It means drunk.

22
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:46,975
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me "Dude."

23
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,853
Now are you going
to tell your men or do I?

24
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,146
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:57,652 --> 00:06:59,904
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:01,698
Pass the word.

27
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:35,732
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:39,068
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:41,362
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:43,114
- Pat, I will tell you.
- What?

31
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:45,658
- Stop your wagons.
- I give up.

32
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:53,583
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,628
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,422
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:02,800
Listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:08:02,884 --> 00:08:04,969
- Now, will you please...
- Hey, Chance!

37
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:08,640
What do you want to do about this outfit?
Do you want to take their guns?

38
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,308
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,727
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:15,438
- Where'd you take him on?
- Fort Worth.

41
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:18,191
- What does he do?
- I speak English, Sheriff...

42
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,193
...if you want to ask me.

43
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,824
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:28,284
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,370
Pretty young for that, aren't you?

46
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,956
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?

47
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:35,834
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

48
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,126
Rocky Ryan?

49
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:38,795
That's his boy.

50
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,548
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

51
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:44,717
He better be, packing a pair of guns.

52
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:49,681
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

53
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:51,558
I could let you have them both.

54
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,726
They wouldn't do me too much good.

55
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:56,813
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

56
00:08:57,021 --> 00:09:00,692
- Stumpy, didn't I tell...
- I know. I'm going. I'm going.

57
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,322
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

58
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:09,242
Thanks, Sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

59
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,119
Well, then don't start any.

60
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,621
I won't, unless I tell you first.

61
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,540
That's good enough.

62
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:18,293
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

63
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,044
I ought to do just that.

64
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:22,714
- What?
- I'm just guessing, you understand.

65
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,884
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble here.

66
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,302
You're guessing right.

67
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,264
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

68
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,850
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

69
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,226
No, I wouldn't.

70
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,645
They could put them over there
by the creek.

71
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,689
Near the Burdette warehouse.

72
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:42,859
If it's going to blow
that's just as good a place as any.

73
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,611
Show them the way, Dude.

74
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,529
You can go along, Colorado.

75
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,199
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

76
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,368
Go ahead.

77
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,262
Let's get out of the middle of the street.

78
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:17,810
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

79
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,731
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

80
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,818
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

81
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:29,531
- Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
- That's right.

82
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:32,075
What are you holding them for?

83
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:35,411
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

84
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,997
- Murder?
- No other word for it.

85
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,042
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

86
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,294
What does Nathan say about this?

87
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:46,631
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

88
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,049
You saw part of it.

89
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:53,388
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

90
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,517
There are men over there watching us.

91
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,060
They're his.

92
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:02,188
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

93
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,982
Who you got helping you?

94
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:06,943
You met half of them.

95
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,989
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

96
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,658
Stumpy. You know him.

97
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,703
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

98
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,124
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

99
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,917
That's what I got.

100
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:28,173
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

101
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,343
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

102
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:34,470
Guess I better see they did it.

103
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:36,097
I'll see you later.

104
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,488
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

105
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,156
You don't look so good.

106
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,824
I feel worse.

107
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,035
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

108
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,661
I thought you would.

109
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,331
Got some in here. Cold.

110
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:03,458
Just as long as it's beer.

111
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:12,467
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

112
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,763
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

113
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:21,226
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

114
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,560
You'd be in trouble?

115
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,729
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

116
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,731
Don't you never think of me?

117
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,609
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

118
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:32,779
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

119
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:35,156
I told you why I want you back in there...

120
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,743
...and you're going to stay there
with that cage locked when I'm not here.

121
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,411
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

122
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,163
Those windows, did you fix them?

123
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,582
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

124
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,209
Nothing could get in here.

125
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,837
- Not even some fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

126
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,214
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

127
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:55,760
Five, six days breathing the same air
as Burdette might make a killer out of me.

128
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,221
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

129
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,599
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

130
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:04,018
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

131
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:07,188
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

132
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:09,816
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

133
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,609
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

134
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:14,779
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

135
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:18,032
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

136
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,536
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

137
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,913
What do you want?

138
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:26,875
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

139
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,961
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

140
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,173
How you holding up, borrachon?

141
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,216
Got the shakes yet?

142
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:39,971
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

143
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:43,141
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

144
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,396
- Chance, you going to let him do that?
- I'll do better than that.

145
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,858
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

146
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:59,115
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

147
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:03,161
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

148
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,539
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him to sleep in it.

149
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,082
Want another beer?

150
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,627
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

151
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,213
No, it wasn't wasted, except I missed him.

152
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:16,674
- I don't need any more.
- Hey, in the jail.

153
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:23,348
That's far enough. What do you want?

154
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,559
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.

155
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:30,188
- You expecting a package?
- Be right out.

156
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,815
- Stumpy?
- Yeah?

157
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,276
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

158
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,655
If you don't come back,
me and Joe will have us a good cry.

159
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,740
Just keep that door locked.

160
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,702
- Thanks for your trouble.
- No trouble at all.

161
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,163
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.

162
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:51,084
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

163
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,418
Yeah.

164
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:55,463
There's another one over by the church.

165
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,132
Any use in arresting them?

166
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,677
For just standing around?

167
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,929
All they'd do is get another one.

168
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,515
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

169
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:09,644
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

170
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,271
Remember that.

171
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,945
Senor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for...

172
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:22,282
- What you have here?
- The package you've been waiting for.

173
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,492
Just in time.

174
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:27,912
- Carlos! Where you are?
- I'm over here.

175
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,747
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

176
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:32,417
If you break the dishes,
you'll see what happens.

177
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,712
Every day is the same thing... Carlos.
Oh Senor Chance.

178
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
I just ask Carlos if he's...

179
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:40,383
Carlos, what is wrong?

180
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,636
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

181
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,890
- What have you been doing?
- What have I been doing?

182
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:50,518
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

183
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:52,103
We have important business.

184
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,439
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

185
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,316
Consuelo, look at me.

186
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,525
Am I fat?

187
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,653
- I did not say you are fat.
- Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

188
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:02,447
You already say too much.

189
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,949
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

190
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,201
Come.

191
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:14,834
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

192
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,503
I'm going to see.

193
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,005
You take chances, my friend.

194
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:20,465
Because I know woman.

195
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,800
If she will be mad or she will be sorry.

196
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:25,512
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

197
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,223
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

198
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,183
You do not have women.

199
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,809
So you do not know.

200
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,771
But me, Carlos Remonte, I know.

201
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:38,608
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

202
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:42,821
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

203
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,867
If I had bought these myself,
everyone in town would have known.

204
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:53,456
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

205
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,128
You see?

206
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,674
Are they not beautiful?

207
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,844
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

208
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:07,846
You sure you want me to do that?

209
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,097
No.

210
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:12,141
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

211
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,270
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

212
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:20,108
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

213
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,779
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:29,701
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

215
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:32,370
- Didn't you come in on the stage?
- That's right.

216
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,038
Why aren't you on it?

217
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:37,167
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

218
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,336
Chihuahua, I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

219
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,213
The stage, she did not go.

220
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:43,506
Why?

221
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,050
- Something happened with the wheel.
- Where's Jake?

222
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:49,012
Near the corral.
He must fix the wheel before he can leave.

223
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:50,513
That's just fine.

224
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,894
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.

225
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,073
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?

226
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:53,493
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

227
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,328
That ain't no kind of answer.

228
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,914
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

229
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,458
Your guess is as good as mine.

230
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,544
What I want to know is when.

231
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,421
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

232
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,309
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

233
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,186
I'm full of beer.

234
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:23,147
It doesn't do any good.

235
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:26,442
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

236
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,949
Stumpy.

237
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,703
We're going to take a turn
around the town.

238
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,998
- You be all right?
- 'Course I'll be all right.

239
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,958
Then get in there where you belong.

240
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,669
I'm going. But you remember one thing:

241
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,339
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

242
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,925
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

243
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,260
We'll holler.

244
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,645
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

245
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:03,938
Usually do.

246
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:07,984
Don't want to do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

247
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,611
Aren't we?

248
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:13,865
I just can't take it sitting in there.

249
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,242
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

250
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,370
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

251
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,123
Think you invented the hangover.

252
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:25,251
I could sure take out a patent for this one.

253
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,131
Take that side.

254
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:07,585
Good evening.

255
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,915
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

256
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,042
Don't shoot, Sheriff.

257
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,002
Just getting a little air.

258
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:06,663
I'm getting jumpy.

259
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:09,332
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

260
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:12,377
- Get back over there where you belong.
- Yes, Papa.

261
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,352
- Carlos.
- Senor Chance. I been looking for you.

262
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:31,563
- It is very bad.
- What's wrong?

263
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,815
- Your friend Senor Wheeler.
- What about him?

264
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:37,735
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

265
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,321
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

266
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:43,741
He say why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.

267
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,535
He's right.

268
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:48,329
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

269
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:50,290
- You tell him.
- Is he in there?

270
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:51,583
Si, I think.

271
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,503
Chance, he's over there.

272
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:57,881
The kings full.

273
00:23:58,089 --> 00:23:59,966
That's good. Beats me.

274
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,143
Spare a minute, Pat?

275
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:11,644
Good evening, Sheriff.

276
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:12,896
Deal me out.

277
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,063
Evening.

278
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,284
You two know each other.

279
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:27,452
Yeah.

280
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:29,245
No thanks, Carlos.

281
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:31,664
I've been wanting to talk to you.

282
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:33,541
You've been talking too much.

283
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,336
- What do you mean "talking too much"?
- Anybody that...

284
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,965
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

285
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:44,052
Is that why you haven't asked for
any deputies?

286
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:47,931
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

287
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:51,601
I was talking about why you haven't
asked for any new deputies.

288
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:52,936
You could get some.

289
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:55,063
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

290
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:57,482
Suppose I got them, what would I have?

291
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:59,484
Some well-meaning amateurs.

292
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,403
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

293
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:06,074
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

294
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:09,828
Only things they're worried
about is earning their pay.

295
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,166
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

296
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,585
A lot of people would get hurt.

297
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:19,546
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

298
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,257
He isn't worth one of those
that would get killed.

299
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,092
Then what are you going to do?

300
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:27,178
All you got for help is that old man
down at the jail and this...

301
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:29,722
Borrachon is the name,
Mr. Wheeler.

302
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:33,017
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

303
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:39,065
Wasn't good, Pat.

304
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,025
Let's sit down.

305
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:42,652
Yeah, I know.

306
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:44,737
I shouldn't have said it.

307
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,739
I meant nothing by it.

308
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:49,784
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

309
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:52,745
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

310
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:54,873
...without something to hold him up.

311
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:56,749
How long you been coming here?

312
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,334
Going on two years.

313
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:02,213
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

314
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:03,798
Dude was good.

315
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,341
He was my deputy.

316
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:07,635
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

317
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,013
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

318
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,475
A girl. Just a girl
that came through on the stage.

319
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,562
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

320
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:19,939
I tried and he damn near killed me.

321
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,859
Anyway, he was hooked.

322
00:26:23,193 --> 00:26:24,402
Went away with her.

323
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:27,071
Six months later
he came back without her.

324
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:30,533
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachon.

325
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,660
- That's Spanish for...
- I know.

326
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:34,329
He told me.

327
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:38,124
So, for two years he's been drinking...

328
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,755
...all he could buy, or somebody would buy
for him until last night.

329
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:46,674
And how long do you think that'll last?

330
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:48,009
I don't know.

331
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,804
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him.

332
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:54,891
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

333
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:59,020
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.

334
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:02,774
- Why don't you let me help you?
- You're not good enough.

335
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,526
I don't know! I'm as good...

336
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:07,904
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

337
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:09,781
No thanks, you keep out of it.

338
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:10,949
That's an idea.

339
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,785
- What?
- Ryan. "Colorado," you call him.

340
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:16,830
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

341
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,500
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

342
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:22,919
We'll see what he says.

343
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,190
Good evening, Sheriff.

344
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:45,692
Any luck, kid?

345
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,611
- It's a pretty fast game.
- Son, I...

346
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:52,157
...asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.

347
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,034
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

348
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,662
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?

349
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,038
That's right.

350
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,541
I told him you were one of the best.

351
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:08,631
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

352
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:10,758
That's minding my own business.

353
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:12,886
No offense, Sheriff.

354
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:14,929
No offense.

355
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:22,937
I never expected that.

356
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:24,939
He showed good sense.

357
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,692
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you...

358
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,903
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

359
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:31,529
I appreciate it.

360
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,199
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

361
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:38,328
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

362
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,958
Enough for me for a while.

363
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:45,335
You leaving?

364
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,421
- Maybe I'll have some luck now.
- Maybe.

365
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,507
If you play your cards right.

366
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:52,884
Hope you leave some of your luck with me.

367
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,470
I'll come back and give it to you next time.

368
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:57,055
We'll ante up.

369
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:00,350
Dude?

370
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:01,392
Yeah?

371
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,521
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

372
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,501
Hi, Sheriff.

373
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,754
I'm sorry about those pants.

374
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,965
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

375
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:34,968
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

376
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:37,512
Sure.

377
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,477
Sheriff, what is it?

378
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:48,690
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

379
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,192
Three cards short.

380
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,736
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

381
00:29:55,822 --> 00:29:57,323
Why do you tell me?

382
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:01,953
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

383
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,581
- And did you talk to him?
- He's still there.

384
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:05,999
You were leaving.

385
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:07,876
And I was a winner.

386
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,588
Is that all you've got to go on?

387
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:15,758
No. Here's a handbill...

388
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:20,555
...about a gambler they're interested in
catching up with.

389
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,265
You know him?

390
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,684
Says he had a girl with him.

391
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:29,814
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

392
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,611
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

393
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:40,116
Now, the man isn't our...

394
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,745
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

395
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,247
Yes, I could be.

396
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:50,001
As a matter of fact, I am.

397
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,590
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

398
00:30:55,673 --> 00:31:00,595
You'd better give me the money you won,
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

399
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,306
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

400
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:07,852
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

401
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,981
But I'm not going to make it that easy.

402
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:15,944
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

403
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:18,404
So, you're going to have to prove
I've got them.

404
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:21,032
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

405
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,867
- Search you?
- That's right.

406
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:25,912
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

407
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:29,582
Let's see, the cards could be in my purse...

408
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,334
...but they're not.

409
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,879
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

410
00:31:34,963 --> 00:31:38,216
- All right, all right.
- I don't wear anything like those red pants.

411
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:41,386
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

412
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,556
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

413
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,600
- That's about enough.
- You have to prove I've got those cards.

414
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:50,812
- You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
- I'm not so sure.

415
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:53,940
I think you're embarrassed.

416
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:56,234
- And if you're not...
- lf he's not...

417
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:57,402
...he ought to be.

418
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:59,279
What're you doing here?

419
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:01,489
I don't think she has the cards.

420
00:32:01,573 --> 00:32:03,783
If that's what you're looking for.

421
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,952
How do you know?

422
00:32:06,035 --> 00:32:08,371
The fellow in the checkered vest has them.

423
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,165
Why didn't you find out?

424
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:13,001
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

425
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,545
I'm telling you.
I'm going to see if he's got them.

426
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:17,130
Wait a minute.

427
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:20,425
- You want to come along?
- I do.

428
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,302
I'm interested, too.

429
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,615
Ace high straight.

430
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,201
Looks like I got the lady's luck.

431
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,496
All right, keep your hands on the table.

432
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:51,206
Right where they are.

433
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,751
Put your hands back.

434
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,294
Where they were.

435
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,392
Holdout.

436
00:33:12,268 --> 00:33:13,978
He's all yours, Sheriff.

437
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:15,355
Get up.

438
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:17,815
Get up!

439
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,237
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

440
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,781
Carlos, lock him in his room.

441
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,408
Let him out in time for the stage.

442
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:30,787
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

443
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:32,580
Thanks, Colorado.

444
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:35,500
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

445
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:49,681
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

446
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:52,183
Is that all, Sheriff?

447
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm not going to apologize,
if that's what you mean.

448
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:58,481
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

449
00:33:58,606 --> 00:33:59,858
That's right.

450
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:03,111
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

451
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:06,781
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

452
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:08,158
Made a joke of it.

453
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,869
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

454
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:14,289
Tell me, Sheriff, what should I have done?

455
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:16,416
I'd like to know.

456
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,752
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

457
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:22,172
I'd like to know what to do about it.

458
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,842
You could quit playing cards...

459
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,136
...wearing feathers.

460
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,637
No, Sheriff.

461
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:33,224
No, I'm not going to do that.

462
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,604
You see, that's what I'd do...

463
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,567
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

464
00:35:02,504 --> 00:35:04,088
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

465
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:06,132
Not since he went up the street.

466
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,218
I think that's him coming now.

467
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:23,399
Get him out of here.

468
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,158
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

469
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,371
Got him in the back.

470
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:38,081
He's dead.

471
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:44,629
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

472
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:48,258
Ain't got many friends like that.

473
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:51,386
You were smart, Colorado.

474
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:54,639
- No one's come out of the stable.
- I want to go with you.

475
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:57,475
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?

476
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,478
- Wouldn't you?
- I wouldn't have let him get shot.

477
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:03,231
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

478
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,316
Stay out, we don't need you.

479
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,611
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.

480
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,994
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

481
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:17,620
How you going in?

482
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:21,040
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

483
00:36:21,457 --> 00:36:23,918
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

484
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:25,378
No, there isn't.

485
00:36:25,461 --> 00:36:26,546
I thought so.

486
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,882
I'll let you know when I get there.

487
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,281
Chance, you all right?

488
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,716
Chance, out here.

489
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:56,052
You all right?

490
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:58,179
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

491
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:00,223
He came out the door, running fast.

492
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:02,475
- You missed him.
- I couldn't get a good shot.

493
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,104
- Might've winged him.
- Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

494
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:07,605
He hasn't got away yet...

495
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:10,483
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

496
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,902
- He's still in there.
- How do you know?

497
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:14,988
Can see both doors from here.

498
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:16,948
And there ain't any others.

499
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,159
I'm an expert on saloons.

500
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:22,453
- Get a chance to see who he was?
- No, but we'll know.

501
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:26,499
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

502
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,586
You figure we're going in there after him?

503
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:31,421
- Aren't we?
- We used to.

504
00:38:32,297 --> 00:38:34,924
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

505
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,177
Maybe more.

506
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:41,347
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

507
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:42,640
I'd like to try...

508
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:44,475
You'd like to try what?

509
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:47,729
I been going in the back door.

510
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:50,565
They haven't been letting me in the front.

511
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,735
Think you're good enough?

512
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,403
I'd like to find out.

513
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,905
So would I.

514
00:38:57,697 --> 00:39:00,241
I'll let you know when I get around back.

515
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,430
Begin with you, Charlie.

516
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:07,350
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

517
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,103
Pick it up by the barrel.

518
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:11,813
Easy.

519
00:40:11,938 --> 00:40:15,733
Thought you were going to ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

520
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:17,152
Shotgun first.

521
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:19,070
Set it down.

522
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,739
Back up.

523
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:29,873
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

524
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:41,259
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not going to tell you twice.

525
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:45,346
You're going to stand up
and stand real still.

526
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:47,265
Now!

527
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:56,816
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

528
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:58,902
...drop them and step back.

529
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:02,614
Come on.

530
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:12,457
There's no reason for you to move, Charlie.

531
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,629
What's this all about?

532
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:20,298
We're looking for a man that ran in here.

533
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:22,008
Nobody's run in here.

534
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,260
We'll remember you said that.

535
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:28,973
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

536
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,976
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

537
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,744
Who saw a man run in here?

538
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:51,913
I did.

539
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:56,000
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

540
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,420
Clean as a whistle.

541
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:02,173
Dude, you been seeing things again.

542
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:03,967
You better have a drink.

543
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:07,178
Dude.

544
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:10,265
Maybe this'll help.

545
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:54,934
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

546
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:57,187
Kind of thought you would.

547
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,821
You want that gun, pick it up.

548
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,741
I wish you would.

549
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:17,040
Stepped in a puddle all right.

550
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,626
It's the fellow we wanted.

551
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:23,546
I guess this is his.

552
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,924
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

553
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:30,595
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

554
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:33,306
That's earning money the hard way.

555
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:38,228
Paid killer.

556
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:42,524
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

557
00:43:44,442 --> 00:43:46,945
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

558
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:48,571
Nobody paid me.

559
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:50,114
Nobody!

560
00:43:50,615 --> 00:43:53,159
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

561
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:55,203
Chance.

562
00:43:55,286 --> 00:43:57,247
I'm not going to hurt him.

563
00:43:57,455 --> 00:43:58,456
Get up!

564
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,709
You're all in it.

565
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,295
The whole lot of you.

566
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,465
You're going to get out of town.

567
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:09,843
Take your boy here with you.

568
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:13,513
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

569
00:44:14,305 --> 00:44:17,725
You can tell anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

570
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:20,103
...because they're going to earn it.

571
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,273
Charlie, I want you to...

572
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:27,944
You finished yet, Dude?

573
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:29,571
You in a hurry?

574
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:30,905
Not especially.

575
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,502
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

576
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:46,838
- Yeah, Dude, l...
- You want it back?

577
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:49,716
- Sure.
- You know how to get it?

578
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,219
Yeah.

579
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:12,071
That's all for me, Chance.

580
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:15,200
- Charlie, come here.
- Yeah, Sheriff.

581
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:16,659
You're going with us.

582
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:18,661
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

583
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,498
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

584
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:23,958
All right, back up and give him room.

585
00:45:27,837 --> 00:45:30,381
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

586
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,975
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

587
00:45:41,476 --> 00:45:43,061
Why, you're crazy!

588
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:45,480
And you are, too. What happened?

589
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:47,565
He was hiding in the loft.

590
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:48,733
Who got him?

591
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,527
Dude did. One shot.

592
00:45:51,736 --> 00:45:53,488
I wish I could've seen that.

593
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,532
I wish Wheeler could've, too.

594
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,743
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

595
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:01,830
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

596
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:04,123
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

597
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,584
You were good in there tonight.

598
00:46:07,168 --> 00:46:09,003
Good as you've ever been.

599
00:46:09,337 --> 00:46:12,090
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

600
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:16,177
They were laughing at you.
Borrachon talking big.

601
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,931
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

602
00:46:20,014 --> 00:46:22,600
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

603
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:25,311
- Listen to him.
- Don't get too cocksure.

604
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:27,355
What a stinker! Spit in his eye.

605
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:29,941
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

606
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:32,652
If he were to change, that would worry me.

607
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:37,073
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

608
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:39,784
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

609
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,705
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

610
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:46,583
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

611
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,668
I could've sure used a drink then.

612
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:51,880
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

613
00:46:51,963 --> 00:46:55,216
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

614
00:46:55,341 --> 00:46:58,469
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

615
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:02,932
Chance, nobody please you no how?

616
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:05,059
You got a light, Stumpy?

617
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:08,563
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

618
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,398
Let him in.

619
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:14,235
Come on in.

620
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,325
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

621
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:21,743
Dude did.

622
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:24,871
Thanks, Dude.

623
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:28,666
Going to bury him in the morning.

624
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,252
I've just been at the undertaker's with him.

625
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:33,755
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

626
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:35,882
I took out $60 he owed me.

627
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,134
You got yours.

628
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:40,011
How about the rest?

629
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,930
Did he owe them, too?

630
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:43,431
Probably did.

631
00:47:43,973 --> 00:47:45,934
Didn't think about that.

632
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:49,479
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

633
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:52,774
- Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?
- That's right.

634
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:54,609
Meantime, I'm broke.

635
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:58,655
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

636
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:02,283
...l'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

637
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:05,995
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

638
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:08,122
No offense again, Sheriff.

639
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,046
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

640
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:18,007
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid with a gun.

641
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:21,678
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?

642
00:48:22,303 --> 00:48:23,805
I'd say he is.

643
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:28,351
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

644
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:40,446
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I was beginning to think you didn't.

645
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,906
I wanted to talk to you.

646
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,326
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.

647
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:48,413
No, I was thinking of making one.

648
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,582
I was pretty much of a...

649
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,918
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

650
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:55,920
My only excuse is...

651
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:59,340
...I didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.

652
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,267
I'm going to have a drink. How about you?

653
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:12,604
Thanks, I'd like one.

654
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:17,609
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

655
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:20,487
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

656
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,324
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that, too?

657
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:25,909
Yes, he told me.

658
00:49:29,204 --> 00:49:31,414
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

659
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:33,333
Gets lazy.

660
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:34,876
Gets tired...

661
00:49:35,126 --> 00:49:36,961
...of selling his gun all over...

662
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:39,047
...decides to sell it in one place.

663
00:49:39,172 --> 00:49:41,132
I'd say you made a poor sale.

664
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:43,927
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

665
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,764
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

666
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:52,060
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

667
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:54,562
She gets married.

668
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:58,566
- Handbill says he was a cheat.
- He wasn't a cheat then.

669
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:02,487
That came later after his luck turned.

670
00:50:03,655 --> 00:50:05,907
It was probably my fault he cheated.

671
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:08,076
He liked to buy me things.

672
00:50:08,243 --> 00:50:10,995
- Then why did you leave him?
- I didn't.

673
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:14,582
He left me rather suddenly.

674
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:18,419
He was caught just like that man tonight...

675
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,422
...only his luck had run out.

676
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:23,049
He was shot.

677
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:25,969
You've had a rough time.

678
00:50:28,012 --> 00:50:31,057
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.

679
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,101
I liked gambling.

680
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,896
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

681
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:42,610
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

682
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:46,739
If I had known, it might have been rough.

683
00:50:46,823 --> 00:50:49,075
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

684
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,743
When did this happen?

685
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:52,996
About four months ago.

686
00:50:54,914 --> 00:50:58,168
Since then I've been working...

687
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,880
...to get enough money for stage fare.

688
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,673
You going home?

689
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:05,300
I haven't any.

690
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:06,718
Senor Chance!

691
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:09,554
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

692
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:13,057
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

693
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:16,060
But tonight, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

694
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:18,396
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

695
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,815
I don't want anybody else helping me.

696
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:24,736
This is my hotel...

697
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:27,363
...and you are a guest under my roof.

698
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:31,493
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do.

699
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:35,079
- All right, Carlos.
- What you do?

700
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:36,456
I'll sleep in the jail.

701
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:37,916
But you can't sleep...

702
00:51:37,999 --> 00:51:39,209
Bueno, senor.

703
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:41,920
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

704
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:44,839
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

705
00:51:45,006 --> 00:51:47,425
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

706
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:49,093
- One thing.
- What?

707
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:51,513
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

708
00:51:52,263 --> 00:51:54,390
- But it's not enough.
- Will you?

709
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:58,102
Bueno, senor. I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

710
00:51:58,186 --> 00:52:00,355
I don't want to meddle in your business.

711
00:52:00,438 --> 00:52:02,065
I'm going to turn in.

712
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:04,776
If I don't see you in the morning, so long.

713
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:05,944
So long.

714
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:09,197
By the way, where are you going?

715
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:12,367
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

716
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:16,496
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

717
00:52:18,206 --> 00:52:20,625
I know the sheriff that got these out.

718
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:24,712
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

719
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:29,008
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

720
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:43,231
Thanks.

721
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:24,397
Carlos!

722
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,565
Si, senor.

723
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:28,610
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?

724
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:29,944
- The girl.
- The girl?

725
00:53:30,028 --> 00:53:32,947
- That one with the feathers.
- What's she got to do with it?

726
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:34,657
She told me not to wake you.

727
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:37,035
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

728
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:39,120
Sitting outside my room in a chair?

729
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:40,246
All night long.

730
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,582
She was still there two, three minutes ago.

731
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:46,252
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you.

732
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:48,171
You can tell her...

733
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:49,839
The fool!

734
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:51,257
Tell her she's a fool?

735
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:54,260
No! I'll tell her myself.

736
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:56,137
You tell her she's a fool?

737
00:53:56,262 --> 00:53:57,805
I didn't say I was.

738
00:53:57,889 --> 00:54:01,059
He say, "Not to wake him up."

739
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:03,269
She say, "To wake him up."

740
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,355
Me, I'm in the middle. Ay, Dios.

741
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:09,609
Who is it?

742
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:11,069
It's me. The sheriff.

743
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:12,737
Just a minute.

744
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:21,037
Come on in.

745
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,334
Hi.

746
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:28,837
Did you get a good night's sleep?

747
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,754
Who? Me?

748
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,382
Yes, you. There's nobody else in the room.

749
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:35,051
Carlos had to go and talk.

750
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:39,639
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

751
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:43,393
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

752
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:44,352
Fool women.

753
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:46,688
- Didn't you hear me say that...
- I know.

754
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:49,941
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

755
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:52,694
- Why did you do it?
- You weren't supposed to know.

756
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:55,238
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

757
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:56,865
He didn't wake me up!

758
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,492
Don't blame him, that was my fault.

759
00:54:59,742 --> 00:55:02,245
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

760
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:04,664
You got some sleep, I lost some.

761
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:08,001
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

762
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:09,627
...you'd better go on.

763
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,629
I'm going to get some sleep, too.

764
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:13,715
You can't go to bed now!

765
00:55:14,215 --> 00:55:15,425
I can't?

766
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,845
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.

767
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:20,972
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

768
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:23,850
- What'd you say?
- The stage, it leaves in an hour.

769
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:26,269
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did!

770
00:55:26,895 --> 00:55:31,107
Then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

771
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:33,359
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

772
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:35,361
You're doing most of the talking.

773
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:38,072
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

774
00:55:38,156 --> 00:55:40,200
- Will you just go on and go?
- I'm going.

775
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:42,035
Then do it, don't talk any more.

776
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:44,996
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

777
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,707
So, just go on and let me get on the stage.

778
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,793
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

779
00:55:51,419 --> 00:55:53,087
I just wanted to...

780
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,758
You could have at least let me finish.

781
00:55:57,425 --> 00:56:01,304
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

782
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:04,432
I guess I talk too much.

783
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:07,727
You tell her?

784
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,104
- Tell her what?
- That she's a fool.

785
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,274
She's going on the stage?

786
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:15,777
She's going on the stage.
You make sure she does.

787
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,321
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

788
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:20,740
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

789
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:22,158
I hold you responsible.

790
00:56:22,242 --> 00:56:23,618
Responsible, me?

791
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:24,536
Yes.

792
00:56:27,997 --> 00:56:31,209
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

793
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:32,544
So I see.

794
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:36,297
There's a lot of people in town today.

795
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,258
Did you hear why?

796
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:42,929
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

797
00:56:43,054 --> 00:56:45,098
Most likely they here to watch.

798
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:48,852
If he does, they may see something.

799
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:50,937
I don't like it.

800
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,272
Neither do I.

801
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:01,781
Tom, hang your gun on the fence.
You'll pick it up when you leave.

802
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,659
Sure enough.

803
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:31,853
That's far enough.

804
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,105
I got orders to take your guns.

805
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:36,983
Suppose we don't want to give them up?

806
00:57:37,066 --> 00:57:39,861
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

807
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:43,072
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

808
00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:47,118
You won't need a gun no more
because you'd be the first man I'd get.

809
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:48,578
Come on, let's go.

810
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:51,039
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

811
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,126
Hold it, Harris!

812
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,419
He cut my reins.

813
00:57:56,503 --> 00:58:00,048
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

814
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:08,640
Now hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

815
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:10,225
Hang up your guns.

816
00:58:18,274 --> 00:58:20,860
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

817
00:58:20,944 --> 00:58:22,529
Not bad.

818
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:24,197
How does that happen?

819
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,742
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

820
00:58:28,284 --> 00:58:30,370
If you mean being sober...

821
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:33,414
...l'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

822
00:58:33,498 --> 00:58:34,791
I don't follow you.

823
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:37,460
You don't have to follow me. Matt!

824
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,880
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

825
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:44,008
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.

826
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:51,307
- You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
- All right, Mr. Burdette...

827
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:54,143
...get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

828
00:58:54,227 --> 00:58:56,104
You should enjoy it, Dude.

829
00:58:56,312 --> 00:59:00,108
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

830
00:59:20,378 --> 00:59:21,421
Stumpy!

831
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,965
Burdette and his men are coming in.

832
00:59:24,048 --> 00:59:26,676
Don't put down no red carpet for them.

833
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:29,137
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

834
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,638
You do that.

835
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,518
Good morning, Sheriff.

836
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:37,353
Hello, Burdette.

837
00:59:38,062 --> 00:59:39,814
Been expecting you.

838
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:41,941
I want to see my brother.

839
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,443
You can come in.

840
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,364
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

841
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,742
Go on across the street with the others.

842
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:52,327
Do as he says.

843
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:56,080
What are all those people doing in town?

844
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:57,790
I didn't ask.

845
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,628
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

846
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,882
But I think they're watching to see
what you're going to do.

847
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:11,888
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

848
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:15,975
Now do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?

849
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,353
See my brother.

850
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:22,524
We're coming in, Stumpy.

851
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:26,069
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

852
01:00:33,618 --> 01:00:35,745
All right, Stumpy, open up.

853
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:38,081
What's the password?

854
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:39,207
Come on.

855
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,043
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

856
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:46,005
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.

857
01:00:46,214 --> 01:00:48,675
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

858
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:50,301
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

859
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:53,930
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

860
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:55,223
Nathan.

861
01:00:55,974 --> 01:00:57,058
Joe.

862
01:00:58,226 --> 01:01:00,478
Looks like they gave you a going over.

863
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:02,146
Our friend here.

864
01:01:03,565 --> 01:01:04,482
Why?

865
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:08,153
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

866
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,946
It wasn't murder.

867
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:13,032
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

868
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:17,203
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

869
01:01:18,246 --> 01:01:21,541
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

870
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,963
You knew that already, otherwise you
wouldn't have set things up like you did.

871
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:28,673
Just what have I done?

872
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:30,466
You're a rich man, Burdette.

873
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,801
Big ranch.

874
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:34,762
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

875
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,056
And you got a brother.

876
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,642
He's no good, but he's your brother.

877
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,938
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

878
01:01:44,022 --> 01:01:45,690
I don't like that kind of talk.

879
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:48,109
- You're accusing me...
- Let's get this straight.

880
01:01:48,193 --> 01:01:49,777
You don't like it.

881
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:51,863
I don't like a lot of things.

882
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:55,700
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

883
01:01:55,783 --> 01:02:00,038
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

884
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:02,999
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

885
01:02:03,082 --> 01:02:05,251
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

886
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:09,172
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

887
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,177
What're you going to do about it?

888
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:17,472
I thought you'd get around to that.

889
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:20,600
I'm going to sit here
with your brother in my lap...

890
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,520
...until the United States Marshal
gets here.

891
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:25,688
That'll be about six days.

892
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:29,192
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

893
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:33,112
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

894
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,864
Now I'm running out of breath.

895
01:02:34,948 --> 01:02:36,908
You talk if you want to.

896
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:40,537
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

897
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:43,039
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

898
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:47,210
- You can get me out of here any...
- Shut up, Joe!

899
01:02:47,627 --> 01:02:50,421
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

900
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:55,051
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you.

901
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:58,680
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

902
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:01,391
If any trouble starts around this jail...

903
01:03:01,474 --> 01:03:05,478
...before anybody can get to you,
you're going to get accidentally shot.

904
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:08,356
I can practical guarantee that.

905
01:03:09,607 --> 01:03:12,569
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

906
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:17,365
460 acres might be little to you, Nathan.

907
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:19,784
But it was a lot of country to me.

908
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:23,872
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

909
01:03:24,247 --> 01:03:26,166
He's smarter than I thought.

910
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,295
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.

911
01:03:30,753 --> 01:03:32,380
What's the difference?

912
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:34,507
We'd all be dead by then.

913
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:37,135
You got anything else you want to say?

914
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:40,930
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

915
01:03:41,764 --> 01:03:44,142
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

916
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:47,103
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

917
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,147
I want to make that clear.

918
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,065
I'll help you make it clear.

919
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:53,860
I don't think Joe's got a friend in the world.

920
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:58,198
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

921
01:03:58,615 --> 01:04:01,034
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

922
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,329
You made it clear.

923
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:06,122
All right, Stumpy.

924
01:04:06,206 --> 01:04:08,124
- Nathan.
- Just sit tight, Joe.

925
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,210
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

926
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:13,922
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

927
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:16,841
Sometimes takes quite a spell to find out.

928
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:23,973
- He didn't have much to say, did he?
- No.

929
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:32,774
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

930
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:34,526
Anything they're going to do is...

931
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:37,111
...planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

932
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:40,615
Throwing him with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

933
01:04:40,698 --> 01:04:42,075
I never thought of that.

934
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:44,494
- What do you think will happen?
- I don't know.

935
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:46,329
You can think, can't you? Any man...

936
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:50,750
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

937
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:53,419
Be careful how you talk to me.
You hear what Joe said.

938
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,840
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

939
01:04:57,006 --> 01:05:01,010
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

940
01:05:01,553 --> 01:05:04,138
I got to fix your supper for you tonight.

941
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:10,436
Senor Chance.

942
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,021
It's me, Carlos.

943
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:13,481
Come on in.

944
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:15,066
What do you want?

945
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:16,484
I want to talk to you.

946
01:05:16,568 --> 01:05:18,027
Did the girl...

947
01:05:18,987 --> 01:05:20,655
What happened to your eye?

948
01:05:20,738 --> 01:05:22,907
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

949
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:24,868
She did that? What'd you do?

950
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:27,495
- She did not do it.
- I thought you said she did.

951
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:31,624
I say you tell me to put her on the stage.
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

952
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:34,627
- I'm a little mixed up.
- Do not talk. I tell you.

953
01:05:34,711 --> 01:05:36,504
- Okay.
- It's better if I tell you.

954
01:05:36,588 --> 01:05:40,550
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage she's ready, but she don't come.

955
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:43,052
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said, "No."

956
01:05:43,136 --> 01:05:45,805
- I go and get her, she said she don't go.
- Did she go?

957
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:48,600
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

958
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:51,686
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I said that may be.

959
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:55,273
I pick her up. And Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

960
01:05:55,356 --> 01:05:58,818
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

961
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:00,445
Did she go on the stage?

962
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:03,990
Consuelo tell me put her down.
I said, "I am responsible."

963
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:07,202
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye.

964
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:08,411
What'd you do?

965
01:06:08,495 --> 01:06:11,331
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.

966
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:15,793
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she says I tried to kill her.

967
01:06:15,877 --> 01:06:17,462
Did the girl get on the stage?

968
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:20,256
No, she did not go!
But Jake says he couldn't wait.

969
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,050
- Why?
- He says he must leave.

970
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:24,719
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

971
01:06:24,802 --> 01:06:27,847
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

972
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:31,684
Please come and tell Consuelo
what responsible means.

973
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,394
Stumpy, we're going out.

974
01:06:33,478 --> 01:06:36,689
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

975
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:46,783
The door's unlocked.

976
01:06:53,623 --> 01:06:55,124
I didn't go.

977
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,126
I can see that.

978
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:00,672
I don't know...

979
01:07:01,172 --> 01:07:04,801
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

980
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:07,846
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

981
01:07:08,847 --> 01:07:10,640
It was me saying it.

982
01:07:10,974 --> 01:07:14,269
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?

983
01:07:16,229 --> 01:07:19,023
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

984
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:20,984
Chance, John T.

985
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:22,777
"T" for trouble.

986
01:07:23,528 --> 01:07:26,281
I always make you mad, don't I, John T.?

987
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:30,368
Then, don't make me tell you why I stayed.

988
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:34,664
I won't make it any harder for you.

989
01:07:34,747 --> 01:07:37,500
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

990
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:40,420
You don't owe me a thing.

991
01:07:40,628 --> 01:07:43,131
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

992
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:46,801
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

993
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,472
No, you won't even have to tell me.

994
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:54,475
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

995
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:57,478
Is that fair, John T.?

996
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:05,445
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

997
01:08:06,988 --> 01:08:10,575
But just say something.

998
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:15,955
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

999
01:08:16,956 --> 01:08:18,333
But I am.

1000
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:21,669
That's all I wanted to hear.

1001
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:44,442
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

1002
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:47,487
It's better when two people do it.

1003
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:52,075
I've kept you long enough.

1004
01:08:52,534 --> 01:08:55,119
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

1005
01:10:58,168 --> 01:10:59,378
Hi, Chance.

1006
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:03,507
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

1007
01:11:04,008 --> 01:11:06,051
Anything happen when Burdette left?

1008
01:11:06,176 --> 01:11:07,928
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

1009
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:09,847
What was the shot when they came in?

1010
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,224
That gunslinger of his was on the prod.

1011
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:13,225
What'd he do?

1012
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:16,353
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

1013
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:18,856
Took care of that. What happened here?

1014
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:20,190
Not much.

1015
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:24,820
That tune, they been playing it all day.

1016
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:26,363
What is it?

1017
01:11:26,697 --> 01:11:29,783
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

1018
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,037
Good evening, Sheriff.

1019
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:35,247
Colorado. What do you want?

1020
01:11:35,664 --> 01:11:37,291
Just curious again.

1021
01:11:37,374 --> 01:11:39,418
How'd you come out with Burdette?

1022
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:41,462
He wanted to talk to his brother.

1023
01:11:41,545 --> 01:11:43,839
- What'd he have to say?
- Nothing.

1024
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:45,799
You mean he didn't say anything?

1025
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:47,635
Why are you so interested?

1026
01:11:47,718 --> 01:11:49,762
Because he's talking now.

1027
01:11:50,054 --> 01:11:51,555
Hear that music?

1028
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,474
He told the man to play it.

1029
01:11:54,725 --> 01:11:55,851
What is it?

1030
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,979
They call it The Deguello,
the cutthroat song.

1031
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:03,609
The Mexicans played it for the Texas boys
when they had them pent up at the Alamo.

1032
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:06,445
Played it day and night till it was all over.

1033
01:12:06,904 --> 01:12:09,031
Now do you know what he means by it?

1034
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:10,532
No quarter.

1035
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:13,160
No mercy for the losers.

1036
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:14,912
You'll be hearing a lot of it.

1037
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:17,539
I guess we made him talk after all.

1038
01:12:17,706 --> 01:12:20,292
Just thought you'd like to know, Sheriff.

1039
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:20,519
Stumpy!

1040
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:23,731
- What?
- They don't need any help with that tune.

1041
01:13:23,814 --> 01:13:26,692
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

1042
01:13:33,741 --> 01:13:36,493
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1043
01:13:38,412 --> 01:13:40,789
I watched it clear through the valley.

1044
01:13:42,499 --> 01:13:45,461
In about six days the marshal will get here.

1045
01:13:45,628 --> 01:13:47,254
That's what I figured.

1046
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:53,135
The girl wasn't on the stage.

1047
01:13:55,638 --> 01:13:57,014
I know that.

1048
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:01,018
Tell her she could stay?

1049
01:14:01,352 --> 01:14:02,561
No, she...

1050
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:06,398
Yes, I did. What about it?

1051
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:08,317
Nothing, nothing at all.

1052
01:14:08,484 --> 01:14:10,194
You were going to say something.

1053
01:14:10,277 --> 01:14:12,071
I remembered in time.

1054
01:14:13,447 --> 01:14:17,618
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1055
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:21,330
I remember you told me she was no good.

1056
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:24,625
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

1057
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,086
So, naturally I figured you're an expert.

1058
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:30,089
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1059
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:33,926
I just hope you have better luck than I had.

1060
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:40,057
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1061
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:41,976
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1062
01:14:42,059 --> 01:14:42,851
Maybe.

1063
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:44,520
But I doubt it.

1064
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:48,274
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1065
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:52,486
If you go by the hotel,
pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?

1066
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:53,862
Joe complaining?

1067
01:14:53,946 --> 01:14:55,698
Him? He didn't get no sugar.

1068
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:58,242
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

1069
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:00,369
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1070
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:04,707
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1071
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,084
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1072
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:10,963
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

1073
01:15:11,255 --> 01:15:13,549
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1074
01:15:14,425 --> 01:15:17,511
- I forgot all about them.
- Your memory is no better than mine.

1075
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:20,055
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

1076
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,808
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

1077
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:32,276
Where'd you get these?

1078
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,529
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

1079
01:15:41,785 --> 01:15:43,579
I don't know how to...

1080
01:15:44,288 --> 01:15:48,083
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee.

1081
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,544
Ain't you going to tell me
to get back in there?

1082
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:53,380
No, stay out here and get shot.

1083
01:15:53,797 --> 01:15:55,841
I might do that just for spite.

1084
01:15:56,091 --> 01:15:58,052
Might get a laugh out of you.

1085
01:15:58,761 --> 01:16:01,138
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1086
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:21,867
Feels good.

1087
01:16:21,951 --> 01:16:23,035
Come on.

1088
01:16:23,452 --> 01:16:25,663
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1089
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,373
Same as before.

1090
01:16:27,456 --> 01:16:30,167
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

1091
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,502
No hurry.

1092
01:16:32,002 --> 01:16:34,755
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1093
01:16:34,838 --> 01:16:38,717
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

1094
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:39,885
No need of that.

1095
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:42,972
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1096
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:45,557
I got them at the hotel.

1097
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:48,560
You been keeping them all this time?

1098
01:16:49,395 --> 01:16:51,730
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1099
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:57,194
You could use a bath and a shave, too.

1100
01:16:57,569 --> 01:17:01,156
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1101
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:03,993
Chance?

1102
01:17:04,368 --> 01:17:05,494
Yeah?

1103
01:17:05,744 --> 01:17:06,996
They'll fit.

1104
01:17:07,705 --> 01:17:08,789
Thanks.

1105
01:17:40,571 --> 01:17:41,822
There you are.

1106
01:17:48,495 --> 01:17:50,372
How about you, John T.?

1107
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:52,374
Shall I work on you?

1108
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:54,335
I do my own shaving.

1109
01:17:55,085 --> 01:17:56,545
I thought you did.

1110
01:17:56,837 --> 01:17:58,797
I was just reminding you.

1111
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,973
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1112
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:11,769
You sure could.

1113
01:18:14,772 --> 01:18:16,649
I'll let you keep it for me.

1114
01:18:18,484 --> 01:18:21,987
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1115
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:24,073
Anytime, because I'll be here.

1116
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,368
I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

1117
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:30,829
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1118
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:33,832
You in a hurry, John T.?
I'd like to talk to you.

1119
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,627
- I'll wait for you.
- Thanks, Dude.

1120
01:18:37,252 --> 01:18:39,797
- I just wanted to ask you...
- What's this about a job?

1121
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,801
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1122
01:18:44,385 --> 01:18:45,803
Tending bar?

1123
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:47,638
Among other things.

1124
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:50,432
You think I shouldn't?

1125
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,684
Why ask me?

1126
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:53,852
The way you said "tending bar."

1127
01:18:54,103 --> 01:18:56,563
- All right, I won't do it.
- I didn't say not to.

1128
01:18:56,689 --> 01:18:58,190
You don't like the idea.

1129
01:18:58,274 --> 01:19:00,901
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1130
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:03,028
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1131
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:04,905
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?

1132
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:07,908
- You'd make anybody mad.
- I suppose I would.

1133
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:12,705
As long as you haven't anything against it,
I'll take the job.

1134
01:19:12,871 --> 01:19:13,872
Go ahead.

1135
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:15,582
Thanks, I will.

1136
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:18,877
What were you going to ask me?

1137
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:22,381
- Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
- What were you going to ask?

1138
01:19:22,464 --> 01:19:25,009
Whether you were going to sleep
in the hotel tonight.

1139
01:19:25,092 --> 01:19:28,929
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

1140
01:19:29,013 --> 01:19:30,889
I know. I've given that up.

1141
01:19:30,973 --> 01:19:34,810
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1142
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:36,895
Anyone looking wouldn't look there first.

1143
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,690
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1144
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:43,652
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

1145
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:47,489
Just an idea. You can think about it.

1146
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,743
When you're in a little better humor.

1147
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:02,588
Chance!

1148
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:04,673
The shot came from the jail.

1149
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:16,894
Chance, look out!

1150
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:18,562
Don't go in there.

1151
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:20,856
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1152
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,567
Stumpy! You all right?

1153
01:20:24,193 --> 01:20:28,030
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

1154
01:20:28,113 --> 01:20:29,657
And I'm that fellow.

1155
01:20:32,242 --> 01:20:33,577
Coming in.

1156
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:36,956
Look what he did to my hat.

1157
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,502
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1158
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:44,922
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1159
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:46,674
Fool almost blowed my head off.

1160
01:20:46,757 --> 01:20:48,133
How'd I know it was you?

1161
01:20:48,217 --> 01:20:50,594
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

1162
01:20:50,678 --> 01:20:54,014
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1163
01:20:54,098 --> 01:20:55,182
Look at this hat.

1164
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:58,227
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

1165
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:00,479
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

1166
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:03,148
Okay, I know, just stop talking, will you?

1167
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:05,818
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1168
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:07,361
You could have hollered.

1169
01:21:07,444 --> 01:21:10,698
Just 'cause you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1170
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:14,201
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1171
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:16,578
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1172
01:21:16,787 --> 01:21:20,249
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

1173
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:22,876
...and now you expect...
- Shut up!

1174
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:28,007
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1175
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:31,051
Don't let me tell you again.

1176
01:21:47,651 --> 01:21:50,195
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

1177
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:53,616
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I'm...

1178
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:56,410
All right, I'm wrong.

1179
01:21:56,493 --> 01:21:59,455
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1180
01:21:59,538 --> 01:22:01,665
He's the one that's scared.

1181
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:05,127
We've been pampering you too much.

1182
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:07,921
You better get some sleep.

1183
01:22:16,972 --> 01:22:20,643
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

1184
01:22:20,851 --> 01:22:22,603
You see that door there?

1185
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,230
That look like I done it on purpose?

1186
01:22:25,856 --> 01:22:27,983
It's going to get cold here at night.

1187
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:32,363
And I'm going to leave it get cold.
Because I ain't going to fix that door.

1188
01:22:34,573 --> 01:22:36,367
It weren't my fault.

1189
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:39,286
Were it?

1190
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,335
I know.

1191
01:22:48,837 --> 01:22:50,297
I'll fix the door.

1192
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:06,563
Hi, Sheriff.

1193
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:19,201
How do you like your new job?

1194
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,787
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1195
01:23:23,247 --> 01:23:25,791
You through for the day? Going to bed?

1196
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,293
I thought I would.

1197
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:29,628
- Can I make you some coffee?
- No thanks.

1198
01:23:29,712 --> 01:23:31,297
- Anything to eat?
- Nope.

1199
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,840
How about a drink?

1200
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:35,759
I'll take a drink.

1201
01:23:36,844 --> 01:23:39,555
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1202
01:23:40,723 --> 01:23:42,600
Tired, aren't you, John T.?

1203
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,853
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1204
01:23:45,936 --> 01:23:47,771
All I want is that drink.

1205
01:23:48,731 --> 01:23:51,775
Then, this is all I can do for you?

1206
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,530
I thought you said I could think about it.

1207
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:59,074
You're right. I did.

1208
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:02,119
Put it on the tab.

1209
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,873
In case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1210
01:24:09,543 --> 01:24:11,503
Get a good night's sleep.

1211
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,589
You're not helping me any.

1212
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:13,959
Good morning, Dude.

1213
01:26:14,251 --> 01:26:15,461
Good morning.

1214
01:26:15,544 --> 01:26:17,046
Have a good night?

1215
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:18,797
All right, I guess.

1216
01:26:18,881 --> 01:26:20,257
Eat anything?

1217
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,509
This morning?

1218
01:26:23,093 --> 01:26:24,428
Stumpy fixed something.

1219
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:27,431
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1220
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,309
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

1221
01:26:30,392 --> 01:26:33,520
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

1222
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,272
Think you can stand your watch?

1223
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,733
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

1224
01:27:39,503 --> 01:27:41,297
- That's enough.
- Yeah.

1225
01:27:41,505 --> 01:27:43,090
Where's his hat?

1226
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,808
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

1227
01:28:04,403 --> 01:28:07,489
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1228
01:28:07,823 --> 01:28:09,950
He's suffering "thunderation," Chance.

1229
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:14,496
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

1230
01:28:15,205 --> 01:28:16,707
Ain't pretty.

1231
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,043
He's got to sweat it out.

1232
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,254
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

1233
01:28:22,379 --> 01:28:23,631
He ain't done it yet.

1234
01:28:23,714 --> 01:28:26,550
Why are you so god darned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1235
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,887
- You got any tobacco?
- No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1236
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:32,598
He uses it up fast.
You got to get some for yourself.

1237
01:28:32,681 --> 01:28:35,476
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

1238
01:28:35,559 --> 01:28:39,480
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1239
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:42,191
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1240
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:46,153
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

1241
01:28:46,236 --> 01:28:48,989
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

1242
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,283
Considering what I have to do around here.

1243
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:55,663
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the "nursemaiding" that killer back there.

1244
01:28:56,246 --> 01:28:58,457
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

1245
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,542
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1246
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:02,920
You're a treasure.

1247
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:07,216
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1248
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:11,178
Go back to being yourself.

1249
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:13,097
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1250
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,010
He's coming down the street now.

1251
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,932
Good morning, Sheriff.

1252
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:58,601
Colorado.

1253
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:01,812
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1254
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:03,105
About what?

1255
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:06,233
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

1256
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,611
...if trouble started around the jail.

1257
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:12,197
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me, too.

1258
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:14,700
- Would you have said it any different?
- No.

1259
01:30:14,825 --> 01:30:18,370
If he was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

1260
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:21,123
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

1261
01:30:21,248 --> 01:30:22,791
I don't suppose so.

1262
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:25,919
But you can be sure
he's going to try it a different way.

1263
01:30:26,045 --> 01:30:27,921
Got enough left there for another?

1264
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:29,757
Sure. Help yourself.

1265
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,885
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1266
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:34,803
Only when I carry it.

1267
01:30:35,638 --> 01:30:37,514
How come you carry a rifle?

1268
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:41,477
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1269
01:30:46,148 --> 01:30:48,651
I don't suppose you have a match either?

1270
01:30:48,817 --> 01:30:50,402
All out of them, too.

1271
01:30:50,569 --> 01:30:51,862
I'll get some.

1272
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:04,291
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1273
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,585
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1274
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:09,004
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1275
01:31:09,129 --> 01:31:10,756
Round the corner.

1276
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:13,342
About three or four doors to the right.

1277
01:31:13,425 --> 01:31:15,511
Stay away from that rifle, Sheriff.

1278
01:31:15,594 --> 01:31:17,554
You can see we've still got our guns.

1279
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,848
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1280
01:31:20,015 --> 01:31:21,517
Unloosen that belt.

1281
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:27,898
- What've you done to him?
- Don't worry about him.

1282
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,942
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1283
01:31:30,025 --> 01:31:33,237
He ain't going to be and nor are you
unless you do as you're told.

1284
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,321
Stay back here.

1285
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:35,990
We're going down to the jail.

1286
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,658
You'll turn Joe Burdette loose...

1287
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:41,203
...or you and your deputy quit worrying
about this whole thing.

1288
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:42,663
Take your choice.

1289
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,999
Are you just going to stand here?

1290
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:48,002
If you want to get him shot,
just go out there.

1291
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:49,753
What'll it be?

1292
01:31:52,589 --> 01:31:55,676
If you want to do something,
when I get out on the porch...

1293
01:31:55,759 --> 01:31:58,512
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

1294
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,556
Duck after you throw it.

1295
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,982
Just keep coming, mister.

1296
01:32:10,482 --> 01:32:12,651
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1297
01:32:31,128 --> 01:32:32,504
Grab that horse.

1298
01:32:39,261 --> 01:32:42,222
- Colorado, where's he going?
- He's going to see if Dude's all right.

1299
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,238
Chance, over here.

1300
01:33:05,245 --> 01:33:07,039
You look a little used.

1301
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,291
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1302
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:10,876
They had me cold.

1303
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,920
Going to make me open the jail.

1304
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:14,296
What happened?

1305
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:17,424
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1306
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:20,552
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1307
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:22,513
I can get up by myself!

1308
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:25,057
I let them get me.

1309
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:28,560
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

1310
01:33:28,644 --> 01:33:30,604
...and it was easy for them.

1311
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:35,609
I'm good when I'm sober, boy, real good.

1312
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,779
I should have known better.

1313
01:33:38,862 --> 01:33:42,574
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1314
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:45,077
- Where're you going?
- Get your hands off of me.

1315
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:46,662
I said where're you going?

1316
01:33:46,745 --> 01:33:49,707
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

1317
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,834
One bad night and I'm done for.

1318
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:55,879
An old man takes a pot shot at me
and I'm finished.

1319
01:33:56,463 --> 01:33:59,550
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1320
01:33:59,633 --> 01:34:00,843
Look at me.

1321
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:02,845
I got them so bad.

1322
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:06,098
What can a man do with hands like that?

1323
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:09,226
I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.

1324
01:34:09,893 --> 01:34:11,478
All right, quit.

1325
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:13,856
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1326
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:15,941
If you want to quit, quit.

1327
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:18,319
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

1328
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:19,987
One thing, though.

1329
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:24,867
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1330
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:28,162
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1331
01:34:30,372 --> 01:34:31,707
I'm sorry.

1332
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:35,377
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

1333
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:39,173
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1334
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,760
Maybe you're right.

1335
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:46,055
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1336
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:52,561
Here are your guns.

1337
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,565
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

1338
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,609
You get something out of it.

1339
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:03,739
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

1340
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,705
I think this is your horse.

1341
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,666
Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1342
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,210
I guess Dude's all right.

1343
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:17,670
Anyway, he's walking.

1344
01:35:17,753 --> 01:35:19,129
I'm so glad.

1345
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:21,048
I was afraid.

1346
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:23,592
My stomach seems...

1347
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:25,970
Come on, maybe a drink will help.

1348
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:42,444
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

1349
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,365
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1350
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:56,834
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1351
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,378
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

1352
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,590
There's another one down by the bridge.
Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.

1353
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:04,758
No need for that.

1354
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:08,512
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

1355
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,930
Price is going up.

1356
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,098
What?

1357
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:12,516
Nothing, Bert.

1358
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:15,227
Bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.

1359
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:16,478
It will be done.

1360
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:18,230
Here is your gun.

1361
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:20,065
Thank you, Carlitos.

1362
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:21,900
Where's Colorado?

1363
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,194
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl Feathers.

1364
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:28,907
Better give me another, Colorado.

1365
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:30,451
Yes, ma'am.

1366
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:33,871
Look at me, Colorado, take a good look.

1367
01:36:34,496 --> 01:36:37,833
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1368
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,585
No, ma'am.

1369
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,920
You'd be a liar then.

1370
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,132
Better go easy on that stuff.

1371
01:36:45,215 --> 01:36:47,343
- That makes three you've had.
- Yep.

1372
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:50,346
You'd be lying because that's what I am.

1373
01:36:50,512 --> 01:36:52,222
A softheaded idiot.

1374
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:56,226
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

1375
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:59,229
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me...

1376
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:04,443
Hi, Sheriff.

1377
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:07,321
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1378
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:10,699
He's all right. So am I, thanks to you.

1379
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:15,454
- Thank the lady here.
- Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.

1380
01:37:15,537 --> 01:37:19,708
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

1381
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,543
Or was it four?

1382
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:23,337
Why did you make me do it?

1383
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,256
- I made you do it?
- Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1384
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,467
He wasn't going to do
what those men told him.

1385
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:29,843
Not him.

1386
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,597
You were just going to get yourself killed,
that's all.

1387
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,266
Somebody had to...

1388
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,059
What were you going to do, Sheriff?

1389
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:39,395
I'm glad I didn't have to make up my mind.

1390
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:42,189
You weren't going down to that jail.

1391
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,149
So somebody had to help you.

1392
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,944
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1393
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,698
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

1394
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:52,783
It was my own idea.

1395
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:56,120
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

1396
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:57,871
I know you did.

1397
01:37:57,955 --> 01:37:59,206
I'm glad you didn't.

1398
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,416
What?

1399
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,209
I'm glad you didn't go.

1400
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,258
What'd you have to say a thing
like that for?

1401
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:14,013
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1402
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,933
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

1403
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:19,685
And neither do I.

1404
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:23,147
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1405
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,649
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1406
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:33,574
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

1407
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:38,787
I don't know why I should go, though,
because we're all fools.

1408
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:42,082
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1409
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,169
I'm going, anyway.

1410
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:48,213
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

1411
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:50,633
Just a bunch of idiots.

1412
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:54,803
How did she get mixed up in this?

1413
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,097
She didn't feel too good.

1414
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:01,060
- She had a couple of drinks.
- I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1415
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:05,773
She was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

1416
01:39:06,523 --> 01:39:10,819
I told her to throw that pot through
the window and I went out instead.

1417
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:13,656
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me.

1418
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:15,950
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1419
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:18,494
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

1420
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,496
But you saved my neck.

1421
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:23,248
Burdette isn't going to kiss you for that.

1422
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,708
So you're in.

1423
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:29,588
Don't tell me you didn't think about that.
Before you did it, I mean.

1424
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:32,633
If I'm going to get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1425
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,510
How do I get a badge?

1426
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,595
Come on, I'll get you one.

1427
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:40,641
I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1428
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:45,896
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

1429
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:50,150
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

1430
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:57,950
You telling me they was going to bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

1431
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,451
Why, they're crazy.

1432
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:00,911
God darn fools.

1433
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:03,998
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

1434
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,751
...what do they think I'm going to do?
You know what I'm going to do.

1435
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:10,129
I'm going to start blasting.

1436
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:12,756
Where'd you get that hat?

1437
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,967
Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.

1438
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:15,884
For a what?

1439
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,512
- Stumpy, we're coming in.
- Well, come ahead.

1440
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,639
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1441
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:26,520
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

1442
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:28,731
In the right-hand drawer there.

1443
01:40:28,897 --> 01:40:31,358
You know where that book is,
the one with the oath?

1444
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:35,029
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

1445
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:37,990
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1446
01:40:38,073 --> 01:40:41,327
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy...

1447
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:44,538
Found yourself another knot-head
who don't know when he's well off?

1448
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:47,625
...in the County of Presidio
of the great State of Texas?

1449
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,792
I do.

1450
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:51,670
And that includes taking orders from me.

1451
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,715
All right, Sheriff.
How about giving me one.

1452
01:40:54,798 --> 01:40:57,092
Get over to the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1453
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:58,677
Move in here.

1454
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:01,055
What are you laughing about?

1455
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,015
What I got myself in for.

1456
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:06,644
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1457
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:09,188
- How good do you think he is?
- He's all right.

1458
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:11,565
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1459
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:14,902
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

1460
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:17,529
- Then he got another one.
- Good enough.

1461
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:19,782
Is he as good as I used to be?

1462
01:41:22,701 --> 01:41:24,453
It'd be pretty close.

1463
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:27,164
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

1464
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:32,461
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1465
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,632
What's he talking about, him for me?

1466
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:39,426
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

1467
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,011
He's quitting.

1468
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,224
What's got into you?

1469
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:47,810
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

1470
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,979
Shaking worse all the time.

1471
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,107
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

1472
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:57,027
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1473
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:59,113
He can take the whole bottle.

1474
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:00,739
Go ahead.

1475
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:27,266
Stumpy.

1476
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,728
Don't close it.

1477
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,500
Didn't spill a drop.

1478
01:42:57,254 --> 01:42:58,839
Shakes are gone...

1479
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:01,800
...just because of a piece of music.

1480
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:07,848
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1481
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:13,062
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1482
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:17,316
Chance, give me another shot at it...

1483
01:43:18,609 --> 01:43:20,819
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1484
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:26,784
You heard him.

1485
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:33,165
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1486
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:36,377
I ain't going to wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

1487
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,837
You two are enough to drive a man to it.

1488
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:44,260
I think I'll go watch the road again.

1489
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:47,513
Unless you need me for something else.

1490
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,808
Did you forget this?

1491
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:53,936
You could clean up a little.

1492
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:56,605
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1493
01:43:57,314 --> 01:43:59,066
I'm better than I look.

1494
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:01,151
I'll do that tonight.

1495
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:05,322
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1496
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,035
Nothing in his stomach.

1497
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:11,745
Nothing but guts.

1498
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:15,416
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1499
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:18,252
We know about him,
he's going to be all right, but I ain't.

1500
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:21,255
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

1501
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,881
Where're you going?

1502
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:26,093
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better...

1503
01:44:26,176 --> 01:44:28,220
I know, get back in my hole.

1504
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:31,682
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1505
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:34,602
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1506
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:39,148
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1507
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:40,858
Close the window!

1508
01:44:42,067 --> 01:44:45,279
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

1509
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:48,157
Never can satisfy him.

1510
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:02,291
That's real pretty. Go on, play some more.

1511
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,209
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1512
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:13,844
Good one.

1513
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,747
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1514
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:26,834
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

1515
01:48:26,917 --> 01:48:28,627
I can't argue with you.

1516
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:30,796
- You're right, Stumpy.
- Right about what?

1517
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:34,300
- I should have thought of it before.
- Thought about what?

1518
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:38,178
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't going to rush this jail.

1519
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:40,556
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1520
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,017
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

1521
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,935
Only be three or four days.

1522
01:48:45,394 --> 01:48:48,022
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1523
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:50,065
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1524
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:52,526
- Water and firewood?
- Filled up this morning.

1525
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:55,821
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

1526
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,449
- Less you got plenty.
- He ain't.

1527
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:01,160
- And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
- Thanks, Stumpy.

1528
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,953
There's another thing now...

1529
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:07,249
...if we're all going to be in here
three or four days, close together like...

1530
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:11,795
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

1531
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:13,422
...do what he said he'd do.

1532
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:17,301
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

1533
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:18,469
All right, Stumpy.

1534
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:22,389
Me, I like roses, but this fellow
ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

1535
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,975
I'm going to take a bath. I said I would.

1536
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,811
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1537
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:30,022
I was just a wondering when.

1538
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:32,608
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

1539
01:49:32,733 --> 01:49:35,277
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1540
01:49:35,361 --> 01:49:39,031
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

1541
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:43,911
How you do that?

1542
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:46,747
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1543
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,166
Carlos, open up.

1544
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,292
Coming.

1545
01:49:52,711 --> 01:49:56,298
Buenas tardes, Senor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

1546
01:49:57,216 --> 01:50:00,469
Carlos, I'm sleeping over at the jail tonight.
All of us are.

1547
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:04,056
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

1548
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:06,767
- And some beer, too.
- Feeling better?

1549
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:07,935
Much better.

1550
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:10,145
- That's all you need?
- That's all.

1551
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:14,400
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

1552
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:20,739
Now don't make any noise.

1553
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:24,910
Open your mouth.

1554
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:51,979
Hi, Feathers.

1555
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:54,356
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1556
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:57,151
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1557
01:50:57,234 --> 01:50:59,945
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1558
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:01,947
Who's Stumpy?

1559
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:03,949
The fellow that likes roses.

1560
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,868
No, he watches the jail.

1561
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:06,869
Hurry it up.

1562
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:08,120
Right away.

1563
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:11,290
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1564
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:14,918
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

1565
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:16,754
Are you sorry you didn't?

1566
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,381
Are you?

1567
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,217
I know an easy way of telling you.

1568
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,931
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1569
01:51:27,473 --> 01:51:28,974
Chance, give me a towel.

1570
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:29,975
I'm busy.

1571
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,268
What'd you say?

1572
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:33,145
Somebody's telling me something.

1573
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:36,357
I can't... Give me a towel, will you?

1574
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:39,944
He's a big help.

1575
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:42,196
I'll finish telling you later.

1576
01:51:50,663 --> 01:51:52,373
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1577
01:51:52,456 --> 01:51:55,000
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1578
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:58,504
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

1579
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:00,631
I don't want to go up and get him.

1580
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:03,425
- Burdette wants him alive.
- Then don't talk so loud.

1581
01:52:03,509 --> 01:52:06,762
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

1582
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:09,181
- That might just work.
- What?

1583
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:11,558
The stairs are pretty dark.

1584
01:52:11,642 --> 01:52:14,311
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

1585
01:52:14,395 --> 01:52:17,648
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

1586
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,251
Hurry it up, will you?

1587
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:38,669
Be right out.

1588
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:44,008
If you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1589
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:47,011
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in a while...

1590
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:50,931
...and see if you needed anything.
- I don't want you anyplace around there.

1591
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:53,100
I was afraid of that.

1592
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:56,770
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1593
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:59,398
That's a long time, you know.

1594
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:02,276
You'll live through it.

1595
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,362
Yeah, you do the same.

1596
01:53:16,874 --> 01:53:20,252
All right, you both better get out there.
You, too, Pedro.

1597
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:22,421
Leave the door open a little.

1598
01:53:22,713 --> 01:53:24,673
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1599
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:28,969
Now, lady,
we want you to call the sheriff down here.

1600
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,846
No! No!

1601
01:53:31,597 --> 01:53:33,140
Maybe this'll help.

1602
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:35,935
Please don't. Don't!

1603
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:46,320
He's out cold. Get upstairs, quick!

1604
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:50,699
Hold it, Dude.

1605
01:53:51,075 --> 01:53:52,242
Watch him.

1606
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:57,164
Just keep coming, lady.

1607
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,209
All right, everybody, downstairs.

1608
01:54:08,926 --> 01:54:11,053
All right, get on your feet.

1609
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:19,561
Come on, get up!

1610
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,195
Can you walk?

1611
01:54:30,447 --> 01:54:31,824
Where're we going?

1612
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:33,075
That's up to you.

1613
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,160
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

1614
01:54:35,286 --> 01:54:37,830
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1615
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:38,998
Take your choice.

1616
01:54:39,123 --> 01:54:41,417
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1617
01:54:41,959 --> 01:54:45,045
- You'll just get Joe killed.
- Not if he knows we got you two.

1618
01:54:45,129 --> 01:54:47,172
They got us. We're licked.

1619
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:50,843
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

1620
01:54:50,968 --> 01:54:53,762
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm telling you to do it now.

1621
01:54:53,846 --> 01:54:57,349
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

1622
01:54:57,474 --> 01:54:59,852
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

1623
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:01,895
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I do.

1624
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:04,732
I'm thinking good, too.
Now do what I tell you.

1625
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,527
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

1626
01:55:08,652 --> 01:55:10,404
All we want is Joe.

1627
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:16,994
- You still think it's a good idea?
- I still think it's good.

1628
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,914
We'll go over to the jail.

1629
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:22,666
Take the shells out of his gun.

1630
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:24,251
I unloaded his pistol.

1631
01:55:24,335 --> 01:55:26,712
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1632
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:30,049
Now look, Sheriff,
we're going out of here natural like.

1633
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:33,469
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

1634
01:55:33,552 --> 01:55:35,429
...think something is wrong.

1635
01:55:35,512 --> 01:55:39,308
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1636
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:42,561
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

1637
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:46,315
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1638
01:55:46,815 --> 01:55:49,526
Some of those you killed
were friends of mine.

1639
01:55:49,735 --> 01:55:51,236
Give him his rifle.

1640
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:55,324
You first.

1641
01:56:32,778 --> 01:56:34,029
Hold it.

1642
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:38,617
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1643
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:42,329
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1644
01:56:42,413 --> 01:56:43,998
It took you long enough.

1645
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:46,208
Steve, cover from out here.

1646
01:56:54,258 --> 01:56:57,469
All right, open up.
We're going to let Joe go.

1647
01:56:57,595 --> 01:56:58,887
How come?

1648
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:01,849
His friends here put up bail.

1649
01:57:02,433 --> 01:57:05,352
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

1650
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:07,688
I forgot.

1651
01:57:17,615 --> 01:57:18,616
Easy.

1652
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,952
- This fellow will talk all right.
- Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1653
01:57:22,036 --> 01:57:24,496
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1654
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:28,917
Now watch yourself.

1655
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,211
There's two of them holding Dude.

1656
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:34,798
The window.

1657
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:48,479
All right, Colorado.

1658
01:57:56,737 --> 01:57:58,614
In here.

1659
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:00,240
They're gone.

1660
01:58:00,324 --> 01:58:02,618
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

1661
01:58:02,743 --> 01:58:06,288
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1662
01:58:09,166 --> 01:58:10,918
They've gone all right.

1663
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:14,004
We going to go after them?

1664
01:58:15,214 --> 01:58:20,344
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1665
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:23,389
You ought to remember that.

1666
01:58:23,472 --> 01:58:25,182
You thought it was funny.

1667
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:28,143
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

1668
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:29,728
I didn't think.

1669
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:32,231
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

1670
01:58:32,356 --> 01:58:35,067
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1671
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:37,403
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1672
01:58:37,528 --> 01:58:39,738
He sent them over there, all right.

1673
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:43,367
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do, too.

1674
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:46,412
That's why they're not happy about it.

1675
01:58:46,495 --> 01:58:47,746
What're you going to do?

1676
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:49,832
It's what Burdette will do.

1677
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:53,127
Carlos. Get a hold of Burdette.

1678
01:58:53,877 --> 01:58:56,714
I don't care how.
Tell him I want to talk to him.

1679
01:58:56,797 --> 01:59:00,467
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I want to talk to him.

1680
01:59:00,592 --> 01:59:02,553
We'll be at the jail.

1681
01:59:07,975 --> 01:59:10,853
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1682
01:59:16,358 --> 01:59:17,818
Come on, Colorado.

1683
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,279
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1684
01:59:50,059 --> 01:59:52,269
It's me, Carlos.

1685
01:59:56,941 --> 01:59:58,817
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1686
01:59:58,943 --> 02:00:00,778
He say he don't want to talk to you.

1687
02:00:00,861 --> 02:00:03,781
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1688
02:00:03,864 --> 02:00:04,698
A trade?

1689
02:00:04,782 --> 02:00:05,991
Dude for Joe.

1690
02:00:06,075 --> 02:00:08,452
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

1691
02:00:08,577 --> 02:00:09,411
Warehouse?

1692
02:00:09,536 --> 02:00:10,204
Si.

1693
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:12,498
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1694
02:00:12,623 --> 02:00:16,210
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1695
02:00:16,293 --> 02:00:18,003
He said to let him know.

1696
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:24,843
Tell him we'll be there.

1697
02:00:24,927 --> 02:00:27,429
You're crazy! You can't do that!

1698
02:00:27,513 --> 02:00:29,723
Not even if Dude was your own brother.

1699
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:30,766
What can I do?

1700
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:34,270
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

1701
02:00:34,395 --> 02:00:37,231
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1702
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:40,276
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1703
02:00:40,359 --> 02:00:43,028
I'd like to add my two cents worth, Sheriff.

1704
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,280
Go ahead.

1705
02:00:44,363 --> 02:00:46,991
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1706
02:00:47,074 --> 02:00:49,451
Let's say that we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1707
02:00:49,535 --> 02:00:52,413
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

1708
02:00:52,496 --> 02:00:56,542
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

1709
02:00:56,625 --> 02:00:58,085
The brakes'll be off then.

1710
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,462
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1711
02:01:00,587 --> 02:01:02,381
You're right, Colorado.

1712
02:01:02,965 --> 02:01:05,092
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

1713
02:01:05,175 --> 02:01:07,303
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1714
02:01:07,428 --> 02:01:09,013
- I'm not worried.
- Me neither.

1715
02:01:09,096 --> 02:01:11,223
You'll just wait for the marshal to come.

1716
02:01:11,307 --> 02:01:14,101
- He's still going to want you and Dude.
- I'd say so.

1717
02:01:14,184 --> 02:01:16,937
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

1718
02:01:17,021 --> 02:01:20,232
When you make the trade
then Burdette's going to get both of you.

1719
02:01:20,316 --> 02:01:22,109
After a little argument.

1720
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:25,904
- But why at all? Why the both of you?
- Dude ought to have a chance.

1721
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:28,741
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1722
02:01:29,074 --> 02:01:30,326
Will he?

1723
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:33,078
You're going to have me crying.

1724
02:01:33,203 --> 02:01:38,000
Fellow's got to be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

1725
02:01:40,169 --> 02:01:41,629
Go ahead, Carlos.

1726
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:01,649
Burdette's here.

1727
02:02:04,485 --> 02:02:05,945
About time to go.

1728
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,948
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

1729
02:02:09,031 --> 02:02:10,532
Look out here.

1730
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:13,535
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1731
02:02:13,744 --> 02:02:17,539
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

1732
02:02:17,706 --> 02:02:19,750
Besides, you're not going.

1733
02:02:19,959 --> 02:02:23,170
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1734
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:24,797
I'm going along now.

1735
02:02:24,964 --> 02:02:26,048
Why?

1736
02:02:27,049 --> 02:02:29,134
Just say I'd like a closer look.

1737
02:02:32,513 --> 02:02:35,432
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1738
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:38,519
Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why?

1739
02:02:39,186 --> 02:02:40,354
I'll give you one.

1740
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:44,483
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

1741
02:02:44,566 --> 02:02:48,487
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

1742
02:02:48,612 --> 02:02:50,906
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1743
02:02:51,782 --> 02:02:54,910
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1744
02:02:56,996 --> 02:02:58,747
You give me a reason.

1745
02:03:02,668 --> 02:03:07,881
Do you want that I should bring Joe out,
or do you want to do that yourself?

1746
02:03:08,299 --> 02:03:09,800
Bring him out.

1747
02:03:17,308 --> 02:03:20,352
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1748
02:03:29,486 --> 02:03:31,530
I told you I'd get out of here.

1749
02:03:31,864 --> 02:03:34,867
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

1750
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:37,786
See you, Stumpy.

1751
02:03:43,542 --> 02:03:44,543
See you.

1752
02:04:36,887 --> 02:04:38,597
That's far enough, Joe.

1753
02:04:43,852 --> 02:04:45,312
Through the barn.

1754
02:04:57,324 --> 02:05:01,370
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1755
02:05:25,019 --> 02:05:26,729
You want a closer look?

1756
02:05:27,605 --> 02:05:29,398
This is close enough.

1757
02:05:29,898 --> 02:05:31,358
Take that window.

1758
02:05:31,692 --> 02:05:33,027
Watch Joe.

1759
02:05:51,086 --> 02:05:52,254
Burdette!

1760
02:05:55,633 --> 02:05:56,967
Burdette!

1761
02:05:57,384 --> 02:05:59,094
Nathan Burdette!

1762
02:06:04,767 --> 02:06:05,935
We're ready.

1763
02:06:06,101 --> 02:06:07,478
Joe's here.

1764
02:06:07,895 --> 02:06:09,521
We're ready, too.

1765
02:06:10,648 --> 02:06:11,857
Start Dude.

1766
02:06:12,691 --> 02:06:14,485
I'll start Joe.

1767
02:06:14,568 --> 02:06:15,819
Go ahead.

1768
02:06:20,074 --> 02:06:21,617
All right, Joe.

1769
02:06:25,204 --> 02:06:27,539
You can start walking very slow.

1770
02:06:29,249 --> 02:06:31,377
And stop if I say stop...

1771
02:06:32,711 --> 02:06:34,213
...or I'll stop you.

1772
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:36,382
Bring him out.

1773
02:06:41,387 --> 02:06:42,638
Go ahead.

1774
02:06:43,472 --> 02:06:44,556
Slow.

1775
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:27,474
Look out!

1776
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:46,744
Do you want me to go help Dude?

1777
02:07:46,869 --> 02:07:48,621
He'll take Joe all right.

1778
02:07:50,539 --> 02:07:52,791
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1779
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,501
He'll take him.

1780
02:08:00,466 --> 02:08:02,092
You're right. He did.

1781
02:08:03,218 --> 02:08:06,221
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1782
02:08:06,889 --> 02:08:08,849
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1783
02:08:08,933 --> 02:08:10,768
Stay right where you are.

1784
02:08:10,893 --> 02:08:12,269
We'll throw you a gun.

1785
02:08:12,353 --> 02:08:13,854
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1786
02:08:25,491 --> 02:08:29,161
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1787
02:08:29,995 --> 02:08:32,289
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1788
02:09:05,364 --> 02:09:06,865
That ought to start something.

1789
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:09,201
It will.

1790
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:13,330
On your left!

1791
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:19,003
Two of them made it to that shack.

1792
02:09:19,086 --> 02:09:21,630
If they get across that creek,
we'll be in bad shape.

1793
02:09:21,714 --> 02:09:23,048
They'll get behind us.

1794
02:09:23,132 --> 02:09:25,926
I don't know how
we're going to stop them from here.

1795
02:09:31,015 --> 02:09:32,474
Is that who I think it is?

1796
02:09:32,558 --> 02:09:33,726
Old Stumpy.

1797
02:09:34,268 --> 02:09:36,020
The fellow I left behind.

1798
02:09:37,605 --> 02:09:39,648
Don't shoot, it's me.

1799
02:09:39,732 --> 02:09:41,900
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1800
02:09:42,192 --> 02:09:44,987
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them.

1801
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:46,447
Who'll turn up next?

1802
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:48,907
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

1803
02:09:50,534 --> 02:09:54,538
Chance, Stumpy sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1804
02:09:55,414 --> 02:09:56,957
I go tell him.

1805
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:59,251
You stay here. I'll go get him.

1806
02:09:59,376 --> 02:10:01,003
Give me those shells.

1807
02:10:27,237 --> 02:10:29,448
Stumpy, get out of there.

1808
02:10:29,949 --> 02:10:32,868
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1809
02:10:33,035 --> 02:10:34,662
You got a good seat, all right.

1810
02:10:34,745 --> 02:10:36,872
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1811
02:10:37,081 --> 02:10:38,791
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1812
02:10:39,208 --> 02:10:41,293
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1813
02:10:41,377 --> 02:10:44,880
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1814
02:11:02,648 --> 02:11:04,733
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1815
02:11:04,817 --> 02:11:07,486
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

1816
02:11:08,904 --> 02:11:10,739
I brought us some dynamite.

1817
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:12,741
That's a good idea.

1818
02:11:12,866 --> 02:11:15,327
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1819
02:11:19,123 --> 02:11:21,417
Can you shoot as good as you say you can?

1820
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:24,003
- Can you throw?
- Near as far as you can shoot.

1821
02:11:24,086 --> 02:11:26,255
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1822
02:11:30,426 --> 02:11:31,343
Dude!

1823
02:11:32,553 --> 02:11:33,971
Over here.

1824
02:11:34,805 --> 02:11:35,931
Get ready.

1825
02:11:36,098 --> 02:11:37,474
Let it go!

1826
02:11:44,148 --> 02:11:45,691
That was a good one.

1827
02:11:46,734 --> 02:11:48,235
Stop cackling.

1828
02:11:48,736 --> 02:11:50,946
Get one a little farther out there.

1829
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:52,573
There you go again.

1830
02:11:53,324 --> 02:11:56,076
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

1831
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:57,411
I'd throw them myself.

1832
02:11:57,494 --> 02:11:59,955
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1833
02:12:00,122 --> 02:12:01,457
Let it go.

1834
02:12:06,837 --> 02:12:09,298
Dude, how do you like them apples?

1835
02:12:09,632 --> 02:12:10,883
That's all right.

1836
02:12:11,008 --> 02:12:12,468
Throw one for me.

1837
02:12:12,718 --> 02:12:14,762
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1838
02:12:14,845 --> 02:12:17,139
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1839
02:12:17,264 --> 02:12:18,432
Throw it.

1840
02:12:18,515 --> 02:12:20,017
Here you are, Dude.

1841
02:12:26,190 --> 02:12:27,691
Took you two.

1842
02:12:27,942 --> 02:12:29,610
I didn't allow for the wind.

1843
02:12:29,693 --> 02:12:31,987
Can't you throw them any farther?

1844
02:12:32,112 --> 02:12:34,406
I can if you want to blow
the whole place down.

1845
02:12:34,573 --> 02:12:37,451
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1846
02:12:46,377 --> 02:12:48,420
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1847
02:12:48,587 --> 02:12:50,881
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

1848
02:12:50,965 --> 02:12:51,924
Look at them quit.

1849
02:13:08,732 --> 02:13:10,526
Sure is quiet out there.

1850
02:13:10,693 --> 02:13:11,777
Find anything?

1851
02:13:11,902 --> 02:13:15,990
There isn't a Burdette man left
in town outside those who got locked up.

1852
02:13:16,073 --> 02:13:18,784
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1853
02:13:18,867 --> 02:13:19,952
You're welcome.

1854
02:13:20,077 --> 02:13:21,245
Thank you.

1855
02:13:22,579 --> 02:13:24,290
What do you want to do about them?

1856
02:13:24,373 --> 02:13:27,001
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

1857
02:13:27,084 --> 02:13:29,795
- We'll wait for the marshal.
- Wait for the marshal?

1858
02:13:29,878 --> 02:13:33,549
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

1859
02:13:33,632 --> 02:13:36,719
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

1860
02:13:36,802 --> 02:13:38,053
And that's a question.

1861
02:13:38,137 --> 02:13:40,764
I'm fed up feeding them,
and I ain't going to watch them.

1862
02:13:40,889 --> 02:13:43,934
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

1863
02:13:44,018 --> 02:13:46,562
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

1864
02:13:46,645 --> 02:13:49,356
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1865
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,483
I'll watch it for you if you want to go out.

1866
02:13:51,567 --> 02:13:53,235
- Would you?
- Sure.

1867
02:13:53,319 --> 02:13:56,822
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1868
02:13:56,947 --> 02:13:58,365
I don't think it would.

1869
02:13:58,449 --> 02:14:02,286
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me either.

1870
02:14:02,369 --> 02:14:04,079
I don't think it would.

1871
02:14:04,997 --> 02:14:06,248
Should I go?

1872
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:07,583
Go ahead.

1873
02:14:08,125 --> 02:14:08,876
Go ahead.

1874
02:14:08,959 --> 02:14:11,003
- You ain't going to give me a argument?
- No.

1875
02:14:11,128 --> 02:14:13,172
Don't care whether I go or not.

1876
02:14:25,851 --> 02:14:26,936
Chance.

1877
02:14:27,978 --> 02:14:29,939
Have you seen that girl yet?

1878
02:14:30,731 --> 02:14:33,108
I said, "Have you seen that girl yet?"

1879
02:14:35,861 --> 02:14:36,946
The job.

1880
02:14:38,072 --> 02:14:39,490
Didn't have time.

1881
02:14:40,699 --> 02:14:43,827
The Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1882
02:14:44,203 --> 02:14:45,579
Should be leaving soon.

1883
02:14:45,663 --> 02:14:47,873
- You mean she's going on it?
- I don't know.

1884
02:14:47,998 --> 02:14:49,959
I don't think you do either.

1885
02:14:50,084 --> 02:14:52,044
But if it was me, I'd find out.

1886
02:14:52,169 --> 02:14:54,797
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

1887
02:14:55,214 --> 02:14:57,675
She might be leaving and she might not.

1888
02:14:58,217 --> 02:15:00,302
She might need help making up her mind.

1889
02:15:00,386 --> 02:15:02,012
But you're the expert.

1890
02:15:02,096 --> 02:15:04,723
Me, I don't know anything about women.

1891
02:15:05,432 --> 02:15:08,686
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

1892
02:15:12,606 --> 02:15:14,108
A man forgets.

1893
02:15:18,529 --> 02:15:20,489
Sometimes it isn't easy.

1894
02:15:22,533 --> 02:15:25,577
Something happens, he just forgets.

1895
02:15:27,204 --> 02:15:30,457
In case you're interested, I have.

1896
02:15:31,333 --> 02:15:33,127
I don't even want a drink.

1897
02:15:34,253 --> 02:15:35,629
It's about time.

1898
02:15:36,171 --> 02:15:38,799
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

1899
02:15:38,882 --> 02:15:41,885
If you want to jump in, I'll take care of you.

1900
02:15:42,678 --> 02:15:45,014
What is this now?
You're going to take care of him.

1901
02:15:45,097 --> 02:15:47,558
- Tell me about it.
- Sheriff's got himself a girl.

1902
02:15:47,641 --> 02:15:48,767
Shut up.

1903
02:15:48,851 --> 02:15:50,811
We ain't going to go through that again?

1904
02:15:50,894 --> 02:15:53,105
You going to do
the same thing Dude done?

1905
02:15:53,230 --> 02:15:55,983
- Keep still.
- Why don't somebody tell me these things?

1906
02:15:56,066 --> 02:15:57,526
Where you going?

1907
02:15:57,610 --> 02:15:59,111
Let him go, Stumpy.

1908
02:16:01,363 --> 02:16:03,699
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

1909
02:16:03,782 --> 02:16:06,201
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

1910
02:16:06,327 --> 02:16:09,038
- She got him on the run?
- She sure has.

1911
02:16:09,955 --> 02:16:11,415
I can just see him.

1912
02:16:11,498 --> 02:16:13,459
Laying down the law to her.

1913
02:16:13,584 --> 02:16:15,961
"I told you to get back in there!"

1914
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,381
And then getting told off himself.

1915
02:16:25,554 --> 02:16:28,182
Everything is all right?

1916
02:16:28,265 --> 02:16:30,726
- I am so happy.
- Thank you, Consuelo.

1917
02:16:30,851 --> 02:16:32,394
You look for the girl?

1918
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:33,729
She's in there.

1919
02:16:34,605 --> 02:16:36,899
"No got time."

1920
02:16:43,781 --> 02:16:45,115
Hi, John T.

1921
02:16:45,866 --> 02:16:48,577
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

1922
02:16:50,996 --> 02:16:52,164
There.

1923
02:16:55,167 --> 02:16:57,252
It's all over, isn't it, John T.?

1924
02:16:57,336 --> 02:16:59,338
Where'd you get those things?

1925
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:02,341
I wore them the last place I worked.

1926
02:17:03,842 --> 02:17:06,053
Why are you wearing them now?

1927
02:17:06,845 --> 02:17:08,389
Tonight's a big night.

1928
02:17:08,472 --> 02:17:10,933
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

1929
02:17:11,016 --> 02:17:12,393
I'm going to do a song.

1930
02:17:12,476 --> 02:17:14,770
You need a rig like that to sing?

1931
02:17:15,145 --> 02:17:16,689
You haven't heard me sing.

1932
02:17:16,772 --> 02:17:20,609
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

1933
02:17:21,819 --> 02:17:23,237
But you don't like them.

1934
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:26,532
- I didn't say that.
- You don't want me to wear them.

1935
02:17:26,615 --> 02:17:28,158
I didn't say that either.

1936
02:17:28,242 --> 02:17:32,121
- Is it because they show so much of me?
- They certainly do that.

1937
02:17:34,164 --> 02:17:37,334
You're a stubborn man, John T.

1938
02:17:39,044 --> 02:17:41,422
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

1939
02:17:42,172 --> 02:17:43,841
And other times...

1940
02:17:44,842 --> 02:17:48,012
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

1941
02:17:48,178 --> 02:17:49,680
You like what you see.

1942
02:17:49,763 --> 02:17:52,683
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

1943
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:56,770
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

1944
02:17:57,855 --> 02:17:59,690
And I haven't helped much.

1945
02:18:00,858 --> 02:18:03,068
I wore these before I met you.

1946
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:05,070
I wanted you to know it.

1947
02:18:05,571 --> 02:18:08,240
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

1948
02:18:08,866 --> 02:18:13,495
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

1949
02:18:14,163 --> 02:18:15,706
But it didn't work.

1950
02:18:16,332 --> 02:18:18,042
You didn't even get mad.

1951
02:18:21,587 --> 02:18:24,548
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

1952
02:18:25,215 --> 02:18:28,510
That I'd know, but I don't know.

1953
02:18:30,137 --> 02:18:32,264
So, you're going to have to talk.

1954
02:18:33,265 --> 02:18:36,226
I'm hard to get, John T.

1955
02:18:36,310 --> 02:18:38,354
You're going to have to say you want me.

1956
02:18:38,437 --> 02:18:41,065
- Where're you going?
- Downstairs.

1957
02:18:41,148 --> 02:18:42,608
You'd better not.

1958
02:18:43,233 --> 02:18:45,027
Why had I better not?

1959
02:18:45,235 --> 02:18:46,737
Because I'm still sheriff.

1960
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,740
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

1961
02:18:54,036 --> 02:18:55,204
John T.

1962
02:18:57,748 --> 02:19:00,459
I've waited so long for you to say that.

1963
02:19:01,126 --> 02:19:02,711
I thought you were never...

1964
02:19:02,795 --> 02:19:05,047
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

1965
02:19:05,130 --> 02:19:07,424
Just when I think
you're going to say one thing...

1966
02:19:07,508 --> 02:19:10,678
Get those darn things off. I'll wait outside.

1967
02:19:10,761 --> 02:19:13,931
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

1968
02:19:14,723 --> 02:19:17,142
Besides I want you to stay here...

1969
02:19:17,226 --> 02:19:19,812
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

1970
02:19:19,895 --> 02:19:22,273
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

1971
02:19:22,898 --> 02:19:24,858
What I had to go through!

1972
02:19:25,276 --> 02:19:28,737
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

1973
02:19:28,821 --> 02:19:32,324
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never going to say it.

1974
02:19:32,449 --> 02:19:33,492
Say what?

1975
02:19:33,617 --> 02:19:35,244
That you loved me.

1976
02:19:35,327 --> 02:19:37,204
I said I'd arrest you.

1977
02:19:37,454 --> 02:19:41,083
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

1978
02:19:41,458 --> 02:19:44,378
We're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

1979
02:19:44,461 --> 02:19:46,588
Me, I just talk all the time.

1980
02:19:46,714 --> 02:19:48,590
You most certainly do.

1981
02:19:48,716 --> 02:19:51,510
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

1982
02:19:51,594 --> 02:19:53,971
Either that or start talking, too.

1983
02:19:56,265 --> 02:19:57,933
Tell me something.

1984
02:19:58,225 --> 02:20:02,146
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

1985
02:20:02,646 --> 02:20:05,899
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

1986
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:07,526
I like that.

1987
02:20:07,985 --> 02:20:10,029
You're getting better already.

1988
02:20:10,821 --> 02:20:13,490
Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

1989
02:20:28,172 --> 02:20:32,843
- Do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff?
- Not unless you mind your own business.
