1
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,908
Joe, you're under arrest.

2
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,786
Maybe so, but don't turn around, sheriff.

3
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,372
Now what're you gonna do, sheriff?

4
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,300
You can do just about what you want,
Chance.

5
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,513
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

6
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,350
No.

7
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,728
Give me a hand.

8
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,821
-What is all this?
-Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

9
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,075
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

10
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,786
Who the devil do you think
you're ordering around here?

11
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,289
First Burdette's men stop me and
now you stand there and try to--

12
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,919
-Say, seems like I ought to know you.
-I think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

13
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,380
Yeah, I remember you now.

14
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,841
That star you're wearing
kind of threw me off for a minute.

15
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,136
Aren't you the fellow
the Mexicans used to call borrachín?

16
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,223
That's nearly right. Only it's borrachón.

17
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,767
I don't think I've ever seen you
like this before.

18
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,813
You mean sober? You're probably right.

19
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,564
You know what "borrachón" means?

20
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,608
My Spanish ain't too good.

21
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,276
It means drunk.

22
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,822
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me Dude.

23
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,157
Now are you gonna tell your men or do I?

24
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,035
I'll tell my men.

25
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,793
Stand by the wagons, everybody!

26
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,586
Pass the word.

27
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,537
Chance, what's going on here?

28
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,874
People stopping me. Everybody telling me
what I can and can't do.

29
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,209
Next thing, you'll be telling me what to do.

30
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,919
-Pat, I will tell you.
-What?

31
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,547
-Stop your wagons.
-Oh, I give up.

32
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,388
Now don't tell me what's going on.
Just leave me wandering around in the fog.

33
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,433
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

34
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,894
You better look out, Pat,
you'll blow up and bust.

35
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,606
Oh, listen, Chance, remember me?
Your old friend Pat Wheeler.

36
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,566
-Now, will you please--?
-Hey, Chance!

37
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,445
What do you wanna do about this outfit?
Do you wanna take their guns?

38
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,155
Got any new men with you, Pat?

39
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,532
No, nobody except Colorado here.

40
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,243
-Where'd you take him on?
-Fort Worth.

41
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,746
-What does he do?
-I speak English, sheriff...

42
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,081
...if you wanna ask me.

43
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,921
All right, buster, what do you do?

44
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,756
I'm riding guard.

45
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,093
-Pretty young for that, aren't you?
-Just how old do you have to be, sheriff?

46
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,680
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

47
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,683
-Rocky Ryan?
-Well, that's his boy.

48
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,269
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

49
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,606
Well, he better be,
packing a pair of guns.

50
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,277
Now, sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of them.

51
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,404
I could let you have them both.

52
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,615
They wouldn't do me too much good.

53
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,618
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

54
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,580
-Stumpy, didn't I tell--?
-I know. I'm going. I'm going.

55
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,086
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

56
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,130
Thanks, sheriff. I don't want any trouble.

57
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,966
Well, then don't start any.

58
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,552
I won't, unless I tell you first.

59
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,345
That's good enough.

60
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,098
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

61
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,849
I ought to do just that.

62
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,602
-What?
-I'm just guessing, you understand.

63
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,730
It seems to me that you've already
got some trouble here.

64
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,148
You're guessing right.

65
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:31,152
It so happens that part of our load
there is fuel oil and dynamite.

66
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,655
Would you like to have that
sitting next to you?

67
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,073
No, I wouldn't.

68
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,492
They could put them over there
by the creek.

69
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,494
Near the Burdette warehouse.

70
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,706
If it's gonna blow
that's just as good a place as any.

71
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,126
Show them the way, Dude.
You can go along, Colorado.

72
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,420
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

73
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,299
Go ahead.

74
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,067
-Well?
-Let's get out of the middle of the street.

75
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,699
Well, now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns...

76
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,870
...would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

77
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,623
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

78
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,419
-Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?
-That's right.

79
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,880
What are you holding him for?

80
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,258
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

81
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,886
-Murder?
-No other word for it.

82
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,889
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

83
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,141
What does Nathan say about this?

84
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,478
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

85
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,896
You saw part of it.

86
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:53,276
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

87
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,197
Those men over there watching us...

88
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,907
...they're his.

89
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,035
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

90
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,870
Who you got helping you?

91
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,831
You met half of them.

92
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,627
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me, and who else?

93
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,546
Stumpy. You know him.

94
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,341
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

95
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,012
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

96
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,806
That's what I got.

97
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:28,770
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

98
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,399
It's a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

99
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,860
Guess I better see they did it.
I'll see you later.

100
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,292
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

101
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,961
You don't look so good.

102
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,713
I feel worse.

103
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,881
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

104
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,466
I thought you would.

105
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,302
Got some in here. Cold.

106
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,388
Just as long as it's beer.

107
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,313
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

108
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,609
There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

109
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:21,030
I'd be in more trouble if you'd have gotten
picked off while standing at that door.

110
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,282
You'd be in trouble?

111
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,534
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

112
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,494
Don't you never think of me?

113
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,456
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

114
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,500
Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

115
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,878
I told you why I want you back in there...

116
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,590
...and you're gonna stay there with
that cage locked when I'm not around.

117
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,258
-You hear me?
-I heard you.

118
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,010
Those windows, did you fix them?

119
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,387
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

120
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,014
Nothing could get in here now.

121
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,683
-Not even some fresh air.
-That's the way I want it.

122
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,019
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

123
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,565
Five, six days breathing the same air as
Burdette is apt to make a killer out of me.

124
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,026
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

125
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,446
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

126
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,865
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

127
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,035
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

128
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,662
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

129
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,456
-Shut up!
-I take it back, Joe.

130
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,584
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before ...

131
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,712
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

132
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,382
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

133
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,718
What do you want?

134
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,721
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

135
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,724
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

136
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,936
How you holding up, borrachón?

137
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,729
Got the shakes yet?

138
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,776
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

139
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,904
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

140
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,243
-Chance, you gonna let him do that to me?
-I'll do better than that.

141
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,621
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

142
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,920
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

143
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,841
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

144
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,261
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him sleep in it.

145
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,431
Want another beer?
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

146
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,101
No, it wasn't wasted,
except I missed him.

147
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,563
-I don't need any more.
-Hey, in the jail.

148
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,152
That's far enough. What do you want?

149
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,447
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the sheriff.

150
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,449
Hey, Chance, you expecting a package?

151
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,076
Be right out.

152
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,620
-Stumpy?
-Yeah?

153
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,123
Going over to the hotel for a few minutes.

154
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,543
If you don't come back,
me and Joe'll have us a good cry.

155
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,628
Just keep that door locked.

156
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,549
-Thanks for your trouble.
-No trouble at all.

157
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,051
Wheeler said, "Just be careful coming up."

158
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,346
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

159
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,307
Yeah.

160
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,310
There's another one over by the church.

161
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,979
Any use in arresting them?

162
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,523
For just standing around?

163
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,817
All I'd do is get another one.

164
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,320
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of them.

165
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,490
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

166
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,159
Remember that.

167
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,791
Señor Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for--

168
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,043
What you have here?

169
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,128
The package you've been waiting for.

170
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,463
Just in time, señor.

171
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,634
-Carlos! Carlos! Where are you at?
-I'm over here.

172
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,594
You keep it. Consuelo, she comes now.

173
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,514
If you break the dishes, you'll see what
happens. Every day is the same thing....

174
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,600
Carlos. Oh, Señor Chance .

175
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,685
I just ask Carlos if he's...

176
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,271
Carlos, what is wrong?

177
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,483
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

178
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,109
What have you been doing?

179
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,694
What have I been doing?

180
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,365
I've been talking to my friend the sheriff,
that's what I have been doing.

181
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,908
We have important business.

182
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,243
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

183
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,372
Consuelo, look at me . Am I fat?

184
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,500
-I did not say you are fat.
-Please, Consuelo, do not say more.

185
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,293
You already say too much.

186
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,754
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

187
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,047
Come, señor.

188
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,639
The thing is if he ate the chicken or not.

189
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,391
I'm going to see.

190
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,851
You take chances, my friend.

191
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,311
Because I know woman.

192
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,647
She will be mad or she will be sorry.

193
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,358
If it is mad,
she will be much pleasure to make right.

194
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,986
And if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

195
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,029
You do not have women.

196
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,614
So you do not know, señor.

197
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,659
But me, Carlos Robante, I know.

198
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,496
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

199
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,709
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

200
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,755
If I had bought this myself, señor,
everyone in town would have known.

201
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,344
And it's not the sort of thing that Consuelo
would like to have known by everyone.

202
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,809
You see?

203
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,562
And they're not beautiful, señor?

204
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,690
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

205
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,692
You sure you want me to do that?

206
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,985
No. No, señor.

207
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,821
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

208
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,657
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

209
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,871
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

210
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,625
What are you doing here?

211
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,589
Until I saw those things, I was looking
for a towel. I'd like to take a bath.

212
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,216
-Didn't you come in on the stage?
-That's right.

213
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,885
Why aren't you on it?

214
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,804
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

215
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,141
Chihuahua! I forgot.
I start to tell you and I forgot.

216
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,311
-The stage, she did not go.
-Why?

217
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,813
-Something happened with the wheel.
-Where's Jake?

218
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,981
Near the corral.

219
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,234
-He must fix the wheel before he can leave.
-That's just fine.

220
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,406
Hey, sheriff, you forgot your pants.

221
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,669
You reckon they'd try anything tonight?

222
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,339
Could be . Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

223
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,174
That ain't no kind of answer.

224
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,802
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

225
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,557
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-Well, what I wanna know is when.

226
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,226
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

227
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,156
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

228
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,074
I'm full of beer.

229
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,035
It doesn't do any good.

230
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,913
It'll start working on you tomorrow
or the next day.

231
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,087
Stumpy.

232
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,090
We're gonna take a turn
around the town.

233
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,886
-You be all right?
-Of course I'll be all right.

234
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,762
Then get in there where you belong.

235
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,557
I'm going. I'm going.
But you remember one thing:

236
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,935
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

237
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,605
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

238
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,273
We'll holler.

239
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,450
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

240
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,784
Usually do.

241
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,705
Don't wanna do anything different,
they might think we're scared.

242
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,457
Well, aren't we?

243
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,586
I just can't take it sitting in there.

244
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,088
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

245
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,258
Don't set yourself up as being so special.

246
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,011
You'd think you invented the hangover.

247
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,972
I could sure take out a patent for this one .

248
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,977
Take that side.

249
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,433
-Good evening.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,802
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

251
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,846
Don't shoot, sheriff.

252
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,723
Just getting a little air.

253
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,467
I'm getting jumpy.

254
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,136
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

255
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,264
-Get back over there where you belong.
-Yes, Papa.

256
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,156
-Carlos.
-Señor Chance. I been looking for you.

257
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,409
-It is very bad, señor.
-What's wrong?

258
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,661
-Your friend Señor Wheeler.
-What about him?

259
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,540
He is a good friend
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

260
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,251
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

261
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,671
He say, "Why they don't help you?"
That you should have some more help.

262
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,339
He's right, Señor Chance.

263
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,175
But is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

264
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,136
-You tell him.
-Is he in there?

265
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,762
Sí, I think.

266
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,349
Chance, he's over there.

267
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,854
-The queens full.
-That's good. Beats me.

268
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,989
Spare a minute , Pat?

269
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,490
Good evening, sheriff.

270
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,826
-Deal me out.
-Evening.

271
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,298
-You two know each other.
-Yeah.

272
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,049
No, thanks, Carlos.

273
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,512
-Chance, I've been wanting to talk to you.
-You've been talking too much, Pat.

274
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,182
-What do you mean "talking too much"?
-Anybody that...

275
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,769
...sides in with me right now's liable to find
themselves up to their ears in trouble.

276
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,898
Is that why you haven't asked
for any deputies?

277
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,568
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

278
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,740
I was talking about why you haven't asked
for any new deputies. You could get some.

279
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,909
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

280
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,911
Suppose I got them, what'd I have?

281
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,288
Some well-meaning amateurs.

282
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,166
Most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

283
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,920
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

284
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,715
Only thing they're worried about
is earning their pay.

285
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,262
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

286
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,223
A lot of people'd get hurt.

287
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,391
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

288
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,769
He isn't worth one of those
that'd get killed.

289
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,938
Then what are you gonna do?

290
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,024
All you got for help's that old man
down at the jail and this--

291
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,610
Borrachón's the name, Mr. Wheeler.

292
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,821
I'll go outside so you can talk more freely.

293
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,953
Wasn't good, Pat.

294
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,540
-Let's sit down.
-Yeah, I know.

295
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,627
I shouldn't have said it.
I meant nothing by it.

296
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,588
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

297
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,591
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

298
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,718
...without something
to help hold him up.

299
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,595
How long you been coming here?

300
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,138
Going on two years.

301
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,059
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

302
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,686
Dude was good.

303
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,145
He was my deputy.

304
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,481
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

305
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,858
That's pretty hard to believe , Chance .

306
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,944
-What--?
-A girl.

307
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,321
Just a girl that came through on the stage.

308
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,408
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

309
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,827
I tried and he damn near killed me.

310
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,248
Anyway, he was hooked.
Went away with her.

311
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,875
Six months later
he came back without her.

312
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,379
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him borrachón.

313
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,423
-That's Spanish for--
-Yeah, I know.

314
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,174
He told me.

315
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:38,012
So for two years he's been drinking...

316
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:43,767
...all he could buy, or somebody'd
buy for him till last night.

317
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,520
And how long do you think that'll last?

318
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,855
I don't know.

319
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,650
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him, huh?

320
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,195
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

321
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,824
I'm supposed to be your friend too.

322
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,619
Why don't you let me help you?
Deal me in.

323
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,371
-You're not good enough.
-I don't know! I'm as good--

324
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,708
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

325
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,794
-No, thanks, Pat, you keep out of it.
-Hey, that's an idea.

326
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,672
-What?
-Ryan. Colorado you call him.

327
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,508
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

328
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,387
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

329
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,723
We'll see what he says.

330
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,579
-Good evening, sheriff.
-Any luck, kid?

331
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,499
-It's a pretty fast game.
-Son, I ...

332
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,002
...asked you over here
because the sheriff's a friend of mine.

333
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,922
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

334
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,926
-To go against the Burdettes, sheriff?
-That's right.

335
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,053
I told him you were one of the best.

336
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,473
Well...

337
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,435
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

338
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,604
That's minding my own business.

339
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,272
No offense, sheriff.

340
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,817
No offense.

341
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,825
Well, I never expected that.

342
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,785
He showed good sense.

343
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,538
-I'd like to have him.
-I don't see why you--

344
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,790
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

345
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,417
I appreciate it.

346
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,002
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

347
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,923
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

348
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,804
Enough for me for a while.

349
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,180
You leaving?

350
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,267
-Maybe I'll have some luck now.
-Maybe.

351
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,310
If you play your cards right.

352
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,438
Hope you leave
some of your luck with me .

353
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,315
I'll come back
and give it to you next time.

354
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,942
We'll ante up.

355
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,238
-Dude?
-Yeah?

356
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,324
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

357
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,346
Oh, hi, sheriff.

358
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,641
I'm sorry about those pants.

359
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,810
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

360
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,730
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

361
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,357
Sure.

362
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,364
Well, sheriff, what is it?

363
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,035
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

364
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,038
It's three cards short.

365
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,124
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

366
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,044
Why--?
Well, why do you tell me?

367
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,840
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

368
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,384
-And did you talk to him?
-He's still there.

369
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,844
You were leaving.

370
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,972
And I was a winner.

371
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,391
Is that all you've got to go on?

372
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,604
No. Here's a handbill...

373
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,317
...about a gambler
they're interested in catching up with.

374
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,194
You know him?

375
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,530
It says he had a girl with him.

376
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:29,493
Says the girI's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

377
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,706
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

378
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,920
Now, the man isn't our...

379
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,257
...friend in the checkered vest
but you could be the girl.

380
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,802
Yes, I could be.

381
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,596
As a matter of fact, I am.

382
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,435
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

383
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:00,232
You'd better give me the money you won.
I'll see that it gets back to the right people.

384
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,151
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

385
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:08,115
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

386
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,827
But I'm not gonna make it that easy.

387
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,789
You've made me mad, sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

388
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,125
So you're gonna have to prove
I've got them.

389
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,794
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

390
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,629
-Search you?
-That's right.

391
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,757
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

392
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,428
Let's see,
the cards could be in my purse...

393
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,221
...but they're not.

394
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,683
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings, garters.

395
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,061
-All right, all right.
-I don't wear anything like those red pants.

396
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,273
And my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

397
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,276
You've got a job to do,
where do you intend to begin?

398
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,279
-That's about enough.
-You have to prove I've got those cards.

399
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,407
-You keep going and I'm apt to do it!
-I'm not so sure.

400
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,785
I think you're embarrassed.

401
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,079
-And if you're not--
-If he's not...

402
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,331
...he ought to be.

403
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,999
What're you doing here?

404
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,001
I don't think she has the cards.

405
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,587
If that's what you're looking for.

406
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,672
How do you know?

407
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,175
I think the fellow in the checkered vest
has them.

408
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,843
Well, why didn't you find out?

409
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,846
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

410
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,390
Now I'm telling you.
I'm gonna see if he's got them.

411
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,017
Wait a minute.

412
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,312
-You wanna come along?
-I do.

413
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,189
I'm interested too.

414
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,418
Ace high straight.

415
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,047
Looks like I got the lady's luck.
How come--?

416
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,341
All right, keep your hands on the table.

417
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,009
Right where they are.

418
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,638
Put your hands back.

419
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,181
Where they were.

420
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,238
Hold out.

421
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,865
He's all yours, sheriff.

422
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,242
Get up.

423
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,536
Get up!

424
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,040
We don't like tinhorns around here, mister.

425
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,668
Carlos, lock him in his room.

426
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,254
Let him out in time for the stage.

427
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,674
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

428
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,426
Thanks, Colorado.

429
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:36,263
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

430
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,568
I guess I was wrong about you
having those cards.

431
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,987
Is that all, sheriff?

432
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,115
Well, I'm not gonna apologize,
if that's what you mean.

433
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,326
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

434
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,536
That's right.

435
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,873
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

436
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,293
ldea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

437
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,961
Made a joke of it.

438
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,756
Instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

439
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,134
Tell me, sheriff,
what should I have done?

440
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,178
-Well--
-I'd like to know.

441
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,598
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

442
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,600
I'd like to know what to do about it.

443
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,396
Well, you could quit playing cards...

444
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,981
...wearing feathers.

445
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,483
No, sheriff.

446
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,861
No, I'm not gonna do that.

447
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,949
You see, that's what I'd do...

448
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,329
...if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

449
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,934
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

450
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,977
Not since he went up the street.

451
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,021
I think that's him coming now.

452
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,745
Get him out of here!

453
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,962
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

454
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,258
Got him in the back.

455
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,051
He's dead.

456
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:44,516
Didn't take them long,
less than an hour after he offered to help.

457
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,061
Don't get many friends like that.

458
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,231
You were smart, Colorado.

459
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,484
-No one's come out of the stable.
-I wanna go with you.

460
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,237
Wanna help get the man
that killed your boss?

461
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,240
-Wouldn't you?
-I wouldn't have let him get shot.

462
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,993
You had a chance to get in this
and you didn't want it.

463
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,120
Stay out, we don't need you.

464
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,039
You wanna do something,
get him out of the street.

465
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,755
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

466
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,424
How you going in?

467
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,802
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

468
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,763
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down.

469
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,433
-No, there isn't.
-I thought so.

470
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,727
I'll let you know when I get there.

471
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,168
Chance, you all right?

472
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,603
Chance, out here .

473
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,855
You all right?

474
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,024
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

475
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,026
He came out the door, running fast.

476
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,362
-You missed him.
-I couldn't get a good shot.

477
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,907
-Might've winged him.
-Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

478
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,450
He hasn't got away yet...

479
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,328
...or I wouldn't be standing here.
He went in the saloon.

480
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,706
-He's still in there.
-How do you know?

481
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,543
Can see both doors from here.
And there ain't any others.

482
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,045
I'm an expert on saloons.

483
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,257
-Get a chance to see who he was?
-No, but we'll know.

484
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,386
He'll have muddy boots.
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

485
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,431
You figure we're going in there after him?

486
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,308
-Aren't we?
-We used to.

487
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,728
There's eight or ten Burdette men in there.

488
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,063
Maybe more.

489
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,067
You take the back door, I'll go in the front.

490
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,987
-I'd like to try--
-You'd like to try what?

491
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,574
I been going in the back door.

492
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,243
They haven't been letting me in the front.

493
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,914
-Think you're good enough?
-I'd like to find out.

494
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,583
So would I .

495
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,586
I'll let you know when I get around back.

496
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,234
Begin with you, Charlie.

497
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,153
That shotgun you keep under the bar.

498
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,989
Pick it up by the barrel.

499
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,658
Easy.

500
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,495
Thought you were gonna ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

501
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,996
Shotgun first.

502
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,998
Set it down.

503
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,668
Back up.

504
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:31,010
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

505
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,146
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

506
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,191
You're gonna stand up
and stand real still.

507
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,193
Now!

508
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,703
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns...

509
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,705
...drop them and step back.

510
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Come on.

511
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,718
There's no reason
for you to move, Charlie.

512
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,059
-What's this all about?
-We're looking for a man that ran in here.

513
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,853
Nobody's run in here.

514
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,189
We'll remember you said that.

515
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,860
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

516
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,863
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

517
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,589
Who saw a man run in here?

518
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,175
I did.

519
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,803
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

520
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,307
Clean as a whistle.

521
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,018
Dude, you been seeing things again.

522
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,853
You better have a drink.

523
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,735
Dude. Maybe this'll help.

524
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,571
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie .

525
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,990
I thought you would.

526
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,666
You want that gun, pick it up.

527
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,003
I wish you would.

528
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,801
He stepped in a puddle, all right.

529
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,429
He's the fellow we wanted.

530
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,349
I guess this is his.

531
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,810
A nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

532
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:30,231
It's just about what Burdette would figure
a man's life was worth.

533
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,109
That's earning money the hard way.

534
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,114
Paid killer.

535
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,410
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

536
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,748
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

537
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,458
Nobody paid me.

538
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,001
Nobody!

539
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,046
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

540
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,048
Chance.

541
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,301
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
Get up!

542
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,429
You're all in it.

543
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,140
The whole lot of you.

544
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,226
You're gonna get out of town.

545
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,729
Take your boy here with you.

546
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,274
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

547
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,570
You can tell him anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay them more...

548
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,739
...because they're gonna earn it.

549
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,909
Charlie, I want you to...

550
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,538
You finished yet, Dude?

551
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,833
-You in a hurry?
-Not especially.

552
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,222
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

553
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,683
-Yeah, Dude, l--
-You want it back?

554
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,644
-Sure.
-You know how to get it?

555
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,648
Yeah.

556
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,708
That's all for me, Chance.

557
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,002
-Charlie, come here .
-Yeah, sheriff.

558
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,462
You're going with us.

559
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,464
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

560
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,300
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

561
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,720
All right, back up and give him room.

562
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,768
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

563
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,820
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

564
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,905
Why, you're crazy!

565
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,366
And you are too. What happened?

566
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,410
He was hiding in the loft.

567
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,413
-Who got him?
-Dude did. One shot.

568
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,332
I wish I could've seen that.

569
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,334
I wish Wheeler could've too.

570
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,504
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

571
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,674
Leastways it would've showed him
he was wrong about Dude.

572
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,968
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

573
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,429
You were good in there tonight.

574
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,514
Good as you've ever been.

575
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,893
But you know one reason
why you got by with it?

576
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,022
They were laughing at you.
Borrachón talking big.

577
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,609
You surprised them.
But next time they'll be ready for you.

578
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,111
Next time they'll shoot first
and laugh afterwards.

579
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,156
-Listen to him.
-Don't get too cocksure.

580
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,200
What a stinker!
Spit in his eye, Dude.

581
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,744
Never mind him,
he's always been a stinker.

582
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,371
If he were to change,
that would worry me.

583
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,876
You'd think I could get one
out of a whole sack.

584
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,545
How'd you know
that fellow was in the loft?

585
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,382
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

586
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,385
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

587
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,513
I could've sure used a drink then.

588
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,724
If he was bleeding that means
you hit him on the run outside.

589
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,061
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

590
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,356
Ain't good either.
We had to go in after him.

591
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,819
Chance, nobody please you no how?

592
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,904
You got a light, Stumpy?

593
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,407
Hey, in the jail! It's me, Colorado.

594
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,076
Let him in.

595
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,121
Come on in.

596
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,752
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

597
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,629
Dude did.

598
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,757
Thanks, Dude.

599
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,511
Gonna bury him in the morning.

600
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,097
I've just been to the undertaker's with him.

601
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,599
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

602
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,726
I took out $60 he owed me.

603
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,020
You got yours.

604
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,814
How about the rest?

605
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,816
Did he owe them too?

606
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,234
Probably did.

607
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,820
I didn't think about that.

608
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,948
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

609
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,618
-Does that mean you hold the wagons too?
-That's right.

610
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,495
Meantime, I'm broke.

611
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,541
If you or any of the rest are
short eating money...

612
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,169
...I'll go good for it.
I'll tell them at the hotel.

613
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,715
I wish you'd do that soon,
before anything happens to you.

614
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,009
No offense again, sheriff.

615
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,974
It's nice to see a smart kid for a change.

616
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,935
Yeah, he ain't like
the usual kid with a gun.

617
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,147
I wonder if
he's as good as Wheeler said.

618
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,649
I'd say he is.

619
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,528
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

620
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,291
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I was beginning to think you didn't.

621
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,751
I wanted to talk to you.

622
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,170
Don't tell me you're still looking
for an apology.

623
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,924
No. No, I was thinking of making one .

624
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,468
I was pretty much of a....

625
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,721
I got out of line tonight
and I'm not proud of it.

626
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,806
My only excuse is...

627
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,060
...I didn't know about all
the trouble you were in.

628
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,654
I'm gonna have a drink. How about you?

629
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,490
Thanks, I'd like one.

630
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,495
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

631
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,956
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

632
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,210
That's why he got shot.
Or did Carlos tell you that too?

633
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,795
Yes, he told me.

634
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:31,300
How does--?
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

635
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,762
Gets lazy. Gets tired...

636
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,764
...of selling his gun all over...

637
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,724
...decides to sell it in one place.

638
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,935
I'd say you made a poor sale.

639
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,729
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

640
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:47,692
But it's still a sale
and it's too late to back out.

641
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,904
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

642
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,448
She gets married.

643
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,119
-Handbill says he was a cheat.
-He wasn't a cheat then.

644
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,373
That came later, after his luck turned.

645
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,751
It was probably my fault he cheated.

646
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,920
He liked to buy me things.

647
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,881
-Then why did you leave him?
-I didn't.

648
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,427
He left me rather suddenly.

649
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,180
He was caught just like that man tonight...

650
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,183
...only his luck had run out.

651
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,060
He was shot.

652
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,855
You've had a rough time.

653
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,943
You're wrong, sheriff.
I've had a good time.

654
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,446
I liked gambling.

655
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,782
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

656
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:42,455
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him.

657
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,584
If I had known, it might have been rough.

658
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,919
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

659
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,588
When did this happen?

660
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,882
About four months ago.

661
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,429
Since then I've been working...

662
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,682
...to get enough money for stage fare.

663
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,144
-You going home?
-I haven't any.

664
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,604
Señor Chance!

665
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:09,356
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

666
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,860
You should be in bed.
Last night you slept just a little bit.

667
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,905
But tonight, señor, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

668
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,240
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

669
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,659
Don't want anybody else helping me.

670
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,622
Señor Chance, this is my hotel...

671
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,832
...and you are a guest under my roof.

672
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,337
And I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do, señor.

673
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,882
-All right, Carlos.
-What you do?

674
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,718
-I'll sleep in the jail.
-But you can't sleep...

675
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,764
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

676
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,683
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

677
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,228
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear them.

678
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,896
-One thing.
-What?

679
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,357
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

680
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,151
-But it's not enough.
-Will you?

681
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,905
I say no more.
Have a good sleep.

682
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,199
I don't want to meddle in your business.

683
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,700
I'm gonna turn in.

684
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,746
-If I don't see you in the morning, so long.
-So long.

685
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,083
By the way, where are you going?

686
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,211
Some place where
there aren't any handbills.

687
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,382
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

688
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,511
I know the sheriff that got these out.

689
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,557
I'll write him a letter, get them called in.

690
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,853
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

691
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,822
Well...

692
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,117
Thanks.

693
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,868
-Carlos!
-Señor.

694
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,913
It's after 7 . Why didn't you wake me up?
You said you would.

695
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,247
-The girl.
-The girl?

696
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,250
-That one with the feathers.
-What's she got to do with it?

697
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,960
She told me not to wake you.

698
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,296
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

699
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,549
-Sitting outside my room in a chair?
-All night long.

700
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,843
She was still there
two, three minutes ago.

701
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,555
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you, señor.

702
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,474
Well, you can tell her...

703
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,518
-The fool!
-Tell her she's a fool?

704
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,563
No! I'll tell her myself.

705
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,440
You tell her she's a fool?

706
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,108
I didn't say I was.

707
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,320
He say , "Not to wake him up."

708
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,572
She say, "To wake him up."

709
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,699
Me, I'm in the middle.

710
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,330
-Who is it?
-It's me, the sheriff.

711
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,082
Oh, just a minute.

712
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,465
Come on in.

713
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,887
Hi.

714
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,140
-Did you get a good night's sleep?
-Who, me?

715
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,434
Yes, you.
There's nobody else in the room.

716
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,396
Carlos had to go and talk.

717
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,900
I couldn't sleep anyway.
I was just as well off out there in the hall.

718
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,612
If anybody had come in, you'd have yelled
before they shot you. Is that it?

719
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,780
Fool women.

720
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,991
-Didn't you hear me say that--?
-I know.

721
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,202
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

722
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,997
-Why did you do it?
-You weren't supposed to know.

723
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,666
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

724
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,837
-He didn't wake me up!
-Don't blame him, that was my fault.

725
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,548
All right, nothing happened,
nobody got hurt.

726
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,009
You got some sleep, I lost some.

727
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,304
Now I'm tired and you're mad
and I'm getting mad. So...

728
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,888
...you'd better go on.

729
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,057
I'm gonna get some sleep too.

730
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,059
Well, you can't go to bed now.

731
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,769
I can't?

732
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,897
Well, you just see whether or not
I can go to bed now--

733
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,233
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

734
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,111
-What did you say?
-The stage, it leaves in an hour.

735
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,739
-Well, why didn't you tell me?
-I just did!

736
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:31,493
Well, then you better get out then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

737
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,871
I can't do it if you stand around talking.

738
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,622
You're doing most of the talking.

739
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,375
That's right. And I can't do that
and bathe and pack.

740
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,461
-Will you just go on and go?
-I'm going.

741
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:42,296
Then do it, don't talk any more.

742
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,257
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything.

743
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,926
So, just go on
and let me get on the stage.

744
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,138
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

745
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,432
But I just wanted to...

746
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,935
You could have at least let me finish.

747
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,648
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

748
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,569
I guess I talk too much.

749
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,030
You tell her?

750
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,449
-Tell her what?
-That she's a fool.

751
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,577
She's going on the stage?

752
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,080
She's going on the stage .
You make sure she does.

753
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,624
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

754
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,043
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

755
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,461
I hold you responsible.

756
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,880
Responsible, me? Yes.

757
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,470
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

758
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,888
So I see .

759
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,642
There's a lot of people in town today.

760
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,560
Did you hear why?

761
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:43,232
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

762
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,401
Most likely they here to watch.

763
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,655
Well, if he does,
they may see something.

764
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,616
-I don't like it.
-Neither do I .

765
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,042
Tom, hang your gun on the fence .
You'll pick it up when you leave.

766
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,003
Sure enough.

767
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,156
That's far enough.

768
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,491
I got orders to take your guns.

769
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,286
Suppose we don't wanna give them up?

770
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,164
Think you're good enough
to take them against six of us?

771
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,417
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

772
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,379
You won't need a gun no more
because you'll be the first man I'd get.

773
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,881
Come on, let's go.

774
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,049
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

775
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,930
-Hold it, Harris!
-He cut my rein.

776
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,225
I'd say he did it on purpose.
And I'm telling you to hold it.

777
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,901
Now just hang your guns on the fence
and you can pick them up when you leave.

778
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,444
Hang up your guns.

779
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,163
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

780
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,500
-Not bad, Mr. Burdette.
-How does that happen?

781
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,086
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

782
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,631
If you mean being sober...

783
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,717
...I'm getting practice on account
of your brother.

784
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,093
I don't follow you.

785
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,721
You don't have to follow me,
Mr. Burdette. Matt!

786
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,141
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

787
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,353
That extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence too.

788
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,610
-You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
-All right, Mr. Burdette...

789
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,404
...let's get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

790
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,448
You should enjoy it, Dude.

791
00:58:56,658 --> 00:59:00,285
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

792
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,974
Stumpy!

793
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,268
Burdette and his men are coming in.

794
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:26,979
Well, don't put down
no red carpet for them.

795
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,606
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

796
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:30,983
You do that.

797
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,571
Good morning, sheriff.

798
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,656
Hello, Burdette.

799
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,158
Been expecting you.

800
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,244
I want to see my brother.

801
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,787
You can come in.

802
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:48,709
But that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

803
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,003
Go on across the street with the others.

804
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,671
Do as he says.

805
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,425
What're all those people doing in town?

806
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,135
I didn't ask.

807
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,848
Didn't ask them to come,
or ask them why they're here.

808
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,184
But I think they're watching to see
what you're gonna do.

809
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,232
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

810
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,320
Now do you wanna keep talking to me
or see your brother?

811
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,697
See my brother.

812
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,868
We're coming in, Stumpy.

813
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,371
Well, come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

814
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,173
All right, Stumpy, open up.

815
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,342
What's the password?

816
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:42,346
-Come on.
-Oh, I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

817
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:46,350
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Well, look who's here.

818
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,894
Place is getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

819
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,395
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

820
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,066
That fellow round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

821
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,233
Nathan.

822
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,195
Well, Joe.

823
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,739
Looks like they gave you a going-over.

824
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,491
Our friend here .

825
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,785
Why?

826
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,580
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

827
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,290
It wasn't murder.

828
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,335
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

829
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,547
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

830
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,885
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

831
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,970
But you knew that already...

832
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:27,391
...otherwise you wouldn't have
set things up the way you did.

833
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:28,934
Just what have I done?

834
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,104
You're a rich man, Burdette.
Big ranch.

835
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,107
Pay a lot of people to do
what you want them to do.

836
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,317
And you got a brother.

837
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,986
He's no good, but he's your brother.

838
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:44,241
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for them.

839
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,951
I don't like that kind of talk.

840
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,412
-You're accusing me--
-Let's get this straight.

841
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,080
You don't like.

842
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,124
I don't like a lot of things.

843
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,627
I don't like your men sitting on the road
bottling up this town.

844
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,965
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned.

845
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,301
And I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help...

846
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,554
...and 20 minutes later he's dead!

847
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,516
And I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

848
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,895
What're you gonna do about it?

849
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,733
I thought you'd get around to that.

850
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,902
I'm gonna sit here
with your brother in my lap...

851
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,822
...until the United States marshal
gets here.

852
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,991
That'll be about six days.

853
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:29,536
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel.

854
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,415
But I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

855
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,167
Now I'm running out of breath.

856
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,835
You talk if you want to.

857
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,589
He talks awful big for a man
that's all alone...

858
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,341
...except for a barfly and a cripple.

859
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,554
-You can get me out of here any--
-Shut up, Joe!

860
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,766
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

861
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:55,395
He sees Stumpy here sitting around
the corner locked in with you.

862
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,774
And if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

863
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,693
If any trouble starts around this jail...

864
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,822
...before anybody can get to you,
you're gonna get accidentally shot.

865
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,700
I can practical guarantee that.

866
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,788
I see you still have
a little grudge against us.

867
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,709
Four hundred and sixty acres
might be little to you, Nathan.

868
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,045
But it was a lot of country to me.

869
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:24,049
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

870
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,384
He's smarter than I thought.

871
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,222
You know,
a court might just call that murder too.

872
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,682
Oh, hell, what's the difference?

873
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,851
We'd all be dead by then.

874
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,354
You got anything else
you wanna say, Burdette?

875
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,233
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

876
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,402
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them...

877
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,405
...what you say they've done
or what they might do.

878
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,407
I want to make that clear.

879
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,326
Well, I'll help you make it clear.

880
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,120
I don't think
Joe's got a friend in the world.

881
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:58,583
And he won't have any unless somebody
buys them for him at $50 a head.

882
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,378
Like the fellow that shot Wheeler.

883
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,089
You made it clear.

884
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,424
All right, Stumpy.

885
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,426
-Nathan.
-Just sit tight, Joe.

886
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,512
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

887
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,224
You do that, because part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

888
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,185
Now sometimes it takes
quite a spell to find out.

889
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,568
-He didn't have much to say, did he?
-No.

890
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,951
What'd you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

891
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,536
Anything they're gonna do...

892
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,414
...is planned already,
or he wouldn't have come in here.

893
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,917
Throwing him in with Joe would give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

894
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,377
I never thought of that.

895
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,796
-What do you think'll happen?
-I don't know.

896
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,965
You can think, can't you?
Any man can--

897
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:51,052
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

898
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,680
Careful how you talk to me .
You hear what Joe said.

899
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:57,142
You're alone except for a barfly
and an old cripple.

900
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:01,313
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

901
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,316
I gotta fix your supper for you tonight.

902
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,739
Señor Chance. Señor Chance.

903
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,324
It's me, Carlos.

904
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,825
Come on in.

905
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,786
-What do you want?
-I wanna talk to you.

906
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,371
Did the girl get...?

907
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,957
What happened to your eye?

908
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:25,170
-You told me to put the lady on the stage.
-Oh, she did that? What did you do?

909
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,797
-She did not do it.
-I thought you said she did.

910
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:31,927
I say, "You tell me to put her on the stage."
Consuelo, she hit me in the eye.

911
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,263
-Wait, I'm a little mixed up.
-Do not talk. I tell you.

912
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,223
-Go ahead.
-It is better if I tell you.

913
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,894
You told me to put her on the stage.
The stage is ready, but she don't come.

914
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,521
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said she ain't coming.

915
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,191
-I go and get her, she said she don't go.
-Did she go?

916
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,860
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

917
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,988
She say, no, she is responsible.
And I say, "That may be."

918
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:55,533
I pick her up. Then Consuelo say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

919
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:59,037
I say, "I take her to the stage."
The woman said she don't want to go.

920
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,747
-Did she go on the stage?
-Please.

921
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:04,250
Consuelo tell me, "Put her down."
I said, "I am responsible."

922
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:07,671
Consuelo thinks that mean something else.
So she give me this eye .

923
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,090
-What did you do?
-"Do"? What can I do?

924
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,591
My arms is full of the lady.

925
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:16,054
I can do nothing. I drop her on the floor.
She yells. And she said I tried to kill her.

926
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,722
Did the girl get on the stage?

927
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,558
No, she did not go!
But Jake say he couldn't wait.

928
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,352
-Why?
-He say he must leave.

929
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,021
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

930
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,149
No. She didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

931
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,945
Please, Señor Chance. You come and tell
Consuelo what "responsible" means.

932
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,697
Stumpy, we're going out.

933
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,908
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

934
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,419
The door's unlocked.

935
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,635
Well, I didn't go.

936
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,387
I can see that.

937
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,016
I don't know...

938
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,103
...I had everything all packed,
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready...

939
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,064
...and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

940
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,775
It was me saying it.

941
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,487
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, sheriff?

942
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:19,075
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

943
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,286
Chance, John T.

944
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,705
"T" for trouble.

945
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,624
I always make you mad, don't I, John T.?

946
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,712
Well, then, don't make me
tell you why I stayed.

947
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,966
I won't make it any harder for you.

948
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,844
I won't get in your way. I'll just be here.

949
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,722
You don't owe me a thing.

950
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,349
And you won't owe me when it's all over.

951
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:46,978
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

952
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,816
No, you won't even have to tell me.

953
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:54,819
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

954
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,739
Is that fair, John T.?

955
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,663
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to.

956
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:11,419
But just say something.

957
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:17,050
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different.

958
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,510
But I am.

959
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,680
That's all I wanted to hear.

960
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,786
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

961
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,789
It's better when two people do it.

962
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,377
Well, I've kept you long enough.

963
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,380
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

964
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,003
Hi, Chance .

965
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:03,007
It's getting too dark to do any good
out there. I'd just be a sitting duck.

966
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,760
Anything happen when Burdette left?

967
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,553
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

968
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,514
What was the shot when they came in?

969
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,934
-That gunslinger of his was on the prod.
-What did he do?

970
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,020
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

971
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,523
I took care of that.
What happened here?

972
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,899
Not much.

973
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,529
That tune, it's been playing it all day.

974
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,072
What is it?

975
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,492
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

976
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,704
Evening, sheriff.

977
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:34,956
Colorado. What do you want?

978
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,958
Just curious again.

979
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,043
How'd you come out with Burdette?

980
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,087
He wanted to talk to his brother.

981
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,548
-What'd he have to say?
-Nothing.

982
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,466
You mean he didn't say anything?

983
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,302
Why are you so interested?

984
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,470
Because he's talking now.

985
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,222
Hear that music?

986
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,182
He told the man to play it.

987
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,393
What is it?

988
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:58,521
They call it "The Deguello,"
"The Cutthroat Song."

989
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,815
The Mexicans played it
for those Texas boys...

990
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,318
...when they had them
bottled up in the Alamo.

991
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,237
Played it day and night till it was all over.

992
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,740
Now do you know what he means by it?

993
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,241
No quarter.

994
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,579
-No mercy for the losers.
-You'll be hearing a lot of it.

995
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,248
I guess we made him talk after all.

996
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,876
Just thought you'd like to know, sheriff.

997
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,353
Stumpy!

998
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:23,606
-What?
-They don't need any help with that tune.

999
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,234
What's the matter,
is it getting through to you?

1000
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,160
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1001
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:40,415
I watched it clear through the valley.

1002
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,169
In about six days the marshal will get here.

1003
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,921
That's what I figured.

1004
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,885
Oh, the girl wasn't on the stage.

1005
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:56,722
I know that.

1006
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,685
Tell her she could stay?

1007
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,270
No, she...

1008
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,149
Yes, I did. What about it?

1009
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,025
Nothing, nothing at all.

1010
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,861
You were going to say something.

1011
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,779
I remembered in time.

1012
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:17,326
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1013
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,872
I remember you told me she was no good.

1014
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,250
I didn't believe you, but you were right.

1015
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,711
So naturally I figured you're an expert.

1016
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,672
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1017
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,551
I just hope
you have better luck than I had.

1018
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:39,724
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1019
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,559
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1020
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:42,727
Maybe.

1021
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,228
But I doubt it.

1022
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:48,065
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1023
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:52,111
If you go by the hotel pick up
some coffee and sugar, would you?

1024
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,529
Joe complaining?

1025
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:55,364
Him? He don't get no sugar.

1026
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,909
His coffee's water poured
over the old grounds.

1027
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,036
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1028
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:04,373
Before I forget, your gun's a little stiff.
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1029
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,751
I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1030
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,671
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

1031
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:13,174
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1032
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,136
-I forgot all about them.
-Your memory is no better than mine.

1033
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,764
They been locked up over a year
except when you...

1034
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,475
...took them out
to clean them and oil them.

1035
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,943
Where'd you get these?

1036
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:35,238
Bought them off the fellow
you sold them to.

1037
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:39,659
I didn't...

1038
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,120
I don't know how to....

1039
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:47,750
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee .

1040
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,169
Ain't you gonna tell me
to get back in there?

1041
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,089
No, stay out here and get shot.

1042
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,508
I might do that just for spite .

1043
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,677
Might get a laugh out of you.

1044
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,846
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1045
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,660
-Feels good.
-Come on.

1046
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:25,329
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1047
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:26,998
Same as before.

1048
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:29,834
In that case take out
what you gave for these guns.

1049
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,210
No hurry.

1050
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,422
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1051
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:38,342
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

1052
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,594
No need of that.

1053
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,680
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1054
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,308
I got them at the hotel.

1055
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:48,227
You been keeping them all this time?

1056
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,355
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1057
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,902
You could use a bath and a shave too.

1058
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,698
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1059
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,202
-Chance?
-Yeah?

1060
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,704
They'll fit.

1061
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:08,706
Thanks.

1062
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:41,197
There you are.

1063
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:43,658
Thank you.

1064
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:51,832
How about you, John T.?
Shall I work on you?

1065
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,043
I do my own shaving.

1066
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,170
I thought you did.

1067
01:17:56,546 --> 01:17:58,547
I was just reminding you.

1068
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,348
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1069
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,435
You sure could.

1070
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,315
I'll let you keep it for me.

1071
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,737
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1072
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:23,781
Anytime, because I'll be here.

1073
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:27,118
Oh, I didn't tell you, John T.,
Carlos is giving me a job.

1074
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:30,496
Good for Carlos. Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1075
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:33,457
You in a hurry, John T.?
I'd like to talk to you.

1076
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,335
-I'll wait for you.
-Thanks, Dude.

1077
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,463
-I just wanted to ask you--
-What's this about a job?

1078
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:43,509
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1079
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:45,469
Tending bar?

1080
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,304
Among other things.

1081
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,556
You...

1082
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,308
-You think I shouldn't?
-Why ask me?

1083
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,310
The way you said "tending bar."

1084
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:56,272
-All right, I won't do it.
-I didn't say not to.

1085
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,815
But you don't like the idea.

1086
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,609
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1087
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:02,778
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1088
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:04,572
-I'm not mad.
-You're not?

1089
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,616
-You'd make anybody mad.
-I suppose I would.

1090
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:12,371
Well, as long as you haven't anything
against it, I'll take the job.

1091
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,581
Well, go ahead.

1092
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,291
Thanks, I will.

1093
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,461
What were you gonna ask me?

1094
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:22,006
-Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.
-What were you going to ask?

1095
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,675
Whether you were gonna sleep
in the hotel tonight.

1096
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:28,596
Get one thing straight. There'll be no more
chair-sitting outside this door.

1097
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,514
Oh, I know. I've given that up.

1098
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:34,477
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1099
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,520
Anyone looking
wouldn't look there first.

1100
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:39,356
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1101
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,402
Besides, I have a rocking chair,
it's more comfortable.

1102
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:47,198
Just an idea. You can think about it.

1103
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:50,367
When you're in a little better humor.

1104
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,296
Chance! Señor Chance!

1105
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,381
The shot came from the jail.

1106
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,560
Chance, look out!

1107
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:17,937
Don't go in there.

1108
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,397
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1109
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,234
Stumpy! You all right?

1110
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:26,987
Sure I am, but there's a feller out there
with a black hat that ain't.

1111
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,281
And I'm that fellow.

1112
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,202
Coming in.

1113
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,539
Look what he did to my hat.

1114
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,168
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1115
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,588
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1116
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,716
-Fool almost blowed my head off.
-How'd I know it was you?

1117
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,261
You get yourself dolled up
like Astor's pet horse...

1118
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:53,681
...and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1119
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:54,849
Look at this hat.

1120
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,810
If you hadn't ducked,
that's what your head would look like.

1121
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,104
I never would have fired
if I knew it was you.

1122
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:02,773
Okay, I know.
Just stop talking, will you?

1123
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,526
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1124
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,027
You could have hollered.

1125
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:10,364
Just because you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1126
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,868
It's my fault. I should have yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1127
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,287
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1128
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,915
You been going around for years
like something the cat dragged in...

1129
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,585
-...and now you expect--
-Shut up!

1130
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:27,715
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1131
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,634
Don't let me tell you again.

1132
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,820
You're getting a little touchy, aren't you?

1133
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,032
I've been listening to
that old fool talk until I....

1134
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,035
All right, I'm wrong.

1135
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,121
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1136
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,332
He's the one that's scared.

1137
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,752
We've been pampering you too much.

1138
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,630
You better get some sleep.

1139
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:20,351
You know, he acts like I done it
on purpose. And I didn't.

1140
01:22:20,518 --> 01:22:22,227
You see that door there?

1141
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:24,855
That look like I done it on purpose?

1142
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,650
It's gonna get cold here at night.

1143
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:31,612
And I'm gonna leave it get cold.
Because I ain't gonna fix that door.

1144
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,033
It wasn't my fault.

1145
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,119
Were it?

1146
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,210
I know.

1147
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,922
I'll fix the door.

1148
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,230
Hi, sheriff.

1149
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:18,826
Well, how do you like your new job?

1150
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,286
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1151
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:25,457
You through for the day?
Going to bed?

1152
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:26,959
I thought I would.

1153
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,253
-Can I make you some coffee?
-No, thanks.

1154
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:30,921
-Anything to eat?
-Nope.

1155
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,423
How about a drink?

1156
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,426
I'll take a drink.

1157
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:39,263
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1158
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,307
Tired, aren't you, John T.?

1159
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,519
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1160
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,354
All I want is that drink.

1161
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,859
Then this is all I can do for you?

1162
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:55,946
I thought you said I could think about it.

1163
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:59,575
You're right. I did.

1164
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,827
Put it on the tab.

1165
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:05,247
And in case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1166
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,544
Get a good night's sleep.

1167
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,338
You're not helping me any.

1168
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,085
-Good morning, Dude.
-Good morning.

1169
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:16,670
Have a good night?

1170
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,422
All right, I guess.

1171
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,591
-Eat anything?
-Well, I--

1172
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,217
This morning?

1173
01:26:22,802 --> 01:26:24,094
Stumpy fixed something.

1174
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:27,139
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1175
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,933
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good...

1176
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:33,187
...didn't eat anything.
I had a beer and it didn't do any good.

1177
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:34,938
Think you can stand your watch?

1178
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:37,441
When I can't do that I'll let you know.

1179
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,004
-That's enough.
-Yeah.

1180
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:42,798
Where's his hat?

1181
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:52,474
Get out there.
We'll be along as soon as we get him tied.

1182
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:07,364
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1183
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,574
Oh, he's suffering thunderation, Chance.

1184
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:14,204
His mind's just beginning to work again,
and he sees what he done to himself.

1185
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,373
Well, ain't pretty.

1186
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,709
He's gotta sweat it out.

1187
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,920
And don't let him cry
on your shoulder either.

1188
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:23,297
He ain't done it yet.

1189
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:26,216
Why are you so goddarned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1190
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:29,553
-You got any tobacco?
-No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1191
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,222
He used it up fast.
You gotta get some for yourself.

1192
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,100
But what I'm asking you
is why are you picking on Dude?

1193
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:39,187
All right, be nice to him
and he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1194
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,898
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1195
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:45,819
I guess some folks is built that way.
But that wouldn't work with me.

1196
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:48,613
You could at least have a kind word
for me now and then.

1197
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:50,949
Considering what I have to do around here.

1198
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:55,370
The sweeping, and the cooking, and
the nursemaiding that killer back there.

1199
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,165
Not even a "thank you" do I get.

1200
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:00,167
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1201
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,627
You're a treasure.

1202
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,254
Well...

1203
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,841
-I don't know what I'd do without you.
-Yeah, well....

1204
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:12,804
Go back to being yourself.
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1205
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:50,425
He's coming down the street now.

1206
01:29:55,014 --> 01:29:56,431
Good morning, sheriff.

1207
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:58,308
Colorado.

1208
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,311
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1209
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,813
About what?

1210
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:05,857
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe...

1211
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:08,276
...if trouble started around the jail.

1212
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:11,822
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me too.

1213
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:14,324
-Would you have said it any different?
-No.

1214
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:17,994
He was doing to me what he's doing
to you, I'd tell him the same thing.

1215
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:20,705
He can't take a chance
on whether you'd do it or not.

1216
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,457
I don't suppose so.

1217
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,585
But you can be sure
he's gonna try it a different way.

1218
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,587
Got enough left there for another?

1219
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,464
Sure. Help yourself.

1220
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,551
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1221
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,511
Only when I carry it.

1222
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:37,139
How come you carry a rifle?

1223
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:41,226
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1224
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,233
I don't suppose you have a match either?

1225
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,026
All out of them too.

1226
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,528
I'll get some.

1227
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,957
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1228
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,251
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1229
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,712
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1230
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,464
Around the corner.

1231
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:12,966
About three or four doors to the right.

1232
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,177
Stay away from that rifle , sheriff.

1233
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:17,304
You can see we've still got our guns.

1234
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,556
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1235
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,224
Unloosen that belt.

1236
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:27,564
-What've you done to him?
-Don't worry about him.

1237
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,566
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1238
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:32,903
He ain't gonna be and neither are you
unless you do as you're told.

1239
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,363
-Stay back here.
-We're going down to the jail.

1240
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:37,324
You'll turn Burdette loose...

1241
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,869
...or you and your deputy are gonna
quit worrying about this whole thing.

1242
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:42,162
Take your choice.

1243
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,414
Are you just gonna stand here?

1244
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,417
If you wanna get him shot,
just go out there.

1245
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,419
What'll it be?

1246
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:55,342
If you wanna do something,
when I get out on the porch...

1247
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,094
...take that flowerpot and throw it
through the window.

1248
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:00,263
And duck after you throw it.

1249
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:09,689
Just keep coming, mister.

1250
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,359
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.

1251
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,170
Grab that horse.

1252
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:42,472
-Colorado, where's he going?
-He's gonna see if Dude's all right.

1253
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,737
Chance, over here.

1254
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:06,663
You look a little used.

1255
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,999
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1256
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:12,502
They had me cold.
Gonna make me open the jail.

1257
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,004
What happened?

1258
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,090
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1259
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:20,010
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1260
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,220
I can get up by myself!

1261
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:24,681
I let them get me.

1262
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,184
I let them walk right up
and stick my head in the water trough...

1263
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:30,312
...and it was easy for them.

1264
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,317
I'm good when I'm sober.
Boy, real good.

1265
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:38,445
I should have known better.

1266
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:42,198
A man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1267
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:44,784
-Where're you going?
-Get your hands off of me .

1268
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,328
I said, where're you going?

1269
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:49,372
You've got no use for a man
you can't depend on.

1270
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,541
One bad night and I'm done for.

1271
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:55,545
An old man takes a potshot at me
and I'm finished.

1272
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:59,215
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1273
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:00,467
Look at me.

1274
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,552
I got them so bad.

1275
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,722
What can a man do with hands like that?

1276
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:11,186
-I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.
-All right, quit.

1277
01:34:11,854 --> 01:34:13,521
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1278
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,565
If you wanna quit, quit.

1279
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:17,734
Go on back to the bottle, get drunk!

1280
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,611
One thing, though.

1281
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:24,783
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1282
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:27,327
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1283
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,415
I'm sorry.

1284
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,085
"Sorry" don't get it done, Dude.

1285
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:39,673
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1286
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,425
Maybe you're right.

1287
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:45,762
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1288
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,268
Here are your guns.

1289
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,231
Fellow that took your hat
must have left this.

1290
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,233
You get something out of it.

1291
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:03,113
Now come on down to the jail, and
I'll give you the money you got coming.

1292
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:13,289
-I think this is your horse, señor.
-Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1293
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:15,834
I guess Dude's all right.

1294
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:17,293
Anyway, he's walking.

1295
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:20,755
I'm so glad. I was afraid.

1296
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,258
My stomach seems...

1297
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,677
Come on, maybe a drink'll help.

1298
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:41,943
Go on up to the jail and wait for me there.

1299
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,072
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1300
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:53,121
Oh, Señor Chance.

1301
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:56,291
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1302
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,002
You're the undertaker, Bert. Bury them.

1303
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:03,006
There's another one down by the bridge.
Send in your bill and the county'll pay you.

1304
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,424
No need for that.

1305
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:08,178
Each one of them had two new $50
gold pieces in his pocket.

1306
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:09,554
Price is going up.

1307
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,182
-What?
-Nothing, Bert.

1308
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,976
Bring their guns and other stuff to the jail.

1309
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:17,353
-It will be done.
-Here is your gun, señor.

1310
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,773
Thank you, Carlitos.

1311
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:21,441
Where's Colorado?

1312
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,110
He's inside the hotel.
He took the girl, Feathers.

1313
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:28,531
Better give me another, Colorado.

1314
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,536
-Yes, ma'am.
-Look at me, Colorado. Take a good look.

1315
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,582
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1316
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:39,375
No, ma'am.

1317
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:41,628
Yeah, well, you'd be a liar then.

1318
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:44,756
Better go easy on that stuff.

1319
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:47,091
-That makes three you've had.
-Yep.

1320
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:51,930
You'd be lying because that's what I am,
a softheaded idiot.

1321
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:55,892
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here...

1322
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,937
...and inviting myself into this.
He told me--

1323
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,067
Hi, sheriff.

1324
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,945
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1325
01:37:07,112 --> 01:37:10,406
He's all right. So am I , thanks to you.

1326
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:15,078
-Thank the lady here.
-Sure, thank the lady. She did a big thing.

1327
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:19,249
She threw a flowerpot through the window
and helped get three men killed.

1328
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,251
Or was it four?

1329
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:22,961
Why'd you make me do it?

1330
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,922
-I made you do it?
-Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1331
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,216
He wasn't gonna do
what those men told him.

1332
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,551
Not him.

1333
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,263
You were just gonna get yourself killed,
that's all.

1334
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:34,931
Somebody had to--

1335
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,724
What were you gonna do, sheriff?

1336
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,060
I'm glad I didn't have to
make up my mind.

1337
01:37:39,228 --> 01:37:41,855
You weren't going down to that jail,
John T.

1338
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:43,773
So somebody had to help you.

1339
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,568
But you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1340
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,405
You're right, you didn't make me help you.

1341
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:52,490
It was my own idea.

1342
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,785
It was my idea to stay.
You told me to get on that stage.

1343
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,120
I know you did.

1344
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:59,914
-I'm glad you didn't.
-What?

1345
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,791
I'm glad you didn't go.

1346
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:08,923
What'd you--? What'd you have to
say a thing like that for?

1347
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:13,761
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1348
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,640
You just don't make any sense, that's all.

1349
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:19,392
And neither do I .

1350
01:38:19,685 --> 01:38:22,812
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1351
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,273
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1352
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:33,281
I better go before I make a fool of myself.

1353
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:38,328
I don't know why I should go though,
because we're all fools.

1354
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:41,664
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1355
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,834
Well, I'm going, anyway.

1356
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:47,837
We're just a bunch of idiots, that's all.

1357
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:50,381
Just a bunch of idiots.

1358
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,469
How did she get mixed up in this?

1359
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:56,804
She didn't feel too good.

1360
01:38:56,972 --> 01:39:00,642
-She had a couple of drinks.
-I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1361
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:05,480
Oh, she was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know. And neither did she.

1362
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:10,485
I told her to throw that flowerpot through
the window and I went out instead.

1363
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:13,279
And that's your reason
for throwing in with me?

1364
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,615
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1365
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:18,034
Wheeler just talked about helping me.

1366
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:20,161
But you saved my neck.

1367
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,705
Burdette isn't gonna kiss you for that.

1368
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,374
So you're in.

1369
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:29,128
Now, don't tell me you didn't think
about that. Before you did it, I mean.

1370
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:32,256
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1371
01:39:32,424 --> 01:39:34,217
How do I get a badge?

1372
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,260
Come on, I'll get you one.

1373
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:40,348
Oh, I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1374
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:45,603
I'm sorry for that.
But I figure why is not my business.

1375
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:49,565
You've got peculiar ways of choosing
what is your business.

1376
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:57,532
You telling me they was gonna bring
Chance in here to make me turn Joe loose?

1377
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:59,117
Why, they're crazy.

1378
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:00,576
Goddarn fools.

1379
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:03,663
Chance brings in three strangers,
tells me to unlock the door...

1380
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:07,417
...what do they think I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do.

1381
01:40:07,876 --> 01:40:09,877
I'm gonna start blasting.

1382
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,422
Where'd you get that hat?

1383
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,550
-Chance gave it to me. For a souvenir.
-For a what?

1384
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:18,177
-Stumpy, we're coming in.
-Well, come ahead.

1385
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,346
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1386
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:26,269
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy sheriff badges?

1387
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,312
In the right-hand drawer there.

1388
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:31,024
You know where the book is,
the one with the oath?

1389
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:34,694
No! If you can't take care of your own
truck don't look for me to do it.

1390
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:37,613
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1391
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:40,950
Do you solemnly swear to take
on the duties of a sheriff's deputy--

1392
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,162
Found yourself another knothead
who don't know when he's well off?

1393
01:40:44,329 --> 01:40:47,123
--in the county of Presidio
of the great state of Texas?

1394
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,291
I do.

1395
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:51,377
And that includes taking orders from me.

1396
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:54,380
All right, sheriff.
How about giving me one?

1397
01:40:54,548 --> 01:40:56,716
Get over at the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1398
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,384
Move in here.

1399
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,720
What're you laughing about?

1400
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,847
What I got myself in for.

1401
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,309
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1402
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:08,811
-How good do you think he is?
-He's all right.

1403
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:11,230
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1404
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:14,567
He threw me my gun and while it was
in the air, he got one of them.

1405
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:17,278
-Then he got another one.
-Good enough. Good enough.

1406
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,238
Is he as good as I used to be?

1407
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:24,118
It'd be pretty close.

1408
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:26,788
I'd hate to have to live on the difference .

1409
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,919
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1410
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:36,297
What's he talking about? "Him for me"?

1411
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:39,092
Nobody never tells me
nothing around here.

1412
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:40,968
You heard him, he's quitting.

1413
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:44,847
What's got into you?

1414
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,558
Look at me. Ain't that pretty?

1415
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:49,644
Shaking worse all the time .

1416
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:52,730
What can a man do with hands like that?
Tell me, what?

1417
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:56,692
Take a drink! You said Chance told you to.
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1418
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,528
He can take the whole bottle.

1419
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,446
Well, go ahead.

1420
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,056
Stumpy.

1421
01:42:29,017 --> 01:42:30,184
Don't close it.

1422
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,166
Didn't spill a drop.

1423
01:42:56,962 --> 01:42:58,546
Shakes are gone ...

1424
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,549
...just because of a piece of music.

1425
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:07,555
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1426
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,560
Keep on playing it,
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1427
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:17,023
Chance, give me another shot at it...

1428
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,318
...Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1429
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,490
You heard him.

1430
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:33,289
Bring it out, put it back.
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1431
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:36,000
I ain't gonna wait for them to ask me,
because I do.

1432
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,461
You two's enough to drive a man to it.

1433
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,883
I think I'll go watch the road again.

1434
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:47,136
Unless you need me for something else .

1435
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,514
Did you forget this?

1436
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:53,601
You could clean up a little.

1437
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,145
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1438
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,648
I'm better than I look.

1439
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,816
I'll do that tonight.

1440
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:04,987
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1441
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:09,742
Nothing in his stomach.

1442
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:11,953
Nothing but guts.

1443
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:14,956
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1444
01:44:15,123 --> 01:44:17,875
We know about him.
He's gonna be all right, but I ain't.

1445
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:20,878
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down.

1446
01:44:21,046 --> 01:44:22,171
Where're you going?

1447
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:25,758
To get Dude something to eat.
And you'd better--

1448
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,927
I know, get back in my hole.

1449
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,347
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1450
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,308
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1451
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:38,813
We get a good man, he has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1452
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:40,564
Close the window!

1453
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:44,986
Still talking about that little accident
last night.

1454
01:44:45,195 --> 01:44:47,863
Never can satisfy him.

1455
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:54,704
The sun is sinking in the West

1456
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:59,375
The cattle go down to the stream

1457
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:04,213
The red wing settles in her nest

1458
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:10,303
It's time for her cowboy to dream

1459
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:13,347
Purple light

1460
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:16,642
In the canyon

1461
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:23,607
That's where I long to be

1462
01:45:23,775 --> 01:45:29,822
With my sweet girl companion

1463
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:35,786
Just my rifle, pony and me

1464
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:41,834
Gonna hang my sombrero

1465
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:48,632
On the limb of a tree

1466
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,263
Coming home, sweetheart darling

1467
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:59,977
Just my rifle, pony and me

1468
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,938
Whippoorwill

1469
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:04,940
In the willow

1470
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:10,905
Sings a sweet melody

1471
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:13,616
Riding to

1472
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,117
Riding to

1473
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:17,203
Amarillo

1474
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:18,371
Amarillo

1475
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:24,085
Just my rifle, pony and me

1476
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:27,880
-No more cows
-No more cows

1477
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,758
-To be roping
-To be roping

1478
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:33,761
-No more strays
-No more strays

1479
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:36,347
-Will I see
-Will I see

1480
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:38,099
Round the bend

1481
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:39,433
Round the bend

1482
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:41,310
She'll be waiting

1483
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:43,062
She'll be waiting

1484
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:49,068
-For my rifle, pony and me
-For my rifle, pony and me

1485
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:54,657
-For my rifle, my pony
-For my rifle, my pony

1486
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,786
-And me
-And me

1487
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,956
That's real pretty.
Go on, play some more.

1488
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:04,875
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1489
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:05,084
Why don't you play something
I can sing with you?

1490
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:12,425
I wish I was an apple

1491
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:13,592
That's a good one.

1492
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,095
Hanging in the tree

1493
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:18,848
And every time my sweetheart'd pass

1494
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:20,975
She'd take a bite of me

1495
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,894
She told me that she loved me

1496
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,939
She called me "sugar plum"

1497
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:29,525
She threw her arms around me

1498
01:47:29,693 --> 01:47:31,652
I thought my time had come

1499
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,363
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1500
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:36,824
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1501
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:39,994
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1502
01:47:40,162 --> 01:47:42,455
I'll marry you sometime

1503
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:46,876
I wish I had a needle

1504
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,420
As fine as I could sew

1505
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:54,467
I'd sew her in my pocket
And down the road I go

1506
01:47:54,885 --> 01:47:57,303
Cindy hug and kiss me

1507
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,014
She wrung her hands and cried

1508
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:04,643
She swore I was the prettiest thing
That ever lived or died

1509
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:07,354
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1510
01:48:07,522 --> 01:48:10,065
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1511
01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:12,735
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy

1512
01:48:12,903 --> 01:48:19,909
I'll marry you sometime

1513
01:48:21,578 --> 01:48:23,412
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1514
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,457
It's better than being out
in the street and getting shot at.

1515
01:48:26,625 --> 01:48:28,292
I can't argue with you.

1516
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,503
-You're right, Stumpy.
-Right about what?

1517
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:34,006
-I should have thought of it before.
-Thought about what?

1518
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:37,843
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't gonna rush this jail.

1519
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:40,221
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1520
01:48:40,388 --> 01:48:42,681
We could sit here and wait for the marshal.

1521
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:44,433
Only be three or four days.

1522
01:48:45,101 --> 01:48:47,603
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1523
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:49,939
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1524
01:48:50,106 --> 01:48:52,191
-Water and firewood?
-Filled up this morning.

1525
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,778
We do need some blankets and tobacco,
and matches.

1526
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:58,113
-Less you got plenty.
-He ain't.

1527
01:48:58,448 --> 01:49:00,824
-And a few bottles of beer, Dude?
-Thanks, Stumpy.

1528
01:49:00,992 --> 01:49:02,618
There's another thing now...

1529
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:06,956
...if we're all gonna be in here
three or four days, close together like...

1530
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:11,460
...it might be a good idea if a certain
party, not to mention no names was to...

1531
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,087
...do what he said he'd do.

1532
01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:16,966
A horse barn's a good place but it ain't
a place for a fellow to roll around in.

1533
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:18,133
All right, Stumpy.

1534
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:22,096
Me, I like roses, but this fellow
ain't no rose this fellow I'm talking about.

1535
01:49:22,264 --> 01:49:24,640
I'm gonna take a bath. I said I would.

1536
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,476
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1537
01:49:27,769 --> 01:49:29,520
I was just wondering when.

1538
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:32,314
He'll keep talking till we get out of here.

1539
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:34,942
I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1540
01:49:35,110 --> 01:49:38,779
Yell when you get back, because
you look different when you're clean.

1541
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,617
How do you do that?

1542
01:49:43,785 --> 01:49:46,495
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1543
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:48,872
Carlos, open up.

1544
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,833
Coming. Coming.

1545
01:49:52,502 --> 01:49:55,796
Buenos tardes, Señor Chance.
I think it is best to lock the door.

1546
01:49:55,964 --> 01:50:00,175
Yeah. Carlos, I'm sleeping
over at the jail tonight. All of us are .

1547
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:03,846
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco, and matches.

1548
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:06,473
-And some beer too.
-You feeling better?

1549
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,683
Much better.

1550
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,852
-That's all you need?
-That's all.

1551
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:14,189
When you get the stuff together,
let us know. I'll be upstairs.

1552
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:20,529
Now don't make any noise.

1553
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:24,700
Open your mouth.

1554
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:51,727
Hi, Feathers.

1555
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:54,146
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1556
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,899
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1557
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:59,735
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1558
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:01,695
Who's Stumpy?

1559
01:51:01,863 --> 01:51:03,322
The fellow that likes roses.

1560
01:51:03,865 --> 01:51:05,616
No, he watches the jail.

1561
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,868
-Hurry it up.
-Right away.

1562
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:10,913
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1563
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:14,750
Something I should have done
two or three days ago.

1564
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,585
Are you sorry you didn't?

1565
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,296
Are you?

1566
01:51:19,964 --> 01:51:22,091
I know an easy way of telling you.

1567
01:51:24,594 --> 01:51:26,679
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1568
01:51:27,263 --> 01:51:28,847
Chance, give me a towel, will you?

1569
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:31,100
-I'm busy.
-What'd you say?

1570
01:51:31,267 --> 01:51:32,893
Somebody's telling me something.

1571
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,854
I can't hear--
Give me a towel, will you?

1572
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:39,775
He's a big help.

1573
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:41,944
I'll finish telling you later.

1574
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:45,447
Purple light

1575
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,162
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1576
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,832
I couldn't see,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1577
01:51:54,999 --> 01:51:58,293
The sheriff's upstairs talking to the girl.
He has his gun.

1578
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,379
I don't wanna go up and get him.

1579
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,173
-Burdette wants him alive.
-Then don't talk so loud.

1580
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:06,552
He'll come charging here with that rifle
and we'll have to kill him.

1581
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,971
-That might just work.
-What?

1582
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:11,306
The stairs are pretty dark.

1583
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:14,059
We stretch a rope across them.
Let him hear something.

1584
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:17,479
Give me that piece of rope.
Come on, give me a hand.

1585
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:35,664
The sun is sinking in the West

1586
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,500
-Hurry it up, will you?
-Be right out.

1587
01:52:41,212 --> 01:52:43,839
Well, if you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1588
01:52:44,007 --> 01:52:46,842
I don't suppose I could come by
the jail once in awhile...

1589
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:50,971
-...and see if you needed anything.
-I don't want you anyplace around there.

1590
01:52:51,347 --> 01:52:52,890
I was afraid of that.

1591
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:56,560
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1592
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,937
That's a long time, you know.

1593
01:53:00,398 --> 01:53:01,690
You'll live through it.

1594
01:53:03,526 --> 01:53:05,152
Yeah, you do the same.

1595
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:20,000
All ready. You both better get out there.
You too, Pedro.

1596
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,211
Leave the door open a little.

1597
01:53:22,545 --> 01:53:24,463
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1598
01:53:25,673 --> 01:53:28,634
Now, lady, we want you
to call the sheriff down here.

1599
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:31,136
No! No!

1600
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:32,638
Maybe this'll help.

1601
01:53:33,431 --> 01:53:33,931
Please don't. Don't!

1602
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:36,683
Please don't. Don't!

1603
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,109
-He's out cold.
-Get upstairs, quick!

1604
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,990
-Hold it, Dude.
-Watch him.

1605
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,870
Just keep coming, lady.

1606
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:59,998
All right, everybody downstairs.

1607
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,926
All right, get on your feet.

1608
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:19,601
Come on, get up!

1609
01:54:26,818 --> 01:54:28,068
Can you walk?

1610
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,698
-Where are we going?
-That's up to you.

1611
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,033
We go to the jail and you let Joe go.

1612
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,619
Or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1613
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:38,871
Take your choice.

1614
01:54:39,038 --> 01:54:40,956
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1615
01:54:41,791 --> 01:54:44,877
-You'll just get Joe killed.
-Not if he knows we got you two.

1616
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:46,879
Chance, they got us. We're licked.

1617
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:50,632
Go on, take them over to the jail,
and tell Stumpy to open up and let Joe go.

1618
01:54:50,842 --> 01:54:53,552
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm telling you to do it now.

1619
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:57,180
Stumpy couldn't hold out. He hasn't got
water or food and he's all alone.

1620
01:54:57,348 --> 01:54:59,641
Nobody to get him any water.
Now go on, do it.

1621
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:01,685
-Do you know what you're saying?
-I do.

1622
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:04,688
I'm thinking good too.
Now do what I tell you.

1623
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:08,483
And then after they get Joe,
what happens?

1624
01:55:08,651 --> 01:55:10,444
All we want is Joe.

1625
01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:16,408
-You still think it's a good idea?
-I still think it's good.

1626
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,829
We'll go over to the jail.

1627
01:55:20,997 --> 01:55:22,497
Take the shells out of his gun.

1628
01:55:22,665 --> 01:55:24,041
I unloaded his pistol.

1629
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,543
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1630
01:55:26,711 --> 01:55:30,505
Now look, sheriff,
we're going out of here natural-like.

1631
01:55:30,673 --> 01:55:33,425
You carry your gun
and don't do anything to make anybody...

1632
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:35,218
...think something's wrong.

1633
01:55:35,386 --> 01:55:39,139
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1634
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:41,975
Burdette's got it figured out pretty good.

1635
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:46,146
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1636
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:49,274
Some of those you killed were
friends of mine.

1637
01:55:49,484 --> 01:55:50,692
Give him his rifle.

1638
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,364
You first.

1639
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:33,860
Hold it.

1640
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:38,490
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1641
01:56:40,326 --> 01:56:42,077
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1642
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,787
It took you long enough.

1643
01:56:43,955 --> 01:56:46,039
Steve, cover from out here.

1644
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:57,259
All right, open up.
We're gonna let Joe go.

1645
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,177
How come?

1646
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:01,680
His friends here put up bail.

1647
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:04,683
Give me the keys then.
They're on your desk there.

1648
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:07,519
I forgot.

1649
01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:18,530
Easy.

1650
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:21,742
-This fellow'll talk all right.
-Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1651
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:24,244
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1652
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:28,707
Now watch yourself.

1653
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:30,959
There's two of them holding Dude.

1654
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:34,838
The window.

1655
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:48,310
All right, Colorado.

1656
01:57:56,569 --> 01:58:00,030
-In here, Señor Chance.
-They've gone.

1657
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:02,449
They took Dude
when they heard the shooting.

1658
01:58:02,617 --> 01:58:05,869
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1659
01:58:08,998 --> 01:58:10,665
They've gone all right.

1660
01:58:12,001 --> 01:58:13,752
We gonna go after them?

1661
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:21,343
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1662
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,178
You ought to remember that.

1663
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:24,971
You thought it was funny.

1664
01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:27,849
What do you think he'd do
if we went after Dude?

1665
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:29,559
I didn't think.

1666
01:58:29,852 --> 01:58:32,020
Think the shoe's on the other foot now.

1667
01:58:32,188 --> 01:58:34,898
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1668
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:37,234
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1669
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:39,569
He sent them over there, all right.

1670
01:58:39,862 --> 01:58:42,864
He knew what he was doing.
Knew what Stumpy would do too.

1671
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:46,201
That's why they're not happy about it.

1672
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:49,704
-What're you gonna do?
-It's what Burdette'll do.

1673
01:58:50,665 --> 01:58:52,958
Carlos. Get ahold of Burdette.

1674
01:58:53,709 --> 01:58:56,503
I don't care how.
Tell him I wanna talk to him.

1675
01:58:56,671 --> 01:59:00,215
Tell him to set the time and the place.
But I wanna talk to him.

1676
01:59:00,424 --> 01:59:02,384
We'll be at the jail.

1677
01:59:07,807 --> 01:59:10,684
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1678
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:17,566
Come on, Colorado.

1679
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:20,026
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1680
01:59:49,891 --> 01:59:52,100
Señor Chance. It's me, Carlos.

1681
01:59:56,772 --> 01:59:58,607
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1682
01:59:58,774 --> 02:00:00,567
He say he don't wanna talk to you.

1683
02:00:00,735 --> 02:00:03,570
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1684
02:00:03,738 --> 02:00:05,780
-A trade?
-Dude for Joe.

1685
02:00:05,948 --> 02:00:07,866
He'll be in his place over by the creek.

1686
02:00:08,034 --> 02:00:10,035
-The-- What you call--?
-Warehouse?

1687
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:12,287
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1688
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:15,999
He'll have Dude.
If you'll bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1689
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:17,834
He said to let him know.

1690
02:00:23,174 --> 02:00:24,633
Tell him we'll be there.

1691
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,219
Chance! You're crazy! You can't do that!

1692
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:30,555
-Not even if Dude was your own brother.
-What can I do?

1693
02:00:30,723 --> 02:00:34,100
What we figured on doing.
Hole up till the marshal comes.

1694
02:00:34,268 --> 02:00:37,020
When the marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1695
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:40,065
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1696
02:00:40,233 --> 02:00:44,069
-I'd like to add my two cents worth, sheriff.
-Go ahead.

1697
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:46,780
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1698
02:00:46,948 --> 02:00:49,241
Let's say we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1699
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,202
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here.

1700
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:56,331
Which means you two can't, and
if you don't have Joe, what'll stop him?

1701
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:57,832
The brakes'll be off then.

1702
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,335
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1703
02:01:00,503 --> 02:01:01,878
You're right, Colorado.

1704
02:01:02,797 --> 02:01:04,881
But you and Stumpy didn't see the killing.

1705
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,008
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1706
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:08,802
-I'm not worried.
-Me neither.

1707
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:11,012
You'll just wait for the marshal to come .

1708
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,890
-He's still gonna want you and Dude.
-I'd say so.

1709
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:16,726
You can't get out of town
because he's got it bottled up.

1710
02:01:16,894 --> 02:01:20,021
When you make the trade then
Burdette's gonna get the both of you.

1711
02:01:20,189 --> 02:01:21,898
After a little argument.

1712
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:25,694
-But why at all? Why the both of you?
-Dude ought to have a chance.

1713
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:28,571
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1714
02:01:28,906 --> 02:01:30,156
Will he?

1715
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:32,867
You're gonna have me crying.

1716
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:37,872
Fellow's gotta be a drunk to get anywhere
around here. I might as well start now.

1717
02:01:40,001 --> 02:01:41,376
Go ahead, Carlos.

1718
02:01:57,476 --> 02:01:58,852
Well...

1719
02:02:00,062 --> 02:02:01,396
Burdette's here.

1720
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:05,817
About time to go.

1721
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:08,737
How about I go ahead,
see if they'll play any tricks?

1722
02:02:08,904 --> 02:02:10,071
Look out here.

1723
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,366
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1724
02:02:13,576 --> 02:02:17,370
There won't be any tricks.
At least not till we make the trade.

1725
02:02:17,538 --> 02:02:19,581
Besides, you're not going.

1726
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:22,917
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1727
02:02:23,085 --> 02:02:24,627
I'm going along now.

1728
02:02:24,795 --> 02:02:26,046
Why?

1729
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:28,882
Let's just say I'd like a closer look.

1730
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:35,305
Up to now I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1731
02:02:35,473 --> 02:02:38,350
Why? Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason why.

1732
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:40,143
I'll give you one.

1733
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:44,272
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much.

1734
02:02:44,440 --> 02:02:47,859
But out there if anything happens,
you'll have to move, and move fast.

1735
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:50,779
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1736
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:54,741
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1737
02:02:55,576 --> 02:02:58,578
Well, you give me a reason.

1738
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:07,796
Now, do you want that I should bring
Joe out, or you wanna do that yourself?

1739
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,881
Bring him out.

1740
02:03:17,139 --> 02:03:20,016
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1741
02:03:20,976 --> 02:03:22,394
Yeah.

1742
02:03:29,318 --> 02:03:31,152
I told you I'd get out of here.

1743
02:03:31,695 --> 02:03:35,031
Open your mouth again
and we'll carry you out.

1744
02:03:35,991 --> 02:03:37,617
See you, Stumpy.

1745
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:44,582
See you.

1746
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,386
That's far enough, Joe.

1747
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:45,101
Through the barn.

1748
02:04:57,239 --> 02:05:01,576
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1749
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:26,559
You want a closer look?

1750
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,270
This is close enough.

1751
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:32,941
Take that window.
Watch Joe.

1752
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:52,293
Burdette!

1753
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:56,881
Burdette!

1754
02:05:57,299 --> 02:05:58,967
Nathan Burdette!

1755
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:07,350
We're ready. Joe's here.

1756
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,435
We're ready too.

1757
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:11,646
Start Dude .

1758
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:14,315
I'll start Joe.

1759
02:06:14,483 --> 02:06:15,733
Go ahead.

1760
02:06:19,989 --> 02:06:21,489
All right, Joe.

1761
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:27,453
You can start walking very slow.

1762
02:06:29,164 --> 02:06:31,291
And stop if I say stop...

1763
02:06:32,626 --> 02:06:33,918
...or I'll stop you.

1764
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:36,337
Bring him out.

1765
02:06:41,302 --> 02:06:42,594
Go ahead.

1766
02:06:43,345 --> 02:06:44,637
Slow.

1767
02:07:26,388 --> 02:07:27,513
Look out!

1768
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,574
You want me to go help Dude?

1769
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:48,660
He'll take Joe all right.

1770
02:07:50,537 --> 02:07:52,705
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1771
02:07:53,582 --> 02:07:54,749
He'll take him.

1772
02:08:00,464 --> 02:08:02,006
You're right. He did.

1773
02:08:03,217 --> 02:08:06,260
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1774
02:08:06,887 --> 02:08:08,596
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1775
02:08:08,764 --> 02:08:10,640
Stay right where you are.

1776
02:08:10,891 --> 02:08:12,100
We'll throw you a gun.

1777
02:08:12,267 --> 02:08:13,851
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1778
02:08:25,447 --> 02:08:29,200
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1779
02:08:29,993 --> 02:08:32,203
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1780
02:09:05,487 --> 02:09:07,155
That ought to start something.

1781
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:09,115
It will.

1782
02:09:12,035 --> 02:09:13,327
On your left!

1783
02:09:17,166 --> 02:09:18,916
Two of them made it to that shack.

1784
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:22,503
If they get across that creek, we'll be
in bad shape. They'll get behind us.

1785
02:09:22,671 --> 02:09:24,964
I don't know how
we're gonna stop them from here.

1786
02:09:30,971 --> 02:09:32,305
Is that who I think it is?

1787
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:33,681
Old Stumpy.

1788
02:09:34,224 --> 02:09:35,933
The fellow I left behind.

1789
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:39,562
Hey, Señor Chance.
Don't shoot, it's me.

1790
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,647
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1791
02:09:42,065 --> 02:09:44,692
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them, señor.

1792
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:46,360
Who'll turn up next?

1793
02:09:46,528 --> 02:09:48,529
Maybe the girl with another flowerpot.

1794
02:09:50,532 --> 02:09:54,285
Chance, Stumpy's sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1795
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:56,704
I go tell him, señor.

1796
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:00,792
You stay here. I'll go get him.
Give me those shells.

1797
02:10:27,194 --> 02:10:29,403
Stumpy, get out of there.

1798
02:10:29,905 --> 02:10:32,824
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1799
02:10:32,991 --> 02:10:34,575
You got a good seat, all right.

1800
02:10:34,743 --> 02:10:36,744
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1801
02:10:37,037 --> 02:10:38,746
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1802
02:10:39,164 --> 02:10:41,040
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1803
02:10:41,375 --> 02:10:44,919
Get away from that wagon
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1804
02:11:02,604 --> 02:11:04,647
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1805
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:07,400
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a siesta?

1806
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:10,611
I brung us some dynamite.

1807
02:11:11,196 --> 02:11:12,655
That's a good idea.

1808
02:11:12,823 --> 02:11:15,199
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1809
02:11:19,121 --> 02:11:21,330
Can you shoot
as good as you say you can?

1810
02:11:21,498 --> 02:11:23,916
-Can you throw?
-Near as far as you can shoot.

1811
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:26,210
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1812
02:11:30,215 --> 02:11:31,465
Dude!

1813
02:11:32,342 --> 02:11:33,467
Over here.

1814
02:11:34,803 --> 02:11:35,887
Get ready.

1815
02:11:36,054 --> 02:11:37,430
Let her go!

1816
02:11:44,104 --> 02:11:45,605
That was a good one.

1817
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:48,190
Oh, stop cackling.

1818
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:50,860
Get one a little farther out there.

1819
02:11:51,028 --> 02:11:52,528
There you go again!

1820
02:11:53,322 --> 02:11:55,990
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing them for you?

1821
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:57,325
I'd throw them myself.

1822
02:11:57,492 --> 02:11:59,911
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1823
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:01,412
Let her go.

1824
02:12:06,543 --> 02:12:09,253
Hey, Dude, how do you like them apples?

1825
02:12:09,421 --> 02:12:10,838
Hey, that's all right.

1826
02:12:11,006 --> 02:12:12,131
Throw one for me.

1827
02:12:12,674 --> 02:12:14,675
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1828
02:12:14,843 --> 02:12:17,094
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1829
02:12:17,262 --> 02:12:18,346
Throw it!

1830
02:12:18,513 --> 02:12:20,014
Here you are, Dude.

1831
02:12:26,104 --> 02:12:27,605
Took you two.

1832
02:12:27,898 --> 02:12:29,607
I didn't allow for the wind.

1833
02:12:29,775 --> 02:12:31,943
Can't you throw them any farther?

1834
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:34,362
I can if you wanna blow
the whole place down.

1835
02:12:34,529 --> 02:12:37,406
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1836
02:12:46,124 --> 02:12:48,167
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1837
02:12:48,543 --> 02:12:50,878
That got them.
That took the fight out of them.

1838
02:12:51,046 --> 02:12:52,254
Look at them quit!

1839
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:10,398
Sure is quiet out there.

1840
02:13:10,649 --> 02:13:11,732
Did you find anything?

1841
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:15,903
There isn't a Burdette man left in town
outside of those who got locked up.

1842
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:18,698
Rest of them all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1843
02:13:18,865 --> 02:13:21,117
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

1844
02:13:22,577 --> 02:13:24,203
What do you wanna do about them?

1845
02:13:24,371 --> 02:13:26,914
Want to take them to Presidio
or wait for the marshal?

1846
02:13:27,082 --> 02:13:29,709
-We'll wait for the marshal.
-Wait for the marshal?

1847
02:13:29,876 --> 02:13:33,462
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for them and watch them.

1848
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:36,632
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the marshal?"

1849
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,883
And that's a question.

1850
02:13:38,051 --> 02:13:40,720
I'm fed up feeding them.
I ain't gonna watch them neither.

1851
02:13:40,887 --> 02:13:43,848
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel...

1852
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:46,475
...like a gopher or a burrowing owl
or something.

1853
02:13:46,643 --> 02:13:49,270
When I went outside,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1854
02:13:49,438 --> 02:13:51,439
I'll watch them for you
if you wanna go out.

1855
02:13:51,606 --> 02:13:53,107
-Would you?
-Sure.

1856
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:56,652
I guess it's dark enough I can go outside,
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1857
02:13:56,820 --> 02:13:57,987
I don't think it would.

1858
02:13:58,447 --> 02:14:02,283
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge and
have a drink, it wouldn't hurt me neither.

1859
02:14:02,451 --> 02:14:04,035
I don't think it would.

1860
02:14:04,953 --> 02:14:06,245
Well, should I go?

1861
02:14:06,496 --> 02:14:07,538
Go ahead.

1862
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:09,123
Go ahead.

1863
02:14:09,291 --> 02:14:11,208
-You ain't gonna give me an argument?
-No.

1864
02:14:11,376 --> 02:14:13,127
Don't care whether I go or not.

1865
02:14:25,807 --> 02:14:27,725
-Chance.
-Yeah?

1866
02:14:27,893 --> 02:14:29,810
Have you seen that girl yet?

1867
02:14:30,687 --> 02:14:32,980
I said, have you seen that girl yet?

1868
02:14:33,732 --> 02:14:35,316
No, l....

1869
02:14:35,817 --> 02:14:36,817
The job.

1870
02:14:38,028 --> 02:14:39,403
Didn't have time.

1871
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:43,824
Well, the Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1872
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,493
Should be leaving soon.

1873
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,828
-You mean she's going on it?
-I don't know.

1874
02:14:47,996 --> 02:14:49,914
I don't think you do either.

1875
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:51,999
But if it was me, I'd find out.

1876
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:54,585
I wouldn't walk around wondering about it.

1877
02:14:55,170 --> 02:14:57,505
She might be leaving and she might not.

1878
02:14:58,131 --> 02:15:00,216
She might need help making up her mind.

1879
02:15:00,383 --> 02:15:01,926
But you're the expert.

1880
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:04,678
Me, I don't know anything about women.

1881
02:15:05,388 --> 02:15:08,474
Next thing you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

1882
02:15:12,562 --> 02:15:14,063
Well, a man forgets.

1883
02:15:15,357 --> 02:15:17,274
Sometimes--

1884
02:15:18,527 --> 02:15:20,486
Sometimes it isn't easy.

1885
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:25,533
Something happens, he just forgets.

1886
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:30,412
In case you're interested, I have.

1887
02:15:31,289 --> 02:15:32,706
I don't even want a drink.

1888
02:15:34,126 --> 02:15:35,543
It's about time.

1889
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:38,546
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

1890
02:15:38,713 --> 02:15:41,882
If you wanna jump in, I'll take care of you.

1891
02:15:42,884 --> 02:15:45,052
What is this now?
You're gonna take care of him.

1892
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:47,471
-Tell me about it.
-Sheriff's got himself a girl.

1893
02:15:47,639 --> 02:15:48,681
Shut up.

1894
02:15:48,849 --> 02:15:52,643
We ain't gonna go through that again?
You gonna do the same thing Dude done?

1895
02:15:52,811 --> 02:15:55,896
-Keep still.
-Why don't somebody tell me these things?

1896
02:15:56,064 --> 02:15:59,066
-Where you going? Where you going?
-Let him go, Stumpy.

1897
02:16:01,319 --> 02:16:03,612
No fooling,
has the sheriff got himself a girl?

1898
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:05,990
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

1899
02:16:06,283 --> 02:16:08,993
-She got him on the run?
-She sure has.

1900
02:16:09,911 --> 02:16:11,328
I can just see him.

1901
02:16:11,496 --> 02:16:13,414
Laying down the law to her.

1902
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:15,958
"I told you to get back in there!"

1903
02:16:16,626 --> 02:16:19,420
And then getting told off hisself.

1904
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,095
Señor Chance.
Everything is all right?

1905
02:16:28,263 --> 02:16:30,681
-I am so happy.
-Thank you, Consuelo.

1906
02:16:30,849 --> 02:16:32,308
You look for the girl?

1907
02:16:32,475 --> 02:16:33,767
She's in there.

1908
02:16:34,603 --> 02:16:36,896
"No got time."

1909
02:16:43,653 --> 02:16:45,029
Hi, John T.

1910
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:48,449
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

1911
02:16:50,911 --> 02:16:52,244
There.

1912
02:16:54,289 --> 02:16:57,124
Well, it's all over, isn't it, John T.?

1913
02:16:57,292 --> 02:16:58,792
Where'd you get those things?

1914
02:17:00,003 --> 02:17:01,921
I wore them the last place I worked.

1915
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:06,133
Well, why are you wearing them now?

1916
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:08,260
Tonight's a big night.

1917
02:17:08,428 --> 02:17:10,804
Consuelo thought
a little entertainment might help.

1918
02:17:10,972 --> 02:17:12,139
I'm gonna do a song.

1919
02:17:12,307 --> 02:17:14,475
You need a rig like that to sing?

1920
02:17:14,976 --> 02:17:16,477
You haven't heard me sing.

1921
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:20,481
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuelo thought these tights might help.

1922
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:23,025
But you don't like them.

1923
02:17:23,193 --> 02:17:26,320
-I didn't say that.
-You don't want me to wear them.

1924
02:17:26,488 --> 02:17:27,947
I didn't say that either.

1925
02:17:28,114 --> 02:17:31,951
-Is it because they show so much of me?
-They certainly do that.

1926
02:17:33,995 --> 02:17:37,164
You're a stubborn, stubborn man, John T.

1927
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:41,168
Sometimes I know what you're thinking.

1928
02:17:42,003 --> 02:17:43,671
And other times...

1929
02:17:44,673 --> 02:17:47,841
You just can't make up
your mind about me, can you?

1930
02:17:48,093 --> 02:17:49,510
You like what you see.

1931
02:17:49,678 --> 02:17:52,596
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch.

1932
02:17:53,265 --> 02:17:56,684
But you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was.

1933
02:17:57,727 --> 02:17:59,561
And I haven't helped much.

1934
02:18:00,772 --> 02:18:04,942
I wore these before I met you.
I wanted you to know it.

1935
02:18:05,527 --> 02:18:08,070
To know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

1936
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:13,367
I wanted you to get that funny look
on your face and tell me not to wear them.

1937
02:18:14,035 --> 02:18:15,536
But it didn't work.

1938
02:18:16,204 --> 02:18:17,871
You didn't even get mad.

1939
02:18:21,501 --> 02:18:24,420
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything.

1940
02:18:25,088 --> 02:18:28,882
That I'd know, but I don't know.

1941
02:18:30,051 --> 02:18:32,094
So you're gonna have to talk.

1942
02:18:33,179 --> 02:18:36,056
I'm hard to get, John T.

1943
02:18:36,224 --> 02:18:38,142
You're gonna have to say you want me.

1944
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:40,894
-Where you going?
-Downstairs.

1945
02:18:41,062 --> 02:18:42,396
You better not.

1946
02:18:43,106 --> 02:18:44,898
Why had I better not?

1947
02:18:45,150 --> 02:18:46,483
Because I'm still sheriff.

1948
02:18:46,651 --> 02:18:49,403
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

1949
02:18:53,908 --> 02:18:55,284
John T.

1950
02:18:57,662 --> 02:19:00,372
I've waited so long for you to say that.

1951
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:02,583
I thought you were never....

1952
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,918
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

1953
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:07,254
Just when I think
you're gonna say one thing--

1954
02:19:07,422 --> 02:19:10,507
Get those darn things off.
I'll wait outside.

1955
02:19:10,675 --> 02:19:13,844
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

1956
02:19:14,596 --> 02:19:16,430
Besides I want you to stay here...

1957
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:19,641
...because the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

1958
02:19:19,809 --> 02:19:22,186
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

1959
02:19:22,771 --> 02:19:24,772
What I had to go through!

1960
02:19:25,148 --> 02:19:28,609
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions...

1961
02:19:28,777 --> 02:19:32,237
...start to walk out.
I thought you were never gonna say it.

1962
02:19:32,405 --> 02:19:35,115
-Say what?
-That you loved me.

1963
02:19:35,283 --> 02:19:37,076
I said I'd arrest you.

1964
02:19:37,243 --> 02:19:40,954
It means the same thing, you know that.
You just won't say it.

1965
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:44,208
Oh, we're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

1966
02:19:44,376 --> 02:19:46,460
Me, I just talk all the time.

1967
02:19:46,628 --> 02:19:48,462
You most certainly do.

1968
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:51,340
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

1969
02:19:51,508 --> 02:19:53,884
Either that or start talking too.

1970
02:19:56,137 --> 02:19:57,805
Tell me something.

1971
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:02,059
These tights, now why didn't you
want me to wear them?

1972
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:05,687
Because I didn't want anybody
but me to see you in them.

1973
02:20:05,855 --> 02:20:07,439
Oh, I like that.

1974
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:09,817
You're getting better already.

1975
02:20:09,984 --> 02:20:13,320
Shall I--? Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

1976
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:32,256
-Do you think I'll ever get to be a sheriff?
-Not unless you mind your own business.

1977
02:20:59,117 --> 02:21:01,118
