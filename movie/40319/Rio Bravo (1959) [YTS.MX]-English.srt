No wonder this town's in such a mess.

98
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,142
What does Nathan say about this?

99
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,479
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

100
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,897
You saw part of it.

101
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:53,277
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

Stumpy. You know him.

109

He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

Guess I better see they did it.
I'll see you later.

115
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,294
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,389
Just as long as it's beer.

Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

There you go. I never can please you.
I was just covering you in case of trouble.

Don't you never think of me?

Here's a fellow don't think of nobody
but himself.

130
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,879
I told you why I want you back in there...

131
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,591
...and you're gonna stay there with
that cage locked when I'm not around.

132
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,259
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

133
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,011
Those windows, did you fix them?

134
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,388
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

135
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,015
Nothing could get in here now.

136
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,684
- Not even some fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

137
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,020
You can help to change my life.
Can't help it.

138
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,566
Five, six days breathing the same air as
Burdette is apt to make a killer out of me.

139
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,027
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

140
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,447
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

141
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,866
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you.

142
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:07,036
After me fixing up all your cuts
and bruises like I done.

143
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,664
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it, that's all.

144
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,457
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

145
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,585
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before...

146
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,713
...only I hope you have
more cuts and bruises to fix.

Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

150
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,725
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

151

How you holding up, Borrachón?

152

Got the shakes yet?

153
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,777
That beer won't do you no good. You'll
have to get something stronger than that.

154

Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

311
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,716
Only thing they're worried about
is earning their pay.

312
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,263
No, Pat, all I'd be doing is giving them
more targets to shoot at.

313
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,224
A lot of people'd get hurt.

314
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,393
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

315
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,770
He isn't worth one of those
that'd get killed.

316
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,939
Then what are you gonna do?

317
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:27,025
All you got for help's that old man
down at the jail and this...

318
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,611
Borrachón's the name, Mr. Wheeler.

319
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,823
I'll go outside
so you can talk more freely.

320
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,954
Wasn't good, Pat.

321
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,541
- Let's sit down.
- Yeah, I know.

322
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,628
I shouldn't have said it.
I meant nothing by it.

323
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,589
But I'm so used to stumbling
over that fellow.

324
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,592
I don't think I ever saw him
standing on his own two feet...

325
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,720
...without something
to help hold him up.

326
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,596
How long you been coming here?

327
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,140
Going on two years.

328
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,060
If you'd have come through three years
ago, you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

329
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,687
Dude was good.

330
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,147
He was my deputy.

331
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,482
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

332
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,860
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

333
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,945
- What...?
- A girl.

334
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,322
Just a girl that came through
on the stage.

335
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,409
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

336
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,828
I tried and he damn near killed me.

337
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,249
Anyway, he was hooked.
Went away with her.

338
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,877
Six months later
he came back without her.

339
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,380
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him Borrachón.

340
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,424
- That's Spanish for...
- Yeah, I know.

341
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,176
He told me.

342
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,013
So for two years he's been drinking...

343
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,769
...all he could buy or somebody'd
buy for him, till last night.

344
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,521
And how long do you think that'll last?

345
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,856
I don't know.

346
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,651
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him, huh?

347
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,197
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

348
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,825
I'm supposed to be your friend too.

349
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,620
Why don't you let me help you?
Deal me in.

350
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,372
- You're not good enough.
- I don't know, I'm as good...

351
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,709
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

352
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,796
- No, thanks, Pat, you keep out of it.
- Hey, that's an idea.

353
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,673
- What?
- Ryan. Colorado you call him.

354
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,510
He's young, Chance, but he's good.
Real good.

355
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,388
I could use him if he's good.
But that's up to him.

356
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,724
We'll just see what he says.

357
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,580
- Good evening, sheriff.
- Any luck, kid?

358
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,500
- Pretty fast game.
- Son, I...

359
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,003
...asked you over here
because the sheriff's a friend of mine.

360
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,923
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

361
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,927
- To go against the Burdettes, sheriff?
- That's right.

362
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,054
WHEELER:
I told him you were one of the best.

363
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,474
Well...

364
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,436
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

365
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,605
That's minding my own business.

366
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,274
No offense, sheriff.

367
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,818
No offense.

368
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,826
Well, I never expected that.

369
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:24,786
He showed good sense.

370
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,539
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you...

371
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,791
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

372
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,418
I appreciate it.

373
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,004
If you don't want me,
I'll round up my men...

374
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,924
...and get set for an early start
in the morning. See you before I go.

- You leaving?
- Mm-hm.

- Maybe I'll have some luck now.
- Maybe.

If you play your cards right.

some of your luck with me.

- Yeah?

I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

Oh, hi, sheriff.

I'm sorry about those pants.

Carlos told me they weren't yours.

387

You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

388
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,359
Sure.

389
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,366
Well, sheriff, what is it?

390
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,036
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

391
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,039
It's three cards short.

392
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,125
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

393
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,045
Why...?
Well, why do you tell me?

394
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,841
I know everyone in that game except you
and the fellow in the checkered vest.

395
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,386
- And did you talk to him?
- He's still there.

396
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,845
You were leaving.

397
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,974
And I was a winner.

398
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,393
Is that all you've got to go on?

399
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,605
No. Here's a handbill...

00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,318
...about a gambler
they're interested in catching up with.

00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,195
You know him?

402
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,531
It says he had a girl with him.

403
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,494
Says the girl's about 22,
5 foot 5 inches tall...

404
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,708
...good figure, brown hair,
and wears feathers.

...friend in the checkered vest,
but you could be the girl.

407
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,803
Yes, I could be.

408
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,597
As a matter of fact, I am.

409

Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

410

You'd better give me
the money you won.

416
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:15,790
You've made me mad, sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards.

417
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,126
So you're gonna have to prove
I've got them.

418
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,795
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

- Search you?
- That's right.

to a prisoner?

...but they're not.

01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,712
So naturally I figured you're an expert.

1083
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,673
And you know just
what you're doing all the time.

1084
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:33,552
I just hope
you have better luck than I had.

1085
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:39,725
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1086
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:41,560
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1087
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:44,229
Maybe. But I doubt it.

1088
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,067
That's what I like about you,
you're such an encouraging man.

1089
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,112
If you go by the hotel, pick up
some coffee and sugar, would you?

1090
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,530

1091

Him? He don't get no sugar.

01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,910
His coffee's just water poured
over the old grounds.

You mind if I file the action a bit?

1096

I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1097
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,673
I don't want no easy pull. I might
shoot myself. Get somebody else's.

Why don't you give him his own guns?

- I forgot all about them.
- Your memory is no better than mine.

Where'd you get these?

Ain't you gonna tell me
to get back in there?

1108
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:53,090
No, stay out here and get shot.

1109
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,509
I might do that just for spite.

1110
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,678

By the way, am I drawing pay?

Same as before.

In that case take out

No hurry.

1118
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:34,423
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt.
Something without all these holes in it.

No need of that.

When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

I got them at the hotel.

Been waiting till they fit you again.

You could use a bath and a shave too.

I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

- Chance?
- Yeah?

But you don't like the idea.

Why should I care?
