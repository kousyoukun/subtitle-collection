1
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:42,461
片名：《黑夜传说》
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}{\r}

2
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,086
战争很快就要停止了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.{\r}

3
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,531
鲁肖恩，统治着里坎族最可怕和残忍的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...{\r}

4
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,296
最终被杀死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...had finally been killed.{\r}

5
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,933
里坎族灰飞烟灭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Lycan horde scattered to the wind...{\r}

6
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,443
在一个充满着烈火和复仇的晚上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in a single evening of flame and retribution.{\r}

7
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,753
胜利看上去已经在我们...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...{\r}

8
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,788
...吸血鬼家族一代一代掌握之中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}... the very birthright of the Vampires.{\r}

9
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,056
那个晚上以后过了大概六个世纪
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Nearly six centuries had passed since that night.{\r}

10
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,498
但是古老的世仇不愿跟随鲁肖恩一起进入坟墓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.{\r}

11
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,602
虽然里坎族人少了...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Though Lycans were fewer in number...{\r}

12
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,071
战争却变的更危险了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}... the war itself had become more perilous.{\r}

13
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,636
月亮无法再控制住
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For the moon no longer held her sway.{\r}

14
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:58,339
古老，但是更强壮的里坎人可以随意变身
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.{\r}

15
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,751
武器先进了，但是我们的目标仍然是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same;{\r}

16
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,722
搜寻他们，杀光他们，一个接一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.{\r}

17
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,328
最成功的一次战役
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A most successful campaign.{\r}

18
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,898
可能太成功了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps too successful.{\r}

19
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,344
对于那些像我一样的，死亡行者...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For those like me, a Death Dealer...{\r}

20
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,108
这标志着一个时代的结束
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}... this signaled the end of an era.{\r}

21
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,014
像上个世纪用的武器一样...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like the weapons of the previous century...{\r}

22
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,746
我们也会被作废
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}... we, too, would become obsolete.{\r}

23
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,323
可惜，因为我靠它而活
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pity, because I lived for it.{\r}

24
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,894
血！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bloods!{\r}

25
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,208
好了，没事的，你会好起来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's all right. It's all right. You're gonna be okay.{\r}

26
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,045
你们就像一群疯狗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!{\r}

27
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,355
绅士是...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that, gentlemen...{\r}

28
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,388
不会那么做的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...simply will not do.{\r}

29
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,824
如果你还想在吸血鬼的地盘上打败他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.{\r}

30
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,427
如果你还想活下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not if you expect to survive at all.{\r}

31
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,429
皮尔斯！泰勒！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Pierce! Taylor!{\r}

32
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,066
把衣服穿上好吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put some clothes on, will you?{\r}

33
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,771
我们有个严重的问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have a serious problem.{\r}

34
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,893
我必须做些试验
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll have to run a few tests.{\r}

35
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,900
它一定是某种光线流的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.{\r}

36
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,731
紫外线武器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ultraviolet ammunition.{\r}

37
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,035
利用日光作为武器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.{\r}

38
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,942
你想让我相信一个肮脏的怪物...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You expect me to believe that a mangy animal...{\r}

39
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,403
就带着特别装备的子弹可以杀死吸血鬼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?{\r}

40
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,343
不，我打赌那是军用的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, I'm betting it's military.{\r}

41
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,809
他们偷了些东西，一些高科技追踪器
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something they stole. Some sort of high-tech tracer round.{\r}

42
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,113
我不管他们从哪儿得到这些东西的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I don't care where they got these things.{\r}

43
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,189
雷吉尔死了，纳莎丽尔还在外边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.{\r}

44
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,588
召集所有的死亡行者回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's gather the Death Dealers and go back.{\r}

45
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,763
不可以，现在不能 不能因为一次偶然的入侵就这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Absolutely not. Not now. Not for a random incursion.{\r}

46
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,889
唤醒是几天以后了 这所房子现在已经不安了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.{\r}

47
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,696
偶然的？他们朝我们公开的开火
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.{\r}

48
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,932
-而且我在那条隧道里听到了 -你说过你什么都没看到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-And from what I heard in that tunnel-- -You said you didn't see anything.{\r}

49
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,179
我知道我听到了什么 而且我知道我的勇敢告诉我什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know what I heard, and I know what my gut tells me.{\r}

50
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,678
可能下面有成打的里坎人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There could be dozens of Lycans down there.{\r}

51
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,783
可能还要多，谁知道呢，可能成百上千的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.{\r}

52
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,576
经过我们的猎杀他们已经几近灭绝了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've hunted them to the brink of extinction.{\r}

53
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,050
克莱恩是对的，瑟琳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kraven's right, Selene.{\r}

54
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,216
很久没有过那么大的据点了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries.{\r}

55
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,192
－自从鲁肖恩时代起，就没有过了 －我知道，卡恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Not since the days of Lucian. -I know that, Kahn.{\r}

56
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,161
但是最好仔细检查之后证明我是错的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I'd rather you prove me wrong by checking it out.{\r}

57
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,666
让你的人待命！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have your men tighten things up.{\r}

58
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,998
我会让索伦组织一个搜索小队
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll have Soren assemble a search team.{\r}

59
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:05,475
－不，我想自己带队 －绝对不行，索伦会处理的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-No, I want to lead the team myself. -Absolutely not! Soren will handle it.{\r}

60
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,475
成百上千，真的吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hundreds, really?{\r}

61
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,479
维克多会相信我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Viktor would believe me.{\r}

62
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,318
－我从没那样对待过你 －当然没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I'd never treat you like that. -Of course not.{\r}

63
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:23,752
现在去看看她是否打扮好准备见客人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for her guests.{\r}

64
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,191
－你知道，这是在浪费时间 －指什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-It's a waste of time, you know. -What is?{\r}

65
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,498
我猜维克多想让你呆在这儿，一直盯着他的坟墓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I doubt Viktor would want you freezing in here, staring at his tomb for hours.{\r}

66
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,337
不，他是想让死亡行者去搜索城里每个角落
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, he'd want the Death Dealers out there, scouring every inch of the city.{\r}

67
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,880
克莱恩，我不理解为什么维克多让他负责这事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kraven. I'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.{\r}

68
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,483
他是个官僚，不是个战士
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.{\r}

69
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,050
我们希望你准备好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We need to get you ready.{\r}

70
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,482
－为了什么？ －聚会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-For what? -The party.{\r}

71
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,284
阿米莉娅的使节随时都会来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.{\r}

72
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,975
哦，是这件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, yes.{\r}

73
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,315
你一定得穿上这个，真是完美
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should definitely wear this one. It's perfect.{\r}

74
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,876
他们要找的是你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They were after you.{\r}

75
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,119
他很有魅力...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's attractive...{\r}

76
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,723
－作为人类 －谁很有魅力？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-...for a human. -Who's attractive?{\r}

77
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,108
今天晚上我打算让你在我身边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I planned to have you at my side this evening.{\r}

78
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,610
带上艾丽卡，她渴望在你身边
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take Erika. She's dying to be at your side.{\r}

79
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,012
如果你问我，我要说你把战斗看得太重了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.{\r}

80
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,654
你无法改变过去，无论你杀多少人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.{\r}

81
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,094
除此之外...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And besides...{\r}

82
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,688
如果你拒绝生活中简单的乐趣的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...what's the point in being immortal...{\r}

83
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,366
永生有什么意义呢
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if you deny yourself life's simple pleasures?{\r}

84
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,502
你看见这个人了么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you see this human?{\r}

85
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,464
－他怎么了？ －我开始觉得里坎人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What of him? -I'm beginning to think the Lycans--{\r}

86
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,198
该死！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Blast!{\r}

87
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,942
穿的端庄些，赶紧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Put on something elegant and be quick about it.{\r}

88
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,553
克莱恩,我是认真的，我觉得他们在跟着他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kraven, I'm serious. I think they were following him.{\r}

89
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,422
除了食物，为什么里坎人跟踪人类呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?{\r}

90
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,533
有进展吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Any progress?{\r}

91
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,169
让我们瞧瞧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's find out.{\r}

92
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,004
没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Negative.{\r}

93
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,156
你回家？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You heading home?{\r}

94
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,094
是啊，尼古拉斯给了我几个小时的假
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.{\r}

95
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,095
另外...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By the way...{\r}

96
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,569
...他说今晚你手术做得不错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.{\r}

97
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,173
嗯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah.{\r}

98
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,905
放轻松点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take it easy.{\r}

99
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,500
我们被伏击了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We were ambushed.{\r}

100
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,499
三个死亡行者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Death Dealers, three of them.{\r}

101
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,164
－那个目标呢？ －我们跟丢了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-And the candidate? -We lost him.{\r}

102
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,331
跟丢了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You lost him?{\r}

103
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,170
看看这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look at this mess.{\r}

104
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,110
银球，高含量的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Ag rounds. High content.{\r}

105
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,308
防止他起变化
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Prevented him from making the change.{\r}

106
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,184
挖出剩下的也没用了 银已经穿透了他的器官
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No use in digging out the rest. Silver's penetrated his organs.{\r}

107
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,954
现在再想修复已经不可能了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Regeneration's impossible at this point.{\r}

108
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,625
把这些东西拿出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let's take these out.{\r}

109
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,701
放松
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Relax.{\r}

110
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,507
吸血鬼不会意识你会跟踪一个人类的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Vampires didn't realize you were following a human...{\r}

111
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,849
－对吧，瑞兹? －不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-...did they, Raze? -No.{\r}

112
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,755
我的意思是，我不这么想
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I mean, I don't think so.{\r}

113
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,656
－你不这么想，还是你根本就不知道？ －我不肯定
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-You don't think, or you don't know? -I'm not sure.{\r}

114
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,874
不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Negative.{\r}

115
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,710
我真的要去看看这个迈克尔了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I really must have a look at this Michael.{\r}

116
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,481
什么事情都要我亲自动手？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Must I do everything myself?{\r}

117
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:27,296
也许我们的豪宅会被一场大浪分割...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean...{\r}

118
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:32,500
...但是我们留有同样的血统
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.{\r}

119
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,669
当阿米莉娅到了并唤醒了马库斯时...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus...{\r}

120
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,941
还有两天的时间...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in just two days' time...{\r}

121
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,845
我们将会再一次的团结在一起了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...we shall once again be united as a single coven!{\r}

122
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,323
我们想多谢主人的盛情款待
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.{\r}

123
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,888
他进来，他干完活就回家了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He comes in, he does his job and then he goes home.{\r}

124
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,656
除了这些，我也不知道该告诉你什么了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Other than that, I don't know what to tell you.{\r}

125
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,994
昼夜不停的工作，生活中拥有的不多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Interns work around the clock. We don't have much of a life.{\r}

126
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,467
你知道我们哪儿能找到他么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know where we can find him?{\r}

127
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,036
不知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No.{\r}

128
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,701
你可以到他家去找找，要不就在这儿等他回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.{\r}

129
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,210
他没遇到什么麻烦吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's not in some kind of trouble, is he?{\r}

130
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,324
这是迈克尔家　我现在不在　 请留下您的口讯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is Michael. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.{\r}

131
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,365
迈克尔,我是亚当，警察正在医院找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.{\r}

132
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,402
他们确信你卷入了一场枪击事件
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They were convinced you were involved with a shootout.{\r}

133
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,741
我告诉他们这不可能...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I told them there's no way you'd be involved with that...{\r}

134
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,069
...但是他们还是在找你，就在现在
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but they're looking for you. Right now.{\r}

135
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,011
他们为什么找你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why are they after you?{\r}

136
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,931
他妈的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shit!{\r}

137
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,787
你好，迈克尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hello, Michael.{\r}

138
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,968
他妈的到底发生什么事了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the fuck is going on?{\r}

139
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,815
停车
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop the car.{\r}

140
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,680
停车！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stop the car!{\r}

141
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,847
别动手动脚！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Back off!{\r}

142
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,457
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay.{\r}

143
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,725
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay.{\r}

144
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,661
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

145
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,162
但是你流了很多血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But you've lost a lot of blood.{\r}

146
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,201
如果你不停车的话，我们都会死的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you don't stop the car, you'll get us both killed.{\r}

147
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,138
－我不是在吓你！ －我也不是！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I'm not screwing around! -Neither am l!{\r}

148
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,074
一直闭上你的嘴，我就会很好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shut up and hold on. I'll be fine.{\r}

149
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,944
他妈的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shit!{\r}

150
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,356
闪电般的逃脱，令人印象深刻
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A second escape. Impressive.{\r}

151
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,583
可能瑞兹没有夸大事实
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.{\r}

152
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,421
瑞兹没带回这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Raze didn't bring back this.{\r}

153
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:34,139
如果迈克尔的确我们要找的人， 那吸血鬼就会...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could--{\r}

154
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,906
放松点，老朋友
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Relax, old friend.{\r}

155
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,810
我尝过他的肉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've tasted his flesh.{\r}

156
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,878
离月圆还有两天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just two days till full moon.{\r}

157
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,681
很快他就会变成里坎人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, he will be a Lycan.{\r}

158
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,385
很快他就会来找我们了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, he will come looking for us.{\r}

159
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,109
可惜我们没有更多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's a shame we don't have more.{\r}

160
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,660
行了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Positive.{\r}

161
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,744
躺着别动，你脑袋被狠狠的敲了一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.{\r}

162
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,916
你昏迷了一会儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've been unconscious for a while.{\r}

163
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,353
你知道为什么那些人追你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you have any idea why those men were after you?{\r}

164
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,453
我在哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where am l?{\r}

165
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,122
这地方很安全
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're safe.{\r}

166
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,966
我是瑟琳
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm Selene.{\r}

167
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,373
这次，谣言是真的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So, for once, the rumors were true.{\r}

168
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,952
整间房子的人都会对你的新宠喋喋不休的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.{\r}

169
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,961
－你打算把他变成我们同类吗？ －当然不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Are you going to try to turn him? -Of course not.{\r}

170
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,161
那为什么你把他带到这儿来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So why did you bring him here?{\r}

171
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,701
他救过我的命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He saved my life.{\r}

172
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,135
－你怎么来这儿了？ －克莱恩派我来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Why are you here? -Kraven sent me.{\r}

173
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,040
现在他想见你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He wants to see you. Now.{\r}

174
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,215
这完全不能接受！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is completely unacceptable!{\r}

175
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,548
你违抗我的命令，整晚离开...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion...{\r}

176
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,181
...和一个人类在一起？居然还带到我这里来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.{\r}

177
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,524
据我所知，这儿仍是维克多的房子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}As far as I'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.{\r}

178
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,000
你知道，我不想吵架
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I don't want to argue.{\r}

179
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,296
你要知道迈克尔对里坎人来说有多重要
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans--{\r}

180
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,531
－现在叫迈克尔了! －能先听完我说的话么！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-So now it's "Michael"! -Would you just hear me out?{\r}

181
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,303
我无法理解为什么你执着于这个荒谬的理论
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.{\r}

182
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,003
鲁肖恩绝不会对一个人类有丝毫的兴趣...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lucian wouldn't be a bit interested in a human...{\r}

183
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,741
无论是迈克尔还是别人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Michael or otherwise.{\r}

184
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,017
等一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait a minute.{\r}

185
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,750
他让你着迷了，对吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're infatuated with him, aren't you?{\r}

186
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,120
这想法真荒谬
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, that's a ridiculous theory.{\r}

187
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,092
是吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it?{\r}

188
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,544
离开这儿！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Leave us!{\r}

189
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,108
我当然希望你不会生我的气
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I sure hope you never get pissed off with me.{\r}

190
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,913
等等
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Hold on.{\r}

191
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,851
看看这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Check this out.{\r}

192
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,323
动手吧，射击
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.{\r}

193
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,038
退出弹夹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Eject the mag.{\r}

194
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,048
你已经复制了他们的子弹，硝酸银
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've copied the Lycan rounds. Silver nitrate.{\r}

195
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,882
足以致命的剂量
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A lethal dose.{\r}

196
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,547
他们不能像取出一般子弹一样取出这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They won't dig these out, like our usual rounds.{\r}

197
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,183
直接进入血液，怎么也取不出来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Straight into the bloodstream. Ain't nothing to dig out.{\r}

198
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,491
告诉我,卡恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me, Kahn.{\r}

199
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,330
你相信鲁肖恩是像他们说的那样死了么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you believe Lucian died the way they say?{\r}

200
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,770
－克莱恩又讲起战争故事来了？ －那是我的看法
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Kraven telling war stories again? -That's my point.{\r}

201
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,138
那只不过是个古老的故事，他的故事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's nothing but an ancient story. His story.{\r}

202
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,508
没什么能证明他杀死了鲁肖恩，除了他的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.{\r}

203
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,707
我从没低估过克莱恩对进步的兴趣...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've never underestimated Kraven's lust for advancement...{\r}

204
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,752
但是维克多相信他，那就够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but Viktor believed him and that's all that matters.{\r}

205
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,754
－你要带着这个东西去哪儿？ －哪儿也不去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Where you going with this anyway? -Nowhere.{\r}

206
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,947
和死亡行者公开交火，并追击人类...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human...{\r}

207
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,348
并不是我所想的，你们应该是 开个店什么的低调点！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...was not what I had in mind. You were told to set up shop and lay low!{\r}

208
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,614
冷静点，克莱恩!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Calm yourself, Kraven!{\r}

209
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,191
人类不会注意到你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The human doesn't concern you.{\r}

210
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,295
而且我已经低调很久了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And besides, I've laid low for quite long enough.{\r}

211
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,413
管好你的人，鲁肖恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.{\r}

212
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,447
至少从现在开始
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}At least for the time being.{\r}

213
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,849
别让我后悔我们的交易
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't force me to regret our arrangement.{\r}

214
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,615
你只要尽好你自己的本份！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You just concentrate on your part.{\r}

215
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:38,122
记住，我已经为你流过一次血了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Remember, I've bled for you once already.{\r}

216
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,923
没我，你什么都不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Without me, you'd have nothing.{\r}

217
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,498
你什么都不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You'd be nothing.{\r}

218
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,375
在进攻鲁肖恩堡垒的全部勇士中间...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress...{\r}

219
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:37,480
只有一个吸血鬼幸存下来了，克莱恩...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...a single Vampire survived; Kraven...{\r}

220
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,448
他被给予很多的奖赏，不仅是因为他放了大火...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze...{\r}

221
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,578
还因为他带回了里坎族首领死亡的证据...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise...{\r}

222
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,749
从鲁肖恩手臂上割下来的有烙印的皮
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}... the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.{\r}

223
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,052
我一直在找你 他被咬了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been looking for you. He's been bitten.{\r}

224
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,327
你的人，他已经被打上了里坎人的标记
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.{\r}

225
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,863
－是克莱恩跟你说了的么？ －不是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Did Kraven put you up to this? -No.{\r}

226
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,561
我亲眼看见了那个伤口，我发誓
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw the wound with my own eyes, I swear it.{\r}

227
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,766
但是盟约怎么办？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But what about the Covenant?{\r}

228
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,171
你知道，这个是不允许的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know it's forbidden!{\r}

229
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,652
自从他咬了我之后，我就...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And ever since he bit me, I've been--{\r}

230
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,192
我就有了这些幻觉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been having these hallucinations and these delusions.{\r}

231
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:02,629
我所知道的就是好像我的头裂成两半似的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All I know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.{\r}

232
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,360
知道了，一个成年男子咬了你？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?{\r}

233
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,029
天哪！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Jesus.{\r}

234
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,970
你敢肯定不是狗咬的么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you sure this wasn't a dog?{\r}

235
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,542
我说过了，是个人，是一个人！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I said, it was a man. It was a man.{\r}

236
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,045
－好，我明白了 －他当时在追我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Okay, I got it. -He was after me.{\r}

237
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,776
－然后从地铁出来了个女人... －什么女人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-And that woman from the subway-- -What woman?{\r}

238
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,019
你到底听没听我说话？ 她把我当人质！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Haven't you been listening to me? She took me hostage!{\r}

239
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,680
好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right.{\r}

240
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,223
等一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just-- Please.{\r}

241
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,293
我会帮你把事情搞清楚的，好么？ 我一会儿就回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? I'll be right back.{\r}

242
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,334
放手,迈克尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let go, Michael.{\r}

243
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,428
放手
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Let go.{\r}

244
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,168
冷静点，好么？我一会儿就回来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just calm down, okay? I'm gonna be back in a minute.{\r}

245
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,311
－我保证 －好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-That's a promise. -All right.{\r}

246
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,041
请原谅我...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please forgive me...{\r}

247
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,116
但是我真的需要你的引导
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but I desperately need your guidance.{\r}

248
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,119
卡恩想见你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kahn wants to see you.{\r}

249
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,188
据我所知...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}To my knowledge...{\r}

250
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,832
一个像我这样的人是不会尝试苏醒的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.{\r}

251
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,925
老人们都有能力组织他们的记忆和思想...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts...{\r}

252
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,230
变成一个连贯的具像...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...into a single, cohesive vision...{\r}

253
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,341
和详细的记录
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...a detailed record of their reign.{\r}

254
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:09,411
我只希望维克多能听听我的恳求
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.{\r}

255
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,143
请原谅，但是我非常需要你的帮助
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please forgive me, but I desperately need your guidance.{\r}

256
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,581
很抱歉提前唤醒你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I apologize for awakening you ahead of schedule...{\r}

257
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,317
我担心我们可能处于非常危机之中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but I fear we may all be in grave danger.{\r}

258
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,023
尤其是你，我的主人，你现在是如此虚弱
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.{\r}

259
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,695
因为我相信鲁肖恩仍活得好好的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For I believe that Lucian is alive and well.{\r}

260
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,966
现在，在这个城市...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Here. Now. In this very city...{\r}

261
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,404
他在准备在苏醒仪式上攻击我们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.{\r}

262
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,836
更让人头痛的是...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Even more disturbing...{\r}

263
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,880
如果我想的没错...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...is that if I'm correct...{\r}

264
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,812
克莱恩跟鲁肖恩是一伙儿的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.{\r}

265
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,393
什么事这么急？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's so pressing?{\r}

266
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,804
看这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Take a look.{\r}

267
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,587
瑟琳!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Selene!{\r}

268
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,761
我要跟瑟琳说话!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to speak with Selene!{\r}

269
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,362
是迈克尔么?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is that Michael?{\r}

270
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,436
－是迈克尔么？ －到底发生什么事了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-ls it Michael? -What the hell is going on?{\r}

271
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,901
我到底怎么了？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's happening to me?{\r}

272
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,032
我这就出来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm coming out.{\r}

273
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,540
如果你去见他，你在这里就不再受欢迎了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.{\r}

274
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,952
现在维克多已经醒了，我们就看看 关于这件事他究竟想说点什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.{\r}

275
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,468
进来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get in.{\r}

276
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,520
看，我已经警告过她了 已经警告过了，可是她不听
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I warned her. I warned her, but she didn't listen.{\r}

277
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,996
－我本该早点跟你说的 －告诉我什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I should've told you sooner. -Told me what?{\r}

278
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,803
她的那个人类，迈克尔...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Her human, Michael...{\r}

279
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,465
他已经不再是个人类了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he's not a human at all.{\r}

280
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,803
他是个里坎人了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's a Lycan.{\r}

281
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,747
什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What?{\r}

282
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,579
什么事这么吵？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What's this ruckus?{\r}

283
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,150
别再回来了，他们会杀了你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never come here again. They'll kill you.{\r}

284
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,329
为什么？你们是谁？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why? Who are you people?{\r}

285
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,664
留我们单独在这儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Leave us.{\r}

286
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,980
不论你喜不喜欢，你已经处于 持续一千年的战争中了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.{\r}

287
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,249
吸血鬼和里坎人之间的族仇
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A blood feud between Vampires and Lycans.{\r}

288
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,085
狼人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Werewolves.{\r}

289
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,502
祝你好运
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Consider yourself lucky.{\r}

290
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,906
被咬过的大多数人类不在一个小时内都会死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.{\r}

291
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,979
我们传播的病毒是致命的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The viruses we transmit are deadly.{\r}

292
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,378
如果你咬了我，我也会变成吸血鬼？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if you bit me, I'd become a Vampire instead?{\r}

293
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,882
不，你会死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, you'd die.{\r}

294
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,019
被两个种族咬过之后，没有人可以幸存下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one's ever survived a bite from both species.{\r}

295
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,715
其实我该停下车然后杀了你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}By rights, I'd stop the car and kill you myself--{\r}

296
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,792
－为什么你要帮我？ －我没有帮你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Why are you helping me? -I'm not.{\r}

297
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,462
我追踪然后杀死你的同类
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I track down and kill your kind.{\r}

298
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,259
我最想知道的是为什么鲁肖恩这么想得到你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.{\r}

299
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,596
你知道为什么我醒了么，我的仆人？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Do you know why I've been awakened, servant?{\r}

300
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,639
不知道，主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No, my lord.{\r}

301
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,245
－但是我将会知道的 －你是说当你找到她的时候？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-But I'll soon find out. -You mean when you find her.{\r}

302
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,107
－是的，主人 －你一定要让她来见我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Yes, my lord. -You must let her come to me.{\r}

303
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:32,778
瑟琳和我，我们有很多事要谈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have much to discuss, Selene and l.{\r}

304
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:39,017
她让我看到了很多麻烦事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She has shown me a great many disturbing things.{\r}

305
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,494
不过这些事很快就会解决的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Things that will be dealt with soon enough.{\r}

306
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:46,601
这个地方越来越软弱和和堕落了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This coven has grown weak, decadent.{\r}

307
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:52,139
也许我本应该留个其他人处理我的事务
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Perhaps I should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.{\r}

308
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,646
还有...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Still...{\r}

309
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,713
她的记忆...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...her memories...{\r}

310
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,610
是混乱的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...are chaotic.{\r}

311
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,784
对时间没有意识
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no sense of time.{\r}

312
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,289
主人，请让我去召集支援吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please, my lord, let me summon assistance.{\r}

313
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,154
你需要的是休息
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You're in need of rest.{\r}

314
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,859
我已经休息够了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've rested enough.{\r}

315
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,769
你要做的就是召唤马库斯
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What you will do is summon Marcus.{\r}

316
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,697
但是他仍在休眠，主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But he still slumbers, my lord.{\r}

317
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,843
阿米莉娅和议会成员明天夜里会到达...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night...{\r}

318
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,040
唤醒马库斯的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...to awaken Marcus.{\r}

319
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,709
不是你，我的主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not you, my lord.{\r}

320
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:41,016
你已经提前整整一个世纪苏醒了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.{\r}

321
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,796
那个婊子背叛了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That bitch has betrayed me.{\r}

322
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:56,333
现在他知道所有她正在困扰的事情了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.{\r}

323
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,106
等等
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Wait.{\r}

324
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,881
你能被我相信吗?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Are you to be trusted?{\r}

325
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,787
当然
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Of course.{\r}

326
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,279
20分钟后在我住的地方等我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.{\r}

327
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,449
是时候让你知道一些事情了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's time I filled you in on a few things.{\r}

328
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:01,469
我看见这些，这些幻象
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.{\r}

329
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,300
它们不是幻象，是记忆
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They're not hallucinations, they're memories.{\r}

330
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:08,274
你被咬过了，他的记忆已经传递给你了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.{\r}

331
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:16,617
这是我们用来审问的地方之一，很安全的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is one of the places we use for interrogations. It should be safe.{\r}

332
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,702
－Ziodex工业 －我们开的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Ziodex lndustries. -We own it.{\r}

333
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,669
起先是人造血浆，现在就是这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}First there was synthetic plasma, now this.{\r}

334
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,638
一旦被许可，它就会成为我们最赚钱的商品
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.{\r}

335
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,710
它是克隆血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's cloned blood.{\r}

336
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,745
这些是作甚么用的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are these for?{\r}

337
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,979
里坎人对银过敏
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lycans are allergic to silver.{\r}

338
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,752
如果我们不尽快取出我们的子弹的话， 他们就会在审讯过程中死掉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.{\r}

339
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,289
然后你要对他们作什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What do you do with them after?{\r}

340
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,731
我们把子弹放回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We put the bullets back in.{\r}

341
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:22,350
－事情进展的如何？ －准备好了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-How are things progressing? -We're ready.{\r}

342
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,016
为什么你这么恨他们？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why do you hate them so much?{\r}

343
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:34,289
我告诉过你了，我们在战争
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've already told you, we're at war.{\r}

344
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:36,226
所以你只是按命令行事？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So you're just following orders?{\r}

345
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,035
为什么不回答？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Why can't you just answer the question?{\r}

346
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,137
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine.{\r}

347
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,917
一些事发生了...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Something was in the stable...{\r}

348
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,088
他们把我们的马撕成碎片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...tearing our horses to pieces.{\r}

349
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,914
我无法救出我妈妈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I couldn't have saved my mother.{\r}

350
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,526
我的妹妹
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or my sister.{\r}

351
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,556
他们的惊叫声惊醒了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Their screams woke me.{\r}

352
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:13,397
我爸爸死在外边，他试图去保护她们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My father died outside, trying to fend them off.{\r}

353
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,528
我站在门口...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I stood at my door...{\r}

354
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,701
当我想跑到我的侄女的房间时，我发现...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...about to run to my nieces' room when....{\r}

355
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,947
双胞胎女孩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Twin girls.{\r}

356
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,112
才6岁
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Barely 6 years old.{\r}

357
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,958
被屠杀了...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Butchered...{\r}

358
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,254
－像牲口似的 －天哪！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-...Iike animals. -Jesus Christ.{\r}

359
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,432
接下来我知道的就是我躺在他怀里了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The next thing I knew, I was in his arms.{\r}

360
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,869
战火烧到了我的家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The war had spilled into our house.{\r}

361
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:50,004
他已经跟踪里坎人好几天了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He'd been tracking the Lycans for days.{\r}

362
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,403
他把那些人赶走也救了我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He drove them off and saved me.{\r}

363
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,237
－谁？ －维克多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Who? -Viktor.{\r}

364
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:59,414
我们当中最年长和最强壮的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The oldest and strongest of us.{\r}

365
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,908
那一夜，他使我成为吸血鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That night, he made me a Vampire.{\r}

366
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,388
他给了我复仇的力量
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He gave me the strength to avenge my family.{\r}

367
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,389
从那时候起，我不再回忆过去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Since then, I've never looked back.{\r}

368
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,199
我看过你的照片
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw your pictures.{\r}

369
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,096
那个女人是谁？你的妻子？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who is the woman? Your wife?{\r}

370
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:34,445
也许应该看紧一点我们的兄弟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.{\r}

371
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,387
我会让瑞兹立刻去看
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'll have Raze see to it immediately.{\r}

372
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:42,991
朋友　我想我该相信你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm afraid that I'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.{\r}

373
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,827
时间不多了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Time is running short.{\r}

374
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:50,432
当我想转弯时，他朝我们撞过来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.{\r}

375
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,364
他正好把我们撞到反方向的单行道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He sent us right into the oncoming lane.{\r}

376
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,268
当我醒来的时候...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When I came to...{\r}

377
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,214
我意识到机器的引擎在前座
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.{\r}

378
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:12,885
而我妻子钉在那里 离我6英寸的距离
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And she was pinned there, 6 inches from me...{\r}

379
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,454
在这个可怕的位置
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...in this horrible position.{\r}

380
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,895
我想她吓坏了 因为她...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I think she was in shock because she just...{\r}

381
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,433
一遍一遍的问我是不是还好
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...kept asking me over and over again if I was all right.{\r}

382
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,803
她更担心我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She was more worried about me.{\r}

383
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,938
我如果能像现在一样意识到当时的状况 我应该能救她的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You know, if I knew then what I know now, I could have saved her.{\r}

384
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,313
我没有怀疑过这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no doubt in my mind about that.{\r}

385
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,188
但是恰恰在那里她死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But instead she died right there...{\r}

386
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,621
大概救护车赶来之前2分钟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.{\r}

387
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,095
从那以后我不能在周围看到棒子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After that, I didn't see any reason to stick around.{\r}

388
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:06,264
当我是小孩的时候我在这里 跟我的爷爷度过了一个夏天
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I spent a summer here with my grandfather when I was a kid so....{\r}

389
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,275
当我得到学位以后
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}After I got my degree, I just--{\r}

390
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,775
我就飞走了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I took off.{\r}

391
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:19,444
我搬到这里希望忘记一切
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I came over here to move on, to forget.{\r}

392
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,024
那个时候看上去这个主意不错
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It seemed like a good idea at the time.{\r}

393
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,364
你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And have you?{\r}

394
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,262
忘了吗?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Moved on?{\r}

395
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,732
你呢?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Have you?{\r}

396
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:49,246
我现在要告诉你的需要你保守秘密
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need you to keep what I'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.{\r}

397
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,443
等一下
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It can wait.{\r}

398
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,936
谁发动的战争？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who started the war?{\r}

399
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,782
他们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They did.{\r}

400
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,545
或者可以说，至少他们让我们这么相信
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Or at least that's what we've been led to believe.{\r}

401
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:27,913
挖掘过去是被禁止的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Digging into the past is forbidden.{\r}

402
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,784
我得回去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I should be heading back.{\r}

403
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,962
那我呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What about me?{\r}

404
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,529
维克多知道怎么做，我会回来的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Viktor will know what to do. I'll come back.{\r}

405
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,361
-我不想一个人呆着 -如果你想活就必须这么做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I won't stay alone. -You will if you want to live.{\r}

406
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,729
我想跟你一起走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want to go with you.{\r}

407
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,086
你在干嘛？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing?{\r}

408
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,361
明天月圆的时候..
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When the full moon rises tomorrow...{\r}

409
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:10,397
...你会变身, 你将会去杀人, 你将会去喝血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.{\r}

410
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,466
这是不可避免的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's unavoidable.{\r}

411
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,695
我不能让你随便乱走 对不起
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't leave you free to roam around. I'm sorry.{\r}

412
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,276
一发子弹不会杀了你，但是银会防止变身
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A single round won't kill you, but silver prevents transformation.{\r}

413
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,507
至少可以维持几个小时
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}At least for a few hours.{\r}

414
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,777
如果我没及时回来的话 自己看着办
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If I don't return in time, do yourself a favor.{\r}

415
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,244
用这个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Use it.{\r}

416
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,098
嗯?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yeah?{\r}

417
01:07:56,272 --> 01:08:00,003
主人,她来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My lord. She's here.{\r}

418
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,124
你怎么能这么对我？让我这样难堪？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How could you do this to me? Embarrass me like this?{\r}

419
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,091
这里都知道我是为了大家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The entire coven knows that I had plans for us.{\r}

420
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:25,199
-不是我们! -你快走，在维克多...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-There is no us! -You'll go before Viktor...{\r}

421
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:30,999
...告诉他我对你说的那些话! 从现在起，你要按我说的做
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and tell him exactly what I tell you to! From here on out, you'll do as I say.{\r}

422
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,573
还有什么不清楚的么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is that in any way unclear?{\r}

423
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,688
过来点，我的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come closer, my child.{\r}

424
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,352
出去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Outside.{\r}

425
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,897
快点，走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on, move it.{\r}

426
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,000
没有你我就迷失了方向，主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I've been lost without you, my lord.{\r}

427
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:44,907
克莱恩不停的纠缠我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.{\r}

428
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:51,313
这是书里最古老的故事
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It is the oldest story in the book.{\r}

429
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,481
他渴望得到他不能拥有的东西
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He desires the one thing he cannot have.{\r}

430
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,554
现在，告诉我...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, tell me...{\r}

431
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,798
为什么你相信卢西恩仍活着?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?{\r}

432
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,733
－没错 －我给了你所需要的全部证据
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Yeah. -I've given you all the proof you need.{\r}

433
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:16,003
破碎的想法和影像，没有别的了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Incoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.{\r}

434
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:19,614
那正是为何要召唤长老来完成
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.{\r}

435
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:22,080
你没有拥有必要的技能
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You do not possess the necessary skills.{\r}

436
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:25,084
但是我的确看见卢西恩了， 我还打了他一枪，你要相信我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I did see Lucian. I shot him. You must believe me.{\r}

437
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,451
惯例从来没被破坏过，一次都没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The chain has never been broken. Not once.{\r}

438
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,854
十四个世纪都没有
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not in 1 4 centuries.{\r}

439
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:35,122
自从我们这些老人开始 轮流执掌以来就没有过
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.{\r}

440
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,357
一个醒着，两个沉睡着，就是这样
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One awake, two asleep. That's the way of it.{\r}

441
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,764
现在是马库斯统治的时代，不是我的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.{\r}

442
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,904
－这很复杂 －可是我没的选择
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-There's been a complication. -But I had no choice.{\r}

443
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,066
大家处于危险之中，迈克尔是关键...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The coven is in danger, and Michael is the key--{\r}

444
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,980
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

445
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,309
里坎人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Lycan.{\r}

446
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,354
求你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please.{\r}

447
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,119
给我机会让我去搞到你要的证据吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Give me the chance to get proof you require.{\r}

448
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,451
好吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fine.{\r}

449
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,618
我让克莱恩去搜集证据...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...{\r}

450
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,791
如果有的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...if there is any.{\r}

451
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,135
为什么你信任他多于信任我？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How could you trust him over me?{\r}

452
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:19,467
因为他没有被动物感染上
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.{\r}

453
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,076
我爱你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I love you...{\r}

454
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:30,780
就像爱女儿一样,但你让我没有选择
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Iike a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.{\r}

455
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,013
这些规矩的存在一定有其合理的理由...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These rules are in place for a good reason...{\r}

456
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:39,491
而且那也是我们活这么久的唯一理由
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and they are the only reason we have survived this long.{\r}

457
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:47,601
你连一点的仁慈都得不到
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You will not be shown an ounce of leniency.{\r}

458
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:53,632
等阿米莉娅来了 委员会将开会决定你的命运
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}When Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.{\r}

459
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,406
你破坏了惯例，破坏了这个盟约！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You have broken the chain and the Covenant!{\r}

460
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,979
你该受到审判！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You must be judged!{\r}

461
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,403
你应该听我的话，别管这事了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You should've listened to me and stayed out of this.{\r}

462
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:32,104
如果你运气好 也许我能说服委员会饶了你的命
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now you'll be lucky if I can convince the Council to spare your life.{\r}

463
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,010
告诉我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Tell me.{\r}

464
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,643
是你从鲁肖恩手臂上割下那块皮的 还是鲁肖恩自己割下来的？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?{\r}

465
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,888
记着我的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Mark my words.{\r}

466
01:12:47,095 --> 01:12:50,030
不久，你就会用我的方式看待问题
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, you'll be seeing things my way.{\r}

467
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,569
不准开门，明白么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No one opens this door. Understood?{\r}

468
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:09,308
我不能让我未来的女王和那个里坎人再跑了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.{\r}

469
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:49,484
他妈的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Shit.{\r}

470
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,694
改变计划，索伦和他的人会把阿米莉娅接来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.{\r}

471
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,774
－这是我们的事！ －不再是了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-That's our job. -Not anymore.{\r}

472
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,374
－为什么你要帮我？ －不，我是在帮我自己
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Why are you helping me? -I'm not. I'm helping me.{\r}

473
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,992
－什么事？ －警报器被触动了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What's going on? -The perimeter sensor's been tripped.{\r}

474
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,628
我们正封锁整座楼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We're locking down the mansion.{\r}

475
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:52,066
是瑟琳，她跑了，去找他，去找迈克尔了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.{\r}

476
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,669
我要那个里坎人的头！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I want that Lycan's head on a plate.{\r}

477
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,227
我们得走了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We need to go.{\r}

478
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,585
趴下！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get down!{\r}

479
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:06,228
走，走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Go. Go.{\r}

480
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,572
－跳！ －你他妈不是跟我开玩笑吧？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Jump. -Are you fucking kidding me?{\r}

481
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,117
－怎么样？ －只是假警报
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Any luck? -False alarm.{\r}

482
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:44,765
如果有什么东西靠近围栏的话 那些狗早都全上去了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.{\r}

483
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:48,300
－阿米莉娅现在应该已经到了 －是啊
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Amelia should have arrived by now. -Yes.{\r}

484
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:57,107
我想让你去看看什么事情耽搁她了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Look, I want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.{\r}

485
01:21:57,278 --> 01:21:59,075
知道了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've got it.{\r}

486
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,880
或许我们应该停车给他吃点药
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Maybe we should pull over and dose him.{\r}

487
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:43,047
去他妈的,他会没事儿的，我们就快到了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fuck him. He'll be all right. We're almost there.{\r}

488
01:23:48,389 --> 01:23:52,257
噢，该死！他不行了，停车，停车！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it. Pull over. Pull over!{\r}

489
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:12,704
拿东西来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Get the kit.{\r}

490
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,386
扎他，扎他
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Stick him. Stick him.{\r}

491
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,403
主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My lord.{\r}

492
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:45,206
维克多找你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Viktor wants to speak with you.{\r}

493
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,536
我的主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My lord.{\r}

494
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,573
我派瑟琳去...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I sent for Selene...{\r}

495
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,007
不是你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...not you.{\r}

496
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,246
她违抗你的命令...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}She's defied your orders...{\r}

497
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,989
逃出去了，我的主人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and fled the mansion, my lord.{\r}

498
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:34,254
你的无能最让我头痛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your incompetence is becoming most taxing.{\r}

499
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:37,431
这不是我的错 她在自寻烦恼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's not my fault. She's become obsessed...{\r}

500
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:41,035
...以为我在搞什么阴谋
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...thinks that I'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.{\r}

501
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,193
这是我的证据
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And here's my proof.{\r}

502
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,615
现在，你把你跟我说的话再跟他们说一遍
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now, I want you to tell them exactly what you told me.{\r}

503
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:11,492
好的，好的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}All right, all right.{\r}

504
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:18,166
我们在研究一个特殊种族
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We've been searching for someone with a special trait.{\r}

505
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,605
科维努斯的直裔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...{\r}

506
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:26,406
...匈牙利人, 一个将军...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Hungarian, a warlord...{\r}

507
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:31,143
在第5世纪的时候上台执政的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.{\r}

508
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:37,781
刚好看到他的村庄被大清洗
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.{\r}

509
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:42,021
只有他活下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He alone survived.{\r}

510
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:48,199
他的身体可以改变疾病
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Somehow, his body was able to change the disease...{\r}

511
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:52,203
把它变成对他有益的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...mold it to his benefit.{\r}

512
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:57,538
他成为第一个真正永生的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He became the first true immortal.{\r}

513
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,821
几年以后他成为两个孩子的父亲
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And years later, he fathered at least two children...{\r}

514
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,289
他们继承了同样的特性
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who inherited this same trait.{\r}

515
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,758
科维努斯的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The sons of the Corvinus clan.{\r}

516
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:19,160
一个被蝙蝠咬了 一个被狼咬了...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One bitten by bat, one by wolf...{\r}

517
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:24,636
还有一个像人一样生老病死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.{\r}

518
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:30,244
-这是个可笑的故事! -可能...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-It's a ridiculous legend. Nothing! -That may be...{\r}

519
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,479
...但是我们的种族确实有个共同的祖先
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but our species do have a common ancestor.{\r}

520
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:40,014
一个原病毒的异变...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A mutation of the original virus...{\r}

521
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,383
和他的血脉有直接的关系
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...is directly linked to his bloodline.{\r}

522
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:47,392
那里躺着一个科维努斯的后裔...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There is a descendant of Corvinus lying there...{\r}

523
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:50,688
离你不足三英尺远
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...not three feet from you.{\r}

524
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,627
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

525
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:58,431
但是他已经是一个吸血鬼了 我们需要的是一个纯正的源
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But he's already a Vampire. We needed a pure source...{\r}

526
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:04,506
没有受到过污染 最初病毒完全拷贝
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus...{\r}

527
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,847
就我们知道的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which we learned...{\r}

528
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:11,417
是藏于他人类后代的基因密码中的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...{\r}

529
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:16,614
并且以隐匿的形式传递下去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and passed along in its latent form...{\r}

530
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,692
经过这么多代
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...down through the ages...{\r}

531
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:25,730
到了迈克尔 科温
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...all the way to Michael Corvin.{\r}

532
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:31,838
许多年我们都在混合血统
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}For years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.{\r}

533
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,406
这么多年来我们都失败了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And for years we failed.{\r}

534
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,107
这是没用的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was useless.{\r}

535
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:47,147
甚至细胞我们两个种族都在互相毁灭
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.{\r}

536
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:54,717
直到我们找到迈克尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That is, until we found Michael.{\r}

537
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:02,893
他的血可以使我们种族能完美的结合
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.{\r}

538
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:08,405
三细胞血小板...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}A triple-celled platelet...{\r}

539
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:14,514
拥有不可言语的力量
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...which holds unspeakable power.{\r}

540
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:18,113
不可能有这种结合
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There can be no such union.{\r}

541
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:23,549
-你说的是邪教 -我们会看到的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-And to speak of it is heresy. -We'll see.{\r}

542
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:29,219
一旦鲁肖恩给他自己注射了迈克尔的血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.{\r}

543
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,324
鲁肖恩已经死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lucian is dead.{\r}

544
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:35,059
谁说的?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}According to whom?{\r}

545
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,505
我需要你替我作些事情
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need you to do something for me.{\r}

546
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,424
我向你保证，我的孩子...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I can assure you, my child...{\r}

547
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,924
克莱恩将以性命偿还
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Kraven will pay with his life.{\r}

548
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:25,315
不久这所房子将会成为废墟
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, this house will lie in ruins.{\r}

549
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:27,920
-不会在你之前 -不，等等，等等
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Not before you. -No, wait. Wait.{\r}

550
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:31,081
你，只有你会知道这个事实
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You and you alone will know the truth of this.{\r}

551
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:40,559
如果鲁肖恩能够得到一个纯种的人的血...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born...{\r}

552
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:45,798
一个像阿米莉娅一样有权的长老...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...a powerful elder like Amelia...{\r}

553
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:49,704
或者是你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...or yourself...{\r}

554
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:54,507
和迈克尔的血一起注入....
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and inject it along with Michael's blood....{\r}

555
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:56,843
可恨
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Abomination.{\r}

556
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,213
半吸血鬼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Half-Vampire...{\r}

557
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:03,653
半里坎人, 但是比两个都要强
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.{\r}

558
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,142
我要和卡恩说话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need to speak with Kahn.{\r}

559
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,447
我的主人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My lord...{\r}

560
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:38,088
委员会成员已经被暗杀了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the Council members have been assassinated.{\r}

561
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:44,794
阿米莉娅怎么样了？ 他们放光了她的血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What of Amelia? -They bled her dry.{\r}

562
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:51,095
已经开始了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It has already begun.{\r}

563
01:32:02,516 --> 01:32:04,950
我对我曾怀疑你感到抱歉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm sorry I doubted you.{\r}

564
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:10,786
别害怕，我的孩子 你将会得到赦免
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...{\r}

565
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:17,756
只要你杀死了科维努斯的后代
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...{\r}

566
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:20,627
迈克尔
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Michael.{\r}

567
01:32:56,203 --> 01:33:00,469
已经给了你可以停止变身的酶了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You've been given an enzyme to stop the change.{\r}

568
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:06,102
晕眩的状态一会儿就会消失的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.{\r}

569
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,416
够了！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's enough!{\r}

570
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:19,048
去看看瑞兹怎么还没来？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Just go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?{\r}

571
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,456
我真的要说抱歉
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I really must apologize.{\r}

572
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,065
他真的需要好好学学礼貌
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.{\r}

573
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,992
谈到礼貌，请原谅，我呢？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.{\r}

574
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,263
我是鲁肖恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I'm Lucian.{\r}

575
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,673
我要走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need to go.{\r}

576
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,569
我要回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I need to get back.{\r}

577
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,649
不能回去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no going back.{\r}

578
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:46,842
哪儿都不能去
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no going anywhere.{\r}

579
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:51,958
吸血鬼一看见你就会杀了你，就因你是
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Vampires will kill you on sight. Just for being what you are.{\r}

580
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,922
我们当中的一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}One of us.{\r}

581
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,133
你是我们当中的一个
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You are one of us.{\r}

582
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:04,701
你干什么？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are you doing?{\r}

583
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:08,901
－你作什么呢？ －让这场冲突结束
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-What are you doing? -Bringing an end to this conflict.{\r}

584
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,511
你的战争，它与我无关
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your war, it has nothing to do with me.{\r}

585
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:20,620
我的战争？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}My war?{\r}

586
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,638
不!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

587
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,547
不!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

588
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:50,873
不!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

589
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,683
不!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

590
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,018
不! 不!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No! No!{\r}

591
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:42,466
索妮亚!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sonja!{\r}

592
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:48,993
他们逼你看着她死
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They forced you to watch her die.{\r}

593
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,238
索妮亚!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Sonja.{\r}

594
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:57,504
这才是引起战争的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's what started the war.{\r}

595
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:03,979
我看见它发生就像我身临其境一般
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I saw it happen as if I were there.{\r}

596
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:11,716
我们曾经是奴隶
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We were slaves once.{\r}

597
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:16,693
吸血鬼白天的守卫者
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The daylight guardians of the Vampires.{\r}

598
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:21,228
我出生在奴隶的家庭...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I was born in servitude...{\r}

599
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:25,870
但是我对不恨吸血鬼
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...yet I harbored them no ill will.{\r}

600
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:29,742
我甚至娶了一个吸血鬼作我的新娘
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I even took a Vampire for my bride.{\r}

601
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:32,702
这是禁止的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was forbidden...{\r}

602
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:35,177
我们的结合
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...our union.{\r}

603
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:40,309
维克多怕血统混合
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Viktor feared a blending of the species.{\r}

604
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:44,420
非常害怕
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Feared it so much...{\r}

605
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:47,583
他杀了她
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he killed her.{\r}

606
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,857
他自己的女儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}His own daughter...{\r}

607
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:54,330
活活的烧死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...burnt alive...{\r}

608
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,705
只是因为她爱我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...for loving me.{\r}

609
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,471
这是他的战争
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}This is his war...{\r}

610
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:06,704
维克多的...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...Viktor's...{\r}

611
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:11,245
而且他从600年前就开始...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...and he's spent the last 600 years...{\r}

612
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:15,149
消灭我的部族
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...exterminating my species.{\r}

613
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,053
他们会对瑟琳作什么呢？?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What are they gonna do to Selene?{\r}

614
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,396
我们有客人来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}We have company.{\r}

615
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:28,666
－我想我们说好了的 －耐心点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-I thought we had a deal. -Patience.{\r}

616
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:32,431
克莱恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Kraven.{\r}

617
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,939
我们有点事要私下谈
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}These are matters to be discussed in private.{\r}

618
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:41,609
把我们的客人护送到楼下去吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Please escort our guests downstairs.{\r}

619
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:00,556
委员会被消灭了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}The Council has been destroyed.{\r}

620
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:04,269
很快你就会得到它们
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, you will have it all.{\r}

621
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:10,399
伟大的吸血鬼和里坎人达成的永久和平条约
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.{\r}

622
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:14,980
当战利品到手后 我不会忘记那些我信任的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Who I trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.{\r}

623
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:19,210
维克多已经醒了，你以为我还能控制吗？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's awake?{\r}

624
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:22,947
没人可以打败他，我们说话的时候 他正变得更加强大
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}There's no defeating him. He grows stronger as we speak.{\r}

625
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:27,253
这就是为什么我需要迈克尔的原因
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And that is precisely why I need Michael.{\r}

626
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,827
如果维克多很容易就会被弄死的话
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}If Viktor were so easy to dispatch...{\r}

627
01:39:30,397 --> 01:39:33,457
几世纪前你自己就会干掉他了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.{\r}

628
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,575
关闸！快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Exit shaft! Move it!{\r}

629
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,447
狗娘养的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Son of a bitch!{\r}

630
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,994
噢，他妈的！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Oh, shit!{\r}

631
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,675
是维克多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It's Viktor.{\r}

632
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,477
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

633
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:28,251
如果你干好自己活的话，他仍旧在休眠中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.{\r}

634
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:36,161
瑞兹他妈的到底在哪儿?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where the hell is Raze?{\r}

635
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,460
还有别的出路么?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is there another way out?{\r}

636
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:47,730
我猜你没想到要流血才能赢得胜利
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I guess it didn't occur to you that you'll have to bleed to pull off this coup.{\r}

637
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,939
别想逃
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Don't even think about leaving.{\r}

638
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:19,371
硝酸银！我打赌你没想到这点
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Silver nitrate. Bet you weren't expecting that.{\r}

639
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:31,618
快，快点！快上！快！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!{\r}

640
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:55,861
鲁肖恩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Lucian.{\r}

641
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,581
瑟琳!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Selene!{\r}

642
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:56,515
瑟琳!
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Selene!{\r}

643
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:44,634
还不行
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not yet.{\r}

644
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:37,128
我要带你走，维克多就要来了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have to get you out. Viktor's on his way.{\r}

645
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:40,266
他不希望一个里坎人能活下来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.{\r}

646
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:43,694
他们也会因为你帮助我而杀了你的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}They'll kill you too, just for helping me.{\r}

647
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:45,436
我知道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know.{\r}

648
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:10,960
我知道这导致了这场战争
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I know what started the war.{\r}

649
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:22,994
够了！跟我来！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}That's enough. You're coming with me!{\r}

650
01:53:24,063 --> 01:53:26,588
我希望我能活着 看到维克多结束你的生命！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I hope I live to see Viktor choke the life from you!{\r}

651
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,801
我打赌你会
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I bet you do.{\r}

652
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:33,032
但是让我告诉你一件事 关于你深爱着的黑暗之父的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.{\r}

653
01:53:34,173 --> 01:53:36,664
他就是杀死你全家的凶手之一
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}He's the one who killed your family.{\r}

654
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,841
不是里坎人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Not the Lycans.{\r}

655
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:41,574
从不遵守自己定的规矩
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Never could follow his own rules.{\r}

656
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:44,148
他说无法忍受牲畜的味道
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.{\r}

657
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:48,549
所以他经常出去，贪婪地喝着人血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.{\r}

658
01:53:49,355 --> 01:53:51,323
我替他保守秘密
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I kept his secrets...{\r}

659
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:53,049
收拾残局
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...cleaned up the mess.{\r}

660
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:55,527
就是他...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But it was he...{\r}

661
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:57,356
蹑手蹑脚的走进一个个房间...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...who crept room to room...{\r}

662
01:53:57,563 --> 01:54:00,896
杀死了你最亲的人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...dispatching everyone close to your heart.{\r}

663
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:03,928
但是当他看到你...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But when he got to you...{\r}

664
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:08,072
他忍不住想喝干你的血
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.{\r}

665
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:13,304
可是你让他想起了他最珍爱的索妮亚....
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...{\r}

666
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:18,308
他亲手处决的女儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the daughter he condemned to death.{\r}

667
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:21,913
－说谎 －信不信由你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}-Lies. -Believe what you want.{\r}

668
01:54:22,855 --> 01:54:24,550
快走
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Now come on.{\r}

669
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:26,988
到我身边来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your place is by my side.{\r}

670
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,034
那就这样吧
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}So be it.{\r}

671
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:06,360
咬他！
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Bite him!{\r}

672
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:12,131
半吸血鬼...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Half-Vampire...{\r}

673
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:14,102
半里坎人...
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...half-Lycan...{\r}

674
01:55:14,273 --> 01:55:17,140
但是比两个都要强
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...but stronger than both.{\r}

675
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:45,260
你到底在干什么
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}What the hell are you doing?{\r}

676
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:48,540
你可以杀死我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}You may have killed me...{\r}

677
01:55:49,308 --> 01:55:50,570
堂兄
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...cousin.{\r}

678
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:52,734
但是我的愿望
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But my will...{\r}

679
01:55:52,912 --> 01:55:55,506
已经实现
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...is done regardless.{\r}

680
01:56:35,621 --> 01:56:37,486
他在哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where is he?{\r}

681
01:56:38,591 --> 01:56:39,853
克莱恩在哪儿？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Where's Kraven?{\r}

682
01:57:01,147 --> 01:57:03,513
原谅我，我的孩子
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Forgive me, my child.{\r}

683
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,717
不是里坎人
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It wasn't the Lycans.{\r}

684
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:10,652
是你
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}It was you.{\r}

685
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:19,531
走开
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Leave us.{\r}

686
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:40,884
你怎么能骗我
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}How could you bear my trust...{\r}

687
01:57:41,053 --> 01:57:43,419
是你杀了我全家
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...knowing that you'd killed my family?{\r}

688
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,285
是的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Yes.{\r}

689
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,724
我从你身边夺走很多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I have taken from you.{\r}

690
01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:53,456
但是我给你的更多
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But I have given so much more.{\r}

691
01:57:54,433 --> 01:57:59,632
这不是公平交易吗？ 我赐予你生活？赐予你的永生？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Is it not a fair trade, the life I have granted you? The gift of immortality?{\r}

692
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:02,501
还有你女儿的生命？
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And the life of your daughter?{\r}

693
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:05,276
你自己的骨肉?
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Your own flesh and blood?{\r}

694
01:58:26,332 --> 01:58:29,028
我爱我的女儿
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I loved my daughter!{\r}

695
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:33,703
但是她怀了孽种
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}But the abomination growing in her womb...{\r}

696
01:58:33,873 --> 01:58:36,569
那是对我和整个族的背叛
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...was a betrayal of me and of the coven!{\r}

697
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:45,581
我所作的都是为了保护我的种族
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}I did what was necessary to protect the species...{\r}

698
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:49,187
而且我不得不再这么做一次了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...as I am forced to do yet again.{\r}

699
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:55,318
不
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}No!{\r}

700
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,327
该去死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Time to die.{\r}

701
02:05:09,201 --> 02:05:11,897
虽然我无法预言未来
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Though I cannot predict the future...{\r}

702
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:15,632
但今晚的结局会在接下来的许多年中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...{\r}

703
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:18,936
给族里造成巨大影响
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...of both great covens for many years to come.{\r}

704
02:05:20,412 --> 02:05:23,210
两个吸血鬼长老死了
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Two Vampire elders have been slain...{\r}

705
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:25,612
有一个是我亲手杀死的
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...one by my own hand.{\r}

706
02:05:27,386 --> 02:05:31,220
不久马库斯将会继位
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Soon, Marcus will take the throne.{\r}

707
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:37,054
怨恨和报复将弥漫在夜空中
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.{\r}

708
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:41,493
分歧将被消除
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Differences will be set aside.{\r}

709
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:44,433
人人都会效忠
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}Allegiances will be made.{\r}

710
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,528
不久
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}And soon...{\r}

711
02:05:46,705 --> 02:05:49,367
我将会被追杀
{\fscx75\fscy75\1c&H00FFFF&}...I will become the hunted.{\r}
