1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,086
The war had all but ground to a halt
in the blink of an eye.

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,531
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless
leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...

3
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,296
...had finally been killed.

4
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,933
The Lycan horde
scattered to the wind...

5
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,443
...in a single evening
of flame and retribution.

6
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,753
Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,788
... the very birthright of the Vampires.

8
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,056
Nearly six centuries had passed
since that night.

9
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,498
Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling
to follow Lucian to the grave.

10
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,602
Though Lycans were
fewer in number...

11
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,071
... the war itself had become
more perilous.

12
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,636
For the moon no longer
held her sway.

13
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:58,339
Older, more powerful Lycans
were now able to change at will.

14
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,751
The weapons had evolved,
but our orders remained the same;

15
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,722
Hunt them down and kill them off,
one by one.

16
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,328
A most successful campaign.

17
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,898
Perhaps too successful.

18
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,344
For those like me, a Death Dealer...

19
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,108
... this signaled the end of an era.

20
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,014
Like the weapons
of the previous century...

21
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,746
... we, too, would become obsolete.

22
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,323
Pity, because I lived for it.

23
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,894
Bloods!

24
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,208
It's all right. It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

25
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,045
You're acting like a pack
of rabid dogs!

26
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,355
And that, gentlemen...

27
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,388
...simply will not do.

28
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,824
Not if you expect to defeat
the Vampires on their own ground.

29
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,427
Not if you expect to survive at all.

30
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,429
Pierce! Taylor!

31
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,066
Put some clothes on, will you?

32
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,771
We have a serious problem.

33
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,893
I'll have to run a few tests.

34
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,900
It's definitely an irradiated fluid
of some sort.

35
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,731
Ultraviolet ammunition.

36
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,035
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.

37
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,942
You expect me to believe
that a mangy animal...

38
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,403
...came up with a bullet specifically
engineered to kill Vampires?

39
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,343
No, I'm betting it's military.

40
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,809
Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.

41
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,113
I don't care where
they got these things.

42
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,189
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel
could still be out there.

43
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,588
Let's gather the Death Dealers
and go back.

44
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,763
Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.

45
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,889
The Awakening is a few days off,
and this house is in unrest as it is.

46
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,696
Random? They opened fire on us
in full view of the public.

47
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,932
-And from what I heard in that tunnel--
-You said you didn't see anything.

48
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,179
I know what I heard,
and I know what my gut tells me.

49
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,678
There could be dozens
of Lycans down there.

50
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,783
Who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.

51
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,576
We've hunted them
to the brink of extinction.

52
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,050
Kraven's right, Selene.

53
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,216
There's not been a den
of that magnitude for centuries.

54
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,192
-Not since the days of Lucian.
-I know that, Kahn.

55
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,161
But I'd rather you prove me wrong
by checking it out.

56
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,666
Have your men tighten things up.

57
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,998
I'll have Soren assemble
a search team.

58
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:05,475
-No, I want to lead the team myself.
-Absolutely not! Soren will handle it.

59
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,475
Hundreds, really?

60
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,479
Viktor would believe me.

61
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,318
-I'd never treat you like that.
-Of course not.

62
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:23,752
Now run along and make sure she's
dressed and ready for her guests.

63
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,191
-It's a waste of time, you know.
-What is?

64
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,498
I doubt Viktor would want you freezing
in here, staring at his tomb for hours.

65
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,337
No, he'd want the Death Dealers out
there, scouring every inch of the city.

66
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,880
Kraven. I'll never understand
why Viktor left him in charge.

67
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,483
He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.

68
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,050
We need to get you ready.

69
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,482
-For what?
-The party.

70
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,284
Amelia's envoy will be here
any minute.

71
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,975
Oh, yes.

72
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,315
You should definitely wear this one.
It's perfect.

73
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,876
They were after you.

74
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,119
He's attractive...

75
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,723
-...for a human.
-Who's attractive?

76
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,108
I planned to have you
at my side this evening.

77
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,610
Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.

78
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,012
If you ask me, you take this warrior
business far too seriously.

79
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,654
You can't undo the past,
no matter how many you kill.

80
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,094
And besides...

81
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,688
...what's the point
in being immortal...

82
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,366
...if you deny yourself
life's simple pleasures?

83
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,502
Do you see this human?

84
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,464
-What of him?
-I'm beginning to think the Lycans--

85
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,198
Blast!

86
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,942
Put on something elegant
and be quick about it.

87
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,553
Kraven, I'm serious.
I think they were following him.

88
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,422
Other than food,
why would Lycans stalk a human?

89
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,533
Any progress?

90
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,169
Let's find out.

91
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,004
Negative.

92
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,156
You heading home?

93
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,094
Yeah, Nicholas gave me
a couple hours off.

94
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,095
By the way...

95
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,569
...he said you did a terrific job
tonight with the surgery.

96
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,173
Yeah.

97
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,905
Take it easy.

98
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,500
We were ambushed.

99
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,499
Death Dealers, three of them.

100
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,164
-And the candidate?
-We lost him.

101
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,331
You lost him?

102
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,170
Look at this mess.

103
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,110
Ag rounds. High content.

104
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,308
Prevented him from
making the change.

105
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,184
No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.

106
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,954
Regeneration's impossible
at this point.

107
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,625
Let's take these out.

108
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,701
Relax.

109
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,507
The Vampires didn't realize
you were following a human...

110
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,849
-...did they, Raze?
-No.

111
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,755
I mean, I don't think so.

112
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,656
-You don't think, or you don't know?
-I'm not sure.

113
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,874
Negative.

114
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,710
I really must have a look
at this Michael.

115
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,481
Must I do everything myself?

116
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:27,296
Our noble houses may be
separated by a great ocean...

117
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:32,500
...but we are equally committed
to the survival of the bloodlines.

118
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,669
And when Amelia arrives
to awaken Marcus...

119
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,941
...in just two days' time...

120
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,845
...we shall once again
be united as a single coven!

121
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,323
We want to thank our hosts
for their generous hospitality.

122
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,888
He comes in, he does his job
and then he goes home.

123
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,656
Other than that,
I don't know what to tell you.

124
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,994
Interns work around the clock.
We don't have much of a life.

125
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,467
You know where we can find him?

126
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,036
No.

127
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,701
You can try him at home,
or you'll have to wait till he gets back.

128
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,210
He's not in some kind
of trouble, is he?

129
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,324
This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

130
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,365
Michael, it's Adam. The police were
just in the hospital looking for you.

131
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,402
They were convinced you were
involved with a shootout.

132
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,741
I told them there's no way
you'd be involved with that...

133
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,069
...but they're looking for you.
Right now.

134
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,011
Why are they after you?

135
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,931
Shit!

136
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,787
Hello, Michael.

137
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,968
What the fuck is going on?

138
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,815
Stop the car.

139
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,680
Stop the car!

140
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,847
Back off!

141
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,457
Okay.

142
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,725
Okay.

143
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,661
All right.

144
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,162
But you've lost a lot of blood.

145
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,201
If you don't stop the car,
you'll get us both killed.

146
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,138
-I'm not screwing around!
-Neither am l!

147
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,074
Shut up and hold on.
I'll be fine.

148
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,944
Shit!

149
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,356
A second escape. Impressive.

150
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,583
Perhaps Raze wasn't
overstating matters.

151
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,421
Raze didn't bring back this.

152
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:34,139
If Michael is indeed The Carrier,
the Vampires could--

153
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,906
Relax, old friend.

154
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,810
I've tasted his flesh.

155
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,878
Just two days till full moon.

156
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,681
Soon, he will be a Lycan.

157
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,385
Soon, he will come looking for us.

158
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,109
It's a shame we don't have more.

159
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,660
Positive.

160
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,744
Lay still. Your skull's
taken a good knock.

161
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,916
You've been unconscious
for a while.

162
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:26,353
Do you have any idea
why those men were after you?

163
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,453
Where am l?

164
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,122
You're safe.

165
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,966
I'm Selene.

166
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,373
So, for once, the rumors were true.

167
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,952
The whole house has been absolutely
buzzing about your new pet.

168
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,961
-Are you going to try to turn him?
-Of course not.

169
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,161
So why did you bring him here?

170
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,701
He saved my life.

171
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,135
-Why are you here?
-Kraven sent me.

172
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,040
He wants to see you. Now.

173
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,215
This is completely unacceptable!

174
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:32,548
You go against my orders and spend
the night away from the mansion...

175
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,181
...with a human? A human you've
since brought back to my house.

176
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,524
As far as I'm concerned,
this is still Viktor's house.

177
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,000
Look, I don't want to argue.

178
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,296
Understand that Michael is somehow
important to the Lycans--

179
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,531
-So now it's "Michael"!
-Would you just hear me out?

180
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,303
It's beyond me why you're so
obsessed over this ridiculous theory.

181
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,003
Lucian wouldn't be a bit
interested in a human...

182
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,741
...Michael or otherwise.

183
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,017
Wait a minute.

184
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,750
You're infatuated with him,
aren't you?

185
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,120
Now, that's a ridiculous theory.

186
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,092
Is it?

187
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,544
Leave us!

188
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,108
I sure hope you never get
pissed off with me.

189
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,913
Hold on.

190
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,851
Check this out.

191
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,323
Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.

192
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,038
Eject the mag.

193
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,048
You've copied the Lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.

194
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,882
A lethal dose.

195
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,547
They won't dig these out,
like our usual rounds.

196
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,183
Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.

197
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,491
Tell me, Kahn.

198
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,330
Do you believe Lucian died
the way they say?

199
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,770
-Kraven telling war stories again?
-That's my point.

200
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,138
It's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.

201
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,508
There's not a shred of proof
he killed Lucian, only his word.

202
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,707
I've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement...

203
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,752
...but Viktor believed him
and that's all that matters.

204
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,754
-Where you going with this anyway?
-Nowhere.

205
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,947
Engaging Death Dealers in public
and chasing after some human...

206
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,348
...was not what I had in mind. You
were told to set up shop and lay low!

207
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,614
Calm yourself, Kraven!

208
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,191
The human doesn't concern you.

209
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,295
And besides, I've laid low
for quite long enough.

210
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,413
Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.

211
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,447
At least for the time being.

212
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,849
Don't force me to regret
our arrangement.

213
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,615
You just concentrate on your part.

214
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:38,122
Remember, I've bled for you
once already.

215
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,923
Without me, you'd have nothing.

216
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,498
You'd be nothing.

217
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,375
Of the scores of brave souls
who entered Lucian's fortress...

218
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:37,480
...a single Vampire survived;
Kraven...

219
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,448
...who was richly rewarded
for not only setting the great blaze...

220
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,578
...but for returning with evidence
of the Lycan master's demise...

221
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,749
... the branded skin,
cut from Lucian's very arm.

222
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,052
I've been looking for you.
He's been bitten.

223
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,327
Your human,
he's been marked by a Lycan.

224
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,863
-Did Kraven put you up to this?
-No.

225
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:33,561
I saw the wound with my own eyes,
I swear it.

226
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,766
But what about the Covenant?

227
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,171
You know it's forbidden!

228
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,652
And ever since he bit me,
I've been--

229
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,192
I've been having these hallucinations
and these delusions.

230
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:02,629
All I know is, it feels like
my skull is splitting in half.

231
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,360
Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?

232
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,029
Jesus.

233
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,970
Are you sure this wasn't a dog?

234
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,542
I said, it was a man.
It was a man.

235
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,045
-Okay, I got it.
-He was after me.

236
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,776
-And that woman from the subway--
-What woman?

237
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,019
Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!

238
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,680
All right.

239
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,223
Just-- Please.

240
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,293
I'll help you get this all sorted out,
all right? I'll be right back.

241
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,334
Let go, Michael.

242
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,428
Let go.

243
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,168
Just calm down, okay?
I'm gonna be back in a minute.

244
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,311
-That's a promise.
-All right.

245
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,041
Please forgive me...

246
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,116
...but I desperately need
your guidance.

247
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,119
Kahn wants to see you.

248
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,188
To my knowledge...

249
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,832
...an Awakening has never been
attempted by one such as myself.

250
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,925
The elders hold the power to organize
their memories and thoughts...

251
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,230
...into a single, cohesive vision...

252
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,341
...a detailed record of their reign.

253
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:09,411
I can only hope Viktor
will hear my plea.

254
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:22,143
Please forgive me,
but I desperately need your guidance.

255
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,581
I apologize for awakening you
ahead of schedule...

256
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,317
...but I fear we may all be
in grave danger.

257
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,023
Especially you, my lord,
if left in your weakened state.

258
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,695
For I believe that Lucian
is alive and well.

259
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,966
Here. Now. In this very city...

260
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,404
...preparing to hit us
during the Awakening ceremony.

261
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,836
Even more disturbing...

262
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,880
...is that if I'm correct...

263
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,812
...it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

264
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,393
What's so pressing?

265
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,804
Take a look.

266
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,587
Selene!

267
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,761
I want to speak with Selene!

268
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,362
Is that Michael?

269
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,436
-ls it Michael?
-What the hell is going on?

270
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,901
What's happening to me?

271
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,032
I'm coming out.

272
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,540
If you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

273
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,952
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

274
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,468
Get in.

275
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,520
Look, I warned her. I warned her,
but she didn't listen.

276
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,996
-I should've told you sooner.
-Told me what?

277
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,803
Her human, Michael...

278
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,465
...he's not a human at all.

279
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,803
He's a Lycan.

280
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,747
What?

281
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,579
What's this ruckus?

282
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,150
Never come here again.
They'll kill you.

283
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,329
Why? Who are you people?

284
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,664
Leave us.

285
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,980
Like it or not, you're in the middle
of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.

286
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,249
A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.

287
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,085
Werewolves.

288
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,502
Consider yourself lucky.

289
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,906
Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

290
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,979
The viruses we transmit are deadly.

291
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:54,378
And if you bit me,
I'd become a Vampire instead?

292
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,882
No, you'd die.

293
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,019
No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

294
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,715
By rights, I'd stop the car
and kill you myself--

295
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,792
-Why are you helping me?
-I'm not.

296
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,462
I track down and kill your kind.

297
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,259
My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

298
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:17,596
Do you know why I've
been awakened, servant?

299
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,639
No, my lord.

300
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,245
-But I'll soon find out.
-You mean when you find her.

301
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:27,107
-Yes, my lord.
-You must let her come to me.

302
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:32,778
We have much to discuss,
Selene and l.

303
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:39,017
She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

304
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,494
Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

305
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:46,601
This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

306
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:52,139
Perhaps I should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

307
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,646
Still...

308
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,713
...her memories...

309
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,610
...are chaotic.

310
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,784
There's no sense of time.

311
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,289
Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

312
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,154
You're in need of rest.

313
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,859
I've rested enough.

314
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,769
What you will do
is summon Marcus.

315
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,697
But he still slumbers, my lord.

316
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,843
Amelia and the Council members
are arriving tomorrow night...

317
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,040
...to awaken Marcus.

318
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,709
Not you, my lord.

319
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:41,016
You've been awakened
a full century ahead of schedule.

320
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,796
That bitch has betrayed me.

321
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:56,333
Now he knows everything
she's been obsessing about.

322
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,106
Wait.

323
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,881
Are you to be trusted?

324
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,787
Of course.

325
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,279
Meet me in my quarters
in 20 minutes.

326
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,449
It's time I filled you in
on a few things.

327
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:01,469
I'm seeing these things,
these hallucinations.

328
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,300
They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

329
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:08,274
You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

330
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:16,617
This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. It should be safe.

331
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,702
-Ziodex lndustries.
-We own it.

332
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,669
First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

333
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,638
Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

334
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,710
It's cloned blood.

335
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,745
What are these for?

336
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,979
Lycans are allergic to silver.

337
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,752
If we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

338
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,289
What do you do with them after?

339
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,731
We put the bullets back in.

340
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:22,350
-How are things progressing?
-We're ready.

341
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,016
Why do you hate them so much?

342
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:34,289
I've already told you,
we're at war.

343
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:36,226
So you're just following orders?

344
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,035
Why can't you just answer
the question?

345
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,137
Fine.

346
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,917
Something was in the stable...

347
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,088
...tearing our horses to pieces.

348
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,914
I couldn't have saved my mother.

349
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,526
Or my sister.

350
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,556
Their screams woke me.

351
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:13,397
My father died outside,
trying to fend them off.

352
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,528
I stood at my door...

353
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,701
...about to run
to my nieces' room when....

354
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,947
Twin girls.

355
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,112
Barely 6 years old.

356
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,958
Butchered...

357
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,254
-...Iike animals.
-Jesus Christ.

358
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,432
The next thing I knew,
I was in his arms.

359
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,869
The war had spilled into our house.

360
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:50,004
He'd been tracking the Lycans
for days.

361
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,403
He drove them off and saved me.

362
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,237
-Who?
-Viktor.

363
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:59,414
The oldest and strongest of us.

364
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,908
That night,
he made me a Vampire.

365
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:06,388
He gave me the strength
to avenge my family.

366
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,389
Since then,
I've never looked back.

367
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,199
I saw your pictures.

368
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,096
Who is the woman? Your wife?

369
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:34,445
It may be wise to keep a closer eye
on our cousins.

370
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,387
I'll have Raze see to it immediately.

371
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:42,991
I'm afraid that I'm going to have
to place my faith in you, my friend.

372
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,827
Time is running short.

373
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:50,432
I tried to swerve,
but he hit us anyway.

374
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:55,364
He sent us right into
the oncoming lane.

375
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,268
When I came to...

376
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,214
...I realized that part of the engine
was in the front seat.

377
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:12,885
And she was pinned there,
6 inches from me...

378
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,454
...in this horrible position.

379
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,895
I think she was in shock
because she just...

380
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,433
...kept asking me over
and over again if I was all right.

381
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,803
She was more worried about me.

382
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,938
You know, if I knew then what
I know now, I could have saved her.

383
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,313
There's no doubt in my mind
about that.

384
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,188
But instead she died right there...

385
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,621
...about two minutes before
the ambulance arrived.

386
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,095
After that, I didn't see any reason
to stick around.

387
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:06,264
I spent a summer here with my
grandfather when I was a kid so....

388
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,275
After I got my degree, I just--

389
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,775
I took off.

390
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:19,444
I came over here to move on,
to forget.

391
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,024
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

392
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,364
And have you?

393
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,262
Moved on?

394
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,732
Have you?

395
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:49,246
I need you to keep what I'm about to
tell you under the strictest confidence.

396
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,443
It can wait.

397
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,936
Who started the war?

398
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,782
They did.

399
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,545
Or at least that's what
we've been led to believe.

400
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:27,913
Digging into the past is forbidden.

401
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,784
I should be heading back.

402
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,962
What about me?

403
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,529
Viktor will know what to do.
I'll come back.

404
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,361
-I won't stay alone.
-You will if you want to live.

405
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,729
I want to go with you.

406
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,086
What are you doing?

407
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,361
When the full moon
rises tomorrow...

408
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:10,397
...you will change, you will kill,
and you will feed.

409
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,466
It's unavoidable.

410
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,695
I can't leave you free
to roam around. I'm sorry.

411
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,276
A single round won't kill you, but
silver prevents transformation.

412
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,507
At least for a few hours.

413
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,777
If I don't return in time,
do yourself a favor.

414
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,244
Use it.

415
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,098
Yeah?

416
01:07:56,272 --> 01:08:00,003
My lord. She's here.

417
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:18,124
How could you do this to me?
Embarrass me like this?

418
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,091
The entire coven knows
that I had plans for us.

419
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:25,199
-There is no us!
-You'll go before Viktor...

420
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:30,999
...and tell him exactly what I tell you to!
From here on out, you'll do as I say.

421
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,573
Is that in any way unclear?

422
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,688
Come closer, my child.

423
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,352
Outside.

424
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,897
Come on, move it.

425
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,000
I've been lost without you, my lord.

426
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:44,907
Constantly hounded by Kraven
and his never-ending infatuation.

427
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:51,313
It is the oldest story in the book.

428
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,481
He desires the one thing
he cannot have.

429
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,554
Now, tell me...

430
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,798
...why have you come to believe
that Lucian still lives?

431
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,733
-Yeah.
-I've given you all the proof you need.

432
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:16,003
Incoherent thoughts and images,
nothing more.

433
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:19,614
Which is precisely why the Awakening
is performed by an elder.

434
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:22,080
You do not possess
the necessary skills.

435
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:25,084
But I did see Lucian. I shot him.
You must believe me.

436
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,451
The chain has never been broken.
Not once.

437
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,854
Not in 1 4 centuries.

438
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:35,122
Not since we elders first began
to leapfrog through time.

439
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,357
One awake, two asleep.
That's the way of it.

440
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,764
It is Marcus' turn to reign,
not mine.

441
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,904
-There's been a complication.
-But I had no choice.

442
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,066
The coven is in danger,
and Michael is the key--

443
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,980
Yes.

444
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,309
The Lycan.

445
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:59,354
Please.

446
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,119
Give me the chance
to get proof you require.

447
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,451
Fine.

448
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:07,618
I will leave it to Kraven
to collect the proof...

449
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,791
...if there is any.

450
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,135
How could you trust him over me?

451
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:19,467
Because he is not the one who
has been tainted by an animal.

452
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,076
I love you...

453
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:30,780
...Iike a daughter,
but you leave me with no choice.

454
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,013
These rules are in place
for a good reason...

455
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:39,491
...and they are the only reason
we have survived this long.

456
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:47,601
You will not be shown
an ounce of leniency.

457
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:53,632
When Amelia arrives, the Council
will convene and decide your fate.

458
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,406
You have broken the chain
and the Covenant!

459
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,979
You must be judged!

460
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,403
You should've listened to me
and stayed out of this.

461
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:32,104
Now you'll be lucky if I can convince
the Council to spare your life.

462
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,010
Tell me.

463
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,643
Did you have the nerve to cut the skin
from his arm, or did Lucian do it?

464
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,888
Mark my words.

465
01:12:47,095 --> 01:12:50,030
Soon, you'll be
seeing things my way.

466
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,569
No one opens this door.
Understood?

467
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:09,308
I can't afford to have my future queen
run off with that Lycan again.

468
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:49,484
Shit.

469
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,694
Change of plans. Amelia will be
picked up by Soren and his team.

470
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,774
-That's our job.
-Not anymore.

471
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:03,374
-Why are you helping me?
-I'm not. I'm helping me.

472
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,992
-What's going on?
-The perimeter sensor's been tripped.

473
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:48,628
We're locking down the mansion.

474
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:52,066
It's Selene. She's escaped,
to go to him, to Michael.

475
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,669
I want that Lycan's head on a plate.

476
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,227
We need to go.

477
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,585
Get down!

478
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:06,228
Go. Go.

479
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,572
-Jump.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

480
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,117
-Any luck?
-False alarm.

481
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:44,765
The dogs would've been all over it
if anything had gotten near that fence.

482
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:48,300
-Amelia should have arrived by now.
-Yes.

483
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:57,107
Look, I want you to slip off the property
and find out what's keeping her.

484
01:21:57,278 --> 01:21:59,075
You've got it.

485
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,880
Maybe we should pull over
and dose him.

486
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:43,047
Fuck him. He'll be all right.
We're almost there.

487
01:23:48,389 --> 01:23:52,257
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it.
Pull over. Pull over!

488
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:12,704
Get the kit.

489
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,386
Stick him. Stick him.

490
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,403
My lord.

491
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:45,206
Viktor wants to speak with you.

492
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,536
My lord.

493
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,573
I sent for Selene...

494
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,007
...not you.

495
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,246
She's defied your orders...

496
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,989
...and fled the mansion, my lord.

497
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:34,254
Your incompetence
is becoming most taxing.

498
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:37,431
It's not my fault.
She's become obsessed...

499
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:41,035
...thinks that I'm at the core
of some ridiculous conspiracy.

500
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,193
And here's my proof.

501
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,615
Now, I want you to tell them
exactly what you told me.

502
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:11,492
All right, all right.

503
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:18,166
We've been searching for someone
with a special trait.

504
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,605
A direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus...

505
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:26,406
...Hungarian, a warlord...

506
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:31,143
...who came to power in the early
seasons of the fifth century.

507
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:37,781
Just in time to watch a plague
ravage his village.

508
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:42,021
He alone survived.

509
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:48,199
Somehow, his body
was able to change the disease...

510
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:52,203
...mold it to his benefit.

511
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:57,538
He became the first true immortal.

512
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,821
And years later,
he fathered at least two children...

513
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,289
...who inherited this same trait.

514
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,758
The sons of the Corvinus clan.

515
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:19,160
One bitten by bat, one by wolf...

516
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:24,636
...one to walk the lonely road
of mortality as a human.

517
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:30,244
-It's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
-That may be...

518
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,479
...but our species
do have a common ancestor.

519
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:40,014
A mutation of the original virus...

520
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,383
...is directly linked to his bloodline.

521
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:47,392
There is a descendant
of Corvinus lying there...

522
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:50,688
...not three feet from you.

523
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,627
Yes.

524
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:58,431
But he's already a Vampire.
We needed a pure source...

525
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:04,506
...untainted. An exact duplicate
of the original virus...

526
01:28:04,879 --> 01:28:06,847
...which we learned...

527
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:11,417
...was hidden away in the genetic
code of his human descendants...

528
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:16,614
...and passed along
in its latent form...

529
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,692
...down through the ages...

530
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:25,730
...all the way to Michael Corvin.

531
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:31,838
For years, we tried to combine
their bloodlines.

532
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,406
And for years we failed.

533
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,107
It was useless.

534
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:47,147
Even at the cellular level, our species
seemed destined to destroy each other.

535
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:54,717
That is, until we found Michael.

536
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:02,893
The Corvinus strain allows
for a perfect union.

537
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:08,405
A triple-celled platelet...

538
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:14,514
...which holds unspeakable power.

539
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:18,113
There can be no such union.

540
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:23,549
-And to speak of it is heresy.
-We'll see.

541
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:29,219
Once Lucian has injected himself
with Michael's blood.

542
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,324
Lucian is dead.

543
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:35,059
According to whom?

544
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,505
I need you to do something for me.

545
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,424
I can assure you, my child...

546
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,924
...Kraven will pay with his life.

547
01:30:21,015 --> 01:30:25,315
Soon, this house will lie in ruins.

548
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:27,920
-Not before you.
-No, wait. Wait.

549
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:31,081
You and you alone
will know the truth of this.

550
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:40,559
If Lucian was able to get his hands
on the blood of a Pure-Born...

551
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:45,798
...a powerful elder like Amelia...

552
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:49,704
...or yourself...

553
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:54,507
...and inject it along
with Michael's blood....

554
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:56,843
Abomination.

555
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,213
Half-Vampire...

556
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:03,653
...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.

557
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,142
I need to speak with Kahn.

558
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:33,447
My lord...

559
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:38,088
...the Council members
have been assassinated.

560
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:44,794
-What of Amelia?
-They bled her dry.

561
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:51,095
It has already begun.

562
01:32:02,516 --> 01:32:04,950
I'm sorry I doubted you.

563
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:10,786
Fear not, my child,
absolution will be yours...

564
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:17,756
...the moment you kill the descendant
of Corvinus, this...

565
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:20,627
...Michael.

566
01:32:56,203 --> 01:33:00,469
You've been given an enzyme
to stop the change.

567
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:06,102
It may take a little time
for the grogginess to dissipate.

568
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,416
That's enough!

569
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:19,048
Just go and see
what's keeping Raze, will you?

570
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,456
I really must apologize.

571
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,065
He's in desperate need
of a lesson in manners.

572
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,992
Speaking of manners,
where are mine? Forgive me.

573
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,263
I'm Lucian.

574
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,673
I need to go.

575
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,569
I need to get back.

576
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,649
There's no going back.

577
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:46,842
There's no going anywhere.

578
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:51,958
The Vampires will kill you on sight.
Just for being what you are.

579
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,922
One of us.

580
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,133
You are one of us.

581
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:04,701
What are you doing?

582
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:08,901
-What are you doing?
-Bringing an end to this conflict.

583
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:18,511
Your war, it has nothing
to do with me.

584
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:20,620
My war?

585
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,638
No!

586
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,547
No!

587
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:50,873
No!

588
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,683
No!

589
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,018
No! No!

590
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:42,466
Sonja!

591
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:48,993
They forced you to watch her die.

592
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,238
Sonja.

593
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:57,504
That's what started the war.

594
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:03,979
I saw it happen as if I were there.

595
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:11,716
We were slaves once.

596
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:16,693
The daylight guardians
of the Vampires.

597
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:21,228
I was born in servitude...

598
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:25,870
...yet I harbored them no ill will.

599
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:29,742
I even took a Vampire for my bride.

600
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:32,702
It was forbidden...

601
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:35,177
...our union.

602
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:40,309
Viktor feared
a blending of the species.

603
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:44,420
Feared it so much...

604
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:47,583
...he killed her.

605
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,857
His own daughter...

606
01:37:52,066 --> 01:37:54,330
...burnt alive...

607
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,705
...for loving me.

608
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,471
This is his war...

609
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:06,704
...Viktor's...

610
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:11,245
...and he's spent the last 600 years...

611
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:15,149
...exterminating my species.

612
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,053
What are they gonna do to Selene?

613
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,396
We have company.

614
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:28,666
-I thought we had a deal.
-Patience.

615
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:32,431
Kraven.

616
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,939
These are matters
to be discussed in private.

617
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:41,609
Please escort our guests downstairs.

618
01:38:57,564 --> 01:39:00,556
The Council has been destroyed.

619
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:04,269
Soon, you will have it all.

620
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:10,399
Both great covens and an ironclad
peace treaty with the Lycans.

621
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:14,980
Who I trust will not be forgotten
when the spoils are tabulated.

622
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:19,210
How do you expect me to assume
control now that Viktor's awake?

623
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:22,947
There's no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.

624
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:27,253
And that is precisely why
I need Michael.

625
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,827
If Viktor were so easy to dispatch...

626
01:39:30,397 --> 01:39:33,457
...you'd have done it yourself
centuries ago.

627
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:46,575
Exit shaft! Move it!

628
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,447
Son of a bitch!

629
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,994
Oh, shit!

630
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,675
It's Viktor.

631
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,477
Yes.

632
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:28,251
And if you had done your job,
he'd still be in hibernation.

633
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:36,161
Where the hell is Raze?

634
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,460
Is there another way out?

635
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:47,730
I guess it didn't occur to you that you'll
have to bleed to pull off this coup.

636
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,939
Don't even think about leaving.

637
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:19,371
Silver nitrate.
Bet you weren't expecting that.

638
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:31,618
Come on! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!

639
01:42:54,234 --> 01:42:55,861
Lucian.

640
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,581
Selene!

641
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:56,515
Selene!

642
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:44,634
Not yet.

643
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:37,128
I have to get you out.
Viktor's on his way.

644
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:40,266
And he won't be satisfied
until every Lycan's dead.

645
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:43,694
They'll kill you too,
just for helping me.

646
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:45,436
I know.

647
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:10,960
I know what started the war.

648
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:22,994
That's enough.
You're coming with me!

649
01:53:24,063 --> 01:53:26,588
I hope I live to see
Viktor choke the life from you!

650
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,801
I bet you do.

651
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:33,032
But let me tell you a little something
about your beloved dark father.

652
01:53:34,173 --> 01:53:36,664
He's the one who killed your family.

653
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,841
Not the Lycans.

654
01:53:39,379 --> 01:53:41,574
Never could follow his own rules.

655
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:44,148
Said he couldn't abide the taste
of livestock.

656
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:48,549
So every once in a while, he went out
and gorged himself on human blood.

657
01:53:49,355 --> 01:53:51,323
I kept his secrets...

658
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:53,049
...cleaned up the mess.

659
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:55,527
But it was he...

660
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:57,356
...who crept room to room...

661
01:53:57,563 --> 01:54:00,896
...dispatching everyone
close to your heart.

662
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:03,928
But when he got to you...

663
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:08,072
...he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you dry.

664
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:13,304
You, who reminded him so much
of his precious Sonja...

665
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:18,308
...the daughter
he condemned to death.

666
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:21,913
-Lies.
-Believe what you want.

667
01:54:22,855 --> 01:54:24,550
Now come on.

668
01:54:24,724 --> 01:54:26,988
Your place is by my side.

669
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,034
So be it.

670
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:06,360
Bite him!

671
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:12,131
Half-Vampire...

672
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:14,102
...half-Lycan...

673
01:55:14,273 --> 01:55:17,140
...but stronger than both.

674
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:45,260
What the hell are you doing?

675
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:48,540
You may have killed me...

676
01:55:49,308 --> 01:55:50,570
...cousin.

677
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:52,734
But my will...

678
01:55:52,912 --> 01:55:55,506
...is done regardless.

679
01:56:35,621 --> 01:56:37,486
Where is he?

680
01:56:38,591 --> 01:56:39,853
Where's Kraven?

681
01:57:01,147 --> 01:57:03,513
Forgive me, my child.

682
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,717
It wasn't the Lycans.

683
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:10,652
It was you.

684
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:19,531
Leave us.

685
01:57:38,518 --> 01:57:40,884
How could you bear my trust...

686
01:57:41,053 --> 01:57:43,419
...knowing that you'd
killed my family?

687
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,285
Yes.

688
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,724
I have taken from you.

689
01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:53,456
But I have given so much more.

690
01:57:54,433 --> 01:57:59,632
Is it not a fair trade, the life I have
granted you? The gift of immortality?

691
01:57:59,839 --> 01:58:02,501
And the life of your daughter?

692
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:05,276
Your own flesh and blood?

693
01:58:26,332 --> 01:58:29,028
I loved my daughter!

694
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:33,703
But the abomination growing
in her womb...

695
01:58:33,873 --> 01:58:36,569
...was a betrayal of me
and of the coven!

696
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:45,581
I did what was necessary
to protect the species...

697
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:49,187
...as I am forced to do yet again.

698
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:55,318
No!

699
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,327
Time to die.

700
02:05:09,201 --> 02:05:11,897
Though I cannot predict the future...

701
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:15,632
...the consequences of tonight
will reverberate through the halls...

702
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:18,936
...of both great covens
for many years to come.

703
02:05:20,412 --> 02:05:23,210
Two Vampire elders
have been slain...

704
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:25,612
...one by my own hand.

705
02:05:27,386 --> 02:05:31,220
Soon, Marcus will take the throne.

706
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:37,054
And a tide of anger and retribution
will spill out into the night.

707
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:41,493
Differences will be set aside.

708
02:05:42,101 --> 02:05:44,433
Allegiances will be made.

709
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,528
And soon...

710
02:05:46,705 --> 02:05:49,367
...I will become the hunted.
