and then fighting amongst ourselves.

335
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,444
Is this what you want?

336
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,454
I have lived by their rules my entire life.

337

envied them.

339
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,158
And for what?

340
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,631
To be treated like an animal.

341
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,395
We are not animals!

342
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,103
We do have a choice.

343
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,738
We can choose to be more than this.

344
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,805
We can be slaves

Gladly.
There are some difficult decisions ahead.

I would like your help with one of them.
Of course, Father.

350
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,368
With Lucian gone,

351
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,838
we must promote another Lycan in his place.

352
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,572

353
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,275
Coloman thinks he will stir the others.

354
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,147
We must remove him.

355

That will be difficult.

356

He has been with us so long.

357
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,495
Perhaps Gyorg.

358
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,867
Or Thrasos.

359
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,473

360
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,570

Excellent suggestions.

362

I will consider them strongly.

363

You, my child, are the most precious thing in my heart.

364
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,834
What have you told my father?

365
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,502
What have you told him? Nothing.

366
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,875
Why? Why what?

367
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,410
Why have you told him nothing?

368
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,684
Would your father welcome the man who brought him news

369
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,755
that his beloved daughter was consorting

370
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,949
with a Lycan?

371
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,930
He isn't well known for his gratitude.

372
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,768
And I am not yet in a position to use this for my benefit.

373
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,643
What sort of benefit?

374
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,315
There are 12 council seats.

375
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,890
And we don't die often.

376

Sadly, no.

377
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,420
So, what if I gave up my seat at council?

378
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,557
Simply left it to you?

379
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,995
Why would you do that?

380
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,731
Can you keep a secret?

381
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,066
I will need something in return.

382
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,629
Two minutes.

383
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,726
Any longer is too risky.

384
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,706
I'm sorry. There was no other way.

385

So Tannis?

386
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,020
You were right. He will help us in exchange for a seat on the council.

You defiled my daughter.

I loved her! You killed her!

01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,925
I should have crushed you under my heel the day you were born.

678

Yes, you should have...

He's the one who killed your family. Not the Lycans.

But when he got to you,

01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:51,153
he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
