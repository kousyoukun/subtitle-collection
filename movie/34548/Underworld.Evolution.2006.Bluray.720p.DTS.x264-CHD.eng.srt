1
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,622
My God.
Brother, what have you done?

2
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,394
Yet again we arrive to witness
this monster's aftermath.

3
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,568
I will not tolerate this
any longer, Marcus.

4
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,991
Your brother must be stopped.

5
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,239
It ends tonight.

6
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,914
We must move quickly,
before they turn.

7
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,670
Is he still here?

8
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,757
Yes.

9
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,753
Viktor, he must not be harmed.

10
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,092
I gave you my word, did I not?

11
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,176
But William must be controlled.

12
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,717
Burn the bodies.

13
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,847
Search the outbuildings.

14
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,022
Form two groups.
You, douse them with fuel.

15
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,692
- Yes, sir.
- Marcus.

16
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,527
Stay with me.

17
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,855
Give me the torch.

18
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,987
They're turning!

19
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,450
They're turning!

20
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,095
- Retreat to the woods.
- I'll stay and fight. You need my help.

21
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,008
I need you alive.

22
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,504
If you die, we all die.

23
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,840
Now, go.

24
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,883
Go!

25
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,503
- We found him.
- And?

26
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,205
- We need more men.
- Find Amelia.

27
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,515
Amelia, we found William.

28
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,664
Surround him!

29
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,544
Take him down.

30
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,222
No.

31
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,016
Leave him be.

32
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,152
Stop this, you're killing him.

33
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,695
More!

34
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,594
William.

35
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,055
Marcus!

36
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,438
He was not to be harmed.

37
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,938
Place him in my charge
as we agreed...

38
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,108
...or you will pay for your deceit.

39
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,989
And you will learn your place.

40
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,151
Your sympathy for this beast
is foolish.

41
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,119
Your brother is entirely
beyond control.

42
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,870
It will be done my way.

43
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,531
You know well the consequences
if you murder me...

44
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,948
...or William.

45
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,584
If you so much as speak
his name again...

46
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,169
...you will have chosen
that future for him.

47
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,633
What is thy will, my lord?

48
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,848
Imprisonment for all time.

49
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,307
Far from you.

50
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:20,367
For six centuries I was a loyal soldier
of the Vampire clan.

51
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,586
But I was betrayed.

52
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,126
The war was not as it had seemed.

53
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,171
In one night, the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed.

54
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,137
Kraven, our second-in-command...

55
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,806
...had formed a secret alliance
with Lucian...

56
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,013
...ruler of the Werewolf clan...

57
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,729
...to overthrow Viktor, our leader.

58
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,235
But Kraven's lust for power
and domination had failed.

59
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,740
Viktor was not the saviour
I had been led to believe.

60
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,324
He had betrayed us all.

61
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,499
Soon the hunt will be on
for his killer.

62
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,758
I have but one ally left:

63
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,550
Michael...

64
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,387
...the human descendant
of Corvinus.

65
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,637
Neither Vampire nor Lycan...

66
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,647
...but a hybrid.

67
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,981
It's only a matter of time
before we're found.

68
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,588
My only hope now
is to awak en Marcus...

69
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,177
...our last remaining elder...

70
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,051
...and expose the truth...

71
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:05,681
...before Kraven tries to murder him
while he's still in hibernation.

72
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,899
Kraven knows
he's no match for him awak e.

73
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,935
Perfect.

74
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,177
This thing's been dead for weeks.

75
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,264
I thought Lycans went back
to their human form when they die.

76
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,971
They do. It's been given
a serum to stop regression...

77
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,983
...so it can be studied.

78
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,356
How can you tell?

79
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,243
Not quite your department, I guess.

80
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,823
I just killed them. I didn't pay
much attention to their anatomy.

81
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,916
- How long can we stay here?
- Not long.

82
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,833
These safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe...

83
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,621
...with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active.

84
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,131
Someone could have
picked us up already.

85
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,350
There's only about an hour
till daylight.

86
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,971
Can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise?

87
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,860
- Just.
- Okay, let's get what we need and go.

88
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,027
No.

89
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,148
I'm going alone.

90
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,128
Open it.

91
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,773
Marcus?

92
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:32,821
The blood memories
of this wretched creature...

93
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:39,117
...have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds.

94
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,965
My lord, I can explain.

95
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,669
Why would I listen to your lies...

96
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,804
...when the journey to the truth...

97
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,270
...is so much sweeter?

98
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,816
I k ept his secrets,
cleaned up the mess.

99
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,153
You'll go before Viktor...

100
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,694
...and tell him
exactly what I tell you to!

101
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,447
You just concentrate on your part.

102
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,089
Please.

103
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,217
I can assist you.

104
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,589
Oh, you already have.

105
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,721
If I can plead my case...

106
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,183
...there's a chance
you'll be granted sanctuary.

107
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,189
Now, you'll be killed on sight.
I'm not prepared to risk it.

108
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:47,650
What should I do, wait?

109
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,700
Kraven may still have men with him.
You're not going alone.

110
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,736
You're not as strong
as you might think.

111
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,574
- What?
- Michael, you're unique.

112
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,782
There's never been a hybrid before.

113
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,582
However ambivalent you feel about it,
your powers could be limitless.

114
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,993
But you depend on blood.

115
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,297
You need to feed.

116
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:09,042
Without it, you'll be growing weaker
by the second. Use the time for that.

117
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,261
Jesus Christ.

118
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,014
And what if I don't?

119
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,718
What if I can't?

120
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,594
Normal food could be lethal.

121
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,812
If you don't anticipate your cravings,
you will attack humans.

122
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,142
And believe me, you don't want that
on your conscience.

123
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,776
There really is
no going back, Michael.

124
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,072
I'm sorry.

125
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,692
Look, I understand what you did.

126
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,654
I'm grateful.

127
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,823
You saved my life.

128
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,703
I wasn't ready to die.

129
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,290
I don't know.

130
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,622
Everything's changed.

131
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,541
I probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head.

132
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,838
It's a lot to process all at once.

133
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,720
Look, go. I'll be here.

134
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,802
You just make sure you come back.

135
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,310
Sir.

136
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,933
The innocent who witnessed...

137
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,433
...they've been silenced?

138
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,193
But otherwise unharmed,
as ordered.

139
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,991
- Show me what you have.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,919
Two Death Dealers were killed.

141
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,956
We found no Lycan bodies.

142
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:53,706
Apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition...

143
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,717
...some sort of UV round.

144
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:58,008
Amelia?

145
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,006
No one survived.

146
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,598
It seems Kraven's men
might have been present...

147
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,599
...but they did nothing to prevent it.

148
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,648
And Viktor?

149
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,165
And no trace of Marcus
amongst the ashes?

150
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,087
It seems he destroyed
his own coven, sir.

151
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,467
It was never his coven.

152
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,616
We need to go.

153
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,205
Give me a moment.

154
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,465
There you are.

155
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,329
How you doing?

156
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,263
Thank you.

157
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,676
You've got to get away from me.

158
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,523
Get away from me!

159
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,025
Hello?

160
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:26,705
There.

161
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,204
Michael Corvin.

162
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:31,704
Get the men up there. Now.

163
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,221
Get the fuck away from me.

164
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,745
Stop. Stop.

165
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:18,758
Shit.

166
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:47,720
Michael. Oh, shit.

167
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,404
- Here. Take it.
- No.

168
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,652
Michael, you'll die.

169
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,009
Shit.

170
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,052
Can you move?

171
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,685
We need to go.

172
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:56,869
Marcus.

173
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,544
I know what you've done, Selene.

174
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,666
Viktor deserved his fate
and Kraven was no better.

175
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:08,011
Kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds.

176
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,011
And Viktor...

177
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,891
Viktor deserved his fate...

178
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,480
...many times over.

179
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,107
A terrible business...

180
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,145
...the slaying of your family.

181
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,356
Yet so much effort was spent...

182
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,815
...to conceal this matter from me.

183
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:31,037
What do you suppose
Viktor had to hide?

184
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,290
Or perhaps it is you, Selene...

185
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:40,961
...as the last
of your wretched family...

186
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:44,005
...who has something to hide.

187
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,056
Go!

188
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,755
Get in.

189
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,328
Dead or alive,
you will give me what I want.

190
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,071
You okay?

191
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,242
- He's a hybrid, isn't he?
- Yes.

192
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,709
He wanted this. Why?

193
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,507
I don't know.

194
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,876
But we have another problem.

195
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,298
Turn off up here.

196
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,099
Shit. All right, get down.

197
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,192
Keep your foot on the gas,
but stay down.

198
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,794
Hold on.

199
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,144
Stay down.

200
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,243
Come on.

201
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,303
Give me your hand.

202
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,007
Jesus Christ.

203
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,474
There's really no need.

204
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,309
I'll be right back.

205
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,199
All right, let me see.

206
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:50,745
See?

207
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,539
No need.

208
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:41,930
Area secure, sir.

209
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,072
Sun's setting.

210
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,492
What's wrong?

211
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,121
The supplies were taken.
Used weapons were left behind.

212
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,622
The tavern events occurred before
dawn, so they couldn't have got far.

213
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,627
Remain airborne for the moment.
I'm sure they'll reappear...

214
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:33,416
...in good time.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,560
I've seen this before,
when I was a child.

216
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,311
I've held it.

217
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:44,015
When it was open, like this.

218
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,429
How is that possible?

219
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,442
I don't know.

220
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,358
But I know someone that might.

221
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,073
Andreas Tanis.

222
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,120
He was the official historian
of the covens.

223
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:05,200
He fell from favour after documenting
what Viktor considered malicious lies.

224
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,336
Of course, as it turns out,
he was probably telling the truth.

225
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:09,792
What happened to him?

226
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,083
He was exiled over 300 years ago.

227
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,040
Three hundred years?

228
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:16,170
What makes you think
we'll find him now?

229
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,007
I was the one who exiled him.

230
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,132
Looks like a monastery.

231
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:01,387
It used to be.
More like a prison now.

232
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:04,466
Tanis has been hiding there
since Viktor's order.

233
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,224
We'll be the first people
he's seen in centuries.

234
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:21,199
- That's odd.
- What?

235
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:24,360
I don't remember this gate
being here before.

236
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:27,995
Take this.

237
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,775
Shit.

238
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,540
Go back!

239
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,215
Gotcha.

240
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,298
Fuck.

241
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,628
I knew it was you, Selene.

242
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:47,383
The stench of Viktor's blood
still lingers in your veins.

243
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,053
Tanis.

244
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:50,971
I see your aim hasn't improved.

245
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:55,425
You haven't changed.

246
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,352
You don't scare me, Selene.

247
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,265
Well, we're gonna
have to work on that.

248
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,779
We need to talk.

249
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,536
Your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than I remember.

250
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,333
How does a Vampire
have Lycan bodyguards?

251
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:22,958
A gift.

252
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,749
From a most persuasive client.

253
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,294
Lucian.

254
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,425
Why would Lucian
wanna protect you?

255
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:33,806
Because he was trading with them.

256
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,969
UV rounds.

257
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,974
How long have you been
in the business of killing your own?

258
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,107
I've done what's necessary
to survive.

259
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:48,612
My decision was made easy the day
your precious Viktor betrayed me.

260
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,609
Betrayal was something
he did very well.

261
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,698
Viktor's dead. I killed him.

262
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,288
You?

263
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:59,241
Kill Viktor?

264
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,294
No, I think not.

265
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,417
Oh, unless you've learned the truth.

266
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,344
So your eyes are finally open.

267
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:20,385
Isn't it interesting how the truth...

268
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:22,929
...is even harder to absorb
than light?

269
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:25,307
You know, I tried to stop him,
of course.

270
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:28,443
A travesty,
committing such a horrible crime.

271
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,688
And then turning you.

272
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:33,983
That was too much to take.

273
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,531
My protests are why he put me here.

274
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:39,614
Careful with that, dear.

275
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:40,994
Makes a terrible bang.

276
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,415
Open the blades and they're active.

277
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,537
Good to know.

278
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:53,124
Viktor put you here for a reason,
but I doubt it was...

279
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,634
...because you had moral qualms.

280
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:59,845
- What do you know?
- Very little of anything, I'm afraid.

281
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:09,441
Well, then, perhaps I'm mistaken
and there's no use for you at all.

282
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,813
Marcus was after this. Why?

283
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:00,363
Some history is based on truth...

284
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,655
...and others on deception.

285
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:08,082
Viktor was not the first of our kind,
as you were led to believe.

286
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,204
He was once human...

287
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,580
...the ruler of these lands.

288
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,878
Marcus...

289
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,427
...he's the one.

290
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,504
The source.

291
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,767
The first true Vampire.

292
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,637
So the legend is true.

293
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:31,601
Toward the end of his ruthless life...

294
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:36,781
...when the next breath meant more
to Viktor than silver or gold...

295
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,825
...Marcus came with an offer...

296
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:43,784
...a reprieve from sickness
and death.

297
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:46,284
Immortality.

298
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,035
And in return, Viktor was to use
his army-turned-immortal to help him.

299
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:52,712
To do what?

300
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:55,129
To defeat
the very first Werewolves...

301
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,343
...a dangerous
and infectious breed...

302
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:01,127
...created by Marcus' own
flesh and blood:

303
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,761
His twin brother, William.

304
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,430
But these weren't
the Lycans we know.

305
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,020
Disgusting though
your brethren may be...

306
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,190
...they at least are evolved.

307
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:15,644
No, these were raging monsters.

308
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:19,148
Never able to take
human form again.

309
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:22,486
It was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage.

310
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:26,403
And William's appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable.

311
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,118
He had to be stopped.

312
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:31,742
And so once Viktor's army
was turned...

313
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:34,334
...the legions of Vampires
under his control...

314
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:37,751
...tracked down
and destroyed the animals...

315
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:39,248
...then captured William...

316
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,345
...and locked him away.

317
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,012
Viktor's prisoner for all time.

318
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:47,925
Why let him live?

319
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:52,392
For the very same reason that Viktor
never conspired against Marcus: Fear.

320
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,856
He was warned that,
should Marcus be killed...

321
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,361
...all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave.

322
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:01,357
So in Viktor's mind...

323
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:04,280
...William's death would mean
the end for all Lycans...

324
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,574
...his slaves.

325
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,075
Yes.

326
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,410
Yes, a clever deception...

327
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:15,379
...but one Viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test.

328
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,714
And so Marcus was protected...

329
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,132
...at all costs.

330
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,629
Yes, here we are.

331
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,894
- Vampires?
- Mortals.

332
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:38,068
Men loyal to Alexander Corvinus.

333
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,227
The father of us all.

334
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,570
What's this?

335
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,039
You should know.

336
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,041
It's William's prison.

337
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:05,002
The prison your father
was commissioned to build.

338
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,680
So you've been the one keeping
a watch over this for me, have you?

339
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:16,471
I've been searching everywhere
for this, my darling.

340
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,353
What is it?

341
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,271
What's wrong?

342
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:28,327
She now understands
why her family was killed.

343
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,657
But that was many years later.

344
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,828
The winter of Lucian's escape.

345
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:39,038
Your father knew too much.

346
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,999
Or too much for Viktor to risk...

347
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,293
...especially when Lucian...

348
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:47,588
...had the key to William's cell.

349
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,467
And I'm the map.

350
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:52,846
Yes.

351
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:58,392
The only one still living
who has seen its location.

352
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:02,152
Oh, Viktor realized you'd be too young
to remember explicitly...

353
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,566
...but Marcus knows
that the memory...

354
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:09,401
...and therefore the exact location
of William's prison...

355
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:11,738
...is hidden away in your blood.

356
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,448
Why is Marcus looking
for him now...

357
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,210
...after all this time?

358
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:18,790
That I cannot answer.

359
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,634
But I do know someone...

360
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,679
...who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

361
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:40,642
In exchange for your discretion,
of course.

362
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:43,402
Of course.

363
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,376
Tanis. You seem anxious.

364
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,371
Why do you flee
the very sight of me?

365
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,007
Please...

366
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:53,598
...sit.

367
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,727
There's no need
for this to be unpleasant.

368
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,393
I've always rather enjoyed
your company.

369
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,485
Now you're being rude.

370
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:12,283
Sorry.

371
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,577
Viktor struck two keys.

372
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,545
What do you know of them?

373
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:28,216
Keys?

374
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:32,093
I don't know of any keys.

375
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:49,568
Oh, yes.

376
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,274
Yes, those keys.

377
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:54,616
- Yes?
- Well, one was...

378
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,913
One was kept in plain sight...

379
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:01,329
...draped around
his daughter's neck...

380
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:04,539
...right there for you to see.
- And the other?

381
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:10,210
- Kept with Viktor at all times.
- Where?

382
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:13,009
Within him.

383
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:16,012
Beneath the flesh.

384
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:24,347
Please. Please.

385
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,679
I beg you. Please.

386
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,768
Please, I beg you.

387
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,914
- Who could stop him.
Perhaps I could arrange a meeting.

388
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:49,584
Go to pier 17.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.

389
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,231
How do we know Tanis
isn't setting us up?

390
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,857
He's not brave enough
to set me up.

391
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:46,015
You can go.

392
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,150
You're familiar with this, then?

393
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:07,369
Intimately.

394
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,548
You're Alexander Corvinus.

395
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:26,178
There was a time
that I was known by that name.

396
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:30,938
By any name,
I am still your forefather.

397
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:40,239
How have you stayed hidden
all these years?

398
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,941
For centuries I've stood by
and watched the havoc...

399
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:48,120
...my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity.

400
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:51,167
Not the legacy I prayed for...

401
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,620
...the morning I watched them
enter this world.

402
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,082
And a tiresome duty...

403
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:00,467
...keeping the war contained,
cleaning up the mess...

404
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,799
...hiding my family's
unfortunate history.

405
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:07,305
- Couldn't you have stopped it?
- Yes.

406
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:10,680
Could you kill your own sons?

407
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:13,186
You know what Marcus will do.

408
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,436
If he finds me,
he finds William's prison.

409
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:18,776
You need to help us stop him.

410
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,947
You are asking me
to help you kill my son?

411
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:25,536
You?

412
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:27,204
A Death Dealer?

413
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:29,372
How many innocents did you kill...

414
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:32,335
...in the six-century quest
to avenge your family?

415
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,869
Spare me
your self-righteous declarations.

416
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:40,130
You are no different from Marcus
and even less noble than William.

417
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,048
At least he cannot control
his savagery.

418
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:46,134
Anything I've done
can be laid at your feet.

419
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,635
Hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept...

420
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,854
...that your sons are monsters,
that they create monsters.

421
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:55,191
You could've stopped all of this.

422
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,108
Do not come grovelling to me...

423
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:00,984
...simply because you are weaker
than your adversary.

424
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:04,152
You know the devastation William
caused before he was captured.

425
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,566
He cannot be set free.

426
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:56,949
Wa... No, wait.
You're no match for him.

427
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,058
Soon, brother.

428
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,395
No.

429
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:10,785
Father.

430
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:12,276
No.

431
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:16,238
They've gone.
There, there, my child.

432
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,917
You are safe now.

433
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,089
No. Michael.

434
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:11,090
Look at me.

435
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,932
Michael.

436
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,674
Shit.

437
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,336
Please.

438
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,999
Please.

439
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,559
Come on.

440
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,762
Come on.

441
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,315
Fuck.

442
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:53,853
Hello, Father.

443
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:57,492
You are unwelcome in my presence.

444
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:04,245
The predictable heart
that never thaws.

445
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:08,168
Pity it beats within such a fool.

446
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,916
The eldest of the immortals...

447
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:15,339
...yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny.

448
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:20,893
We are oddities of nature, you and I.
Nothing more.

449
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,639
This is a world for humanity.

450
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:27,982
And that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons?

451
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:30,647
Why you stood by
for over half a millennium...

452
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:34,396
...as William suffered alone
in darkness?

453
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,905
No, Father.

454
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,909
I have no respect
for your petty sentiment.

455
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:45,625
Viktor's key. Where is it?

456
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,586
Whatever plan you have
for William is futile.

457
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:51,915
- You cannot control your brother.
- Oh, I am stronger now.

458
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:55,501
And our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge.

459
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:56,999
You're wrong.

460
01:08:57,221 --> 01:09:00,424
Soon you'll be drowning in Lycans,
just like before.

461
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,265
Oh, not Lycans, Father...

462
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,558
...or Vampires.

463
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:09,266
A new race, created in
the image of their maker...

464
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,983
...their new god:

465
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:16,945
Me.

466
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:31,333
And a true god...

467
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,676
...has no father.

468
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,666
You will fail.

469
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,251
- Get the kit.
- No.

470
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:03,886
Please, sir, let us help you.

471
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:06,382
The time has come, my friend.

472
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,512
Find the girl.

473
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:13,014
Bring her to me.

474
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:19,809
No, wait. Wait.

475
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:26,612
If you want Marcus,
you'll need Alexander's help.

476
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,418
Don't leave him here.

477
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:58,772
- Did he get the pendant?
- Yes.

478
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,191
He's too powerful for you alone.

479
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:04,821
You are the only one
older than he is...

480
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,991
...the only one stronger.

481
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:09,574
You could have killed him yourself.

482
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:13,790
No matter what he's become...

483
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,586
...he is my son.

484
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,678
You are the last hope left.

485
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:29,924
There is only one way
to defeat him.

486
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,313
Quickly, now...

487
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:43,476
...before there is no more legacy
left in my veins.

488
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:54,162
What will I become?

489
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:57,626
The future.

490
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,246
Go now.

491
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,275
We're getting close.

492
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,746
Head back around
towards the river.

493
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:42,880
I don't see a way inside.

494
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:47,390
There used to be
a river entrance just there.

495
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,642
It must be submerged now.

496
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,314
Looks like we're getting wet.

497
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:29,227
Closer.

498
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:36,400
Selene.

499
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:50,922
William.

500
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,944
Wait.

501
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,457
No, William. Stop.

502
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,578
Be still, brother.

503
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:18,252
It's me.

504
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:24,593
I'd no sooner harm you than myself.

505
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,282
Which way?

506
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,071
Is this it?

507
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,243
He's already here.

508
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:09,779
What is that?

509
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:13,193
Nothing. Let's go.

510
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:26,419
We're too late.

511
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:55,612
- After him.
- Get behind him.

512
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,670
Impressive.

513
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:17,074
Michael, you're unique.

514
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,241
There's never been
a hybrid before.

515
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:25,117
Your powers could be limitless.

516
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:44,807
Hold it! Oh, fuck.

517
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:51,317
- Where is he?
- He went right through there.

518
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,780
All we have are UV rounds.
They won't take him down.

519
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,445
No, but they'll slow him down.

520
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:46,371
Let's go.

521
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,113
You all right?

522
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:06,743
Jesus Christ!

523
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:01,809
But these weren't the Lycans we know.
No, these were raging monsters.

524
01:30:02,027 --> 01:30:04,150
Unable to take human form
ever again.

525
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:56,495
What are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

526
01:30:56,707 --> 01:30:59,411
I can't. Not without taking her out.

527
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:00,789
I can't get a shot.

528
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:53,799
Michael.

529
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:32,168
Take her down.

530
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:05,455
Cut us loose!

531
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:10,874
We're going down!

532
01:34:50,524 --> 01:34:51,935
William!

533
01:35:02,578 --> 01:35:06,492
I knew Viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet.

534
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,374
He should have killed you
with the rest of your family.

535
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:01,838
An unknown chapter lies ahead.

536
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:05,299
The lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred.

537
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:08,428
Chaos and infighting are inevitable.

538
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,173
All that is certain is that darkness
is still ahead.

539
01:38:12,392 --> 01:38:16,141
But for now, for the first time...

540
01:38:16,355 --> 01:38:19,190
...I look into the light with new hope.
