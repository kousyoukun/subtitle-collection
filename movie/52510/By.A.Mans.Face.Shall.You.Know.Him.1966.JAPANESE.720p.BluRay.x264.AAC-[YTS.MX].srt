15
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,701
At first, I thought I'd go nuts.

16
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,580
But it looks like the construction work
will be finished soon.

17
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,124
Just three more days.

18
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,293
So, they're leaving?

19
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,340
Doctor Amamiya, have you given some thought
about the job on the islands?

20
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:17,386
Are you going, or do you have plans for
your eviction compensation fee?

21
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:23,476
I have loan sharks breathing
down my neck.

22
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:28,773
What if I asked you to come
with me to the islands?

23
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,027
I'm not cut out for island life.

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,196
I don't want to go either.

25
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:39,116
Imagine me a GP on a small island.

26
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,037
That's no kind of life for me.

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,248
Doctor, I've always wondered...

28
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:51,295
why a man of your ability
is working a job like this.

29
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,223
- Doctor, can I use the telephone?
- Go ahead.

30
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,830
Doctor Amamiya!

31
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,630
It's a traffic accident.
Any lacerations?

32
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,215
Excessive bleeding.

33
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,360
It looks like the lower half of
his body has been crushed.

34
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,760
Get him on the gurney.

35
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,941
Thank you.

36
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,241
We can't handle this here.
He's too badly hurt.

37
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,786
He'll die if we can't get him to
a hospital with better facilities.

38
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,922
<i>Choâ€œ.!</i>

39
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,966
You know him?

40
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,138
Doctor, aren't you going to operate?

41
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,850
I can't here. Contact a hospital
with better facilities.

42
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,352
He'll bleed to death if we move him.

43
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,105
Doctor, there's no time.

44
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:44,108
August 1948 The Nine Heavens League of Korean nationals
has gathered volunteers from around the country.

45
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:24,907
Ever since Japan lost the War, ethics and
the rule of law have gone out the window.

46
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,660
The Japs are weak.

47
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:32,498
We'll create enough turmoil to
tear this country apart.

48
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:42,508
We'll snatch the New Life Market from the Japs,
and turn it into an entertainment district.

49
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:47,221
That's why I had you gather volunteers
from around the country.

50
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,770
Two, please.

51
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,499
What do you got there?

52
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,878
Give it back!

53
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,881
Doctor, help!

54
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,564
Let go of her.

55
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,442
I said, let go!

56
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,732
Let's go.

57
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,490
He owns the market I want
to take over.

58
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,284
He's a doctor named Amamiya.

59
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,037
He went to war after graduating
from a university in Tokyo.

60
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,122
He doesn't have any real ties
to the town,

61
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:40,459
but he took over the family practice
after his old man died.

62
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,509
- Blood pressure?
- Below 100.

63
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,930
Keep pumping blood into him.

64
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,352
Scalpel.

65
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:34,805
What kind of a woman do you
plan to marry?

66
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,977
Someone from a fine family,
no doubt.

67
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,230
I want you.

68
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:47,401
This is exactly where I want to be.

69
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,445
I love you.

70
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,490
I can be your mistress.

71
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,242
Don't say such things.

72
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,997
You don't understand.

73
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,291
I love you.

74
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,543
I don't care what happens to me.

75
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,004
- But you...
- I love you, too.

76
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,464
Liar!

77
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:12,593
You're the only thing in this world
I can count on.

78
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,264
<i>I...</i> killed <i>men in the War.</i>

79
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:24,855
As soon as we lost...
I learned that it was all a lie.

80
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,733
Everything.

81
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:31,236
You're the only thing I can
believe in anymore.

82
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,946
Maki.

83
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:08,190
Doctor! What are you doing?!

84
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,610
The hospital's closed, so I guess
you boys came here for nothing.

85
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,362
Come back tomorrow.

86
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,239
We need to talk.

87
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,158
Come down to the Nine Heavens
League headquarters.

88
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,202
I don't think so.

89
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,753
The boss, Yoo Seong-Won,
wants to talk to you.

90
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,672
Yoo Seong-Won?

91
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,049
Isn't he a Korean king
or something?

92
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,969
- I ain't got no business with him.
- Don't get smart!

93
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,847
A beat cop is coming.

94
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:43,225
Do I look worried?
Take him to the headquarters.

95
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,769
No, let's leave well enough
alone tonight.

96
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,774
You better watch it!

97
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:57,614
We'll be back!

98
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,552
How'd it go with the country doctor?

99
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,387
He talked tough,

100
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,890
but it's only a matter of time
before we break him.

101
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,642
We'll bust into his hospital
like that every day.

102
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,478
- Do you think that will work?
- Why wouldn't it?!

103
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,772
What are you talking about?

104
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,443
He's not like other Japanese people.

105
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,862
- Let's dance.
- Wait.

106
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,281
Do you know him?

107
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,869
If you really want the market,

108
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,372
- you should just pay him off now.
- Pay?!

109
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,334
That's what I have you idiots for!

110
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,879
Look around you:
this is a nice club.

111
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,090
I took it from the Japs.

112
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,260
Hey, tell the manager
not to let sales drop.

113
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,391
Let's dance.

114
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,815
- Wait. - But, he...
- Forget about it.

115
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:19,947
He just got out of Japanese prison.

116
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,242
Everything is new to him...

117
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:27,579
but he can fight like a madman
when he gets riled up.

118
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,207
We need him for now.

119
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,297
- Who are you?
- Gye Hye-Chun.

120
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,592
I don't mean your name.

121
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,011
What you're doing here?

122
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,265
- I was rescued by the master.
- "The master"?

123
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,976
That's what you call
Yoo Seong-Won?

124
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,773
It's dangerous.
Sooner or later...

125
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,112
He already has, hasn't he?

126
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,239
That jerk.

127
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,867
Go home.

128
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,497
My parents lived their whole lives
under Japanese rule.

129
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,875
I'm used to Japan.

130
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,879
I was born here,
and I don't know Korea.

131
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,632
Me, too.

132
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Are your parents alive?

133
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:26,346
An incendiary bomb killed
my entire family.

134
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,662
I told you to leave my sideburns long!

135
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,832
- You did not. - Yes, I did!
I did, I tell you!

136
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,126
I didn't hear you say anything,
mister.

137
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,962
Wait, pay UP-

138
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:02,299
If you expect to be paid,
do the job right!

139
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,926
We give you the same haircut
every time.

140
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,553
Not this time, you didn't!

141
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,889
You planned to stiff me
from the start.

142
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,350
Of all the nerve, you tramp!

143
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,186
Who's the one with the nerve?
It's you Koreans.

144
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:17,564
Yoko, don't provoke him!

145
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,068
- Pay what you owe!
- Bitch!

146
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:44,341
Yoko, let him be!

147
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,385
What do you expect from a Korean?!

148
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:51,932
Dad, it's not fair!

149
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,317
What the hell are you doing?!

150
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,029
What, the price went up again?

151
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,449
Get cheaper ones next time.

152
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,994
- Why don't you talk to me?!
- Yeah, whatever.

153
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,749
You're barking up the wrong tree, mac.

154
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,671
How much do you girls cost?

155
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,050
Do you only fuck Americans?

156
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,470
Soldiers of the Imperial Army
aren't good enough for you, huh?

157
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:36,601
The country is free, women are free,
and the place is a disgrace.

158
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,854
I shouted a banzai when
I heard we lost the War.

159
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,446
What do you think you're doing?!
Wait!

160
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,781
- What?!
- Pay your tab.

161
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,451
MY tab?!

162
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,078
Look at this badge;
do you know who I am?

163
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,873
Is that supposed to mean
something to me?!

164
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,583
You deadbeat!

165
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Have you ever heard the Japanese expression,
"A fox that borrows the tiger's tail?"

166
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,547
You weren't the ones at war!

167
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,234
- Gen! Help!
- What is it?

168
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:29,112
It's one of those rats from the
Nine Heavens League! He's gone crazy!

169
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,490
Those numbskulls are always
up to something.

170
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,992
- Get the police!
- I'm going.

171
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,042
Get out of the way!

172
00:16:51,384 --> 00:16:54,346
You're not going to weasel
your way out of this one.

173
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:57,974
He tried to run off from Michiyo's
without paying.

174
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:01,394
He also beat Tama senseless.

175
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,814
I didn't beat her,
she was doing a strip show!

176
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,484
It's obvious to tell she's
a prostitute!

177
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,657
Please, try to remain calm.

178
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,954
- Your name?
- Come again?

179
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:21,122
I'm asking your name!

180
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,124
Seo Yeon-Bok.

181
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,045
- I need you to come to the station.
- We don't take orders from Japs!

182
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,679
Are you sure you know what
you're getting yourself into?

183
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:52,028
If you don't free Seo this instant,
I'll have the commissioner fired!

184
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:57,367
Japan lost the War.
Your domination of Korea is over!

185
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,831
- Sorry to have to be the one to tell you.
- It serves you right!

186
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,255
It might have been a mistake
to arrest Seo.

187
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,968
But letting him go for no good
reason will only stir up...

188
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,054
resentment in the market.

189
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:21,975
US General Headquarters already issued
an order that all foreigners...

190
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:25,520
- are subject to Japanese law.
- I'm well aware of that.

191
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,274
But still, we lost the War and
the country is under occupation.

192
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:32,944
The US forces avoid conflict with
the Chinese and Koreans.

193
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,781
Their circumstances are unusual,
and they use bribes and violence.

194
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:42,621
If I'm not mistaken, they use a taxi
and transport company as a front.

195
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,849
But of course their real business
is black market goods.

196
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,593
Their boss is Yoo Seong-Won,
a vicious criminal and seven-time loser.

197
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,717
Sit down.

198
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:59,179
The police couldn't have
just released Seo on our say so.

199
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,222
They're up to something.

200
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,478
What did you tell the barber
and the barmaid?

201
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,357
We asked for Â¥25,000 in damages
from each for insulting Seo.

202
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,110
Idiot, squeeze them for
more than that!

203
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,738
This isn't just about Seo,
it's an insult to all Koreans.

204
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,406
I Want Â¥500,000.

205
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,619
No, Â¥1 million.
Tell them Â¥1 million.

206
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,829
Hey, (Ben's back.

207
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,042
Gen, what happened?

208
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,801
We lost this one.

209
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:41,471
The police called the army,

210
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,016
but the case isn't black and white,
and it didn't go anywhere.

211
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,897
They were more interested in
clamping down on the black market.

212
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,565
That's ridiculous!

213
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:57,028
They call it the black market, but it's the
only way to put food on the table!

214
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:01,574
Are the police going to target us,
or the Nine Heavens League?

215
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,910
You have to tell us!

216
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,870
Don't take it out on Gen.

217
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:11,000
Gen, are you saying that the police
can't touch Korean residents?

218
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,796
What will happen to ordinary
Japanese people?

219
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,298
The bottom line is that
we're responsible...

220
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,469
for protecting the interests of the
New Life Market ourselves.

221
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:25,014
You say that even as the Heaven's League
is rounding up as many members as it can.

222
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,434
Are you going to fight when they
try to force you out?

223
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,311
What about when they
try to bleed you for Â¥1 million?

224
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,188
What other choice do we have?

225
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:40,572
By the way, what happened with the
barber on the main shopping boulevard?

226
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:44,075
- I haven't seen hide nor hair of him.
- Yeah, what's he doing?

227
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,410
Will you shut up!

228
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,709
The shopping boulevard and the
New Life Market are business rivals.

229
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,420
Once the Koreans take over,
our rivalry won't matter much.

230
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,339
- That's right, look at my cuts here!
- Shut up!

231
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:03,178
Dammit, all the businesses on the
shopping boulevard hate us,

232
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,543
and even though the Koreans are trying to
take over, we still can't count on them.

233
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:10,935
We're on our own. We fought and
suffered through the War,

234
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,354
we won't go down without a fight.

235
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,148
Am I right?!

236
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:20,320
But there are hundreds of them,
and hundreds more coming for all we know.

237
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,405
How do you suggest we fight?

238
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,413
I can't believe I'm saying this,

239
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,793
but we need help from
the Onogawa gang.

240
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,378
You want to get in bed with
the mob?

241
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,881
We don't have a choice.

242
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:43,134
It's the reason we pay them off
every month.

243
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,137
I'll go and talk to them.
Come on.

244
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,945
Hey, Gen. Where are you going?

245
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,697
I'm going to see your mob boss.

246
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,841
I heard...
I know all about it.

247
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,051
Sit down.

248
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:32,308
I think you're talking to
the wrong person.

249
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:37,564
- I don't think so...
- I don't have the muscle I used to.

250
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,234
Sir, we got your back.

251
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:45,196
You say the word,
and we'll lay down our lives.

252
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,825
Shut up!
I didn't ask your opinion.

253
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:54,622
I'm sorry to betray your trust,

254
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:57,709
but we lost most of our
young men in the War,

255
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,837
and I can't see any way that
we could win this fight.

256
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,632
Sir, don't you care if you
lose the market?

257
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,969
- Kubota, Mr. Onogawa didn't say that.
- Think about it.

258
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:11,931
My men and I will do what we can
to save the market.

259
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:16,728
But if I put every man I have into
this fight, we'll lose everything.

260
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,730
That's a fact.

261
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:22,609
Then you're going to leave us
out to dry?

262
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,152
Let's go.

263
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,574
Hold on.

264
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,163
The man who can help you is
a doctor named Amamiya.

265
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,331
Amamiya?

266
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:40,084
- Yeah, he owns the land that the New
Life Market is on. - That young fella?

267
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:42,462
What can that hayseed doctor
do for us?

268
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:47,342
Don't underestimate him.
He's fearless and he's strong.

269
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:53,306
Once my boys were foolish enough
to mess with his nurse.

270
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,018
He mopped up the floor with them.

271
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,980
- Isn't that so?
- Yes, he was one tough customer.

272
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:07,445
He's the owner of the market.

273
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,241
With him leading the cause, you'll be
an army. A braver man you'll never find.

274
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,954
He was a lion on the battlefield
in the War.

275
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,915
I hope I've convinced you.

276
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,293
AMAMIYA HOSPITAL

277
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,171
EXCUSE me for a moment.

278
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,923
Is he all right?

279
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,009
He looks like a street thug.

280
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:33,429
- A nurse can handle it.
- Doctor...

281
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,057
I can't help you.

282
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,519
In the first place,
you can't ask a doctor to fight.

283
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,564
We're not.
We just want you to advise us.

284
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,692
I don't know anything about the law.

285
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,278
The law isn't helping us.
That's why we came to you.

286
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:54,158
But the law should prevail
in all matters.

287
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:59,205
But if the Koreans take the market,
you won't get any rent.

288
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,958
In fact, you'll probably lose
the land, too.

289
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,461
I'm not collecting any rent now.

290
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:09,632
But Onogawa's boys are always
coming around to collect rent.

291
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:13,845
- They're acting on their own behalf.
- They're ripping us off?!

292
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,726
Doctor, come quick.

293
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,979
The Nine Heavens League brought all of
the girls from their cabaret club.

294
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,165
They insist you give them
physical exams immediately.

295
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:28,276
Hey, hurry it up, here!

296
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,238
We have to get back to work!
Time is money and all that jazz!

297
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:37,160
- I don't want any lip outta you!
- You don't even have an appointment!

298
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,661
I'm not going to do this!

299
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,706
- We're not screwing around here, bitch!
- Hold still!

300
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:49,130
I'll do the physical exam,
but not today.

301
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,091
I have house calls to make,
come back tomorrow.

302
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,801
What time?

303
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,430
I want it now. Do it.

304
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,265
Go get it done somewhere else.

305
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,934
What did you say?

306
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:04,854
I've got a right to good health!

307
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,439
Please, stop!

308
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,860
You have a responsibility
as a doctor.

309
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,238
Unless you got a problem with
treating me...

310
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm sorry, doctor.

311
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:20,078
Last night, I was ready to fight
a couple of Yanks...

312
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,456
over some girls,
but he was too yellow to fight.

313
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,917
Go home!

314
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,585
All right.

315
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,548
OK, everybody,

316
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:35,968
it looks like the doc won't see us.

317
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:46,104
You bastard!

318
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,951
Stop!

319
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,828
Gye, stay back.

320
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,540
Help!

321
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,838
Doctor, make them stop!

322
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,020
- You cretins!
- Who did it?!

323
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,272
Gye!

324
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,983
Get her into the examination room.

325
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,736
- Get out of the way!
- I didn't ask you for help!

326
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:39,574
You're playing with her life.
Head trauma is often fatal.

327
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,701
Don't you care?

328
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,954
Then we'll stay while you treat her.

329
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,248
Get out,
you'll just get under foot.

330
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,543
If you don't like it,
take her to another doctor.

331
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,753
But if she dies, her blood is on your
hands. What's it gonna be then?!

332
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,006
What should we do?

333
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,425
She'll be all right, won't she?

334
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:04,056
If you make a hash of this,
we'll get you!

335
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,766
You better believe it!

336
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,570
Let's get everyone together again.

337
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,948
If worse comes to worse,
at least we've gotten the doctor involved.

338
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,268
Doctor, marry me.

339
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,479
Where did that come from?

340
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,648
I want to marry you!

341
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,441
This is a bit sudden.

342
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm frightened! Hold me!

343
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,031
Imai is coming.
Why are you scared?

344
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,451
I'm scared that you're going to leave.

345
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,621
- Who told you such a silly thing?
- I don't care if you think I'm a fool.

346
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,707
I don't want you to go anywhere,
and I don't want to lose you to anyone.

347
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,878
I don't expect you to understand
someone like me,

348
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,839
but my body wants you.

349
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:27,765
Just now, I saw your eyes when that mobster
came in half-dead from the Koreans.

350
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:32,186
They were the eyes of a man
who had no one to turn to.

351
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,856
I'll love you with my body,

352
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,567
and then part of me will be inside you,
no matter what happens.

353
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,278
That's why I spoke so suddenly.

354
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,612
It's your eyes!

355
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:48,744
Maki, what do I mean to you?

356
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:53,165
Marry me. It's the only way
I can be sure you won't leave.

357
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,084
What's the point?

358
00:29:55,209 --> 00:30:00,172
It'd be no different than those punks
acting so tough the other day.

359
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,883
What's it got to do with us?

360
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:08,431
I'm a woman...
Just a woman.

361
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,607
Doctor, it's time for your house calls.

362
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,038
Doctor!

363
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:45,126
Is she going to be all right?

364
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,181
- Doctor.
- Don't interrupt!

365
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,144
I came here as soon as I heard.

366
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,398
Yes, but I only told them she might
die to get rid of them. It was a threat.

367
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,650
She should wake up soon.

368
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,028
For now, let her sleep.

369
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,822
Is she your girl?

370
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,118
When I was on the front,
and my life was on the line,

371
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,454
there was one man I could trust-

372
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,582
not as an officer...
but as a human being.

373
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,335
That was Army Medic Amamiya.

374
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:26,217
If everyone was like this girl
and Dr. Amamiya,

375
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,553
there'd be a whole lot less misery
in the world.

376
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:32,431
Cut the theatrics, Shibata.

377
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,683
You are Private Shibata,
aren't you?

378
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:36,977
Please call me Choi.

379
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:39,563
Choi Mun-Gye.

380
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:42,149
I'm not trying to pass as
Japanese anymore.

381
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,026
Tell me one thing:

382
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:48,364
If you realize the futility of killing
your fellow man in war,

383
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:52,201
how did you wind up in the mob?

384
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,662
The battlefield was futile,

385
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,206
but this is different.

386
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,959
Now we're fighting for ourselves.

387
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,337
- For our own kind.
- And her?

388
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:13,506
It's payback for payback,
and it never ends.

389
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,645
Does that mean you're going to hand over the
market to Yoo Seong-Won without a fight?

390
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,233
Got an answer?

391
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,277
Hell if I know!

392
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:10,112
I know I'm a medic,
but I'm the ranking officer.

393
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,740
I'm taking command of this unit!

394
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:19,538
Sir, there are civilians on the other side
of that hill waiting to be rescued.

395
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:34,553
<i>Attention, brave Japanese soldiers,</i>

396
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,266
<i>please abandon your vain efforts
to win this war.</i>

397
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:45,397
<i>No man who throws down his rifle
will be killed.</i>

398
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,027
<i>Everyone, please come out.</i>

399
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,487
<i>It should be a beautiful
sunrise this morning.</i>

400
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,988
I will personally kill any man who attempts...
It should <i>be</i> a beautiful <i>sunrise this</i> morning.

401
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:54,448
<i>It should be a beautiful
sunrise this morning.</i>

402
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:57,493
To disgrace the Imperial Army
of Japan by surrendering.

403
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:00,079
I'll cut you down!

404
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,751
Let's go.
I'll lead the group and so,

405
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:09,463
- What, you coward!
- If the Americans don't keep their word,

406
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:13,551
- I'll die and you all can take cover.
- I'll go, too.

407
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,388
You Korean dog!

408
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,979
I'll kill any man who surrenders!

409
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,400
If I'm to die,

410
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,989
I want to at least see
the light of day one last time!

411
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,503
Sir, let me go, too!

412
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,215
Cooper scissors.

413
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,839
Who are you?

414
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,093
Haruko. Choi Haruko.

415
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,638
Sai? Then...

416
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,389
How's daddy?

417
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,769
He's asleep.
Did you come by yourself?

418
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,438
The policeman brought me.

419
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,857
Mommy's gone today.

420
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,317
Where's your mommy?

421
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:56,570
She went to Tokyo.
She said she'd be back today.

422
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:59,448
Daddy doesn't know,

423
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:03,786
but mommy went to ask if it was OK
for us to go back to Korea.

424
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,126
You're name's Haruko?

425
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:13,420
Is your mommy Japanese?

426
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,591
- Do you and your mommy want to go
to your daddy's country? - I don't know.

427
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,468
Hello, sir.

428
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:23,597
- I was just checking up on the girl.
- I just heard.

429
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,212
This is the owner of the car that
ran over that nogoodnik.

430
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:28,560
I already questioned him.

431
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,480
Doctor, pleased to meet you.

432
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:39,238
I'm the CEO of four companies.
I'm a busy man.

433
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:44,952
This is the daughter of the man
you ran over.

434
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,288
We had a bad accident.
Didn't we?

435
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,930
Hey, can you write your
name and address?

436
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,226
Write it for the man.

437
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,777
Choi? You're Korean.

438
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,381
Good job.

439
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:47,848
We have another engagement to tend to,
so you'll have to excuse us. Sir?

440
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,558
Wait!

441
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,936
Oh, yes...
Your fee for the surgery.

442
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,106
You jackass! Apologize to
the little girl, blue blood!

443
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,692
Who is this doctor?
Is he yakuza?

444
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,069
And who are you?!
Are you human?!

445
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,447
Doctor, come quick!

446
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:06,658
- What is it? - His stomach is swelling.
It looks like bleeding. - What?

447
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,076
Are you threatening me?

448
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,637
If you have a grievance,
please consult my attorney.

449
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,705
I'm going to report you to
the medical association!

450
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,457
You'll never work again!

451
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,511
Leave me alone?!

452
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,851
Help!

453
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,483
What's that?

454
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,572
They're having a little rumpy pumpy
in the outdoors. How about we try it, babe?

455
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,408
No way, we can get a hotel room!

456
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,757
I've got tired blood,

457
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,218
maybe I'll see the doctor later.

458
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,557
What's going on?

459
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,934
Yoko, the barber's daughter,
has been killed.

460
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:58,812
Her body turned up by the bridge.
That's what I heard.

461
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,536
It was so grisly,
I couldn't bear to look!

462
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:02,024
Yoko!

463
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,693
Why are you taking her photo?!

464
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,529
Mr. Minegishi, please!
We need evidence.

465
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,990
Please get off of her.
Get up.

466
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,033
Get a hold of yourself.
We're collecting evidence.

467
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:16,788
- Minegishi! Evidence!
- I can tell you what happened!

468
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,541
It was the Nine Heavens League.

469
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:24,587
Someone saw those Koreans follow Yoko
when she came out of the public bath!

470
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,300
- Give me a name!
- That's your job!

471
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,220
You know it's the Koreans,
and you're scared to act.

472
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,724
- I... I...
- Mr. Minegishi, calm down.

473
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,603
- We need evidence.
- Dammit!

474
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,440
I raised her by myself,
and now Yoko's dead!

475
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:48,403
The poor child! Yoko!

476
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,492
Whaddya you want, old man?!

477
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,458
Give me the man who killed
my daughter!

478
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,543
Oh, so you're the barber.

479
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:07,381
Your daughter's dead and
you're mad with grief.

480
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:09,341
You can't hide him -

481
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,969
someone saw his face!

482
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:14,137
Then tell the police.

483
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:18,600
Hand him over!
I want him!

484
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,937
- What are you talking about?
- Murderers!

485
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,440
You're all murderers!

486
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:30,529
You're parasites who prey
on the weak!

487
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,322
Parasites?!

488
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,450
Look what you Japs did in Korea
a few years ago!

489
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,577
What's the life of one girl
in comparison?!

490
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,535
Hey, someone help him!

491
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,789
We have to save him!

492
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:26,043
What's happened to this town?

493
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:28,336
This isn't any kind of place
for people to live!

494
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,922
You're my brother,
what do you think?

495
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:34,259
Shuichi, isn't Japan a civilized nation?

496
00:42:34,509 --> 00:42:38,805
Is a national confession of culpability
tantamount to a pledge of cowardice?

497
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:43,310
Why did we lose one war
and now another?

498
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,104
I believe in such a thing
as good and evil.

499
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:48,398
I wish the police did, too!

500
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,109
Doesn't anyone but me care?

501
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:54,738
- It's all we can do to put food
on the table. - Maki!

502
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:56,740
Excuse me.

503
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,743
What the hell are you mumbling about?!

504
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,037
Stand tall and be proud!

505
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,100
Pride won't put food in my stomach! But a
rich brat like you wouldn't understand!

506
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:08,001
Can't you see that our
emotional distress...

507
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:10,796
has ruined the reconstruction
of Japan?

508
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,801
We need to recover a sense
of national cohesion.

509
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,175
Knowing that doesn't do a bit of good!

510
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:18,220
- Maki, please calm down.
- No, I won't! You idiot,

511
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:21,348
if you want national cohesion,
you can start with your brother.

512
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:25,936
You come home from your university in Tokyo
and practically bite his head off!

513
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:28,730
Doctor.

514
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:36,947
Are you in pain?

515
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,991
Shit, I can't believe it!

516
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,577
It looks like you're feeling better.

517
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,579
I thought we were going to lose you.

518
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,498
Shuichi!

519
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:54,840
Eat up...
It's my own recipe.

520
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,176
It's better than a restaurant.

521
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,728
Hey, how's school?

522
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,606
What classes are you taking
this semester?

523
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:14,109
Aren't you going to eat?

524
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,611
You've changed.

525
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,446
Havel?

526
00:44:18,613 --> 00:44:22,868
We enjoy more freedom than ever before.

527
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,786
Why don't you do something?

528
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,498
Social change through action.

529
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,935
The Nine Heavens League are doing
just that through violence.

530
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,295
And they're succeeding quite well.

531
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:37,132
- Are you suggesting I go around
beating them up? - No, I'm not.

532
00:44:37,465 --> 00:44:39,342
But it's eye for an eye.

533
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:43,180
If someone stands up to them,
he'll find hundreds follow along.

534
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,017
Japanese people are good
at following along.

535
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:49,227
And betrayal.

536
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,110
Hey, wait.

537
00:44:57,235 --> 00:44:58,235
Wait.

538
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:02,407
Don't you care what happens
to this town?

539
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:08,663
Don't close yourself up in your own
little world. It's defeatist.

540
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:13,168
I'm tired of fighting...
And I saw enough killing on the front!

541
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:18,173
You act like fighting in the War...
gave you some kind of a special privilege.

542
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:22,135
But I want to fight in a war, too!

543
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,681
If we had won that war,
you'd be dancing...

544
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,185
cheek-to-cheek with some
Hollywood starlet right now.

545
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,771
You don't have the foggiest notion
of what war is like!

546
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:35,607
You disappoint me...

547
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,193
You're a coward.

548
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:41,780
Wait! Shunji!

549
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:43,490
Shunji!

550
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:54,376
Hey, doc, is he your brother?

551
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,880
He's cute.
Can I have him?

552
00:45:59,297 --> 00:46:01,716
Shut up.
Come here, Gye.

553
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:07,055
Hey, I found him first!

554
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:11,726
Hey, mister, this tramp works at
that Korean cabaret club.

555
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:14,229
Be careful with her.

556
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,276
Get out of here!

557
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,988
I can't believe that you had
the nerve to come.

558
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,326
Your friends raped and killed
a local girl.

559
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,081
If it wasn't for us, they would have
killed her father, too.

560
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,416
Shunji!

561
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,504
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

562
00:46:41,923 --> 00:46:43,466
Get out!

563
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,094
Don't come here again!

564
00:46:46,886 --> 00:46:48,471
- Get out!
- Shunji!

565
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,684
This is a patient!

566
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,528
- Were you laughing at me?
- No, of course not.

567
00:47:03,778 --> 00:47:07,073
- I think you were!
- No, I'm sorry.

568
00:47:35,101 --> 00:47:38,688
Please forgive me!

569
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:43,943
I just want to pay my respects.

570
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,906
You wanna get beat up again?!

571
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,422
Stop!

572
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,533
We'll get you for this!

573
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,882
How dare you bring offerings
to the funeral!

574
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,593
Did you think we'd forget that
you killed Yoko?!

575
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,767
Shunji was fighting the Koreans?

576
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:00,812
- Is he all right?
- He disappeared at the market.

577
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,772
Do you know where he is?

578
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:07,110
Your brother has put us in
a difficult position.

579
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:12,532
The Koreans are out for blood and
your brother is missing.

580
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:15,743
We don't have the manpower for this.

581
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:20,623
If he comes back here,
don't let him out again.

582
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,625
All right.

583
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:30,091
Wow, what are you doing here?

584
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,428
Are you hereto collect on a bill
from the hospital?

585
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,430
I'd like a drink, please.

586
00:49:37,098 --> 00:49:40,935
Is it a jilted lover,
a tiff with the doctor?

587
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,188
Do you have any snacks?

588
00:49:44,355 --> 00:49:46,274
I asked you a question.

589
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,902
Did you have a fight with the doctor?

590
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,779
I've seen it a thousand times, honey.

591
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,532
When are you getting married?

592
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:56,993
Why do I have to get married?

593
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,373
You're just going to end up
getting hurt.

594
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,460
Men are all the same.

595
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:11,007
"Love in its most perfect form
is unrequited" - Osamu Dazai.

596
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:20,892
Do nurses make good money?

597
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,946
Where's the doctor's little brother,
Shunji?

598
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,490
His little brother...

599
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:41,162
There are no johns here, girls.
Not at this hour.

600
00:50:42,747 --> 00:50:45,083
Those bozos from the
Nine Heavens League...

601
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,006
are hanging around and
scaring off all the men.

602
00:50:48,127 --> 00:50:50,922
It's slim picking here, too.

603
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,302
Could one of you just tell me
where Shunji is?

604
00:50:56,427 --> 00:51:01,641
He's out stirring up trouble between the
two groups and it's just going to snowball.

605
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,020
You sound just like the doctor.

606
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:11,943
Shunji, everybody's here!

607
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,987
OK, let's roll!

608
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,865
- We'll show them!
- Shunji!

609
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,493
Don't interfere!

610
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,415
This is insanity!

611
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,376
- What are you talking about?!
- I'll tell the cops! - You're a spy!

612
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,796
Watch her until we get back.

613
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,716
Shunji!

614
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:37,760
Give 'em hell!

615
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:16,716
Where's your boss?!

616
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:27,143
Customers, out!

617
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,730
I want the leader of the
Nine Heavens League!

618
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,565
Where do you think you are?
Get out!

619
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:37,403
We can't get anything from
a toady like you... give us Yoo!

620
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,657
We're not taking it anymore,
give us Yoo!

621
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,206
I'm Yoo Seong-Won.

622
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,501
- State your business.
- We want you out of the market.

623
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,211
Is that yes or no?!

624
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,756
- And if I say no?
- We'll do this!

625
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,929
Yeah, I got it.

626
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,182
I have just one thing to say
to you mutts:

627
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,602
You brought this on yourselves.

628
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,022
We're only fighting back.
This blood will be on your hands.

629
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,149
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's get 'em!

630
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:51,227
Laddie buck, let's go.

631
00:54:27,513 --> 00:54:31,517
I heard that you were Amamiya's
kid brother. You fight good.

632
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,770
Now go home,
before you get hurt.

633
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,816
Get out or I'll shoot you dead!

634
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:43,780
Don't run!

635
00:54:50,953 --> 00:54:54,373
The market is as good as mine.

636
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:58,896
- You have to stop fighting.
- I will, just as soon as they do.

637
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:01,566
Then the fighting will just
continue forever.

638
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,988
L.-

639
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:32,638
If it gives you peace,

640
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,975
you can rape me.

641
00:56:40,521 --> 00:56:42,857
If it will quench your anger.

642
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:52,825
And why not?

643
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,553
What's wrong?

644
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,810
I'm not like that.

645
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:25,983
I saw it the first time we met.

646
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:29,236
You're a good man.

647
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:40,915
You're... You're beautiful.

648
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,312
- You set me up!
- No, I didn't. - Liar!

649
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,030
Take him to the headquarters.

650
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:24,709
You're awake.

651
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:27,128
It's me.

652
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:32,049
Dr. Amamiya...

653
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,432
- Where am I?
- At my hospital.

654
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,309
It's not like before, though.

655
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:46,981
Dr. Amamiya,
don't let me die.

656
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:53,404
I need to live for my wife
and daughter.

657
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,741
Your daughter's here.

658
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:58,909
She's a sweet kid.

659
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,203
Yes, Doctor.

660
00:59:12,673 --> 00:59:15,593
- Haruko.
- Daddy!

661
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,181
Did you come here by yourself?

662
00:59:24,685 --> 00:59:27,229
Don't cry.

663
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,610
Daddy will be better soon.

664
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:35,446
Doctor, his blood pressure's falling.

665
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:43,245
<i>Repeat surgeries of this kind have
a mortality rate of 90%.</i>

666
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:46,665
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

667
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,460
<i>But, why me?</i>

668
00:59:50,127 --> 00:59:55,841
<i>I'll have taken the life of
this little girl's father.</i>

669
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,387
<i>Damn it all, I'm a doctor!</i>

670
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,055
<i>Still...</i>

671
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,159
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

672
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:27,623
<i>At that time...
The incident at the market.</i>

673
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,042
<i>I stood up and fought.</i>

674
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:33,504
<i>Why? I didn't want to.</i>

675
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,632
<i>Forget about it.</i>

676
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,219
<i>I went to prison.</i>

677
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,805
<i>Eight years.</i>

678
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,224
<i>Maki visited me.</i>

679
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,791
<i>Oh, yeah...
Just like I thought.</i>

680
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:15,480
<i>As soon as the Nine Heaven's League were
gone, the Onogawa gang took their place.</i>

681
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:17,256
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

682
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:20,176
<i>What was worse was what the
townspeople did to the doctor.</i>

683
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:25,264
<i>She told me about what was
going on in the town.</i>

684
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,058
<i>I was sad that I couldn't...</i>

685
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,021
<i>touch her through the wire mesh
in the visiting room.</i>

686
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:34,231
<i>I noticed that she...</i>

687
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:38,527
<i>was no longer the woman I remembered.
I was dismayed.</i>

688
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:42,364
<i>I truly loved Maki then.</i>

689
01:01:42,948 --> 01:01:45,201
I have to go now, Doctor.

690
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,367
Don't go.

691
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:50,998
Doctor, please believe me:

692
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,252
You're the only man I ever loved.

693
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:58,087
Goodbye.

694
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,384
Maki! Maki!

695
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,224
You're making a mistake!
This is a mistake!

696
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,900
AT THAT TIME

697
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,943
AT THAT <i>TIME At that time, the Nine
Heavens League had taken Shunji hostage.</i>

698
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:23,113
<i>At that time, the Nine Heavens League
had taken Shunji hostage.</i>

699
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:26,742
<i>They told me that if I wanted
my brother back alive,</i>

700
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,828
<i>I'd have to hand over the deed
to the New Life Market.</i>

701
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:35,584
<i>And that if I refused, they would not
hesitate to attack the New Life Market.</i>

702
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:38,462
<i>The police recognized that
this was no idle threat,</i>

703
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:42,174
<i>and released Seo Yeon-Bok from jail
in a bid to appease them.</i>

704
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,808
How do you like them apples?!

705
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,936
Come on out and take a look,
you sons of bitches!

706
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:58,107
The cops let me out of the clink!

707
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:06,991
It's too late to try to kiss
and make up!

708
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:46,113
It's the deed to the land the
New Life Market is on.

709
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,533
Now hand over Shunji.

710
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:03,255
Once we've taken possession of it.

711
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,800
- That's not the deal.
- Suck it up.

712
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:22,358
Well, well.

713
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:26,945
This is a cute bluff.

714
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:30,449
You haven't signed the deed
over to me.

715
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:36,288
I will, once you give me Shunji.

716
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,627
You've certainly got chutzpah.

717
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,004
We should work together.

718
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,882
You'll have more money
than you can spend,

719
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:50,511
and I'll toss your brother in
as a signing bonus.

720
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:52,596
And if I say no?

721
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,184
Mr. Yoo.

722
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,651
Please let me handle this.

723
01:05:05,859 --> 01:05:07,361
<i>Choâ€œ.!</i>

724
01:05:14,868 --> 01:05:16,203
Fine.

725
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:53,323
The alcohol hasn't been delivered yet.

726
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,744
- Water'll do.
- Water.

727
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,920
I didn't want to meet you like this.

728
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:11,800
- You of all people.
- Be grateful you survived.

729
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,386
Uh yeah?

730
01:06:14,928 --> 01:06:17,556
- Oh yeah.
- But...

731
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,354
Your brother is a bit too brave
for his own good.

732
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:30,736
Amamiya, a turf war over this market
is inevitable.

733
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,782
Defeat... Death...

734
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:40,746
I just want Shunji back safely.

735
01:06:40,954 --> 01:06:42,873
Doctor, you're gutless!

736
01:06:42,956 --> 01:06:46,126
Don't you care about anyone
but yourself?

737
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,588
Defeat and death...

738
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:52,925
See you later, Amamiya.

739
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:42,975
The sales at the Niagara...

740
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,274
I want to help Amamiya's kid brother.

741
01:08:10,627 --> 01:08:13,922
- How's that punk kid?
- I took care of him real nice.

742
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:17,009
Some of the junior members are
babysitting him now.

743
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,939
Drink.

744
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:43,493
When we caught you, you said
Gye Hye-Chun ratted you out.

745
01:08:43,535 --> 01:08:46,747
You said she lied to you.
You're the liar!

746
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,751
There are no rats in our ranks.

747
01:08:51,835 --> 01:08:56,298
We snuck up so neither of you
would notice.

748
01:09:04,931 --> 01:09:06,767
And another thing:

749
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:11,480
Your brother brought the deed to the
New Life Market to save your neck.

750
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:16,860
Once your brother signs it,
it will belong to Mr. Yoo.

751
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,237
It will be an entertainment district.

752
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:24,576
The Japs will take it in their stride
and enjoy the place.

753
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:27,579
The Japs have short memories...

754
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:30,415
but we don't!

755
01:09:35,128 --> 01:09:36,463
Shuichi.

756
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:53,355
Is this Amamiya?

757
01:09:53,563 --> 01:09:57,275
You have till noon tomorrow.

758
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:00,904
If you're even a minute late,
we'll attack the market.

759
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:03,949
There will be fighting in the streets.
Do you understand?

760
01:10:04,324 --> 01:10:07,044
<i>This will ostensibly be revenge for what
you Japs did at the Niagara.</i>

761
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,246
<i>We've got the moral high ground here.</i>

762
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:12,040
<i>The market belongs to the Koreans now.</i>

763
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:17,087
<i>I know you don't want that kind
of bloodshed.</i>

764
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:20,424
<i>Don't you want to save the life of
your only brother?</i>

765
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:21,591
<i>It makes sense.</i>

766
01:10:21,883 --> 01:10:25,887
If you don't sign that deed over to me,
the streets will run red with blood.

767
01:10:26,012 --> 01:10:30,267
That's the long and the short of it.
Amamiya, sign the deed.

768
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,041
Shunji!

769
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,003
- Shunji!
- Can you walk?

770
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,733
You son of a bitch!

771
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,049
Stop!

772
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,278
Kill Choi!

773
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,875
Doctor...

774
01:13:43,376 --> 01:13:50,342
I'll arrest you if you try to get
revenge for this.

775
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,182
Doctor, he's over here.

776
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,565
- Alcohol.
- Yes.

777
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,444
Gauze.

778
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,746
I need a cloth.

779
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:30,215
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

780
01:14:31,299 --> 01:14:32,676
Shibata...

781
01:14:33,885 --> 01:14:36,429
Call me Choi.

782
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:41,017
You'll always be Shibata to me.

783
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,937
<i>Listen up!</i>

784
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:47,524
<i>We want you out of the New Life Market
by noon tomorrow!</i>

785
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,110
<i>Amamiya has signed the deed
over to us!</i>

786
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:53,947
We are appropriating this land!

787
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,158
Anyone still here at noon
will be killed!

788
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:01,079
To the last man!

789
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:02,872
Make no mistake!

790
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,385
Doctor, could we...

791
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:48,418
You intend to take action,
don't you?

792
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:52,881
You can count on me.

793
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,800
Thanks, but no thanks.

794
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,802
What?

795
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,763
I don't want your help.

796
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,016
I fight my own battles.

797
01:16:03,933 --> 01:16:05,852
It's revenge.

798
01:16:06,811 --> 01:16:08,688
I'll die.

799
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:11,941
It may be a mistake,

800
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:17,864
but I see no other way to stop
the cycle of hate and bloodshed.

801
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,075
Doctor...

802
01:16:20,283 --> 01:16:21,951
Let it go.

803
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,621
I have a favor to ask.

804
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:27,624
Take care of the injured guy
at the bar.

805
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,339
I'll take him someplace safe.

806
01:16:34,964 --> 01:16:37,133
Also, doctor,

807
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:42,472
take this.

808
01:16:46,726 --> 01:16:50,855
I'd like to be alone now.

809
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,990
Are you going to do the
same thing as Shunji?

810
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,327
Take care of things after I'm gone.

811
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:53,710
You're going to leave me?

812
01:17:54,377 --> 01:17:57,755
You're the only one I can count on.

813
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:02,802
- Where's Nurse lmai?
- She went back to her hometown.

814
01:18:05,638 --> 01:18:10,476
It ain't much,
but it will help you get by.

815
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:13,688
And take care of Choi.

816
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,358
Is that all you have to say to me?!

817
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,361
That's it?!

818
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:24,824
How can you be so cruel?!

819
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:34,876
Everybody, get ready!

820
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:57,899
I don't want to give up!

821
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:01,736
Do you know how hard it is for
a woman to get this far?

822
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:05,281
- We're all in the same boat!
- We can't give up!

823
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:06,783
We'll be killed if we stay!

824
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:16,125
NEW LIFE MARKET

825
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:22,090
Stop here!

826
01:19:26,135 --> 01:19:29,138
- Hey, pay up!
- This'll do.

827
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:31,266
It's used!

828
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,977
You do this to me every time!

829
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,785
Kill 'em all!

830
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:28,239
Attack!

831
01:20:37,373 --> 01:20:38,624
Wait!

832
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:47,592
Amamiya...
you're alone, aren't you?

833
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,474
I'm here to avenge my brother.

834
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:01,410
Doctor! Doctor!

835
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:35,528
The battle over the
New Life Market is finished.

836
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,201
Doctor.

837
01:24:44,453 --> 01:24:46,122
Please lie on your side.

838
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:52,211
We're going to conduct
a lumbar puncture. Please hold still.

839
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:17,445
<i>Mommy!</i>

840
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,032
Haruko!

841
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:24,744
Are you Mr. Choi's wife?

842
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:27,371
There's not much time,
please come in.

843
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,220
Maki.

844
01:25:43,971 --> 01:25:46,974
I'm sorry I couldn't get here faster.

845
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:49,310
Doctor!

846
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:58,235
Dr. Amamiya, we're married.

847
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:05,409
You left me,

848
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:08,913
and Choi was betrayed by
his friends.

849
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:13,584
We treated him at Michiyo's bar.

850
01:26:15,294 --> 01:26:19,715
You asked me to take care of him.

851
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,512
We were both hurt.

852
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:27,807
We took care of each other.

853
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:32,478
We were an ordinary couple.

854
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:39,360
We had a child.

855
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:43,364
She's a darling child.

856
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,409
We're happy!

857
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:54,959
Doctor, please save my husband!

858
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:57,378
Save his life!

859
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:00,589
It's all right, Maki...

860
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,176
I won't die that easily.

861
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,264
I went to the embassy in Tokyo,
so we can go to Korea.

862
01:27:08,305 --> 01:27:11,517
It doesn't matter for me, but I know
you want Haruko to grow up there.

863
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:14,019
It's your home.

864
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:18,399
Haruko will be able to go to
a Korean school.

865
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:22,528
Maki, you silly girl...

866
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:27,283
It doesn't matter where I am,

867
01:27:27,783 --> 01:27:30,536
so long as I'm with you two.

868
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,415
Japan, Korea -

869
01:27:35,332 --> 01:27:38,544
it doesn't matter.

870
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:40,880
Darling!

871
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:46,469
Dr. Amamiya,

872
01:27:48,262 --> 01:27:52,433
my life was in your hands
on the front,

873
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,436
at the market,

874
01:27:56,937 --> 01:27:58,939
and again now.

875
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:02,943
Chance encounters are a part of life.

876
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:06,197
Don't make too much of it.

877
01:28:06,572 --> 01:28:09,158
It was chance that you and Maki met.

878
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:11,994
And that I met you here today.

879
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:17,249
It was the same for Shunji
and Gye when they died.

880
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:22,922
If...

881
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:27,927
Shunji and Gye hadn't died,

882
01:28:29,845 --> 01:28:32,348
they probably would have been lovers.

883
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:35,100
Doctor.

884
01:28:37,436 --> 01:28:39,438
Take the girl outside.

885
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:44,235
No, I want her here...

886
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:48,155
to see her brave father's face.

887
01:28:57,623 --> 01:28:59,250
Let's do it.

888
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,377
THE END

889
