[Man]
Welcome to the University of Ithaca.

2
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:59,435
This is it, right here.
This is what we're talkin' about.

3
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,497
I'm gonna give you
a good tour today.

4
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,772
Show you as much as you need to know,
plus a whole lot more.

5
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:07,279
So this is the main area
of the university.

6
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:09,281
You'll be getting used
to this area.

7
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:12,910
This is where you congregate
with your friends and classmates.

8
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,682
Come in around me, everyone. Keep close.

9
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:19,522
Don't straggle. I've had problems
with stragglers before, okay ?

10
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,653
They get lost in the back. They get
hit by trucks, okay ? It's not pretty.

11
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,664
It's not pretty when it happens.
This is the--

12
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:30,635
By the way, this is the Joseph H. Nelson
Memorial Library here, okay ?

13
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:35,505
It was built, uh--
It was built, uh, in the 1600s.

14
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:39,409
1600s ? It says 1951 .

15
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,414
[Snickering]

16
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:48,947
That's the address.
Okay ? Wise-ass.

17
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:50,717
That's the psychology department.

18
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,850
Each semester you'll
be expected to volunteer...

19
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,895
for some cutting-edge
experimental testing.

20
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,896
Kind of cool. Just a tip.

21
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:03,061
When it's your turn, remember
to wear loose clothes, no metal,

22
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,698
and be prepared to receive
several heavy doses of electric current.

23
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,142
They're watching us right now.

24
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:16,941
Over there is the department of English.

25
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:20,646
I see most of you speak English already,
so we can skip that one.

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,554
- How long have you
been going to school here ?
- Eight years.

27
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:27,559
[ Everyone Laughing ]

28
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:31,393
You don't seem to know anything about it
here. This is the worst tour ever.

29
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:35,424
This is the worst school ever.
Doesn't anything cool ever happen here ?

30
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,595
Yeah, I mean,
cool stuff happens here.

31
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,936
This University of Ithaca is
the coolest, coolest place in the world.

32
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:44,272
That's because he's probably
never been anywhere else.

33
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,710
[ Laughing ]

34
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,473
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh all you want.

35
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,317
But the fact of the matter is,
this is the setting for
the greatest story ever told.

36
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,754
Okay ?

37
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:02,352
It's about this guy I knew,
Josh Parker,

38
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,920
and his girl friend, Tiffany.

39
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,489
It's one of the most
Fascinating journeys ever.

40
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:12,433
Josh and Tiffany were always together,

41
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,940
starting from when
they were really little.

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,907
They did everything as a team.

43
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,074
Once when Tiffany was ten years old,
She had her tonsils taken out.

44
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,676
Josh stayed in the hospital
for three straight days.

45
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:28,744
They were best friends.

46
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:30,881
And eventually what started out
as friendship...

47
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:36,623
blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

48
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:41,395
You know, they spent
so much time together that
even their dogs started dating.

49
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:46,770
They seemed destined
to be together forever.

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,335
But after high school, they faced
their most challenging challenge ever.:

51
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:55,404
a long-distance relationship.

52
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:02,317
See, unfortunately,
while Josh was enrolled here
at the wonderful University of Ithaca,

53
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,655
Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

54
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:10,492
But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

55
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:15,001
to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship.

56
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,801
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them had imagined.

57
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:25,004
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

58
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,569
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

59
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:31,208
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on.

60
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:35,516
Seriously ! I had to take
two birth control pills this morning.

61
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,523
You wanna help me study
again tonight ?

62
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,855
Forget tonight. Come over now.

63
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:43,657
- Let's blow this class off.
- [ Panting ]

64
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,998
[ Gasps ]

65
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,857
[ Line Rings ]

66
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,622
[ Answer Machine ] Tiffany and Carla
can't come to the phone,

67
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,562
but if you leave a message,
we'll call you right back.

68
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:21,032
Hey, Tif, it's me... again.

69
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,696
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still tryin' to get a hold of you.

70
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,672
Everything's cool, though.
I'm sure I'll catch you later.

71
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,040
Call me back, okay ?
Okay. Bye.

72
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,845
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video off.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,616
I haven't talked to you
in a few days.

74
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,818
And I'm starting to think you
don't like me anymore. No, I'm kidding.

75
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:50,351
Hey, guys.
But I am getting a little worried,

76
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,331
so gimme a call when
you get a chance, okay ?

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,958
Barry says " Hi."

78
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:58,232
So gimme a call as soon as
you can, okay ? I miss you.

79
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,762
- Call me, okay ? Bye.
- [ Laughing ]

80
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,278
- What's up, guys ?
- Not much.

81
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:09,543
- You ?
- Nothing. I was just
finishing my tape to Tiffany.

82
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:13,211
[Barry]
Hey, Mitch, what are you doin'?
Are you hungry ?

83
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,811
Huh ?

84
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:22,156
- Are you gonna feed him ?
- No, I'm checking the temperature
inside his cage.

85
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:26,597
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

86
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,699
Can I drop a mouse in ?

87
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,330
Sorry. Mitch only eats
once a week, on Saturdays.

88
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:37,001
Maybe we could cut
a mouse in half,

89
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:40,535
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

90
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:44,174
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now.

91
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,447
What time is it ?
Oh, shit !

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,045
Can you do me a favor ?
When this is done rewinding,

93
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:53,092
- will you drop it in the mail for me ?
- No problem. Just leave it there.

94
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,686
- Thanks, man. I'll see you guys later ?
- Bye.

95
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,527
- Can we please feed him now ?
- No.

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,659
If you overfeed him,
he could die.

97
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:05,432
So ? It'll be worth it.

98
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,943
-Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

99
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,103
- What's goin' on ?
- Not much.

100
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,113
- Where have you been ?
- Nowhere.

101
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:19,049
Just studying a lot. I'm starting
to question this whole college thing.

102
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,212
No one told me there was
gonna be this much reading.

103
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:24,313
- Right. [ Chuckles ]
- Yeah.

104
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,722
- Oh, you going to E.L.'s tonight ?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

105
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,921
[Josh]I gotta run.
Class started five minutes ago.

106
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:34,865
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry. Tonight.

107
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,469
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it ?

108
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:46,342
- It's none of your business, Jacob.
- I can just tell you like him.

109
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:49,313
-I'm not having this conversation again.
-What conversation ?

110
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:53,011
You need to stop this.
You and I, we're not a couple.

111
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,884
We've never been a couple,
and we will never be one.

112
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,716
[Professor]
This week I'd like you...

113
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:03,729
to think about Plato's dialogues
of the middle years,

114
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:08,757
i.e. The Republic,
Phaedo, Symposium.

115
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:13,465
Now, this will all be
on next week's midterm, so...

116
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,667
I suggest you read up on it.

117
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:20,509
Ah, Jacob,
Do you have anything to add ?

118
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:22,846
Just a reminder.

119
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,818
The midterm will cover all
of the in-class lectures...

120
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:30,720
as well as all
of the assigned readings.

121
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,318
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads. I prefer yellow.

122
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,863
It's easier on the eyes.

123
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,731
Okay. Okay ?
Yeah. Thank you,Jacob.

124
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:46,636
And... see you all
next week for the midterm.

125
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,340
-Josh.
- Yes ?

126
00:08:54,414 --> 00:09:00,011
I saw you hitting on Beth.
Not a good idea. She's spoken for.

127
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:04,523
-What ?
-She'll come back to me. They always do.

128
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:10,461
So, Mr. Parker. Do you intend
to be ready for this exam ?

129
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,626
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

130
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,999
Because I was looking
over the books last night,

131
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,131
and you need a "B" on this test
just to pass this class.

132
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:24,199
Actually, I double-checked that,
Professor. He needs a "B" plus.

133
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:28,577
- We're not gonna be able
to bend on this.
- Yeah, I got it.

134
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:33,050
-Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays and stuff.

135
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,679
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

136
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:39,418
I might lose my financial aid. I could
not be allowed back next semester.

137
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,723
Well, you're fucked then. You might
as well come to my party tonight.

138
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,355
Hook up with Beth, and at least
enjoy your last week at college.

139
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:48,764
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I made a commitment to Tiffany.

140
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,769
I'm invested
in this relationship.

141
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:54,705
Invested ? Who are you, Charles Schwab ?
Would you listen to yourself?

142
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,742
I would give my life...

143
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:00,711
for one evening of consensual sex
with that girl.

144
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,374
I've gone this long without cheating.
I think I can hold out.

145
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,886
You're already cheating !
Any time you pass up sex,
you're cheating on yourself.

146
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,047
Think about it.
You're in college.

147
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:12,318
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs...

148
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:16,954
and take advantage of young girls
is getting smaller by the day.

149

453
00:29:56,308 --> 00:29:58,299
I thought they broke up.

454
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:03,040
I mean, this girl who's
a friend of his. You know what I mean.

455
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,976
Where did he go ?

456
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,522
Austin ?

457
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,151
Austin, Massachusetts ?

458
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:19,026
You mean Boston,
Massachusetts ?

459
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:23,193
Yeah, that's what I said.
Boston.

460
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:26,328
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

461
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,506
He is such an asshole.

462
00:30:29,574 --> 00:30:32,771
I can't believe he just lied
to my face like that.

463
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:37,781
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that ?

464
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:41,751
-Wait, she was standing around topless ?
-Girls don't stand around naked.

465
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,189
Yeah, they do. Okay ? This is my story.
Do you wanna hear it or not ?

466
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:51,093
- It just doesn't make any--
- Shh. Please, no interruptions.

467
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:58,263
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked ! Really naked !

468
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,800
I know guys can be jerks.

469
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:06,970
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

470
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:10,378
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

471
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:12,678
All men are perverted pigs.

472
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,016
All they think about,
all they really care about, is sex.

473
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:18,885
You're so right.

474
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:22,085
- You should go to Boston
and bust his ass.
- Right ?

475
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,857
Confront him
and his little girl friend.

476
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,866

Baby, drivin' me crazy*

*I'm freakin' you, baby
Drivin' me crazy*

481
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:43,006
Kyle, come here for a second.

482
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,675
Look, we're a little short
on cash right now,

483
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,719
so we're gonna need
to put this on your credit card.

484
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:52,780
We'll give you the cash
when we get back. I promise.

485
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:59,389
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

486
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:02,399
Hello !
This is an emergency.

487
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:05,903
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt ?

488
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:09,065
*I'm freakin' you, baby
Drivin' me crazy*

00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,974
* When I get to your place*

*I wanna turn up the highs
and turn up the bass**

491
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:22,152
[Josh ] Well, I'd say
we're officially in no-man's-land.

492
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,211
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

493
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:28,589
This is gonna save us five hours
minimum. So thank me later, Josh, okay ?

494
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,855
Maybe we should turn around
and go back to the interstate.

495
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,592
- We're not goin' back.
- We're not goin' back.
Have some faith, Kyle.

496
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,066
It's supposed to be a challenge.
That's why they call it a shortcut.

497
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:40,263
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

498
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,433
[Josh ]
Damn it ! Fuck !

499
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,877
Yep, I give us about 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

500
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,883
What do we do now ?
If we turn around, we're gonna
lose five hours back tracking.

501
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:58,218
Turn around ? Why ?
Because of this ? We can make it.

502
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,158
Make it ?
You mean jump it ?

503
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:06,721
- No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.
-[Rubin] It can be done.

504
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,702
This incline is 30 degrees
roughly, right ?

505
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,900
Factory weight of the car is 1,600.
Add our weight plus cargo, 2,100 pounds.

506
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:19,307
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50 miles per hour,

507
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:22,642
our trajectory
will clear ten feet, easy.

508
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:24,579
No way. Absolutely not.

509
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,947
Kyle, we'll go 60
just to be certain.

510
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:29,851
[Kyle]
We're goin' back. This is impossible.

511
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,684
You sure ?

512
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:34,418
Of course I'm sure.
With physics I'm always sure. Yes.

513
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,324
I'm driving.

514
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,454
I don't think you guys heard me.

515
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,728
This is my car, and we're
not gonna be jumping over any rivers.

516
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:47,431
Kyle, it's ten feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

517
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,269
Look, I can spit across this gap.

518
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,283
- Yeah. Well, better make it 75.
- Okay.

519
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,328
- Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

520
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:14,491
No, you guys. No.
E.L., get out of my car.

521
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:17,558
Kyle, in the car.
Come on.

522
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:30,881
We're okay.

523
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,713
You know we need to hit 60,
right ?

524
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,487
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop !

525
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:47,329
[ Everyone Yelling ]

526
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:00,101
[ E.L. ]
Thank you ! Yes !

527
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,544
What did I tell you ?

528
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:21,331
Oh, my God.

529
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:25,495
Oh, my God !

530
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:31,101
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

531
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:36,478
I only said we'd make it across.
I never said anything
about the wheels staying on.

532
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,846
What the hell
are we gonna do now ?

533
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:41,249
I'm totally screwed !

534
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:45,551
I don't have time to be walking
through the woods right now.

535
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:49,150
Josh, we're gonna call a tow truck.
We'll have the axles fixed.

536
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:52,958
We'll probably lose halfa day.
It'll be fine. It's just the wheels !

537
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:15,619
[Beth] The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

538
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:19,282
they just turn around
and screw me over.

539
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:22,815
Just something about Josh.

540
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:26,853
He's just different.
I feel like we had a connection.

541
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:29,092
I don't think I'll ever
be able to trust a guy.

542
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:34,070
You shouldn't ! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was 1 985,

543
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:36,834
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

544
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:41,140
It was a regular-size van.
That was before they started
making that minivan crap.

545
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,682
So there's no hope, huh ?

546
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,345
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

548
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,021
You can keep that.

[ Kyle ]
God. Crap.

550
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:06,667
Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

551
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:09,571
We almost died
in that explosion.

552
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:14,943
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

553
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,505
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

554
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:23,476
I must live.

555
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:25,819
Yeah, right.
We all must live.

556
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,087
Before we do that, we must figure out
how to get back on the road.

557
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,620
[Josh ] We shouldn't
be going to sleep right now.

00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:04,426
I'm sorry,
do you need to get that ?

566
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,725
Do you need something ?

567
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:11,360
Yeah. This is sort
of an unusual question.

568
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,599
But do you have any marijuana
I might be able to buy from you ?

569
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:18,870
Our car exploded last night,
And I'm practically out of my own.

570
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:21,104
Am I a drug dealer ?

571
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:24,774
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking though.

572
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:29,047
No ? Okay, that's okay.
Thanks.

573
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,588
Is there anything else
I can help you with ?

574
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:34,386
Perhaps you'd like an 11 -year-old
prostitute sent to your room.

575
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,393
We can do that.

576
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,055
Or maybe we can off someone for you.
Huh ? How's that sound ?

577
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,827
I've got it.
Why don't we start small ?

578
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,801
Would you like a fresh towel ?

579
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,203
Maybe you could roll that up
and smoke it.

00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,344
By the way, Cheech.

582
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,869
That credit card you guys gave me
last night was maxed out.

00:38:56,948 --> 00:39:02,511
So don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

Um, Mr. Earl Edwards ?

I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

587
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:22,297
I ran it through three times, sir. It
keeps telling me you're over your limit.

I'd be happy to--
- Don't give me any attitude.

You go fix that
little toy back there,

to that friggin' card.
