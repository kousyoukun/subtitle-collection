1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
哈拉上路




2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,450
欢迎光临艾菲嘉大学


3
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,650
我今天带大家好好参观一下


4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,720
尽量带你们看看你们需要看的


5
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,630
这是学校的主校园


6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,390
你们将会适应这个地方

7
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,900
这是同学们聚会的地方

8
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,030
大家过来，靠近点儿

9
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,400
以前有人掉过队，知道吗？

10
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,570
落在后面被车撞了
11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,670
这不太好，这是…

12
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,910
这是乔瑟夫.H.尼尔逊图书馆

13
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,550
建于…十七世纪

14
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,350
十七世纪？这儿写着1951

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,900
那是地址，小聪明

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,970
那是心理系

17
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,030
你们都要自愿参加尖端的实验

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,770
很好玩的

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,580
到时记住穿宽松衫，别带金属

20
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,420
做好接受多次强电击的准备

21
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,620
他们现在正在注视我们

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,760
那边儿是英文系

23
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,600
你们大部分都说英语
我就不介绍了
24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,470
你在这儿多久了？
八年
25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,310
你看起来知道得不多
这是最差的一次参观
26
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,350
这是最差的学校
这里有过瘾的事儿吗？

27
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,280
有，当然有

28
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,840
这是世界上最有趣的大学

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,220
这是因为他没见过世面

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,350
笑吧，笑个够好了
31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,030
但实情是，最伟大的故事
就发生在这儿

32
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,660
知道吗？
33
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,870
是我认识的一个人
乔希帕克

34
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,000
以及他的女友v芬妮的故事
35
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,410
这是最有趣的旅途之一
36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,320
乔希和v芬妮青梅竹马

37
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,180
从小就在一起
38
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,250
他们总是一起做事

39
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,920
v芬妮十岁那年割扁桃体
40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,230
乔希在医院陪了她三天

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,290
他们是最要好的朋友
'They were best friends.

42
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,840
纯真的友情逐渐开花结果…
'What started out as friendship...

43
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,370
演变成接吻与爱抚
'blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,350
他们常常在一起
以致他俩的狗也开始约会了
'They spent so much time together
that even their dogs started dating.

45
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,610
他们似乎.注定一生都要在一起
'They seemed destined
to be together forever.

46
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,250
但高中毕业后
他们面临着最严峻的考验
'But after high school, they faced
the most challenging challenge ever -

47
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,690
海角天涯的关系
'a long-distance relationship.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,270
乔希进了美妙的艾菲嘉大学
'See, while Josh was enrolled here at
the wonderful University of Ithaca,

49
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,600
v芬妮去了德州
奥斯丁兽医学院
'Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

50
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,370
但他们盟誓要彼此忠诚
'But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,810
每日通电，不见异思迁
'to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship.'

52
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,450
他俩都没想到这实在是不容易
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them ever imagined.

53
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,620
v芬妮！嗨，宝贝儿
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

54
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,530
啊，上帝，你昨晚棒极了
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,860
你我从来也没这样过
你别逗了
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on!

56
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,770
真的，我今早要吃两粒避孕片
Seriously! I had to take
two birth control pills today.

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,460
今晚还来帮我复习功课吗？
You wanna help me study
again tonight?

58
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,630
不等今晚了，现在就来
Forget tonight. Come over now.

59
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,970
我们不去上课了
Let's blow this class off.

60
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,710
v芬妮和卡拉不在，请留言
'Tiffany and Carla can't come to the
phone but please leave a message.'

61
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,670
嗨，v，又是我…
- (Beep )
- Hey, Tif, it's me...again.

62
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,050
不知道你在哪儿
仍在设法与你联系
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still trying to get hold of you.

63
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,680
一切都好，我再与你联系
Everything's cool, though.
I'll catch you later.

64
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,850
打电话给我，好吗？再见
Call me back, OK? OK. Bye.

65
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,800
录像带寄出前我想加点儿东西
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video.

66
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,840
我好几天没跟你说话了…
I haven't talked to you
in a few days and...

67
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,770
我想你不喜欢我了，开玩笑
I'm thinking you don't like me...
I'm kidding.

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,670
嗨，伙计们
Hey, guys.

69
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,180
我开始有点担心
有空给我打电话
But I am getting a little worried so
gimme a call when you get a chance.

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,870
巴里问你好
Barry says hi.

71
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,010
一有空马上来电话，我想你
So gimme a call
as soon as you can. I miss you.

72
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,920
打电话来，好吗？再见
- Call me, OK? Bye.
- (Laughing)

73
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,180
你们在干什么？
没干什么，你呢？
- What's up, guys?
- Not much. You?

74
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,490
我在完成给v芬妮的录像带
I was just finishing my tape to Tif.

75
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,160
米切，你在干什么？饿吗？
(Barry ) Mitch, what are you doing?
Are you hungry? Huh?

76
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,070
你要喂它吗？
不，我在检查温度
- You gonna feed him?
- No, I'm checking the temperature.

77
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,410
米切需要华氏85度的恒温
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

78
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,610
我放进一只老鼠好不好？
Can I drop a mouse in?

79
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,240
米切每周只进一餐，在星期六
Mitch only eats once a week,
on Saturdays.

80
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,550
也许我们应该把老鼠剁开
Maybe we could cut a mouse in half,

81
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,490
现在喂一半，星期六喂一半
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

82
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,120
不，你不是有课吗？
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now?

83
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,290
几点了？啊，他妈的！
What time is it? Oh, shit!

84
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
帮我个忙－
这个倒好后替我寄了，好吗？
Do me a favour -
when this is rewound, mail it for me?

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,060
没问题，放那儿吧
谢谢
- No problem. Leave it there.
- Thanks, man.

86
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,610
回头见
再见
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

87
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,410
我们现在可以喂它吗？
Can we please feed him now?

88
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,570
不行，它吃得太多会死的
No. If you overfeed him he could die.

89
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,020
怎么啦？那也值得
So? It'll be worth it.

90
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,590
乔希，嗨
贝思，嗨
- Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

91
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,680
你怎么样？
还好
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,060
你去哪儿了
没去哪儿
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,000
读书，我开始怀疑大学教育了
Studying. I'm starting
to question this college thing.

94
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,160
要读那么多的书
There's so much reading.

95
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,170
你对
你是啊
- Right. (Chuckles )
- Yeah.

96
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,670
你今晚去EL的晚会吗？
去
- You going to EL's tonight?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,800
我得走了，我的课已经开始了
(Josh) I gotta run,
class has started.

98
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,810
晚上见
对不起
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry.

99
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,320
你看上他了，是不是？
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it?

100
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,850
不关你的事，雅各布
我可以看出来
- It's not your business, Jacob.
- I can tell.

101
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,830
我不想与你谈这个
谈什么？
- I'm not having this conversation.
- What conversation?

102
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,960
你别再这样了，我们不是一对
You need to stop this.
We're not a couple.

103
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,830
从来就不是，将来也不会是
We've never been a couple,
and never will.

104
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,030
这星期我想让你们想想
(Professor) This week
I'd like you to think about

105
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,870
柏拉图的中期对话文章
Plato's Dialogues
of the middle years.

106
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,710
“共和国”
“p尔多”，   “论文集”
"The Republic", "Phaedo",
"Symposium".

107
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,410
下周的期中考试要考这些
Now, this will all be
on next week's mid-term,

108
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,610
我建议你们好好复习一下儿
so I suggest you read up on it.

109
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,390
雅各布，你有什么要补充吗？
Ah, Jacob,
do you have anything to add?

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,030
提醒一下儿
Just a reminder.

111
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,760
期中考试包括所有的讲课内容
The mid-term will cover
all of the in-class lectures

112
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,200
还有所有要求阅读的材料
as well as
all of the assigned readings.

113
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,210
考试形式是写论文
大家带正规纸来
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads.

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,770
最好是黄色的，对眼睛有好处
I prefer yellow.
It's easier on the eyes.

115
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,540
好，好，谢谢你，雅各布
OK. OK? Yeah. Thank you, Jacob.

116
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,550
那…下星期考场见
And...see you all next week
for the mid-term.

117
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,190
乔希
嗯？
- Josh.
- Yes?

118
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,160
我看见你搞上贝思了，这不好
I saw you hitting on Beth.
NOT a good idea.

119
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,930
她说过
什么？
- She's spoken for.
- What?

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,400
她会回来找我，她们都是这样
She'll come back to me.
They always do.

121
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,500
啊…帕克先生
So... Mr Parker.

122
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,340
你打算好好准备考试吗？
Do you intend
to be ready for this exam?

123
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,740
是，先生
那你好好准备
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

124
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,150
因为昨晚我查看了成绩单
Because I was
looking over the books last night

125
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,950
你要拿到B才能通过
and you need a B on this test
just to pass this class.

126
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,120
实际上我又查了一遍，教授
Actually,
I double-checked that, Professor.

127
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,060
他得拿B+，不能讲情
He needs a B+.
We can't bend on this.

128
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,150
我知道了
I got it.

129
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,660
你抄别人的好了
你不行，因为是论文
- Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays.

130
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,530
如果这门不过
我平均成绩就完了
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,270
我可能会失去资助或勒令退学
I might lose my financial aid
or not be allowed back.

132
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,170
那么你就完蛋了
Well, you're fucked, then.

133
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,510
那来我的晚会，与贝思勾搭
愉快度过你最后一周
So come to my party, hook up
with Beth, and enjoy your last week.

134
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,570
我谁也不勾搭
我和v的关系是认真的
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I'm invested in this relationship.

135
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,920
认真的？你是谁？
查尔斯你思瓦波？听着！
Invested? Who are you, Charles
Schwab? Listen to yourself!

136
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,980
与贝思春宵一度
I would give my life...

137
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,550
我死也在所不惜…
for one evening
of consensual sex with that girl.

138
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,260
我与v这么久也没欺骗过
I've gone this long without cheating.

139
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,160
你已经在欺骗了
You're already cheating!

140
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,330
每次你拒绝做爱
你都是在欺骗自己
Any time you pass up sex
you cheat yourself.

141
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,560
想想饮酒吸毒的机会
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs

142
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,300
沾女朋友便宜的机会日益减少
and take advantage
of young girls is shrinking daily.

143
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,000
我得打个电话
I gotta make a call.

144
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,950
我告诉你，放弃这个机会
你会遗恨终身
I'm telling you, you pass this up,
it'll haunt you forever.

145
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,140
你的老二不会原谅你的
Your dick will never forgive you.

146
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,820
你说呢？你不想有新经验吗？
What do you think, man? Don't you
want to experience something new?

147
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,490
做乔希的老二不容易啊
(Squeaky voice )
It ain't easy being Josh's penis.

148
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,330
来了两个月了
我感觉没一点儿意思
We've been here two months,
and I feel like I'm in a coma.

149
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,990
别闹了
我希望我是你的老二，EL
- Stop it.
- I wish I was your dick, EL.

150
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,600
再没刺激事儿，我就离开你了
If something doesn't happen soon,
I'm gonna leave.

151
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,940
够了
喂？
- Enough.
- (Girl) 'Hello?'

152
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,880
卡拉，是乔希，抱歉
v芬妮在吗？
Carla, it's Josh. Sorry to bother
you, is Tiffany around?

153
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,950
v芬妮不在
Tiffany is not here.

154
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,040
她昨夜…又没回来睡觉
She didn't sleep here
last night...again.

155
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,780
如果你能停止每小时来电
那就太好了
And it would be great
if for one hour you didn't call.

156
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,580
好
如果她想跟你通话
- Right.
- If she wanted to talk to you

157
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,520
她就会给你打的
she'd call you.

158
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,620
你就看着办吧
Deal with it.

159
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,420
臭婊子！
她听起来撩人吗？
- You bitch!
- Does she sound hot?

160
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,960
我们从未这么长时间不说话
一定出事了
We've never gone this long
without talking. Something's wrong.

161
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,940
她另有新欢了，你也应该如此
She found someone else,
like you should.

162
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,140
时间在流逝，转眼你就
四十岁了，找姑娘要付钱的
The clock is ticking. Before you know
it you'll be 40 and paying for girls.

163
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,080
我应该警告你
I should really warn you,

164
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,520
这会影响你的判断力
it's been known to affect
your decision-making abilities

165
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,690
降低你的抑制力
and lower your inhibitions.

166
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,920
好，这正是我之所求
Good. That's the plan.

167
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,730
不，那…正是所求
No, that-that's...
Yes, that is the plan.

168
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,600
你有现金吗？
干什么？
- You bring cash?
- Why?

169
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,100
我们有美女要出售
什么？
- We've got chicks for sale.
- What?

170
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,510
相信我，我在这学校呆了七年
Trust me. I've been goin'
to this school seven years

171
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,520
我知道全面大学教育的关键…
and I know the key
to a well-rounded college education

172
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,850
必须有试验精神
is experimentation.

173
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,350
我来示范
Let me show you.

174
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,250
这是拍卖，记住…
This is an auction. Remember...

175
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,850
你不是在买姑娘
you are not buying the girl,

176
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,230
只是买陪伴
买卖不包括与她上床
only her company, and sale does not
constitute sexual relations.

177
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,170
我知道，相信我，我试过
(EL) I know. Believe me, I've tried.

178
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,500
那就闲话少说，首先介绍…
Without further ado,
let's introduce our first...person.

179
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,570
劳拉！
- Laura!

180
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,550

00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,710
喜欢户外活动和吃海鲜
She likes the outdoors
and loves seafood.

182

你好，拍卖从五元开始

- OK, let's start the bidding at $5!
- $3.50!

183
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,190
天啊，钱袋们
她不是麦当劳的儿童餐
Good God, moneybags,
she's not a Happy Meal.

184
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,520

187
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,100

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,870
卖给…队长了
Sold...to the captain.

189
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,210
你在这儿
There you are.

190
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,750
嗨，你在干什么？
没干什么
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not much.

191
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,910
你你真漂亮
你谢谢

192
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,850
别客气
You're welcome.

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,380
听着，雅克布来了
他是个疯子
Listen, Jacob's here,
and he's a total psycho...

194
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,950
你可以叫赢他吗？
Can you go outbid him?

195
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,260
但我没带那么多钱
You know what,
I didn't bring that much money.

196
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,820
你不明白，他迷上我了
You don't understand. He's obsessed.

197
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,100
这很有趣，对吧？
See? That's fun, right?

198
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,700
好，现在我要你们互吻对方
OK, OK. Now, I want you two
to kiss each other.

199
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,140
有人见到贝思了吗？她在那儿
All right, has anyone seen Beth?
There she is!

200
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,540
贝思，对大家打个招呼
嗨
- (Cheering)

201
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,720

210

你听到我高声叫喊三十块
You heard me.
I bid $30 loud and clear.

213
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,590
你的不算
Your bid didn't count.

214
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,760
为什么？
因为你是助教
- Why?
- Because you're a TA.

215
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,360
怎样啦？
这是学生的拍卖
- So?
- This auction is for students.

216
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,170
再见
Goodbye.

217
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,320
谢谢你，我欠你一个
Thanks for doing that. I owe you one.

218
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,650
欠我何止一个
是吗？
- You owe me more than one.
- Do I?

219
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,290
严格地说
Technically.

220
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,300
那…
Well...

221
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,830
你准备好提货了吗？
are you ready to collect?

222
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,600
对，准备好了
I think so. Yeah.

223
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,970
我们互相抚摸
We're touching.

224
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,170
非常有趣
It's a lot of fun. (Chuckles )

225
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,010
我们很开心
- We're having a good time.
- (Chuckles )

226
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,330
我想你爱你的v芬妮
(Romantic music)

227
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,330
v芬妮是谁？
Who's Tiffany Henderson?

228
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,010
我五岁开始约会的女孩
Just some girl I used to date
since I was, like, five.

229
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,570
现在散了，她蹬了我
But that's over now. She blew me off.

230
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,710
啊，可怜的孩子
Oh, poor baby.

231
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,410
你一定很难过
You must be very hurt.

232
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,580
你需要特别的照顾吗？
Do you need some special attention?

233
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,420
的确，我很难过
Well, I am pretty upset.

234
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,570
这样会好点儿吗？
Did that help?

235
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,630
好多了
That helped a lot.

236
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,880
我有个主意
I have an idea.

237
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,080
你说呢？
What do you say?

238
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,320
嗯，这不太好
Uh, I don't think so.

239
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,520
来！会很好玩
Come on! It'll be fun.

240
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,160
你我一直想试这个
你不…
- I've always wanted to try this.
- No...

241
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,830
来
Yes.

242
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,430
我来采访你
I'm gonna interview you.

243
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,240
可以
Fine.

244
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,280
好
OK.

245
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,680
你好，乔希
你好
- OK, Josh.
- Yes.

246
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,760
你喜欢什么样的女孩子？
What do you look for in a girl?

247
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,530
嗯，让我想想
Um, well, let's see.

248
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,860
她应当精明有趣…
She should be smart and funny and...

249
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,830
这也很不错
That's good, too.

250
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,580
现在觉得好点了吗？
Do you feel better yet?

251
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,550
好一点儿了，对，一点点儿
I feel a little bit better.
Yeah. A little...

252
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,050
你还喜欢什么？
What else do you look for?

253
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,020
她要漂亮…
She should be attractive and...

254
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,650
温柔…
nice and...

255
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,020
无上装，无上装
Topless. And topless.

256
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,530
还要吻我
And she should kiss me.

257
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,340
还有呢？
What else?

258
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,980
她不应该停止吻我
She shouldn't stop kissing me.

259
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,480
你为什么停下来？
Why don't you keep doing that?

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,560
小小三文鱼在溪中游动
# Tiny salmon swimming in a stream

261
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,570
小小三文鱼有非份之想
# Tiny salmon
chasing that impossible dream

262
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,440
八哥鸟说
# The mynah bird says

263
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,450
黑猩猩说
# The chimpanzee says

264
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,190
猫头鹰朋友说
# The friendly owl says

265
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,060
但三文鱼只会说
# But the salmon can only say

266
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,480
好可怜啊
# And it's sad #

267
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,310
早安，各位
# Good morning, everyone.

268
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,820
早安，各位
# Good morning, everyone.

269
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,420
你好，你好，你好？
# How are you and you and you #

270
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,550
你为什么这么高兴？
What are you so happy about?

271
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,930
不知道，今早我像高兴吗？
I don't know.
Do I seem happy this morning?

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,300
对，你在这儿跳来跳去
Well, you're bouncing around here.

273
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,070
你确实看起来特别开心
You do seem
unusually light-hearted.

274
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,070
可能是昨夜
我度过了一生最好的夜晚
Maybe it's because I had
the best time of my life last night.

275
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,200
两次！今早又干了一次
Twice! And once this morning.

276
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,370
你和贝思？
You and Beth?

277
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,510
你啊，对
你住嘴，发生了什么事？
- Oh, yeah.
- Shut up. What happened?

278
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,090
不可能！你在撒谎
No way! You're lying.

279
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,450
我没有撒谎
I'm not lying.

280
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,220
你不能只应付了人家
可假装上了床
You can't make out with someone
then pretend you had sex.

281
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,920
你这不够潇洒
你我没有撒谎
- That's really uncool.
- I'm not pretending.

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,400
算了吧，我知道你在撒谎
我敢肯定
Forget it. I know you're lying.
I guarantee it.

283
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,830
要打赌吗？
You wanna bet?

284
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,500
好，我打赌，你没有证据
Great. I'm gonna bet
on something you can't prove.

285
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,170
你录下来了！
You videotaped it!

286
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,450
不，我没有，给我！给我！
No, no, no, I didn't!
Gimme that! Gimme that!

287
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,350
你不给，这太棒了
你我在开玩笑！
- No way! This is amazing!
- I was kidding, I was kidding!

288
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,620
把录像带给我
嗯？来吧
- Gimme the tape.
- Huh? Come on.

289
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,750
我们迟早会看到的
他说得对
- We're gonna see it sooner or later.
- He's got a point.

290
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,290
不，不，不！
Oh-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no!

291
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,030
给我，不，把它给我
Give it to me. No, give it to me.

292
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,270
-EL，不
乔希，别，我们需要它
- EL, no.
- Josh, please? We need this.

293
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,040
好，听着，你们别告诉其他人
OK, listen, seriously.
You can't tell anyone you saw this.

294
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,620
啊，好
Oh, yeah.

295
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,350
行，行！
OK. OK!

296
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,450
巴里，拉上窗帘
Barry, hit the lights.

297
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,420
是娱乐的时间了
It's boner time!

298
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,200
v，这是我从艾菲嘉直播
'Hey, Tif. It's me
coming to you live from Ithaca.'

299
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,710
我不是叫你昨天寄出了吗？
I thought I asked you
to mail this yesterday?

300
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,140
对，你说了，我今天寄出了
Yeah, you did. I mailed it today.

301
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,770
快速进到精彩部份
Fast-forward to the horny stuff.

302
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,750
你把这个寄给v芬妮了吗？
Is this the shit
you've been sending Tiffany?

303
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,090
啊，上帝
Oh, my God.

304
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,420
是你…
# It's you... #

305
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,690
啊，他妈的！
Oh, fuck!

306
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,460
啊，上帝，不，不，不
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

307
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,590
啊，上帝！
Oh, God!

308
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,070
等一等
W-wait a second.

309
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,230
你把贝思的带子寄给v芬妮了
Tell me you mailed
the Beth tape to Tiffany.

310
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,240
是啊！
Yes!

311
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,580
混蛋！啊！不，不！
Shit! Oh, no! Oh, no!

312
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,120
嗨，嗨
Hey, hey.

313
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,220
你有没有复制盘？
Did you make a copy?

314
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,090
有的话，我们可以看看
If you made a copy,
we could watch the copy.

315
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,590
别接！
Don't answer it!

316
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,860
嗨，这是乔希和鲁宾，请留言
(Answer machine ) 'Hey, it's
Josh and Rubin. Leave a message.'

317
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,130
嗨！乔希，这是v芬妮
'Hi, Josh. It's Tiffany.

318
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,330
抱歉没跟你通话
'Sorry we haven't spoken.

319
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,170
我外公去世了
'Listen, my grandfather passed away.

320
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,140
我打过几次电话了，都没人接
'I've tried calling you
a few times, but no one picked up.

321
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,770
我不想留这样的言给你
'I didn't want to leave
this message on your machine

322
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,370
但现在你可能会着急了…
'but by now you're probably
a little worried so...

323
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,920
现在我在家里帮助我妈
'Anyway, I'm at my parents'
house helping my mom.

324
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,690
她很伤心
'She's really a wreck.

325
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,850
如果联系不上
我星期一再来电话
'If I don't speak with you,
I'll call Monday.

326
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,800
我没事儿，只需要点儿时间
'I'll be OK. I just need some time.

327
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,700
再见，我爱你
'Bye. I love you.'

328
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,630
这不公平
That's not fair.

329
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,070
她有带子看而我们却看不到
How come she gets to see the tape
and we don't?

330
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,770
她星期一回校
我有三天的时间赶去
She gets back there Monday.
That leaves three days to get there.

331
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,280
去哪儿？奥斯丁？
Get where? Austin?

332
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,750
你到那儿有一万英里
你一千八百
- That's like 10,000 miles from here.
- 1,800.

333
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,420
三天赶一千八百英里？飞吧
You wanna drive 1,800 miles
in three days? Just fly.

334
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,260
你有钱买机票吗？我没有
Do you have money for a ticket?
I don't.

335
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,690
那好，我们开车
你去吗？
- All right, so we're driving.
- You're coming?

336
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,130
我留下来干什么？学习？
What else am I gonna do,
stay here and learn?

337
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,860
开车上路
Road trip.

338
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,100
等等，等一下儿
(Behind door) Just a minute. Hold on.

339
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,010
他可能在自渎
He's probably jackin' off.

340
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,020
你们想干什么？
What do you guys want?

341
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,860
凯尔，这是紧急情况
Kyle, this is an emergency.

342
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,260
等等，至少让我回去
打电话给我爸爸
Wait. Let me at least
go back and call my dad.

343
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,790
打电话给你爸爸？
你自己没主见？
Call your dad?
Would you listen to yourself?

344
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,330
你十九岁了！
怎么还他妈的娘娘腔？
You're 19 years old,
and you're a fucking sissy.

345
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,740
只知道坐在图书馆猜迷
All you ever do is sit
in a library and play Myst.

346
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,780
这真可怜
It's pathetic.

347
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,070
他是说这是你做大事的好机会
He's trying to say that
this is your chance to do something.

348
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,150
去冒险吧，跟我们一起去
Be a risk-taker. Come with us.

349
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,010
你们这样说，不过是要我的车
You're just saying that
because you want my car.

350
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,580
不，我们一直都很喜欢你
No! No, we've always liked you.

351
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,150
或把车借给我们，这也是冒险
Or just give us the car.
That would make him a risk-taker.

352
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,530
闭嘴，行吗？他也一起去
Shut up, all right?
He's coming with us.

353
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,300
来呀，凯尔，会非常好玩
Come on, Kyle. It'll be fun!

354
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,430
你不想知道我们去哪儿吗？
Aren't you even curious
where we're going?

355
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,410
不想
No.

356
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,980
我们去奥斯丁大学
你不想去吗？
OK, we're going to the University
of Austin. Sure you won't come?

357
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,580
我不喜欢麻省
I don't like Massachusetts.

358
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,380
奥斯丁在德州，波士顿在麻省
Austin's in Texas.
You're thinking of Boston.

359
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,250
你从未离开这个城市，对吧？
You've never left this town,
have you?

360
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,380
没有
No, not really.

361
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,520
这样会憋出恐惧症的
That could turn
into a debilitating phobia.

362
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,220
好吧
OK.

363
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,300
我可以喂米切吗？
是的，你当然可以
- Can I feed Mitch?
- Yes, actually you can.

364
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,170
笼子旁边有个装老鼠的灰盒子
There's a brown box of mice
by his cage.

365
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,570
明天给它一只，就一只
Give him one tomorrow. Just one.

366
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,540
我明天喂它一只老鼠
好
- I'll feed him a mouse tomorrow.
- OK.

367
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,340
你可以信任我，我很可靠
You can count on me.
OK? I'm reliable. OK?

368
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,990
你们一路顺风，安全愉快
You guys do good.
Have a good trip, safe trip.

369
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,610
扣好安全带，我明天喂蛇
Buckle up your seat belt.
I'm gonna feed the snake!

370
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,920
我明天喂蛇，照顾蛇
I'll feed the snake,
I'll watch the snake.

371
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,890
这样他们就出发了
(Barry ) 'So off they went.'

372
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,800
三日里要赶一千八百英里
They had 1,800 miles to go,
and only three days to do it.

373
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,360
这是个疲劳的旅程
彻底改变了他们的一生
It was a killer journey and one
that changed them all forever.

374
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,430
完了
The end.

375
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,500
你我们到那儿看看
你哇，就这些？这故事真混帐
- So we're gonna go look over here.
- Whoa. That's it? This story sucks.

376
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,780
录相带怎么样了？
啊，录像带
- What happened with the tape?
- Right. The tape.

377
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,720
唔…
Well, um...

378
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,060
就像我说的，他们与时间赛跑
Well... Like I said,
they were on a race against time.

379
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,110
星期五下午1:08纽约州界
# The smoke stack spitting black soot
into the sooty sky

380
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,050
我们没看到带子
Since we didn't get to see the tape,

381
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,750
你说给我们听听，好吗？
你不
- can you at least describe it?
- No.

382
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,900
至少承认贝思很出色
Admit that Beth is amazing.

383
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,940
我承认，她很出色，很完美
I admit it, she's amazing.
She's perfect.

384
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,770
不知道你为何内疚
严格地讲，这不算欺骗
I don't know why you feel so guilty.
Technically you haven't cheated.

385
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,900
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

386
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,780
男人关于欺骗的理解
There are these rules that guys have,

387
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,510
有他们自己的规矩
an understanding
as to what constitutes cheating.

388
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,420
就拿你的情况来说吧
Take your situation, for example.

389
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,480
这不算欺骗
It's not cheating.

390
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,150
因为你在另一个地区－
更别说另一个州了
Not when you're in a different
area code - not to mention state!

391
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,200
这毫无道理
That makes no sense.

392
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,430
别看着我，规矩不是我定的
Don't look at me, Kyle.
I don't make the rules.

393
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,030
这是正常的，我看过一篇文章
This is legit. I've read an article.

394
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,470
这些规矩多的是，都是歪理
There's a whole bunch of them,
like loopholes.

395
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,170
比如说一脚踏两只船
Say you were sleeping with
two girls at the same time,

396
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,910
这不是欺骗
因为她们互相抵消了
it's not cheating
because they cancel each other out.

397
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,740
千真万确
- Ahh.
- Exactly!

398
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,680
或者你太笨了记不住
Or if you're too wasted
to remember...

399
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,650
这也不算欺骗
It is not cheating.

400
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,550
既然真的忘了
Because if you
can't really remember it,

401
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,560
那就是没真正发生过
it never really took place.

402
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,060
我也有个比如，准备好了吗？
OK, I've got one. Ready?

403
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,970
在你的尻丸上涂上花生酱
It's OK if you spread peanut butter
on your testicles

404
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,530
让你的狗去舔也没什么
and let your dog lick it off.

405
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,830
因为那是你的狗
上帝！
- Because it's your dog!
- Jesus Christ!

406
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,170
因为狗是你的
我们知道了
- You know, because it's your dog!
- We got it.

407
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,160
明天有人就要死了
Somebody's gonna die tomorrow.

408
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,100
对，你们中的一个要死了
That's right.
One of you is marked for death.

409
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,070
明天一大清早
And first thing tomorrow morning,

410
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,540
你们中的一个
a chosen one
will experience nature's wrath

411
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,670
将受到大自然愤怒的惩罚
in all its fury.

412
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,920
你是谁？
Who are you?

413
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,760
贝思
I'm Beth.

414
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,800
你来看喂蛇？
Are you here for the feeding?

415
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,770
对不起
Excuse me?

416
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,930
你来早了，明天才喂
You're early. It's not till tomorrow.

417
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,970
你应该来看
You should come back.

418
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,310
那将血流成河
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

419
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,380
我想免了吧
I think I'll pass.

420
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,410
你见过乔希了吗？
Have you seen Josh?

421
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,580
他去看他女朋友了
He went to visit his girlfriend.

422
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,680
v芬妮？
Tiffany?

423
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,210
我以为他们散了呢
I thought they broke up.

424
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,960
我是说这个女的是他朋友
你明白我的意思
I mean this girl who's a friend
of his. You know what I mean.

425
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,900
他去哪儿了？
Where did he go?

426
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,300
奥斯丁
Austin?

427
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,470
麻省的奥斯丁
Austin, Massachusetts?

428
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,870
你是说麻省的波士顿？
You mean Boston, Massachusetts?

429
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,040
对，我说的是波士顿
Yeah, that's what I said. Boston.

430
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,250
麻省的波士顿大学
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

431
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,150
他真是个混蛋
He is such an asshole.

432
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,620
他竟然当着我的面撒谎
I can't believe
he just lied to my face like that.

433
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,650
我还以为他喜欢我呢
他怎么能这样做？
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that?

434
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,630
她光着上身？
女孩子不会脱光的
- She was topless?
- Girls don't stand around naked.

435
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,140
她们会的，这是我的故事
你们到底听不听？
Yeah, they do. OK? This is my story.
You wanna hear it or not?

436
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,940
这不…
嘘，别打叉，好吗？
- It just doesn't make any...
- Shh. Please, no interruptions, OK?

437
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,350
因此另一个女孩走来，很刺激
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked! Really naked!

438
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,820
裸体！完全光着！

439
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,610
我知道男人会很坏
I know guys can be jerks.

440
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:07,590
但我以为乔希不同，我喜欢他
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

441
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,460
亲爱的，听我说，他们都一样
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

442
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,460
男人都是变态的猪
All men are perverted pigs.

443
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,530
他们真正关心的…
脑子里想的只有性
All they care about...
really, all they THINK about is sex.

444
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,630
你一点不错，我感到被利用了
你面对它吧，我们都一样
- You're so right. I feel so used.
- Face it, we're all used.

445
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,080
在大部分男人的眼里
我们只是肉体
In most men's eyes, we're just flesh.

446
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,110
真恶心！
是恶心，想一想
- It's so sick!
- It IS sick. Think about it.

447
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,240
如果他们那样…
If they had it their way...

448
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,550
我甚至不愿去想会发生什么
God, I don't even want to know
what would happen

449
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,050
如果他们那样去做！
if they had it their way!

450
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,220
他走了，我该怎么办？
(Beth) What am I supposed to do
now that he's gone?

451
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,290
你该去波士顿揍他屁股
对
- Go to Boston and bust his ass.
- Right.

452
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,190
面对他和他的女朋友
Confront him
and his little girlfriend.

453
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,320
面对他们，你应当面对他们
Face to face. You totally should!

454
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,630
告诉她乔希是个混蛋，对吧？
Show her what an asshole Josh is,
right?

455
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,680
这个，也是
Ooh! These, too.

456
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,420
凯尔，过来一下儿
Kyle, come here for a second.

457
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,320
我们的现金不够
We're a little
short on cash right now,

458
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,330
要借用一下儿你的信用卡
so we need to put this
on your credit card.

459
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,340
我保证回校后还你钱
We'll give you the cash
when we get back, I promise.

460
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,200
不行，那是我爸爸的
是应急用的
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

461
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,910
嗨，现在就是应急啊
Hello! This IS an emergency.

462
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,140
我们需要这些东西
你要我们睡大街上？
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt?

463
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,190
我们在一个无人之地
(Josh) We're in no-man's-land.

464
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,000
在这条路上跑了一个多小时
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

465
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,100
这起码能节省我们五个小时
This is gonna save us five hours,
minimum. Thank me later.

466
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,670
我们应当回到大路去
We should go back to the interstate.

467
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,040
我们不回头
对，相信我
- We're not goin' back.
- Yeah, have some faith.

468
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,310
这是挑战，所以叫捷径
It's a challenge.
That's why it's a short cut.

469
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,010
如果容易就叫大路了
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

470
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,210
该死！他妈的！
(Josh) Damn it! Fuck!

471
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,660
我想二十分钟后
有人就会来鸡奸我们
I give us 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

472
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,590
如果掉头会失去五个小时
If we turn around we'll lose
five hours backtracking.

473
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,000
掉头？就因为这个？
我们可以解决
Turn around? Why? Because of this?
We could make it.

474
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,900
解决？你是说跳过去？
Make it? You mean jump it?

475
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,370
不，绝对不行，我们掉头
No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.

476
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,850
可以成功的
这个斜度大概是三十度
It can be done. This incline
is 30 degrees roughly, right?

477
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,920
车身重一千六百磅
The factory weight
of the car is 1,600lbs.

478
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,650
加上我们和行李…
Add us, plus cargo...

479
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,090
不，不
如果车时速为五十英里
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50mph,

480
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,420
弹道很容易超过十英尺
our trajectory
will clear 10 feet, easy.

481
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,320
不行，绝对不行
No way. Absolutely not.

482
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,690
为保险起见，我们开六十英里
We'll go 60 just to be certain.

483
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,630
我们掉头吧，这没门儿
(Kyle ) We're goin' back.
It's impossible.

484
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,460
你肯定能行？
You sure?

485
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,160
当然，物理我在行
With physics I'm always sure.

486
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,100
我来开车
I'm driving.

487
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,270
我想你们没听到我的话
I don't think you guys heard me.

488
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,870
这是我的车，我们不跳河
This is my car
and we're not gonna jump any rivers.

489
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,210
凯尔，才十英尺
高尔夫球车也能跳过
Kyle, it's 10 feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

490
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,750
瞧，我都可以吐口水过去
Look, I can spit across this gap.

491
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,330
好
Yeah.

492
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,930
我们…
Well...

493
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,060
还是开七十五吧
better make it 75.

494
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,370
来，我们冲
凯尔，相信我，这是科学
- OK. Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

495
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,210
不，你们不能，EL，你出来
No, you guys. No.
EL, get out of my car.

496
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,310
凯尔，进来，快点儿
Kyle, in the car. Come on.

497
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,650
准备好了
We're OK.

498
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,630
要开六十英里，知道吗？
You know we need to hit 60?

499
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,260
你我正在努力，这车不行
你停下！
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop!

500
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,880
谢谢你！好！
(EL) Thank you! Yes!

501
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,320
我早就说过了
What did I tell you?

502
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,600
啊，上帝！
Oh, my God.

503
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,810
啊，上帝！
Oh, my God!

504
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,880
我爸爸知道了，一定会杀了我
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

505
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,290
我只说过我们可以跳过去
I only said we'd make it across.

506
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,290
没说过车轮会没事儿
I never said
the wheels would stay on.

507
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,730
我们现在怎么办？
What the hell are we gonna do now?!

508
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,960
我完了
I'm totally screwed!

509
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,330
我没有时间…走出…树林
I don't have time...
to be walking...through the woods!

510
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,200
我们叫拖车来，把轴修好
Josh, we'll call a tow truck,
have the axles fixed.

511
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,870
不过是车轮，最多半天便修好
We'll lose half a day at most.
It's just the wheels.

512
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,420
每当我对某人产生感情时
(Beth) The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

513
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,300
他们都会掉头来伤害我
they just turn around
and screw me over.

514
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,300
但乔希不同，他很特别
Just something about Josh,
he's just different.

515
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,530
我觉得我们有感应
I feel like we had a connection.

516
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,740
我想我再也不信任男人了
I don't think
I'll ever be able to trust a guy.

517
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,750
对，不要信
我最后一次信任男人是1985年
You shouldn't! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was back in 1985

518
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,620
他开着我的车跟我妹妹跑了
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

519
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,920
那是个大车，不像这个小破车
It was a regular-size van.
Before that mini-van crap.

520
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,520
那么没希望了，嗯？
So there's no hope, huh?

521
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,050
啊，有，但是电动的
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

522
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,500
你留着用吧
You can keep that.

523
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,970
天呀
(Kyle ) God. Crap.

524
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,450
大家听着，我们得小心点儿
(EL) Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

525
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,310
刚才差点没命了
We almost died in that explosion.

526
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,190
你我倒希望我死了
你不是开玩笑，我不能早逝
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

527
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,250
我有种感觉，人类将需要我
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

528
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,530
我必须活下去
I must live.

529
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,460
对，我们都要活下去
Yeah, right. We all must live.

530
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,900
但首先我们必须回到大路上
Before we do that,
we must get back on the road.

531
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,340
我们不应该现在睡觉
(Josh) We shouldn't be going
to sleep right now!

532
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,770
在这儿，那儿都处理一下…
'Let's just lay
an indication here and there.'

533
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,250
涂上各种颜色…
(TV) 'And a whole bunch of colour...'

534
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,460
对不起
Excuse me.

535
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,200
抱歉，你不要接电话吗？
I'm sorry, do you need to get that?

536
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,470
你有什么事儿吗？
Do you need something?

537
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,050
对，这是个特殊的问题
Yeah.
This is sort of an unusual question.

538
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,380
你有大麻卖点儿给我吗？
But do you have any marijuana
I might buy?

539
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,510
昨晚我们的车炸了
我一点儿都没有了
Our car exploded last night
and I'm practically all out.

540
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,750
我像个毒贩子吗？
Am I a drug dealer?

541
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,550
不，我不是，谢谢你问我
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking, though.

542
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,560
没有，那好，谢谢
No? OK, that's OK. Thanks.

543
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,360
你还需要别的吗？
Is there anything else
I can help with?

544
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,960
比如要一个十一岁的妓
我们可以帮助
Perhaps you'd like an 11-year-old
prostitute. We can do that.

545
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,800
或者帮你杀掉谁，嗯？
Or maybe we can off someone
for you. Huh?

546
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,570
我明白了，我们该从小事做起
I've got it.
Why don't we start small?

547
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,170
想要条新毛巾吗？
Would you like a fresh towel?

548
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,720
你可以起来吸
You could roll that up and smoke it.

549
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,980
鬼
Dick.

550
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,150
还有，小伙子
By the way, Cheech,

551
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,560
你们那张信用卡超额了
that credit card
you guys gave me was maxed out,

552
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,790
别把钱都花在毒品和枪枝上
so don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

553
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,370
厄尔你爱德华先生？
Um, Mr Earl Edwards?

554
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,500
对不起，先生，你的卡超额了
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

555
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,940
不会的，你拿回去再试一次
That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

556
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,850
我试过三次了
如果你还有另一个卡，我…
I tried three times, sir. If you
have another card, I'd be happy to...

557
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,950
别装腔作势
Don't give me any attitude.

558
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,960
你去把那鬼机器好好修修
You go fix
that little toy back there,

559
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,080
把账记在卡上
and charge this friggin' card.

560
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,630
我们是这里二十年的顾客了
We've been coming here for 20 years.

561
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,190
我们才开张了八年
马上去做
- We've only been open eight years.
- Do it now.

562
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,440
别紧张，没什么大不了的
(EL) Relax, it's not a big deal.

563
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,940
你不明白，乔希知道会发疯的
(Rubin ) You don't understand,
when Josh finds out he'll freak.

564
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,980
没有信用卡不能租车
You can't rent a car without
a credit card. You just can't.

565
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,480
那么，我们怎么办？
So, what are we gonna do?

566
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,620
这样吧，你呆在这儿
Tell you what. Stay here.

567
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,620
带他去吃早餐或什么的
Take him out
for breakfast or something.

568
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,820
那事儿包在我身上
I'll go take care of this.

569
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:40,560
厄尔，库克，出了点儿事
你们保持静
Earl, Cookie, we have a situation.
Now, brace yourselves.

570
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,090
警方在宾州贝德佛
找到了凯尔的车
The police have found Kyle's car
abandoned in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

571
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,640
车炸成了碎片
It's been blown to bits.

572
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,440
我们问过他的学校了－
他失踪了
We checked with the university -
he's missing.

573
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,140
上帝啊
Mother of God.

574
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,290
你早上好
你嗨
- (Woman ) Good morning.
- Hello.

575
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,530
嗨，你有什么事儿吗？
Hi. How can I help you?

576
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,640
嗨，我是派来检查111巴士的
Yeah, hi. I was sent over here
to check out bus 111,

577
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,540
恐怕情况不妙
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

578
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,700
旋转片…出现了问题
You seem to be having problems
with the...rotator splint.

579
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,980
引擎有旋转片吗？
Engines have rotator splints?

580
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,740
有
Yeah.

581
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,820
车现在没事，但很快就不行了
She runs good now, but not for long.

582
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,150
我可以一周后修好送回来
I can have it back to you
as good as new in a week.

583
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,190
让我看看，贾德还在阿城
Let's see.
Well, Jared's still in Aliquippa,

584
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,320
他在那儿给你打的电话？
对
- I take it he called you from there?
- Yeah.

585
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,100
五天吧，五天应该没问题
Five days.
Well, I think we can work that out.

586
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,640
你别喂我的狗好吗？
Would you please not feed my dog?

587
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,240
我没喂
I didn't.

588
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,370
你不能喂向导狗
You can't feed
Seeing Eye dogs treats.

589
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,280
你不骚扰它我会很感激的
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

590
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,820
别对我瞪眼
Don't roll your eyes at me.

591
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,870
油炸面包
French toast.

592
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,340
咸肉，好东西
Bacon. Good for you.

593
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,670
你还有炒蛋
你谢谢
- And scrambled eggs.
- Thank you.

594
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,240
对不起，这上面有糖
我点的是无糖的
Excuse me, but this has powdered
sugar on it, and I ordered no sugar.

595
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,320
我早上不能吃太多的糖
I can't have
too much sugar in the morning.

596
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,680
噢，对不起，你说得真对
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're absolutely right.

597
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,620
这样吧，我拿回去
再给你换新的
Tell you what, let me take this back
and bring you out a new piece.

598
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,160
没问题吧？好，太好了
Is everybody good? OK, great.

599
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,030
谁看到我的书了？我找不…
Do you know where my possessions are,
because I can't...

600
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,470
等等，不，在车上
那…太好笑了
- Wait, no. They were in the car.
- That's...that's hilarious.

601
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,660
好，我给你加点儿
All right,
let me warm that up for you.

602
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,820
你给你
你谢谢
- There you go.
- Thanks.

603
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,970
对不起，油炸面包马上就来
Excuse me. And the French toast
will be out in just a minute.

604
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,730
好，谢谢
好，太好了
- OK, thank you.
- OK, great.

605
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,130
油炸面包，无糖的
French toast, no sugar.

606
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,560
你行吗？真是对不起
你没关系
- All right? Sorry about that.
- No problem.

607
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,420
他真是个好人
That's a nice guy.

608
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,270
很好吃
It's good.

609
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,030
我不想知道你是怎样弄来的
I don't wanna know
how you got this.

610
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,830
从盲妞儿那儿偷来的
我不想知道
- I stole it from a blind chick.
- I don't wanna know.

611
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,770
什么，我会还给她的
What? I'm gonna give it back.

612
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,770
或许吧
Probably.

613
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,920
请马上停车好吗？我要上厕所
Can we please stop soon?
I need to use the bathroom.

614
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,890
我不急着上，再等两个小时吧
Actually, I don't have to go yet,
so we'll stop in a couple of hours.

615
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,660
我开玩笑，凯尔，我们停车
I'm kidding, Kyle. We'll stop.

616
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,700
老天，你要维护自己的权利
坚定点儿
Jeez, you have to stand up
for yourself. Be more assertive.

617
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,900
对
OK.

618
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,770
你怎么会这样？你怕什么？
What's your deal?
Why are you so worried?

619
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,640
我不知道，可能是我爸爸
I don't know. I guess it's my dad.

620
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,870
他…他很严厉
He's, like...strict.

621
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,710
他发现了车子的事
一定不会饶过我的
He really is gonna kill me
when he finds out about that car.

622
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,150
你搞砸了，妙极了
谁都会出错
So you screwed up. Big deal.
People make mistakes.

623
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,920
他会接受事实的
再说，那是部烂车
He'll get over it.
Besides, that car sucked anyways.

624
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,030
我真的要上厕所了
I really do need
to go to the bathroom.

625
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,540
我们在加油站停车
又停车？
- (EL) We're makin' a pit stop.
- (Rubin ) Again?!

626
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,500
你将亲身经历…
You're about to experience
first-hand...

627
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,270
食物链下游地位意味着什么
exactly what it means to be in
the lower region of the food chain.

628
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,320
米切就要咬你
Mitch is going to bite into you.

629
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,940
挤压你
He's going to squeeze.

630
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,890
实际上你还没死
它就开始消化你
He'll actually start digesting you
while you're still alive.

631
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,190
但不要害怕
But don't be scared.

632
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,350
别害怕
No. No, no.

633
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,550
这将是个快速死亡
It'll be a quick death.

634
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,950
要勇敢
Be brave.

635
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,820
你不会感到痛的
You'll barely feel it.

636
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,720
来
Come on.

637
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,060
来，你妈的怎么不吃它？
Come on. You gonna fuckin' eat him?

638
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,480
乔希，等等
Josh, wait up a second.

639
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,840
我们是上路开眼界
This is supposed to be a road trip.

640
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:25,020
但却一味地开车，太荒谬了
All we do is drive the whole time.
It's ridiculous.

641
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,610
你没人逼你来
你我们玩得不错
- No one forced you to come.
- We're making great time.

642
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:32,150
如果v芬妮看到录相带
那是件好事
And if Tiffany saw that tape,
it'd be a good thing.

643
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,390
你这是什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

644
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,870
贝思就像是天使
她来帮你改变你的一生
Beth is an angel. She's here
to help you change your life.

645
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,800
再说，v芬妮会让你拍她吗？
Besides, did Tiffany
ever let you videotape her?

646
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,900
我想不会
I think not.

647
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,030
这是征兆，乔希
It's a sign, Josh.

648
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,940
你喂？
你安迪生教授吗？
- 'Professor Anderson?'
- Who's calling?

649
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,010
你是谁？
嗨，教授，我是乔希你帕克
Hi, Professor, it's Josh Parker.

650
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,990
嗨，乔希，你有什么事？
(Deeper voice ) Hello, Josh.
What can I do for you?

651
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,020
你我遇上了交通事故了
你啊，天啊
- Well, I was in a car accident.
- 'Oh. Oh, my God.'

652
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,120
我没事儿，就是有点儿困难
I'm OK.
It's just I'm in kind of a bind.

653
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,000
我的书和笔记都毁掉了
All my notes and books
were destroyed.

654
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,760
我能不能申请延期？
Is it possible to get an extension?

655
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,070
过两天再考期中考试？
'Maybe take the mid-term
a couple days later?'

656
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,200
啊，行啊，这是紧急情况
Oh, sure.
Yes, it sounds like an emergency.

657
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,340
延迟三天怎么样？
How about an extra three days?

658
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,320
这可以了吧？
这太好了？
- 'Would that work?'
- Yeah, that would be fantastic!

659
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,550
你真的可以吗？
你没事儿我就放心了
- Are you sure?
- 'Just glad you're not hurt.'

660
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,850
我现在就记下来
I'm marking it down right now.

661
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,760
太好了，教授，谢谢你
'That's great, Professor. Thank you.'

662
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,820
好，再见
OK, goodbye.

663
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,190
是谁啊？
Who was that?

664
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,320
乔希你帕克
Oh, that...that was Josh Parker.

665
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,870
啊，是吗？他有什么事儿？
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

666
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,640
只想核实一下考试的时间
他太紧张了
He was just confirming
the date of the exam. Such a worrier.

667
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,180
宾夕尼亚贝德佛
(Siren wails)

668
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,460
没事儿，我会找到他的
It's gonna be OK. I'll find him.

669
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,720
也会找出肇事者，不会有事的
And we'll find whoever did this,
I promise. It's gonna be OK.

670
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:21,030
我推测这儿有人遭到奸杀
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody
was raped and murdered here.

671
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,430
你怎么会有这种想法？
What the hell gives you that idea?

672
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,170
不知道，凭感觉
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

673
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,550
你怎么样？
你没什么
- Well?
- Nothing yet.

674
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,610
幸运的是没有挣扎过的迹象
Good thing is,
there's no evidence of a struggle.

675
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,020
没有血迹和衣服等等
No blood or clothing or anything.

676
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,950
也没有发现一滴精液
And we haven't found
a single drop of semen yet.

677
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,690
星期六上午11：12

678
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,700
波士顿

679
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,940
嗨，我从家里来看朋友
Hi. I'm visiting my friend from home.

680
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,540
她不知道我来，想给她个惊喜
But she doesn't know I'm coming.
It's a surprise.

681
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,680
真妙，我能帮你点儿什么？
How nice. How can I help you?

682
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,480
我是第一次来，不知她住哪儿
I've never been here before.
I don't know where she lives.

683
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,020
她叫什么名字？我给你查查
What's her name? I can look it up.

684
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,360
啊，v芬妮你安迪森
Oh, OK. Tiffany Henderson.

685
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,390
我认识你吗？
Do I know you?

686
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,160
不，但我认识你的男朋友
No, you don't.
Actually, I know your boyfriend.

687
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,610
好，你是谁？
OK. Who are you?

688
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,080
我叫贝思，我们坐下谈好吗？
I'm Beth.
Could we just sit down for a minute?

689
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,310
好
OK.

690
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,990
嗯，我不知道该怎么开口
Um, this is really hard for me,

691
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,500
但有件事你一定要知道
but it's definitely
something you should hear.

692
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:04,360
你的男朋友在欺骗你…他跟我
Your boyfriend is cheating on you...
with me.

693
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,040
星期四晚上我们在一起
We were together Thursday night.

694
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,240
两次
Twice.

695
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,940
星期五早上又一次
And once again Friday morning.

696
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:14,950
我想你应该知道
I thought you should know.

697
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,190
对不起
Sorry.

698
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,900
v芬妮！你他妈的在干什么？
Tiffany! What the hell are you doing?

699
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,230
他是谁？
她的男朋友
- Who's that guy?
- That's her boyfriend.

700
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,330
她的男朋友？
THAT's her boyfriend?

701
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,110
对，他欺骗她
Yeah. He's been cheating on her.

702
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,340
宝贝，我爱你！
(Boyfriend) Baby, I love you!

703
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,450
星期六下午7：3690号公路
(Thuds and groans )

704
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,270
对不起
I-I'm sorry,

705
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:28,350
但你的脚太美了
but you have the most beautiful feet.

706
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,680
你想按摩一下儿脚吗？
Ohh... Would you like
a foot massage?

707
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,820
不，我不想按摩脚
No, I would not like a foot massage.

708
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,370
事实际上，我憎恨足部按摩
(Louder voice ) I would hate
a foot massage!

709
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,800
啊，对不起，别紧张
OK. I'm sorry. Relax.

710
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:46,770
还有没有正常的男人了！啊？
Are there any guys out there
who are just normal? ! Huh?!

711
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,470
米切，释放你的狂怒
- (Plucks string)
- Unleash the fury, Mitch.

712
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,740
释放你的狂怒
- (Plucks string)
- Unleash the fury.

713
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,820
来，米切
- Come on, Mitch.
- (Plucks string)

714
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,480
吃它
Eat him.

715
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,560
米切，求你，去吃它吧
Please, Mitch. Go get him, boy.

716
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,560
它就在那儿，杀死它
He's right there. Kill him.

717
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,960
伤它，咬它
Maim him. Bite him.

718
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,730
释放你的野性！
UNLEASH THE FURY!

719
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,430
星期六晚上8：12田纳西大学

720
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,350
噢，这真有趣
Wow, this is cool.

721
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,650
我从未到过兄弟会的地方
I've never been in
a fraternity house before.

722
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,360
真行得通吗？
Is this gonna work?

723
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,920
当然行得通，我懂得手势
Of course it's gonna work.
I know the handshake.

724
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,360
嗨
Hi.

725
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,370
你嗨，有什么事吗？
你对
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

726
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,900
我是卡尔你鲁宾
艾菲嘉大学兄弟会的
I'm Rubin Carver,
a Xi Chi brother from Ithaca.

727
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,740
我们路过此地
想找个地方玩玩儿
We're just passing through
and looking for a place to party,

728
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,110
或许能住上一夜
maybe even a place to crash.

729
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,810
啊哼，啊，各位，这是鲁宾
Ahem. Uh, everyone, this is Rubin.

730
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,980
显然鲁宾是艾菲嘉分部的兄弟
Apparently, Rubin is our fraternity
brother from our Ithaca chapter.

731
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,050
这些是他的朋友
These are his friends.

732
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,430
我们打断你们吃饭了，我们…
Listen, uh, we've interrupted
your dinner so we'll just...

733
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,870
嗨，别傻了
Hey, don't be crazy.

734
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,840
这儿有足够的饭菜
There's plenty of food to go around.

735
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,970
欢迎你们留下
You guys are welcome to stay.

736
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,230
这饭菜还真不错
You know, this food's pretty good.

737
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,860
你知道这是黑人兄弟会吗？
Hey, you do realise
this is a national black fraternity?

738
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,100
他们知道你不是成员
They know you're not a member.

739
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,460
抱歉，我没有考虑过
I'm sorry. I don't think
about that kind of stuff.

740
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,070
别担心，他们只是跟我们玩玩
OK, relax. OK?
They're just messing with us.

741
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,210
他们很生气，因为他撒谎
They're pissed because he lied.

742
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,150
你我说我们走吧
你嘘，放松
- I say we get out of here.
- Shh, relax.

743
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,520
有人要解释一下儿
Someone's got some explaining to do.

744
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,180
你从他包里找到的
你什么？！那是什么？！
- Look what we found in his bag.
- What?! What is that?!

745
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,950
不，我从未见过那东西！
No, I've never seen that before!

746
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:55,260
你们来干什么？是三K党吗？
What are you doin'?
Are you in the Ku Klux Klan?

747
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,700
你啊，那不是我们的
你那不是我的
- Whoa, whoa. That is not ours.
- That's not mine!

748
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,530
好，等等，一定有原因的
OK, hold on, th-there's
obviously some explanation.

749
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,540
对，有原因，你们有偏见
现在要处死他了
Yeah, there is. See, your boy's
an evil bigot and now he's gonna die.

750
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,510
公正
Justice!

751
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,010
凯尔，凯尔
(Josh) Kyle. Kyle.

752
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,250
凯尔！
Kyle!

753
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,290
你醒了，还以为你死了
There you are. I thought we lost you.

754
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,060
你这是医院吗？
你你晕过去了
- Am I in the hospital?
- You passed out.

755
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,260
他们在逗我们，这是个玩笑
They were messin' with us, Kyle.
It was a joke.

756
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:39,700
种族主义者？
我常看黑人电视节目
Racist?
But I watch Oprah Winfrey every day.

757
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:42,740
跟你开玩笑，傻瓜
It was a joke, outtie. A joke!

758
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,910
我明白了
把三K党帽.子放进我包里
- (Laughing continues )
- I get it.

759
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,820
对，啊，真有趣
Yeah. Oh, that's funny.

760
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,550
我要杯冰镇酒
I need a wine cooler.

761
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,990
你喝我的吧
你谢谢
- Hey, have mine.
- Thanks.

762
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,860
他真是个可爱的小家伙
Isn't he just
the cutest little thing?

763
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,660
啊，凯尔是个好样的！
Oh, yeah, Kyle's the man!

764
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:25,070
你从未有过？一次也没有？
You mean never? Not even once?

765
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,580
我是说…有过
Well... I mean, I've had sex before.

766
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:35,620
但是…不是与人
Just, um,

767
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,550
明白了
Right.

768
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,290
噢…我觉得那很潇洒
Well, I think that's kinda cool.

769
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,190
你真的？
你真的
- You do?
- Yeah.

770
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,470
我是说你应该忍耐
第一次应该很特别
I mean, you should hold out.
It should be special.

771
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,830
有了爱情再做
Wait till you're in love.

772
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,810
我想我爱你
I think I love you.

773
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,940
你真可爱
You are so cute.

774
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,310
我想你没有避孕套
I take it you don't have a condom?

775
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,980
没有，我用光了
Um, I guess I'm all out.

776
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,110
噢，劳伦斯应该有
Well, Lawrence probably has some.

777
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,320
拉开那个抽屉看看
Why don't you try that drawer?

778
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,700
在香水旁边，皮带后面
Next to the Old Spice,
behind the belts.

779
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,430
猜对了
Good guess.

780
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,880
你知道吗？
You know what?

781
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:17,080
我不太清楚…我在做什么…
Um, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing and, um...

782
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,990
我…
I'm... Oof.

783
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:24,120
放松，宝贝儿，让朗达照顾你
Shhh. Relax, baby.
Let Rhonda handle this.

784
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,750
你谢谢，我很开心
你保重
- Thanks for a great time.
- Take care.

785
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,620
保持静
Stay cool.

786
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,490
嗨，德文
Hey, Devon.

787
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,670
怎么啦？
What's up?

788
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,210
田纳西州盟菲斯

789
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:18,550
凯尔，详细招来
发生了什么事？
Let's go, Kyle.
We want details. What happened?

790
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,390
我们喝了几杯酒
Well, we had a few drinks,

791
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,760
跳了会儿舞，你知道…
danced a little, and, you know...

792
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,920
我们不知道，快告诉我们
No, we don't know.
Why don't you tell us?

793
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:35,930
这是什么？你杀了个小妞？
Did you kill a cheetah?

794
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,130
是她的内裤，她送给我的
What? No. These are her underwear.
She gave 'em to me.

795
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,340
我干了她
I boinked her!

796
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,250
干了她？
Boinked?

797
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,510
你刚才说“干了”吗？
Yeah, did you just say
the word "boinked?"

798
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:57,180
凯尔，希望你别再想干了
I hope you got the boinking
out of your system,

799
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,130
今天我们要赶很长的路
cos we got a lot of driving
to do today.

800
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,290
别奢望去探访猫王故居
Do not get your hopes up
about visiting Graceland,

801
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,390
因为我们有重要任务
cos we're about the mission at hand.

802
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,630
你乔希
你什么事？
- Josh.
- What?

803
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,270
计划不错，但有个小问题
That sounds like a good plan,
except for one little thing.

804
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:16,830
你什么小问题？
你我们没钱了
- What little thing?
- We're out of money.

805
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,380
填表前我先问你们几个问题
OK, before you fill out these,
I have to ask some questions.

806
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,350
合格的话才可以捐精
If you qualify, you can
make a sperm deposit. Understood?

807
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,680
问吧
Mm-hmm. Fire away.

808
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,850
老实回答，否则没有报酬
你们骗不过检验
Tell the truth, because if you don't
the test will and you won't get paid.

809
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,560
在过去的36个小时内
有没有用过药.物？
So, first off, have any of you
done any drugs in the past 36 hours?

810
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,900
这也包括大麻
And that includes marijuana.

811
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,170
好，下个是
(Nurse ) OK, next.

812
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:50,610
在过去的24小时内
有没有性行为或自渎？
Have any of you had sex
or masturbated in the past 24 hours?

813
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,270
那，我不合格
Well, I guess I'm out.

814
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:56,250
因为我昨晚性交过…
Because I had sex last night...

815
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,290
跟一个女孩子！
with a girl! (Grunting)

816
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,480
这很好
That's nice.

817
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:05,120
文件夹里有你们需要的一切
You'll find everything you need
in these binders.

818
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,860
你们每人拿个杯子
Would you each take a cup.

819
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,430
你好
你这是你的
- OK.
- And yours.

820
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,900
完事后请送回来
I'd appreciate it if you'd
return those after you're finished.

821
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,940
好，谢谢
OK. Uh, thanks.

822
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,670
谢谢
Cheers.

823
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,770
对不起，有亚洲女人的吗？
Excuse me. Do you have anything
with Asian women?

824
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:29,980
我很喜欢亚洲妹
这里面却没有
I have this thing for Asian chicks,
and there's none here.

825
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:33,680
这儿不是窥视院
我们的材料有限
This isn't Peep World.
Our selection is limited.

826
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,420
你你凑合着干吧
你好
- You're gonna have to make do.
- OK.

827
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,960
你已经帮我不少了
You've been more than helpful.

828
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,260
有什么问题吗？
Is something wrong?

829
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,390
噢，没有
Well, no.

830
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:52,730
但…我感觉到…
But...I just couldn't help
but notice that...

831
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,280
我们之间有点儿什么？
Is there something between us?

832
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,710
我想，或者你可以…
I mean, I was thinking
that maybe you might want to...

833
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,940
我不知道…给我一点…
I don't know...
help me out with a little...

834
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,850
转业辅导？
professional assistance?

835
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,920
你需要我帮忙吗？
Do you need some help?

836
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,930
对，我需要
Yes, I do.

837
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,050
莫里斯大夫，请拨118
(Woman on PA)
'Dr Morris, dial 1-1-8, please.

838
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,560
莫里斯大夫，请拨118
'Dr Morris, please dial 1-1-8.'

839
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:24,700
我一看见你，便觉得你真棒
The moment I saw you out there,
I thought you were incredible.

840
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:28,830
你跟我认识的女孩不一样
你是真正的女人
You're not like most of the girls
I know. You're a woman.

841
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:33,680
好，转过身，脱下裤子
双手放在床上
That's fine. Turn around, drop your
pants, hands flat on the table.

842
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,440
哎哟，天啊
(Chuckling) Oh, my God.

843
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,780
你太好了，这样？
你对
- This is great. Wow. Like this?
- Exactly.

844
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,320
我得坦白，我喜欢你穿制服
(Sighs ) I have to admit,
I love you in that uniform.

845
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:50,630
你的丝袜到腰还是到大腿？
Do those nylons go all the way up,
or are they, like thigh high?

846
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:54,390
我要开始挤压前列腺
I'm gonna perform a procedure
called milking the prostate.

847
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,730
是从肛门引导射精
It's an anally-induced ejaculation.

848
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,000
肛门？
Anal?

849
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,670
你的直肠会感到有压力
You're gonna feel strong pressure
from inside your rectum.

850
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,240
来，你别跟我讲科学，宝贝儿
Come on, you don't have
to get all scientific, baby.

851
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,150
我是说，我们可以谈…

852
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,260
停下！好，继续干！
Stop! OK, keep doin' it. Yaaah!

853
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:27,830
就那儿！
(EL) Right there! Ahhh!

854
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:36,210
啊，天啊！
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

855
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:43,420
好，完事了
OK. All done.

856
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,180
这好厉害！
That was awesome!

857
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,090
等等，真的可以吗？
Wait. Wait. Does that work?

858
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,030
我是说，医学上真有可能吗？
I mean,
is it even medically possible?

859
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,640
对，当然可以
Oh, yeah, it works.

860
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,760
万试万灵
It works like a charm.

861
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,170
继续讲故事吧
But back to our story.

862
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,940
这是艾嘉菲星期天早上
'It was Sunday morning
back in Ithaca,

863
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,480
情况急转直下
'when things suddenly took
an unexpected turn.'

864
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,950
我是老鼠，吃我，吃我
(Barry ) I'm a mouse.
I'm a mouse. Eat me. Eat me.

865
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,720
吃我，吃我，吃我
Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.
Eat me. Eat me.

866
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,280
来啊
(Sighs ) Come on.

867
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,800
米切，你不吃，我要吃了
You better eat him, Mitch,
before I do.

868
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,490
它味道很好
(Panting) He's tasty.

869
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,070
米切，它味道很好
He's tasty, Mitch. Oh! Oh!

870
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,570
嗯！
Mmm! Mmm!

871
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,490
你为什么骗我？
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Why'd you lie to me?

872
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,660
我没有
(Gulps ) I didn't lie.

873
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,820
你说乔希去波士顿了
You-you told me
that Josh went to Boston.

874
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:08,030
你我没说，我说奥斯丁
你你说波士顿
- I didn't. I said Austin.
- You said Boston.

875
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,660
因为你，一个人的一生毁掉了
Because of you,
some guy's life is ruined.

876
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,200
那又怎样？无论他去了哪儿
都是因为你
So what? Besides, wherever he went,
he went because of you.

877
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:21,880
你什么意思，因为我？
你这还不明摆着
- What do you mean, because of me?
- Look, it's obvious.

878
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:25,280
乔希喜欢你，令人作呕
Josh likes you. It's disgusting.

879
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,750
我知道你会回来的
I knew you'd come back.

880
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,820
你你想干什么？
你跟乔希玩得怎么样？
- What do you want?
- So, how was your getaway with Josh?

881
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:35,620
你我没有
你当然没有，那没关系
- I wasn't with Josh.
- Sure. Doesn't matter, though.

882
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:38,320
因为他下学期不会来了
Cos Josh won't be back next semester.

883
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,870
他的哲学就要不及格了
He's about to flunk philosophy.

884
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:45,600
你你在说什么？
你他以为可以延期考试
- What are you talking about?
- He thinks that he has an extension,

885
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,910
但由于…某人，我
but thanks to
a...certain someone - me -

886
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,740
他不能延期
he doesn't.

887
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,940
你他是个白痴
你你是个疯子
(Jacob ) He's an idiot.
(Beth) You psycho.

888
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,800
啊，天啊！
Oh, my God!

889
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:06,410
那天晚上
我让他们去我爷爷家过夜
(Barry ) 'That night I set the guys up
at my grandparents' house.

890
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,960
我很久没去看他们了
'I haven't been there in a long time.

891
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,390
七岁那年我放火烧了他们的狗
'When I was seven years old
I set their dog on fire

892
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,220
此后再也没有被邀请过
'and wasn't invited back.

893
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,590
但我听说还不错
'But I hear it's still real nice.'

894
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,790
说真的，只准说“请”
I'm serious. "Please",
"Thank you", "This is delicious"

895
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,870
“谢谢”，   “很好吃”
are the only words
you're allowed to say.

896
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:27,600
老人都喜欢我，奶奶更爱我
What? I'm great with old people.
Grandmas love me.

897
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,370
等等，等等，   “曼尼露”？
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. "Manilow"?

898
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,910
你巴里姓曼尼露？
你对
- Barry's last name is Manilow?
- Yeah.

899
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,450
你他叫巴里你曼尼露？
你对
- His name is Barry Manilow?
- Yeah.

900
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:41,860
你嗨！
你哎哟，天啊！
- (All) Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

901
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,320
啊，瞧这些孩子
Oh, look at you boys.

902
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,590
杰克，他们来了！
Jack, they're here!

903
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,630
巴里的朋友来了，来打个招呼
Jack, Barry's friends are here.
Come and say hi.

904
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,300
他们来了
- (Dog groans )
- The boys are here.

905
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:05,140
你啊，嗨，小伙子
你嗨
- Oh, hey, fellas.
- Hi.

906
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,310
你嗨，你怎么样？
你等等，让我起来
- Hey, how's it going?
- Wait. Let me get up.

907
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,080
你我带你们看看
你啊，亲爱的！
- I'll give you guys the full tour.
- Oh, honey!

908
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,210
小心，你太不雅了！
Careful. Your boner!

909
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,620
你叫我怎么办？割了它？
Well, what do you want me to do,
cut it off?

910
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:20,320
这样吧，小伙子
(Groans ) I'll tell you what, fellas,

911
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:24,330
首先带你们看看睡觉的地方
we'll start by showin'
you where you're gonna sleep.

912
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,730
看看所谓的客房
(Chuckles ) I'll show you
what we call the guest room.

913
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,860
跟我来，孩子，客房…
Follow me, boys. The guest room...

914
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,920
对不起
Excuse me.

915
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,360
你见过这个孩子吗？
You remember this kid?

916
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,330
没有，肯定没有
No, sure don't.

917
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,890
该死的傻瓜
(Mutters ) Fuckin' airhead.

918
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:09,210
我再问一次，见过我儿子吗？
Let me ask you once more.
Have you seen my son?

919
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,440
我记起来了，是有几个人来过
Ow. Now that you mention it,
there were a few guys in.

920
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:16,350
放开我的手，我拿账单给你看
If you loosen my arm,
I could get their bill.

921
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,720
用另一只手拿
Use your other arm.

922
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,250
你几个人？
你就几个
- How many were there?
- A few.

923
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,150
四个！
- (Cracking)
- Aaah! Four!

924
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,820
其中一个还想买毒品
One of 'em was trying to score drugs.

925
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:37,230
他们打了两个电话去奥斯丁
他们可能去那儿了
Honey, look. They made two calls to
Austin, Texas. Maybe they went there.

926
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,370
早上2：18
(Door opens )

927
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,950
你抽烟？
(Grandpa ) Havin' a smoke?

928
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,980
对，对
Uh...yeah, yeah.

929
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,390
我也睡不着
(Groans ) I can't sleep, either.

930
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,430
该死的威格拉令我心跳加速
Goddam Viagra
gets my heart racing like a lab rat.

931
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,660
你没事儿吧？
(Chuckles ) Are you OK?

932
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,870
你你看起来闷闷不乐
你我没事儿
- You look kinda goofy.
- No. No, it's nothing.

933
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:17,810
你来，说出来吧
你好
- Come on, out with it.
- (Sniffs ) OK.

934
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,440
啊…两天前我差点儿死了
Well...I almost died two days ago.

935
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,780
你什么？
你我们的车子爆炸了
- What?
- Our car exploded.

936
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:27,050
我可能已经不在了
I could be dead right now.

937
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,860
之后我就问自己为什么？
And since that happened,
I find myself asking why.

938
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:36,190
你知道吗？就像…
You know? Like...

939
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:38,360
生命的目的是什么？
What is my reason for living?

940
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,460
你不把草烟递给我吗？
Are you gonna
pass that doobie, or what?

941
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:47,470
草烟？是，对不起
Doobie? Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

942
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,570
嗯，谢谢
Uh, thanks.

943
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,180
你知道你的问题是啥吗？
You know what your problem is?

944
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,790
只有脑袋没有雄心壮志
You're all brains.
Not enough cock and balls.

945
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,990
实际上，人们一直都这样说
Actually, uh, people have been
telling me that my whole life.

946
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:15,330
六年级时我为伊拉克形势担心
In the sixth grade I got so worried
about the situation in Iraq,

947
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,170
我要服成人剂量的镇静剂
that I was on
an adult dosage of Xanax.

948
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,670
八年级时每周三次见心理医生
And by eighth grade,
I was in therapy three times a week.

949
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:27,410
实情是，只有大麻才使我放松
And the truth is, weed is the
only thing that could balance me out.

950
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,210
你明白我的意思吗？像…
You know what I mean? Like...

951
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,720
你没事儿吧？
You OK?

952
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,760
喂，老人家
Hey, old man.

953
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:41,380
我真他妈的想吃东西
I got the fuckin' munchies real bad.

954
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,520
你呢？
(Dog) How 'bout you?

955
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,500
v芬妮，不要再伤心了
OK, Tiffany,
it's time to stop being so sad.

956
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,540
看你收到了这么多信
Look at all this mail you got!

957
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:58,740
看多少人在关心你
Look how many nice people
care about you.

958
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,210
还有乔希的包裹
You even got a package from Josh.

959
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,770
真的？
Really?

960
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:06,410
打开看看好吗？
Shall we open it
and see what he says?

961
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,350
好，来，打开看看
Yeah, come on, Tif. Let's open it.

962
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,350
是盘录像带
- (Laughs ) It's a tape.
- Oh.

963
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,090
那，放进去看看
Well, pop it in.

964
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:18,760
也许我应该一个人看
Maybe I should watch this on my own.

965
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,890
啊，来吧
Oh, come on.

966
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:25,440
这一定会使你开心
This'll definitely cheer you up.

967
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,070
你喜欢什么样的女孩子？
(Beth) 'What do you look for
in a girl? '

968
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:39,370
哦，让我想想，她要精明
'Well, let's see.
She should be smart...'

969
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:45,080
有趣，还…
- (Giggling)
- 'and, um, funny.

970
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,320
这也不错…不错
'That's good...that's good, too.'

971
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,420
还有呢？
(Beth) 'What else do you look for?'

972
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,660
她还要漂亮
'Um... She should be, uh, attractive.

973
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,700
啊…无上装
'And, um, topless.

974
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,670
她还要吻我
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'And she should kiss me.'

975
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:20,490
你再见
你你们好好做人
(Josh) Bye-bye.
(Grandpa ) You boys be good now.

976
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:23,460
你再见
你我会代你向巴里问好
- Bye-bye.
- I'll tell Barry you said hello.

977
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,130
喂，杰克，叫那个婊子
弄点儿饼给我
Hey, Jack, have that bitch make me
some blueberry pancakes. Now.

978

星期一上午8：52奥斯丁大学

979
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,290
对不起，啊哟
Excuse me. Ahem.

980
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,670
网址是WWW…
www.episodetwo/spoilers...

981
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,970
好，瞧，我这里有人
(Sighs ) OK, look.
Some people are here

982
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,270
他们很无礼
and they are being very rude.

983
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,370
好，我再打给你
OK. Call you back.

984
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,570
对不起，我们需要你帮忙
I'm sorry, but we need your help.

985
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:53,140
你你认识v芬妮你安迪森吗？
你109号房间
- Do you know Tiffany Henderson?
- Room 109.

986
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,310
她的外祖父刚过世了
Well, her grandfather died,

987
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,820
她让我帮她取她的信件
and she asked me
to pick up her mail.

988
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,990
啊，真不幸，你有锁匙吗？
Oh, how sad. Do you have the key?

989
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,700
她没有带到丧礼那儿去
我希望你可以…
Well, she didn't bring it to the
funeral so I was hoping you could...

990
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:10,740
对不起，一定要有锁匙
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you need the key.

991
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,360
别担心，邮件在这儿很安全
Don't worry. Her mail will be here,
safe and sound.

992
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,240
不是担心，是她需要点儿东西
It's not like that, you see?
She needs something.

993
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:24,180
你这是紧急情况
你不要把事情搞大
- This is an emergency.
- Don't make a big deal out of it.

994
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:29,090
没有搞大，你得有钥匙
规矩就是规矩
Well, it's not a big deal, but
you need the key. Rules are rules.

995
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,460
没人让你犯错误，你就看别处
No one's asking you to do anything
wrong. Just, you know, look away.

996
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,550
去买个爱斯基莫馅饼
Go have an Eskimo pie.

997
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,060

Listen to the man before you get
some Jackie Chan on your face.

你好，来吧
你现在就拿来，混蛋
- Come on, let's go.
- That means now, asshole.

1001
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,870
上帝！
Jesus!

1002
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:52,910
他打扁了我的鼻子，上帝！
I think he broke my nose. Oh, God!

1003
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,640
来呀，小妞儿
Come on, Susie.

1004
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,520
你你是摔角的？
你对，小妞儿，你想打吗？
- You're a wrestler?
- You bet, Mary. You wanna go?

1005
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,650
你让我看看
你啊，上帝！
- Let me see it.
- Oh, God!

1006
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,710
好
All right.

1007
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:12,600
你谁是我的婊子？
你什么？！
- Who's my bitch?
- What?!

1008
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,910
就这样，不，不！
(Receptionist) That's it. No, no, no!

1009
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,970
好，各位，不准动！
OK, everyone, freeze!

1010
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:31,540
这是胡椒喷雾
我们会毫不犹豫使用它的
This here is pepper spray,
and we will use it.

1011
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,590
我坐在桌后，这些家伙袭击我
These guys jumped me.
I was just sitting behind my desk!

1012
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,700
凯尔！
Kyle?

1013
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,260
你爸爸？
你他是你爸爸？
- Dad?
- That's your dad?

1014
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:47,560
别动，大家都别动！
Freeze now! Everybody freeze!

1015
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,900
放下武器！
Put your weapon down now!

1016
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,900
我儿子给绑架了！
My son was kidnapped!

1017
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,940
啊…谁给绑架了？
Whoa, whoa... Who was kidnapped?

1018
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,480
不是绑架，他们是我的同学
I wasn't kidnapped.
These are my friends from school.

1019
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,300
你说什么？
What are you talkin' about?

1020
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,950
我们一起来的
We all drove down here together.

1021
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,850
什么？
What?

1022
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,320
那告诉我车子怎么被炸了？
Then explain to me how
the frigging car got blown to hell!

1023
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:15,760
你那…你瞧
你车子被偷了
- Well, see...
- It was stolen.

1024
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,400
对，你说呀，凯尔
That's right. Tell him, Kyle.

1025
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,400
一点儿不错
Uh-huh. Exactly.

1026
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,330
被偷了？
Stolen?

1027
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,270
那该死的信用卡呢？
What about the damned credit card?

1028
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,770
一块儿都给偷了
It was inside,
and that was stolen, too.

1029
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,580
废话！天方夜谈！
为什么不告诉我你的去处？
Bullcrap! This is ridiculous! Why
didn't you tell us where you were?

1030
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,410
我知道你会发怒！你看？
Because I knew you'd get mad! See?

1031
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,250
你我没发怒，马上跟我来
你乔希？
- I'm not mad! You're going with me.
- Josh?

1032
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,490
你v芬妮！
你这…这怎么了？
- Tiffany!
- What the... What's going on?

1033
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,590
你没什么
你嘿，伙计，她真撩人！
- Nothing.
- Damn, dude, she is hot!

1034
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,690
我女友呼我，放他们走好吧？
My girlfriend's pagin' me.
Can we let them go?

1035
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:57,670
你好主意
你谁也别动！
- Good idea.
- No one is going anywhere!

1036
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:01,400
你他跟我走
你放开我！
- He's comin' with me.
- Get off of me!

1037
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,770
我跟他们一块儿回去
I'm going back with these guys.

1038
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,400
你闭嘴，别反嘴
Shut your mouth and don't talk back.

1039
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,910
你为什么不闭嘴？
Why don't YOU shut up?

1040
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,710
你刚才对我说什么？
What the hell did you just say to me?

1041
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,810
我说，你闭嘴
I said, you shut up.

1042
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:16,190
你总是让我维护自己的权益
You've always told me
to stand up for myself.

1043
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:20,160
我现在做了，别管我，笨蛋！
Well, now I am.
Leave me alone, you jerk!

1044
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,520
你这个无意…
You ungrateful...

1045
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,830
你什么…
你这边儿走
- What...
- Go this way.

1046
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,000
走开！走开！
Go away! Go away!

1047
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:39,540
怎么回事儿？你来干什么？
What was that all about? I mean,
Josh, what are you doing here?

1048
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,950
我就是想你，没别的
I just missed you. That's all.

1049
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:47,040
我也想你
但这么远开车来有点发疯
I missed you, too, but it's crazy
for you to drive all the way here.

1050
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,950
什么？我以为你会高兴呢
What?
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

1051
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:55,790
当然高兴，但你要上学念书
I am. But Josh, you have your
entire life to live up at school.

1052
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,590
这不利于健康，此外…
This isn't healthy. Besides...

1053
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,170
这个周我意识到了一些事情
I realised a few things
this past week.

1054
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,800
是吗？什么事情？
You did? Like what?

1055
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,170
比如，我们在念大学
Like, we're in college.

1056
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,840
去玩儿、去认识人的机会
The window of opportunity to go out
and have fun and meet new people

1057
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,680
变得越来越小
is getting smaller by the day.

1058
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,890
你是吗？
你别这样，乔希
- It is?
- Come on, Josh.

1059
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,050
我们一直在一起
We've been together forever.

1060
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,220
我是说…
你几乎.上是我唯一的男友
I mean...you're pretty much
the only guy I've ever been with.

1061
01:21:27,290 --> 01:21:30,350
“几乎.唯一的”是什么意思？
What do you mean,
"pretty much the only guy"?

1062
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:34,830
我十四岁那年，你去露营了
那是多年以前的事
Well, I was 14, and you were away
at camp, but that was years ago.

1063
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,800
此外，我们处于不同的地区
Besides,
we're in different area codes.

1064
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,430
我也想过不少我们的关系
I've been thinking a lot
about us, too.

1065
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:48,740
我来的真正原因是…
The real reason I drove down...

1066
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,840
等等
Hold that thought.

1067
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,090
喂？
Hello?

1068
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:59,350
对，他在这儿
Yeah, he's right here.

1069
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,360
你是谁？
Who is this?

1070
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,860
等等
Hold on.

1071
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,460
找你的，是贝思
It's for you. It's Beth.

1072
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,660
贝思是谁？
Who's Beth?

1073
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,240
贝思，你怎么了？
Beth? What are you doing?

1074
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:23,610
我不知道我们怎么了
但我得告诉你一件事情
I'm not sure what's going on between
us but I need to tell you something.

1075
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,380
我很高兴你来电话
我也有事要告诉你
I'm actually glad you called,
cos I wanted to tell you something.

1076
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,980
好，你先讲
OK, you first.

1077
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,180
现在不太方便
I can't really talk right now,

1078
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:36,460
我回去后一定好好解释
but I'll explain everything
when I get back.

1079
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,000
好吧？真的，我保证
'OK? Really. I promise.'

1080
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,000
我要挂了，好吗？
Uh, I-I gotta get going, OK?

1081
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:45,500
你等等，你不想听我的吗？
你对，抱歉
- Wait! Do you want to hear mine?
- Right. Sorry.

1082
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,400
是好消息？
Is it good?

1083
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:50,170
恐怕不是，雅各布骗了你
Not really. Jacob lied to you.

1084
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,910
期中考试你不能延期
There's no extension
on your mid-term.

1085
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,450
什么？
What?

1086
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:58,380
他耍你，你回不来就过不了
'He tried to trick you. If you
don't get back you're gonna fail.'

1087
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,320
混蛋！
Shit!

1088
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:04,080
她应该精明，有趣
'She should be smart and funny.'

1089
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,320
你我来电话你高兴吗？
你高兴，谢谢
- 'Aren't you glad I called?'
- Yes. Thank you.

1090
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,350
我一回去就给你打电话，再见
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, OK? Bye.

1091
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,230
这是给我的？
- Is this for me?
- Hmm?

1092
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,860
啊，天啊，不！你别…
Oh, God, no, no, no! You don't...

1093
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,310
这是什么？
What the hell is this?

1094
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:28,870
我上电视了，再倒带看看
'I can see myself on TV,
I think it must be rewound.'

1095
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,640
是巴里
It's Barry.

1096
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,720
嗨，看…
'Hey, look...

1097
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,880
看，我看到我的屁股了
'Look at that. I can see my bum.
(Laughs )'

1098
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:41,690
你为什么给我这个？
Why would you send this to me?

1099
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:46,390
等等你你们分手了
拥抱后你就离开了？
So wait - you guys broke up,
then you hugged and then you left?

1100
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,970
对，大致是这样
Yeah, pretty much.

1101
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,900
输家！分手前一定要再来一次
Loser! Always have sex with the girl
one last time before you break up.

1102
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,770
谁都会这样！
Everyone knows that!

1103
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,580
不能那样，我认识她很久
她是我最好的朋友
It's not like that. I've known her
my whole life. She's my best friend.

1104
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:03,240
那，我们现在干什么？
So, what do we do now?

1105
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,410
你想抽两口吗？
你不抽
- Wanna smoke some drugs?
- I don't think so.

1106
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,950
再过46小时就要考试了
我必须回去
My mid-term starts in exactly
46 hours so I got to get back.

1107
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:14,750
虽然我不会通过，但…
Although I'm gonna fail anyway,
so it doesn't matter but...

1108
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:18,320
你考什么试？
你古代哲学
- Which class was it?
- Ancient Philosophy.

1109
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,030
我能在46小时之内教会你
I can teach you ancient philosophy
in 46 hours.

1110
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,600
你能？
You can?

1111
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:25,830
我能在46小时内教会猴子
I can teach a monkey in 46 hours.

1112
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:29,430
关键是让你有兴趣
You just got to find a way
to relate to the material.

1113
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:33,140
就像…你喜欢职业摔角吗？
Like, OK...
You like pro wrestling, don't you?

1114
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,010
你谁不喜欢？
你好
- Who doesn't?
- OK.

1115
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,380
苏格拉底就是哲学上的温森
Socrates was like
the Vince McMahon of philosophy.

1116
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,420
他发起了哲学
He started it all.

1117
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:03,770
两天之后艾菲嘉大学

1118
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,010
晚了57分钟

1119
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,070
啊，二十人皇家大战是什么？
Oh, what was the 20-Man Battle Royal?

1120
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,990
参与解释预言，亚里士多德
Participation explains predication.
Aristotle.

1121
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,520
对
Right.

1122
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,290
你懂这个！你没事儿
You know this! You'll be fine.

1123
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,100
站住，呆那儿！别动！
Freeze, right there! Don't move!

1124
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:33,200
这是哲学课吗？
Is this philosophy?

1125
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,640
有什么消息，打电话给我
If you hear anything, give me a call.

1126
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:41,580
炸弹威胁是重罪，我的名片
A bomb threat is serious.
Take my card.

1127
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,980
好
- OK.
- (Sirens wailing)

1128
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:50,020
好，我们走吧
(Cop ) OK, let's move it.

1129
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:53,250
炸弹威胁是怎么回事儿？
What's goin' on
with this bomb threat?

1130
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,730
谎报，各位，大家回去
False alarm, people.
Everyone back inside.

1131
01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:00,160
我们要考试了，对
We're gonna do this thing.
That's right.

1132
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:20,120
你乔希
你贝思！
- Josh.
- Beth!

1133
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:24,210
嗨…谢谢你的电话
Hey, um...thanks for calling.

1134
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:28,190
这个星期真离奇
Uh, it's been a really weird week.

1135
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,390
你考得怎么样？
So, how'd you do?

1136
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,470
实际上，很不错
On the exam? Pretty good, actually.

1137
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,590
你真的？
你真的
- You did?
- Yeah.

1138
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,300
你感到奇怪吗？
Were you surprised?

1139
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:45,070
你考试来晚了
You weren't back
in time for the exam,

1140
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,110
于是我打电话说有炸弹…
so I, uh, called in a bomb threat.

1141
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,540
是你打的？
You did that?

1142
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,050
你发疯了
(Laughs ) That's insane.

1143
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,260
我不能让雅各布赶你出校
I wasn't gonna let Jacob
get you kicked out.

1144
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,880
此外，下学期我会需要你
Besides, I might need you
around next semester.

1145
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,860
我没做错，对吧？
So I did good, right?

1146
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,560
做错？
Good?

1147
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:09,760
这是别人为我做的最棒的事
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1148
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,850
妈妈？
Mom?

1149
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,420
对不起
(Panting) I'm so sorry.

1150
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,890
妈妈？
Mom?

1151
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:36,890
故事使我情不自禁
I got carried away
with the story there.

1152
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:44,140
不管怎样，乔希得到了B+
So, anyway,
Josh got a B+ on his mid-term.

1153
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,260
继续上学
He got to stay in college.

1154
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:48,740
他现在仍和贝思在一起
'And he and Beth are still together.

1155
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:52,740
他们仍喜欢拍…家庭录像
'They're still really into
making their...home movies.

1156
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:57,080
实际上，他们有70小时的毛片
'In fact, they have about 70 hours
of unedited amateur video.'

1157
01:27:57,150 --> 01:27:59,050
很来劲
It's pretty wild.

1158
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:02,050
我看了，因为我买了一些
I know, because I bought some of it.

1159
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,950
那个雅各布呢？
That guy Jacob?

1160
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:08,360
他离开学校了
到爱何华州当邪教领袖
'He left school. He went on to become
the leader of some cult in Iowa.

1161
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:11,620
他组织了一次集体自杀
'He tried organising a mass suicide.

1162
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:14,720
他率先喝了毒药
'Only problem is,
he drank the Kool-Aid first

1163
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:19,030
信众们却改变了主意
'and, well, everyone else
just kind of changed their minds.'

1164
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,270
真可惜
Too bad.

1165
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,780
至于鲁宾…记得他吗？
As for Rubin... Remember Rubin?

1166
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,140
