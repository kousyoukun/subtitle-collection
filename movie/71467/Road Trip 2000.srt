1
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,797
Welcome to the University
of Ithaca. This is it, right here.

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,314
I'm gonna give you a good tour today.

3
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,039
Show you as much as you need to know.

4
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,839
This is the main area
of the university.

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,275
You'll be getting used to this area.

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,828
This is sort of where you congregate.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,878
Come in around me. Keep close.

8
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,111
I've had problems
with stragglers before, OK?

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,158
They get lost in the back
and hit by trucks, OK?

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,119
It's not pretty. This is the...

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,115
By the way, this is the Joseph
H Nelson Memorial Library here, OK?

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,590
It was built, uh...
It was built, uh, in the 1600s.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,229
1600s? It says 1951.

14
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,399
That's the address. OK? Wise-ass.

15
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,391
That's the psychology department.

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,270
You're expected to volunteer for
cutting-edge experimental testing.

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,952
Kind of cool.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,478
When it's your turn, remember
to wear loose clothes, no metal,

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,111
and be prepared to receive several
heavy doses of electric current.

20
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,156
They're watching us right now.

21
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,115
Over there
is the department of English.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,795
Most of you speak English already
so we can skip that.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,509
- How long have you been here?
- Eight years.

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,075
You don't seem to know anything.
This is the worst tour ever.

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,948
It's the worst school ever.
Doesn't anything cool happen?

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,792
Yeah, cool stuff happens.

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,236
This university
is the coolest place in the world.

28
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,437
That's because
he's never been anywhere else.

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,351
Go ahead, laugh all you want.

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,793
But the fact is, this is the setting
for the greatest story ever told.

31
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,359
OK?

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,399
It's about this guy I knew,
Josh Parker,

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,436
and his girlfriend, Tiffany.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,671
It's one of the most
fascinating journeys ever.

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,399
'Josh and Tiffany
were always together,

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,159
'starting from when they were little.

37
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,028
'They did everything as a team.

38
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,590
'When Tiffany was 10,
she had her tonsils taken out.

39
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,752
'Josh stayed in the hospital
for three days.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,717
'They were best friends.

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,155
'What started out as friendship...

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,473
'blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,236
'They spent so much time together
that even their dogs started dating.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,269
'They seemed destined
to be together forever.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,673
'But after high school, they faced
the most challenging challenge ever -

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,035
'a long-distance relationship.

47
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,278
'See, while Josh was enrolled here at
the wonderful University of Ithaca,

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,433
'Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,115
'But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,318
'to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship.'

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,753
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them ever imagined.

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,755
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,513
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,717
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on!

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,429
Seriously! I had to take
two birth control pills today.

56
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,034
You wanna help me study
again tonight?

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,156
Forget tonight. Come over now.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,390
Let's blow this class off.

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,630
'Tiffany and Carla can't come to the
phone but please leave a message.'

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,518
Hey, Tif, it's me... again.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,673
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still trying to get hold of you.

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,196
Everything's cool, though.
I'll catch you later.

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,236
Call me back, OK? OK. Bye.

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,789
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video.

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,713
I haven't talked to you
in a few days and...

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,519
I'm thinking you don't like me...
I'm kidding.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,352
Hey, guys.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,672
But I am getting a little worried so
gimme a call when you get a chance.

69
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,318
Barry says hi.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,358
So gimme a call
as soon as you can. I miss you.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,836
Call me, OK? Bye.

72
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,151
- What's up, guys?
- Not much. You?

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,312
I was just finishing my tape to Tif.

74
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,791
Mitch, what are you doing?
Are you hungry? Huh?

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,395
- You gonna feed him?
- No, I'm checking the temperature.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,598
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,590
Can I drop a mouse in?

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,114
Mitch only eats once a week,
on Saturdays.

79
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,237
Maybe we could cut a mouse in half,

80
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,029
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

81
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,510
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now?

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,592
What time is it? Oh, shit!

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,070
Do me a favor -
when this is rewound, mail it for me?

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,038
- No problem. Leave it there.
- Thanks, man.

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,509
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,200
Can we please feed him now?

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,236
No. If you overfeed him he could die.

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,470
So? It'll be worth it.

89
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,914
- Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,911
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,195
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

92
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,989
Studying. I'm starting
to question this college thing.

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,036
There's so much reading.

94
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,918
- Right.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,315
- You going to EL's tonight?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,392
I gotta run,
class has started.

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,156
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry.

98
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,357
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it?

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,716
- It's not your business, Jacob.
- I can tell.

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,554
- I'm not having this conversation.
- What conversation?

101
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,552
You need to stop this.
We're not a couple.

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,279
We've never been a couple,
and never will.

103
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,270
This week
I'd like you to think about

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,033
Plato's Dialogues
of the middle years.

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,636
"The Republic", "Phaedo",
"Symposium".

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,157
Now, this will all be
on next week's mid-term,

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,276
so I suggest you read up on it.

108
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,831
Ah, Jacob,
do you have anything to add?

109
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,392
Just a reminder.

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,950
The mid-term will cover
all of the in-class lectures

111
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,237
as well as
all of the assigned readings.

112
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,074
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads.

113
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,550
I prefer yellow.
It's easier on the eyes.

114
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,189
OK. OK? Yeah. Thank you, Jacob.

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,956
And... see you all next week
for the mid-term.

116
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,234
- Josh.
- Yes?

117
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,074
I saw you hitting on Beth.
NOT a good idea.

118
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,720
- She's spoken for.
- What?

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,031
She'll come back to me.
They always do.

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,076
So... Mr. Parker.

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,789
Do you intend
to be ready for this exam?

122
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,031
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

123
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,271
Because I was
looking over the books last night

124
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,909
and you need a B on this test
just to pass this class.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,992
Actually,
I double-checked that, Professor.

126
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,548
He needs a B+.
We can't bend on this.

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,755
I got it.

128
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,156
- Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays.

129
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,913
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,470
I might lose my financial aid
or not be allowed back.

131
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,312
Well, you're fucked, then.

132
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,518
So come to my party, hook up
with Beth, and enjoy your last week.

133
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,390
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I'm invested in this relationship.

134
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,519
Invested? Who are you, Charles
Schwab? Listen to yourself!

135
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,477
I would give my life...

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,916
for one evening
of consensual sex with that girl.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,514
I've gone this long without cheating.

138
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,318
You're already cheating!

139
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,392
Any time you pass up sex
you cheat yourself.

140
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,472
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs

141
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,030
and take advantage
of young girls is shrinking daily.

142
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,636
I gotta make a call.

143
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,395
I'm telling you, you pass this up,
it'll haunt you forever.

144
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,438
Your dick will never forgive you.

145
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,957
What do you think, man? Don't you
want to experience something new?

146
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,430
It ain't easy being Josh's penis.

147
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,149
We've been here two months,
and I feel like I'm in a coma.

148
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,674
- Stop it.
- I wish I was your dick, EL.

149
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,150
If something doesn't happen soon,
I'm gonna leave.

150
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,390
- Enough.
- 'Hello?'

151
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,189
Carla, it's Josh. Sorry to bother
you, is Tiffany around?

152
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,157
Tiffany is not here.

153
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,152
She didn't sleep here
last night... again.

154
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,710
And it would be great
if for one hour you didn't call.

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,394
- Right.
- If she wanted to talk to you

156
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,232
she'd call you.

157
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,276
Deal with it.

158
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,836
- You bitch!
- Does she sound hot?

159
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,117
We've never gone this long
without talking. Something's wrong.

160
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,953
She found someone else,
like you should.

161
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,989
The clock is ticking. Before you know
it you'll be 40 and paying for girls.

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,234
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

163
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,236
I should really warn you,

164
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,518
it's been known to affect
your decision-making abilities

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,591
and lower your inhibitions.

166
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,750
Good. That's the plan.

167
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,393
No, that-that's...
Yes, that is the plan.

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,198
- You bring cash?
- Why?

169
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,589
- We've got chicks for sale.
- What?

170
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,629
Trust me. I've been goin'
to this school seven years

171
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,474
and I know the key
to a well-rounded college education

172
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,710
is experimentation.

173
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,951
Let me show you.

174
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,837
This is an auction. Remember...

175
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,354
you are not buying the girl,

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,558
only her company, and sale does not
constitute sexual relations.

177
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,315
I know. Believe me, I've tried.

178
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,473
Without further ado,
let's introduce our first... person.

179
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,358
Laura!

180
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,351
Laura's from Long Island.

181
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,398
She likes the outdoors
and loves seafood.

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,268
- OK, let's start the bidding at $5!
- $3.50!

183
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,511
Good God, moneybags,
she's not a Happy Meal.

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,673
- $5.
- OK, we've got five. Do I hear 10?

185
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,957
10 bucks.

186
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,828
Who's got 15 bucks
for a lovely evening with Laura?!

187
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,799
OK, we got 15. Who can beat 15?
Going once, going twice...

188
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Sold... to the captain.

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,558
There you are.

190
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,949
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not much.

191
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,031
- You look great.
- Thank you.

192
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,872
You're welcome.

193
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,270
Listen, Jacob's here,
and he's a total psycho...

194
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,749
Can you go outbid him?

195
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,912
You know what,
I didn't bring that much money.

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,389
You don't understand. He's obsessed.

197
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,428
See? That's fun, right?

198
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,833
OK, OK. Now, I want you two
to kiss each other.

199
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,117
All right, has anyone seen Beth?
There she is!

200
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,670
Say hi to the crowd, Beth.

201
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,318
Hi.

202
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,270
Can I hear a $5 opening bid?

203
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,318
- $5 right here!
- Who can beat five?

204
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,994
- Seven.
- $10.

205
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,595
- $10! Going once. Going twice.
- $15!

206
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,114
- 20.
- 25!

207
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,431
25. Who can beat 25? Going once.

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,035
- Going twice.
- 26.

209
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,076
- 26, going once.
- 30!

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,278
- OK, can anyone beat $26?
- I just said 30!

211
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,920
There must be someone
who can beat $26?

212
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,118
- Me, right here! 30!
- Sold! To my man Josh for $26.

213
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,794
You heard me.
I bid $30 loud and clear.

214
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,393
Your bid didn't count.

215
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,436
- Why?
- Because you're a TA.

216
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,954
- So?
- This auction is for students.

217
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,678
Goodbye.

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,233
Thanks for doing that. I owe you one.

219
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,437
- You owe me more than one.
- Do I?

220
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,988
Technically.

221
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,877
Well...

222
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,315
are you ready to collect?

223
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,996
I think so. Yeah.

224
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,076
We're touching.

225
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,115
It's a lot of fun.

226
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,911
We're having a good time.

227
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,036
Who's Tiffany Henderson?

228
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,556
Just some girl I used to date
since I was, like, five.

229
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,996
But that's over now. She blew me off.

230
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,036
Oh, poor baby.

231
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,556
You must be very hurt.

232
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,552
Do you need some special attention?

233
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,234
Well, I am pretty upset.

234
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,911
Did that help?

235
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,956
That helped a lot.

236
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,678
I have an idea.

237
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,711
What do you say?

238
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,876
Uh, I don't think so.

239
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,996
Come on! It'll be fun.

240
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,470
- I've always wanted to try this.
- No...

241
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,073
Yes.

242
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,549
I'm gonna interview you.

243
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,151
Fine.

244
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,071
OK.

245
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,228
- OK, Josh.
- Yes.

246
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,119
What do you look for in a girl?

247
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,751
Um, well, let's see.

248
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,913
She should be smart and funny and...

249
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,590
That's good, too.

250
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,195
Do you feel better yet?

251
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,956
I feel a little bit better.
Yeah. A little...

252
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,349
What else do you look for?

253
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,149
She should be attractive and...

254
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,630
nice and...

255
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,719
Topless. And topless.

256
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,035
And she should kiss me.

257
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,472
What else?

258
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,909
She shouldn't stop kissing me.

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,309
Why don't you keep doing that?

260
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,231
What are you so happy about?

261
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,471
I don't know.
Do I seem happy this morning?

262
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,711
Well, you're bouncing around here.

263
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,394
You do seem
unusually light-hearted.

264
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,234
Maybe it's because I had
the best time of my life last night.

265
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,232
Twice! And once this morning.

266
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,311
You and Beth?

267
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,358
- Oh, yeah.
- Shut up. What happened?

268
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,791
No way! You're lying.

269
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,030
I'm not lying.

270
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,635
You can't make out with someone
then pretend you had sex.

271
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,234
- That's really uncool.
- I'm not pretending.

272
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,596
Forget it. I know you're lying.
I guarantee it.

273
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,910
You wanna bet?

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,436
Great. I'm gonna bet
on something you can't prove.

275
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,748
You videotaped it!

276
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,832
No, no, no, I didn't!
Gimme that! Gimme that!

277
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,595
- No way! This is amazing!
- I was kidding, I was kidding!

278
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,716
- Gimme the tape.
- Huh? Come on.

279
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,679
- We're gonna see it sooner or later.
- He's got a point.

280
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,068
Oh-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no!

281
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Give it to me. No, give it to me.

282
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,713
- EL, no.
- Josh, please? We need this.

283
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,232
OK, listen, seriously.
You can't tell anyone you saw this.

284
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,799
Oh, yeah.

285
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,279
OK. OK!

286
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,238
Barry, hit the lights.

287
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,151
It's boner time!

288
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,311
'Hey, Tif. It's me
coming to you live from Ithaca.'

289
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,710
I thought I asked you
to mail this yesterday?

290
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,030
Yeah, you did. I mailed it today.

291
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,588
Fast-forward to the horny stuff.

292
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,197
Is this the shit
you've been sending Tiffany?

293
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,438
Oh, my God.

294
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,830
Oh, fuck!

295
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,514
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

296
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,556
Oh, God!

297
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,836
W-wait a second.

298
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,872
Tell me you mailed
the Beth tape to Tiffany.

299
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,713
Yes!

300
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,872
Shit! Oh, no! Oh, no!

301
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,393
Hey, hey.

302
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,391
Did you make a copy?

303
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,075
If you made a copy,
we could watch the copy.

304
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,436
Don't answer it!

305
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,474
'Hey, it's
Josh and Rubin. Leave a message.'

306
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,676
'Hi, Josh. It's Tiffany.

307
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,796
'Sorry we haven't spoken.

308
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,519
'Listen, my grandfather passed away.

309
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,309
'I've tried calling you
a few times, but no one picked up.

310
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,836
'I didn't want to leave
this message on your machine

311
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,276
'but by now you're probably
a little worried so...

312
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,636
'Anyway, I'm at my parents'
house helping my mom.

313
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,358
'She's really a wreck.

314
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,398
'If I don't speak with you,
I'll call Monday.

315
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,155
'I'll be OK. I just need some time.

316
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,992
'Bye. I love you.'

317
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,709
That's not fair.

318
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,031
How come she gets to see the tape
and we don't?

319
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,557
She gets back there Monday.
That leaves three days to get there.

320
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,915
Get where? Austin?

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,231
- That's like 10,000 miles from here.
- 1,800.

322
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,757
You wanna drive 1,800 miles
in three days? Just fly.

323
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,434
Do you have money for a ticket?
I don't.

324
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,751
- All right, so we're driving.
- You're coming?

325
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,037
What else am I gonna do,
stay here and learn?

326
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,633
Road trip.

327
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,757
Just a minute. Hold on.

328
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,559
He's probably jackin' off.

329
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,916
What do you guys want?

330
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,672
Kyle, this is an emergency.

331
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,951
Wait. Let me at least
go back and call my dad.

332
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,350
Call your dad?
Would you listen to yourself?

333
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,716
You're 19 years old,
and you're a fucking sissy.

334
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,997
All you ever do is sit
in a library and play Myst.

335
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,991
It's pathetic.

336
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,119
He's trying to say that
this is your chance to do something.

337
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,033
Be a risk-taker. Come with us.

338
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,676
You're just saying that
because you want my car.

339
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,070
No! No, we've always liked you.

340
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,470
Or just give us the car.
That would make him a risk-taker.

341
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,711
Shut up, all right?
He's coming with us.

342
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,394
Come on, Kyle. It'll be fun!

343
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,312
Aren't you even curious
where we're going?

344
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,192
No.

345
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,592
OK, we're going to the University
of Austin. Sure you won't come?

346
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,035
I don't like Massachusetts.

347
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,669
Austin's in Texas.
You're thinking of Boston.

348
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,433
You've never left this town,
have you?

349
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,476
No, not really.

350
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,472
That could turn
into a debilitating phobia.

351
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,118
OK.

352
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,953
- Can I feed Mitch?
- Yes, actually you can.

353
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,713
There's a brown box of mice
by his cage.

354
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,030
Give him one tomorrow. Just one.

355
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,833
- I'll feed him a mouse tomorrow.
- OK.

356
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,515
You can count on me.
OK? I'm reliable. OK?

357
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,990
You guys do good.
Have a good trip, safe trip.

358
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,470
Buckle up your seat belt.
I'm gonna feed the snake!

359
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,632
I'll feed the snake,
I'll watch the snake.

360
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,551
'So off they went.'

361
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,269
They had 1,800 miles to go,
and only three days to do it.

362
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,638
It was a killer journey and one
that changed them all forever.

363
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,631
The end.

364
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,390
- So we're gonna go look over here.
- Whoa. That's it? This story sucks.

365
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,439
- What happened with the tape?
- Right. The tape.

366
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,317
Well, um...

367
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,439
Well... Like I said,
they were on a race against time.

368
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,475
Since we didn't get to see the tape,

369
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,028
- can you at least describe it?
- No.

370
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,593
Admit that Beth is amazing.

371
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,513
I admit it, she's amazing.
She's perfect.

372
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,151
I don't know why you feel so guilty.
Technically you haven't cheated.

373
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,196
What are you talking about?

374
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,953
There are these rules that guys have,

375
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,476
an understanding
as to what constitutes cheating.

376
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,279
Take your situation, for example.

377
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,237
It's not cheating.

378
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,757
Not when you're in a different
area code - not to mention state!

379
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,671
That makes no sense.

380
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,797
Don't look at me, Kyle.
I don't make the rules.

381
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,269
This is legit. I've read an article.

382
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,591
There's a whole bunch of them,
like loopholes.

383
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,195
Say you were sleeping with
two girls at the same time,

384
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,750
it's not cheating
because they cancel each other out.

385
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,512
- Ahh.
- Exactly!

386
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,273
Or if you're too wasted
to remember...

387
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,191
It is not cheating.

388
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,999
Because if you
can't really remember it,

389
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,877
it never really took place.

390
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,109
OK, I've got one. Ready?

391
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,919
It's OK if you spread peanut butter
on your testicles

392
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,389
and let your dog lick it off.

393
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,552
- Because it's your dog!
- Jesus Christ!

394
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,757
- You know, because it's your dog!
- We got it.

395
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,070
Somebody's gonna die tomorrow.

396
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,596
That's right.
One of you is marked for death.

397
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,393
And first thing tomorrow morning,

398
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,756
a chosen one
will experience nature's wrath

399
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,796
in all its fury.

400
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,350
Who are you?

401
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,078
I'm Beth.

402
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,037
Are you here for the feeding?

403
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,951
Excuse me?

404
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,998
You're early. It's not till tomorrow.

405
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,911
You should come back.

406
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,150
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

407
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,151
I think I'll pass.

408
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,031
Have you seen Josh?

409
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,036
He went to visit his girlfriend.

410
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,076
Tiffany?

411
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,516
I thought they broke up.

412
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,037
I mean this girl who's a friend
of his. You know what I mean.

413
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,792
Where did he go?

414
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,031
Austin?

415
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,072
Austin, Massachusetts?

416
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,358
You mean Boston, Massachusetts?

417
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,398
Yeah, that's what I said. Boston.

418
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,397
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

419
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,199
He is such an asshole.

420
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,511
I can't believe
he just lied to my face like that.

421
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,355
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that?

422
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,149
- She was topless?
- Girls don't stand around naked.

423
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,438
Yeah, they do. OK? This is my story.
You wanna hear it or not?

424
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,116
- It just doesn't make any...
- Shh. Please, no interruptions, OK?

425
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,511
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked! Really naked!

426
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,274
I know guys can be jerks.

427
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,036
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

428
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,793
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

429
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,711
All men are perverted pigs.

430
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,595
All they care about...
really, all they THINK about is sex.

431
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,470
- You're so right. I feel so used.
- Face it, we're all used.

432
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,835
In most men's eyes, we're just flesh.

433
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,708
- It's so sick!
- It IS sick. Think about it.

434
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,756
If they had it their way...

435
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,877
God, I don't even want to know
what would happen

436
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,269
if they had it their way!

437
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,352
What am I supposed to do
now that he's gone?

438
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,317
- Go to Boston and bust his ass.
- Right.

439
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,152
Confront him
and his little girlfriend.

440
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,196
Face to face. You totally should!

441
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,319
Show her what an asshole Josh is,
right?

442
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,833
Hmm...

443
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,678
Ooh! These, too.

444
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,190
Kyle, come here for a second.

445
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,953
We're a little
short on cash right now,

446
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,838
so we need to put this
on your credit card.

447
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,674
We'll give you the cash
when we get back, I promise.

448
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,309
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

449
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,874
Hello! This IS an emergency.

450
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,077
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt?

451
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,350
We're in no-man's-land.

452
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,034
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

453
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,999
This is gonna save us five hours,
minimum. Thank me later.

454
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,435
We should go back to the interstate.

455
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,717
- We're not goin' back.
- Yeah, have some faith.

456
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,837
It's a challenge.
That's why it's a short cut.

457
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,434
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

458
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,398
Damn it! Fuck!

459
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,677
I give us 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

460
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,469
If we turn around we'll lose
five hours backtracking.

461
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,634
Turn around? Why? Because of this?
We could make it.

462
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,395
Make it? You mean jump it?

463
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,756
No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.

464
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,994
It can be done. This incline
is 30 degrees roughly, right?

465
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,913
The factory weight
of the car is 1,600lbs.

466
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,592
Add us, plus cargo...

467
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,877
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50mph,

468
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,077
our trajectory
will clear 10 feet, easy.

469
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,912
No way. Absolutely not.

470
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,195
We'll go 60 just to be certain.

471
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,999
We're goin' back.
It's impossible.

472
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,752
You sure?

473
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,354
With physics I'm always sure.

474
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,158
I'm driving.

475
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,276
I don't think you guys heard me.

476
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,716
This is my car
and we're not gonna jump any rivers.

477
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,839
Kyle, it's 10 feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

478
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,275
Look, I can spit across this gap.

479
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,312
Yeah.

480
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,833
Well...

481
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,876
better make it 75.

482
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,032
- OK. Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

483
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,795
No, you guys. No.
EL, get out of my car.

484
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,791
Kyle, in the car. Come on.

485
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,518
We're OK.

486
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,116
You know we need to hit 60?

487
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,634
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop!

488
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,551
Thank you! Yes!

489
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,870
What did I tell you?

490
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,436
Oh, my God.

491
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,472
Oh, my God!

492
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,279
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

493
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,590
I only said we'd make it across.

494
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,433
I never said
the wheels would stay on.

495
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,795
What the hell are we gonna do now?!

496
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,950
I'm totally screwed!

497
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,113
I don't have time...
to be walking... through the woods!

498
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,829
Josh, we'll call a tow truck,
have the axles fixed.

499
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,390
We'll lose half a day at most.
It's just the wheels.

500
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,988
The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

501
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,753
they just turn around
and screw me over.

502
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,553
Just something about Josh,
he's just different.

503
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,710
I feel like we had a connection.

504
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,792
I don't think
I'll ever be able to trust a guy.

505
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,550
You shouldn't! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was back in 1985

506
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,313
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

507
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,439
It was a regular-size van.
Before that mini-van crap.

508
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,828
So there's no hope, huh?

509
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,230
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

510
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,197
You can keep that.

511
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,714
God. Crap.

512
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,914
Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

513
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,673
We almost died in that explosion.

514
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,356
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

515
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,228
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

516
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,392
I must live.

517
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,156
Yeah, right. We all must live.

518
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,437
Before we do that,
we must get back on the road.

519
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,752
We shouldn't be going
to sleep right now!

520
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,832
'Let's just lay
an indication here and there.'

521
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,034
'And a whole bunch of color...'

522
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,796
Excuse me.

523
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,319
I'm sorry, do you need to get that?

524
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,516
Do you need something?

525
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,910
Yeah.
This is sort of an unusual question.

526
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,072
But do you have any marijuana
I might buy?

527
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,039
Our car exploded last night
and I'm practically all out.

528
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,190
Am I a drug dealer?

529
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,829
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking, though.

530
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,673
No? OK, that's OK. Thanks.

531
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,354
Is there anything else
I can help with?

532
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,797
Perhaps you'd like an 11-year-old
prostitute. We can do that.

533
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,519
Or maybe we can off someone
for you. Huh?

534
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,149
I've got it.
Why don't we start small?

535
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,629
Would you like a fresh towel?

536
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,029
You could roll that up and smoke it.

537
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,192
Dick.

538
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,236
By the way, Cheech,

539
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,517
that credit card
you guys gave me was maxed out,

540
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,549
so don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

541
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,716
Um, Mr. Earl Edwards?

542
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,792
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

543
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,998
That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

544
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,676
I tried three times, sir. If you
have another card, I'd be happy to...

545
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,716
Don't give me any attitude.

546
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,598
You go fix
that little toy back there,

547
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,636
and charge this friggin' card.

548
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,075
We've been coming here for 20 years.

549
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,438
- We've only been open eight years.
- Do it now.

550
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,510
Relax, it's not a big deal.

551
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,878
You don't understand,
when Josh finds out he'll freak.

552
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,748
You can't rent a car without
a credit card. You just can't.

553
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,115
So, what are we gonna do?

554
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,076
Tell you what. Stay here.

555
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,958
Take him out
for breakfast or something.

556
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,076
I'll go take care of this.

557
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,549
Earl, Cookie, we have a situation.
Now, brace yourselves.

558
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,872
The police have found Kyle's car
abandoned in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

559
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,315
It's been blown to bits.

560
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,039
We checked with the university -
he's missing.

561
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,473
Mother of God.

562
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,077
- Good morning.
- Hello.

563
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,151
Hi. How can I help you?

564
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,998
Yeah, hi. I was sent over here
to check out bus 111,

565
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,755
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

566
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,753
You seem to be having problems
with the... rotator splint.

567
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,910
Engines have rotator splints?

568
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,592
Yeah.

569
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,513
She runs good now, but not for long.

570
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,717
I can have it back to you
as good as new in a week.

571
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,512
Let's see.
Well, Jared's still in Aliquippa,

572
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,512
- I take it he called you from there?
- Yeah.

573
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,117
Five days.
Well, I think we can work that out.

574
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,555
Would you please not feed my dog?

575
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,998
I didn't.

576
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,992
You can't feed
Seeing Eye dogs treats.

577
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,709
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

578
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,155
Don't roll your eyes at me.

579
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,473
French toast.

580
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,835
Bacon. Good for you.

581
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,115
- And scrambled eggs.
- Thank you.

582
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,512
Excuse me, but this has powdered
sugar on it, and I ordered no sugar.

583
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,433
I can't have
too much sugar in the morning.

584
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,637
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're absolutely right.

585
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,396
Tell you what, let me take this back
and bring you out a new piece.

586
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,790
Is everybody good? OK, great.

587
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,475
Do you know where my possessions are,
because I can't...

588
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,758
- Wait, no. They were in the car.
- That's... that's hilarious.

589
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,919
All right,
let me warm that up for you.

590
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,991
- There you go.
- Thanks.

591
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,872
Excuse me. And the French toast
will be out in just a minute.

592
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,599
- OK, thank you.
- OK, great.

593
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,070
French toast, no sugar.

594
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,391
- All right? Sorry about that.
- No problem.

595
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,077
That's a nice guy.

596
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,470
It's good.

597
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,676
OK!

598
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,515
I don't wanna know
how you got this.

599
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,195
- I stole it from a blind chick.
- I don't wanna know.

600
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,999
What? I'm gonna give it back.

601
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,911
Probably.

602
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,074
Can we please stop soon?
I need to use the bathroom.

603
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,836
Actually, I don't have to go yet,
so we'll stop in a couple of hours.

604
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,797
OK.

605
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,395
I'm kidding, Kyle. We'll stop.

606
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,234
Jeez, you have to stand up
for yourself. Be more assertive.

607
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,390
OK.

608
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,119
What's your deal?
Why are you so worried?

609
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,829
I don't know. I guess it's my dad.

610
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,997
He's, like... strict.

611
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,596
He really is gonna kill me
when he finds out about that car.

612
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,877
So you screwed up. Big deal.
People make mistakes.

613
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,431
He'll get over it.
Besides, that car sucked anyways.

614
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,354
I really do need
to go to the bathroom.

615
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,716
- We're makin' a pit stop.
- Again?!

616
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,472
You're about to experience
first-hand...

617
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,076
exactly what it means to be in
the lower region of the food chain.

618
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,948
Mitch is going to bite into you.

619
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,474
He's going to squeeze.

620
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,190
He'll actually start digesting you
while you're still alive.

621
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,396
But don't be scared.

622
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,476
No. No, no.

623
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,509
It'll be a quick death.

624
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,753
Be brave.

625
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,513
You'll barely feel it.

626
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,318
Come on.

627
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,469
Come on. You gonna fuckin' eat him?

628
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,275
Josh, wait up a second.

629
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,511
This is supposed to be a road trip.

630
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,473
All we do is drive the whole time.
It's ridiculous.

631
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,950
- No one forced you to come.
- We're making great time.

632
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,350
And if Tiffany saw that tape,
it'd be a good thing.

633
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,476
What is that supposed to mean?

634
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,758
Beth is an angel. She's here
to help you change your life.

635
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,515
Besides, did Tiffany
ever let you videotape her?

636
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,556
I think not.

637
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,596
It's a sign, Josh.

638
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
Hello?

639
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,153
- 'Professor Anderson?'
- Who's calling?

640
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,152
Hi, Professor, it's Josh Parker.

641
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,151
Oh, uh...

642
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,915
Hello, Josh.
What can I do for you?

643
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,754
- Well, I was in a car accident.
- 'Oh. Oh, my God.'

644
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,798
I'm OK.
It's just I'm in kind of a bind.

645
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,474
All my notes and books
were destroyed.

646
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,154
Is it possible to get an extension?

647
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,312
'Maybe take the mid-term
a couple days later?'

648
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,312
Oh, sure.
Yes, it sounds like an emergency.

649
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,312
How about an extra three days?

650
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,154
- 'Would that work?'
- Yeah, that would be fantastic!

651
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,232
- Are you sure?
- 'Just glad you're not hurt.'

652
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,436
I'm marking it down right now.

653
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,239
'That's great, Professor. Thank you.'

654
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,231
OK, goodbye.

655
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,515
Who was that?

656
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,479
Oh, that... that was Josh Parker.

657
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,869
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

658
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,431
He was just confirming
the date of the exam. Such a worrier.

659
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,598
It's gonna be OK. I'll find him.

660
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,673
And we'll find whoever did this,
I promise. It's gonna be OK.

661
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,754
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody
was raped and murdered here.

662
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,035
What the hell gives you that idea?

663
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,634
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

664
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,798
- Well?
- Nothing yet.

665
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,668
Good thing is,
there's no evidence of a struggle.

666
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,990
No blood or clothing or anything.

667
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,640
And we haven't found
a single drop of semen yet.

668
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,834
Hi. I'm visiting my friend from home.

669
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,310
But she doesn't know I'm coming.
It's a surprise.

670
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,356
How nice. How can I help you?

671
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,989
I've never been here before.
I don't know where she lives.

672
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,435
What's her name? I can look it up.

673
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,715
Oh, OK. Tiffany Henderson.

674
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,396
Do I know you?

675
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,916
No, you don't.
Actually, I know your boyfriend.

676
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,230
OK. Who are you?

677
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,552
I'm Beth.
Could we just sit down for a minute?

678
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,636
OK.

679
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,914
Um, this is really hard for me,

680
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,231
but it's definitely
something you should hear.

681
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,836
Your boyfriend is cheating on you...
with me.

682
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,355
We were together Thursday night.

683
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,476
Twice.

684
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,028
And once again Friday morning.

685
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,997
I thought you should know.

686
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,797
Sorry.

687
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,152
Tiffany! What the hell are you doing?

688
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,276
- Who's that guy?
- That's her boyfriend.

689
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,231
THAT's her boyfriend?

690
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,914
Yeah. He's been cheating on her.

691
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,990
Baby, I love you!

692
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,511
I-I'm sorry,

693
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,390
but you have the most beautiful feet.

694
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,598
Ohh... Would you like
a foot massage?

695
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,592
No, I would not like a foot massage.

696
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,956
I would hate
a foot massage!

697
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,270
OK. I'm sorry. Relax.

698
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,036
Are there any guys out there
who are just normal?! Huh?!

699
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,590
Unleash the fury, Mitch.

700
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,674
Unleash the fury.

701
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,559
Come on, Mitch.

702
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,119
Eat him.

703
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,032
Please, Mitch. Go get him, boy.

704
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,913
He's right there. Kill him.

705
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,117
Maim him. Bite him.

706
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,752
UNLEASH THE FURY!

707
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,871
Wow, this is cool.

708
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,032
I've never been in
a fraternity house before.

709
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,637
Is this gonna work?

710
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,076
Of course it's gonna work.
I know the handshake.

711
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,311
Hi.

712
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,198
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

713
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,590
I'm Rubin Carver,
a Xi Chi brother from Ithaca.

714
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,275
We're just passing through
and looking for a place to party,

715
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,555
maybe even a place to crash.

716
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,869
Xi. Chi. Xi, Chi.
Xi, Xi, Xi.

717
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,473
Chi.

718
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,152
Hmph.

719
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,553
Wow!

720
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,513
Ahem. Uh, everyone, this is Rubin.

721
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,469
Apparently, Rubin is our fraternity
brother from our Ithaca chapter.

722
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,438
These are his friends.

723
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,599
Listen, uh, we've interrupted
your dinner so we'll just...

724
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,875
Hey, don't be crazy.

725
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,758
There's plenty of food to go around.

726
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,796
You guys are welcome to stay.

727
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,275
You know, this food's pretty good.

728
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,592
Hey, you do realize
this is a national black fraternity?

729
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,716
They know you're not a member.

730
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,870
I'm sorry. I don't think
about that kind of stuff.

731
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,316
OK, relax. OK?
They're just messing with us.

732
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,391
They're pissed because he lied.

733
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,193
- I say we get out of here.
- Shh, relax.

734
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,475
Someone's got some explaining to do.

735
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,996
- Look what we found in his bag.
- What?! What is that?!

736
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,674
No, I've never seen that before!

737
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,832
What are you doin'?
Are you in the Ku Klux Klan?

738
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,071
- Whoa, whoa. That is not ours.
- That's not mine!

739
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,789
OK, hold on, th-there's
obviously some explanation.

740
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,590
Yeah, there is. See, your boy's
an evil bigot and now he's gonna die.

741
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,477
Justice!

742
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,638
Kyle. Kyle.

743
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,790
Kyle!

744
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,634
There you are. I thought we lost you.

745
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,193
- Am I in the hospital?
- You passed out.

746
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,272
They were messin' with us, Kyle.
It was a joke.

747
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,439
Racist?
But I watch Oprah Winfrey every day.

748
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,353
It was a joke, outtie. A joke!

749
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,908
I get it.

750
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,309
Sure, put a Klan hood in my bag.

751
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,073
Yeah. Oh, that's funny.

752
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,832
Whoa.

753
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,672
I need a wine cooler.

754
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,035
- Hey, have mine.
- Thanks.

755
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,917
Isn't he just
the cutest little thing?

756
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,594
Oh, yeah, Kyle's the man!

757
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,475
You mean never? Not even once?

758
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,794
Well... I mean, I've had sex before.

759
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,235
Just, um,

760
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,629
never with a person.

761
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,472
Right.

762
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,040
Well, I think that's kinda cool.

763
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,760
- You do?
- Yeah.

764
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,833
I mean, you should hold out.
It should be special.

765
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,989
Wait till you're in love.

766
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,676
I think I love you.

767
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,716
You are so cute.

768
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,877
I take it you don't have a condom?

769
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,633
Uh... no.

770
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,314
Um, I guess I'm all out.

771
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,316
Well, Lawrence probably has some.

772
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,436
Why don't you try that drawer?

773
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,478
Next to the Old Spice,
behind the belts.

774
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,956
Good guess.

775
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,918
You know what?

776
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,949
Um, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing and, um...

777
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,270
I'm... Oof.

778
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,672
Shhh. Relax, baby.
Let Rhonda handle this.

779
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,314
- Thanks for a great time.
- Take care.

780
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,152
Stay cool.

781
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,958
Hey, Devon.

782
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,757
What's up?

783
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,833
Let's go, Kyle.
We want details. What happened?

784
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,549
Well, we had a few drinks,

785
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,835
danced a little, and, you know...

786
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,878
No, we don't know.
Why don't you tell us?

787
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,388
What the hell is that?

788
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,550
Did you kill a cheetah?

789
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,509
What? No. These are her underwear.
She gave 'em to me.

790
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,512
I boinked her!

791
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,352
Boinked?

792
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,477
Yeah, did you just say
the word "boinked?"

793
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,835
Well, Kyle,

794
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,957
I hope you got the boinking
out of your system,

795
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,759
cos we got a lot of driving
to do today.

796
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,753
Do not get your hopes up
about visiting Graceland,

797
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,796
cos we're about the mission at hand.

798
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,838
- Josh.
- What?

799
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,356
That sounds like a good plan,
except for one little thing.

800
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,637
- What little thing?
- We're out of money.

801
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,110
OK, before you fill out these,
I have to ask some questions.

802
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,909
If you qualify, you can
make a sperm deposit. Understood?

803
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,150
Mm-hmm. Fire away.

804
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,155
Tell the truth, because if you don't
the test will and you won't get paid.

805
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,631
So, first off, have any of you
done any drugs in the past 36 hours?

806
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,870
And that includes marijuana.

807
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,915
OK, next.

808
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,154
Have any of you had sex
or masturbated in the past 24 hours?

809
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,708
Well, I guess I'm out.

810
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,553
Because I had sex last night...

811
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,517
with a girl!

812
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,592
That's nice.

813
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,070
You'll find everything you need
in these binders.

814
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,720
Would you each take a cup.

815
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,155
- OK.
- And yours.

816
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,438
I'd appreciate it if you'd
return those after you're finished.

817
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,397
OK. Uh, thanks.

818
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,038
Cheers.

819
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,874
Excuse me. Do you have anything
with Asian women?

820
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,919
I have this thing for Asian chicks,
and there's none here.

821
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,436
This isn't Peep World.
Our selection is limited.

822
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,114
- You're gonna have to make do.
- OK.

823
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,555
You've been more than helpful.

824
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,470
Is something wrong?

825
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,516
Well, no.

826
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,712
But... I just couldn't help
but notice that...

827
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,155
Is there something between us?

828
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,391
I mean, I was thinking
that maybe you might want to...

829
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,552
I don't know...
help me out with a little...

830
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,359
professional assistance?

831
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,280
Do you need some help?

832
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,158
Yes, I do.

833
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,198
'Dr. Morris, dial 1-1-8, please.

834
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,471
'Dr. Morris, please dial 1-1-8.'

835
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,398
The moment I saw you out there,
I thought you were incredible.

836
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,359
You're not like most of the girls
I know. You're a woman.

837
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,991
That's fine. Turn around, drop your
pants, hands flat on the table.

838
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,640
Oh, my God.

839
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,837
- This is great. Wow. Like this?
- Exactly.

840
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,154
I have to admit,
I love you in that uniform.

841
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,279
Do those nylons go all the way up,
or are they, like thigh high?

842
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,830
I'm gonna perform a procedure
called milking the prostate.

843
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,115
It's an anally-induced ejaculation.

844
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,270
Anal?

845
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,751
You're gonna feel strong pressure
from inside your rectum.

846
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,115
Come on, you don't have
to get all scientific, baby.

847
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,918
I mean, we can just talk...

848
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,468
Stop! OK, keep doin' it. Yaaah!

849
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,030
Right there! Ahhh!

850
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,957
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

851
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,875
OK. All done.

852
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,318
That was awesome!

853
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,999
Wait. Wait. Does that work?

854
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,789
I mean,
is it even medically possible?

855
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,269
Oh, yeah, it works.

856
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,316
It works like a charm.

857
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,550
But back to our story.

858
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,200
'It was Sunday morning
back in Ithaca,

859
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,590
'when things suddenly took
an unexpected turn.'

860
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,879
I'm a mouse.
I'm a mouse. Eat me. Eat me.

861
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,509
Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.
Eat me. Eat me.

862
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,989
Come on.

863
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,311
You better eat him, Mitch,
before I do.

864
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,960
He's tasty.

865
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,152
He's tasty, Mitch. Oh! Oh!

866
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,389
Mmm! Mmm!

867
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,109
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Why'd you lie to me?

868
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,949
I didn't lie.

869
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,998
You-you told me
that Josh went to Boston.

870
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,038
- I didn't. I said Austin.
- You said Boston.

871
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,510
Because of you,
some guy's life is ruined.

872
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,832
So what? Besides, wherever he went,
he went because of you.

873
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:37,316
- What do you mean, because of me?
- Look, it's obvious.

874
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,597
Josh likes you. It's disgusting.

875
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,955
I knew you'd come back.

876
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,874
- What do you want?
- So, how was your getaway with Josh?

877
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,509
- I wasn't with Josh.
- Sure. Doesn't matter, though.

878
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,114
Cos Josh won't be back next semester.

879
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,509
He's about to flunk philosophy.

880
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,037
- What are you talking about?
- He thinks that he has an extension,

881
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:05,148
but thanks to
a... certain someone - me -

882
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,913
he doesn't.

883
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,992
He's an idiot.
You psycho.

884
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,034
Oh, my God!

885
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,557
'That night I set the guys up
at my grandparents' house.

886
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,995
'I haven't been there in a long time.

887
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,311
'When I was seven years old
I set their dog on fire

888
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,072
'and wasn't invited back.

889
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,355
'But I hear it's still real nice.'

890
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,399
I'm serious. "Please",
"Thank you", "This is delicious"

891
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,278
are the only words
you're allowed to say.

892
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,875
What? I'm great with old people.
Grandmas love me.

893
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,475
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. "Manilow"?

894
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,915
- Barry's last name is Manilow?
- Yeah.

895
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,355
- His name is Barry Manilow?
- Yeah.

896
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,558
- Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

897
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,916
Oh, look at you boys.

898
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,070
Jack, they're here!

899
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,636
Jack, Barry's friends are here.
Come and say hi.

900
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,188
The boys are here.

901
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,875
- Oh, hey, fellas.
- Hi.

902
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,918
- Hey, how's it going?
- Wait. Let me get up.

903
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,549
- I'll give you guys the full tour.
- Oh, honey!

904
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,596
Careful. Your boner!

905
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,877
Well, what do you want me to do,
cut it off?

906
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,474
I'll tell you what, fellas,

907
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,269
we'll start by showin'
you where you're gonna sleep.

908
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,557
I'll show you
what we call the guest room.

909
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,519
Follow me, boys. The guest room...

910
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,397
Ohhh.

911
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,751
Excuse me.

912
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,991
You remember this kid?

913
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,833
No, sure don't.

914
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,356
Fuckin' airhead.

915
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,314
Let me ask you once more.
Have you seen my son?

916
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,393
Ow. Now that you mention it,
there were a few guys in.

917
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,153
If you loosen my arm,
I could get their bill.

918
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,435
Use your other arm.

919
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,716
- How many were there?
- A few.

920
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,473
Aaah! Four!

921
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,028
One of 'em was trying to score drugs.

922
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,194
Honey, look. They made two calls to
Austin, Texas. Maybe they went there.

923
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,195
Havin' a smoke?

924
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,153
Uh... yeah, yeah.

925
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,354
I can't sleep, either.

926
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,194
Goddam Viagra
gets my heart racing like a lab rat.

927
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,317
Are you OK?

928
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,392
- You look kinda goofy.
- No. No, it's nothing.

929
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,116
- Come on, out with it.
- OK.

930
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,557
Well... I almost died two days ago.

931
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,790
- What?
- Our car exploded.

932
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,996
I could be dead right now.

933
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,598
And since that happened,
I find myself asking why.

934
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,797
You know? Like...

935
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,836
What is my reason for living?

936
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,718
Are you gonna
pass that doobie, or what?

937
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,554
Doobie? Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

938
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,596
Uh, thanks.

939
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,754
You know what your problem is?

940
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,158
You're all brains.
Not enough cock and balls.

941
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,199
Actually, uh, people have been
telling me that my whole life.

942
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,278
In the sixth grade I got so worried
about the situation in Iraq,

943
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,999
that I was on
an adult dosage of Xanax.

944
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,356
And by eighth grade,
I was in therapy three times a week.

945
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:27,833
And the truth is, weed is the
only thing that could balance me out.

946
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,559
You know what I mean? Like...

947
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,872
You OK?

948
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,837
Hey, old man.

949
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,310
I got the fuckin' munchies real bad.

950
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,356
How 'bout you?

951
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,949
OK, Tiffany,
it's time to stop being so sad.

952
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,838
Look at all this mail you got!

953
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,912
Look how many nice people
care about you.

954
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,237
You even got a package from Josh.

955
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,753
Really?

956
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,274
Shall we open it
and see what he says?

957
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,113
Yeah, come on, Tif. Let's open it.

958
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,511
- It's a tape.
- Oh.

959
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,591
Well, pop it in.

960
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,148
Maybe I should watch this on my own.

961
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,196
Oh, come on.

962
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,513
This'll definitely cheer you up.

963
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,800
'What do you look for
in a girl?'

964
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,868
'Well, let's see.
She should be smart...'

965
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,952
'and, um, funny.

966
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,395
'And, uh...

967
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,480
'That's good... that's good, too.'

968
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,472
'What else do you look for?'

969
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,519
'Um... She should be, uh, attractive.

970
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,398
'And, um, topless.

971
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,233
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'And she should kiss me.'

972
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,356
Bye-bye.
You boys be good now.

973
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,159
- Bye-bye.
- I'll tell Barry you said hello.

974
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,477
Hey, Jack, have that bitch make me
some blueberry pancakes. Now.

975
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,276
Excuse me. Ahem.

976
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,430
www.episodetwo/spoilers...

977
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,317
back slash...

978
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,433
OK, look.
Some people are here

979
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,636
and they are being very rude.

980
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,676
OK. Call you back.

981
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,756
I'm sorry, but we need your help.

982
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,196
- Do you know Tiffany Henderson?
- Room 109.

983
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,236
Well, her grandfather died,

984
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,675
and she asked me
to pick up her mail.

985
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,718
Oh, how sad. Do you have the key?

986
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:59,119
Well, she didn't bring it to the
funeral so I was hoping you could...

987
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,033
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you need the key.

988
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,510
Don't worry. Her mail will be here,
safe and sound.

989
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,156
It's not like that, you see?
She needs something.

990
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,915
- This is an emergency.
- Don't make a big deal out of it.

991
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,630
Well, it's not a big deal, but
you need the key. Rules are rules.

992
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,838
No one's asking you to do anything
wrong. Just, you know, look away.

993
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,876
Go have an Eskimo pie.

994
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,235
You guys are gonna have to leave.

995
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,959
We're not leaving without that mail.

996
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,316
Listen to the man before you get
some Jackie Chan on your face.

997
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,551
- Come on, let's go.
- That means now, asshole.

998
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,596
Jesus!

999
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,475
I think he broke my nose. Oh, God!

1000
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,037
Come on, Susie.

1001
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,795
- You're a wrestler?
- You bet, Mary. You wanna go?

1002
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,836
- Let me see it.
- Oh, God!

1003
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,831
All right.

1004
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,353
- Who's my bitch?
- What?!

1005
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,398
That's it. No, no, no!

1006
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,120
OK, everyone, freeze!

1007
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,556
This here is pepper spray,
and we will use it.

1008
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,235
These guys jumped me.
I was just sitting behind my desk!

1009
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,237
Kyle?

1010
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,709
- Dad?
- That's your dad?

1011
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,870
Freeze now! Everybody freeze!

1012
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,155
Put your weapon down now!

1013
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,037
My son was kidnapped!

1014
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,998
Whoa, whoa... Who was kidnapped?

1015
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,356
I wasn't kidnapped.
These are my friends from school.

1016
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,076
What are you talkin' about?

1017
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,516
We all drove down here together.

1018
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,352
What?

1019
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,716
Then explain to me how
the frigging car got blown to hell!

1020
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,993
- Well, see...
- It was stolen.

1021
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,435
That's right. Tell him, Kyle.

1022
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,397
Uh-huh. Exactly.

1023
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,232
Stolen?

1024
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,029
What about the damned credit card?

1025
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,392
It was inside,
and that was stolen, too.

1026
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,996
Bullcrap! This is ridiculous! Why
didn't you tell us where you were?

1027
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,719
Because I knew you'd get mad! See?

1028
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,395
- I'm not mad! You're going with me.
- Josh?

1029
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,436
- Tiffany!
- What the... What's going on?

1030
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,399
- Nothing.
- Damn, dude, she is hot!

1031
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,274
My girlfriend's pagin' me.
Can we let them go?

1032
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,113
- Good idea.
- No one is going anywhere!

1033
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,715
- He's comin' with me.
- Get off of me!

1034
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,995
I'm going back with these guys.

1035
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,514
Shut your mouth and don't talk back.

1036
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,953
Why don't YOU shut up?

1037
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,634
What the hell did you just say to me?

1038
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,631
I said, you shut up.

1039
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,917
You've always told me
to stand up for myself.

1040
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,709
Well, now I am.
Leave me alone, you jerk!

1041
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,953
You ungrateful...

1042
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,990
- What...
- Go this way.

1043
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,036
Go away! Go away!

1044
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,272
What was that all about? I mean,
Josh, what are you doing here?

1045
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,590
I just missed you. That's all.

1046
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:29,470
I missed you, too, but it's crazy
for you to drive all the way here.

1047
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,313
What?
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

1048
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,918
I am. But Josh, you have your
entire life to live up at school.

1049
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,594
This isn't healthy. Besides...

1050
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,953
I realized a few things
this past week.

1051
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,474
You did? Like what?

1052
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,755
Like, we're in college.

1053
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:56,152
The window of opportunity to go out
and have fun and meet new people

1054
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,834
is getting smaller by the day.

1055
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,951
- It is?
- Come on, Josh.

1056
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,031
We've been together forever.

1057
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,033
I mean... you're pretty much
the only guy I've ever been with.

1058
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,032
What do you mean,
"pretty much the only guy"?

1059
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,318
Well, I was 14, and you were away
at camp, but that was years ago.

1060
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,153
Besides,
we're in different area codes.

1061
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,510
I've been thinking a lot
about us, too.

1062
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,630
The real reason I drove down...

1063
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,676
Hold that thought.

1064
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,713
Hello?

1065
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,836
Yeah, he's right here.

1066
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,797
Who is this?

1067
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,155
Hold on.

1068
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,674
It's for you. It's Beth.

1069
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,678
Who's Beth?

1070
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,677
Uh...

1071
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,955
Beth? What are you doing?

1072
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,068
I'm not sure what's going on between
us but I need to tell you something.

1073
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,676
I'm actually glad you called,
cos I wanted to tell you something.

1074
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,194
OK, you first.

1075
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,316
I can't really talk right now,

1076
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,437
but I'll explain everything
when I get back.

1077
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,829
'OK? Really. I promise.'

1078
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,717
Uh, I-I gotta get going, OK?

1079
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,076
- Wait! Do you want to hear mine?
- Right. Sorry.

1080
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,912
Is it good?

1081
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,560
Not really. Jacob lied to you.

1082
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,200
There's no extension
on your mid-term.

1083
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,633
What?

1084
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,429
'He tried to trick you. If you
don't get back you're gonna fail.'

1085
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,272
Shit!

1086
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,955
'She should be smart and funny.'

1087
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,032
- 'Aren't you glad I called?'
- Yes. Thank you.

1088
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,908
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, OK? Bye.

1089
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,752
- Is this for me?
- Hmm?

1090
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,229
Oh, God, no, no, no! You don't...

1091
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,232
What the hell is this?

1092
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,676
'I can see myself on TV,
I think it must be rewound.'

1093
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,398
It's Barry.

1094
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,357
'Hey, look...

1095
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,750
'Look at that. I can see my bum.

1096
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,993
Why would you send this to me?

1097
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,517
So wait - you guys broke up,
then you hugged and then you left?

1098
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,955
Yeah, pretty much.

1099
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,670
Loser! Always have sex with the girl
one last time before you break up.

1100
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,478
Everyone knows that!

1101
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,076
It's not like that. I've known her
my whole life. She's my best friend.

1102
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,628
So, what do we do now?

1103
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,678
- Wanna smoke some drugs?
- I don't think so.

1104
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,072
My mid-term starts in exactly
46 hours so I got to get back.

1105
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,709
Although I'm gonna fail anyway,
so it doesn't matter but...

1106
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,156
- Which class was it?
- Ancient Philosophy.

1107
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,670
I can teach you ancient philosophy
in 46 hours.

1108
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,159
You can?

1109
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,310
I can teach a monkey in 46 hours.

1110
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,756
You just got to find a way
to relate to the material.

1111
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,310
Like, OK...
You like pro wrestling, don't you?

1112
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,118
- Who doesn't?
- OK.

1113
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,351
Socrates was like
the Vince McMahon of philosophy.

1114
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,271
He started it all.

1115
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,633
Oh, what was the 20-Man Battle Royal?

1116
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,429
Participation explains predication.
Aristotle.

1117
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,919
Right.

1118
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,560
You know this! You'll be fine.

1119
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,874
Freeze, right there! Don't move!

1120
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,916
Is this philosophy?

1121
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,109
If you hear anything, give me a call.

1122
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,953
A bomb threat is serious.
Take my card.

1123
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,917
OK.

1124
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,077
OK, let's move it.

1125
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,197
What's goin' on
with this bomb threat?

1126
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,511
False alarm, people.
Everyone back inside.

1127
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,797
We're gonna do this thing.
That's right.

1128
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,915
- Josh.
- Beth!

1129
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,879
Hey, um... thanks for calling.

1130
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,669
Uh, it's been a really weird week.

1131
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,710
So, how'd you do?

1132
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,633
On the exam? Pretty good, actually.

1133
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,676
- You did?
- Yeah.

1134
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,318
Were you surprised?

1135
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,840
You weren't back
in time for the exam,

1136
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,753
so I, uh, called in a bomb threat.

1137
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,076
You did that?

1138
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,431
That's insane.

1139
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,558
I wasn't gonna let Jacob
get you kicked out.

1140
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,030
Besides, I might need you
around next semester.

1141
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,839
So I did good, right?

1142
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,512
Good?

1143
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,513
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1144
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,949
Mom?

1145
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,310
I'm so sorry.

1146
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,672
Mom?

1147
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,558
I got carried away
with the story there.

1148
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,478
So, anyway,
Josh got a B+ on his mid-term.

1149
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,516
He got to stay in college.

1150
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,875
'And he and Beth are still together.

1151
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,748
'They're still really into
making their... home movies.

1152
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,879
'In fact, they have about 70 hours
of unedited amateur video.'

1153
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,791
It's pretty wild.

1154
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,633
I know, because I bought some of it.

1155
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,517
That guy Jacob?

1156
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,752
'He left school. He went on to become
the leader of some cult in Iowa.

1157
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,877
'He tried organizing a mass suicide.

1158
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,838
'Only problem is,
he drank the Kool-Aid first

1159
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,959
'and, well, everyone else
just kind of changed their minds.'

1160
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,032
Too bad.

1161
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,429
As for Rubin... Remember Rubin?

1162
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,638
Remember how he claimed that
he was destined for great things?

1163
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,029
The people of Earth need me.

1164
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,758
Well, he was right.

1165
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:01,550
Rubin used cross-pollination
to develop a strain of marijuana

1166
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,154
that is not only remarkably potent...

1167
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,516
but completely undetectable
by any drug tests.

1168
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,556
Oh, my God.

1169
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,269
'He was named
High Times' man of the year.'

1170
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,989
As for EL, despite his
swinging philosophy on sexuality,

1171
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,435
he got serious with some girl he met.

1172
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,557
And you want me to use two fingers?

1173
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,596
'I believe she was pre-med.'

1174
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,478
Did I say two? Better make it three.

1175
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,437
Then there's Kyle.

1176
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,876
'Kyle and his father
reconciled their differences.'

1177
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,428
Hi, Dad. Merry Christmas.

1178
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,590
'He brought his girlfriend home.'

1179
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,240
Rhonda, this is my father, Earl.

1180
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,356
Dad, this is Rhonda.

1181
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:48,351
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1182
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,749
Come here.

1183
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,276
That's the end of the tour.

1184
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:00,195
I hope you strongly consider becoming
part of the Ithaca tradition,

1185
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,352
as we lead future generations
of young people

1186
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,396
forward into the new century.

1187
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,835
Thanks a lot. You were great. Thanks.

1188
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,196
- Thank you so much.
- No, it was fun.

1189
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,636
I'll see you in the fall.
Thank you. Thank you.

1190
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,553
- OK. Thank you.
- I'd like to say thank you.

1191
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,835
I mean, uh, that was...

1192
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,309
really great.

1193
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,118
Thank you.

1194
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,032
Thank you.

1195
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,558
Thank you.

1196
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,918
Thank you.

1197
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,956
Mom?

1198
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,958
Thank you.

1199
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,118
Thank you, Mommy.

1200
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,156
I'm pumping your mommy.
