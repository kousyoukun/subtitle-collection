1
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,800
Welcome to the University
of Ithaca. This is it, right here.

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm gonna give you a good tour today.

3
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,300
Show you as much as you need to know.

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,300
This is the main area
of the university.

5
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,800
You'll be getting used to this area.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
This is sort of where you congregate.

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,600
Come in around me. Keep close.

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,900
I've had problems
with stragglers before, OK?

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
They get lost in the back
and hit by trucks, OK?

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,200
It's not pretty. This is the...

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,400
By the way, this is the Joseph
H Nelson Memorial Library here, OK?

12
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,100
It was built, uh...
It was built, uh, in the 1600s.

13
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,900
1600s? It says 1951.

14
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,400
That's the address. OK? Wise-ass.

15
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,600
That's the psychology department.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
You're expected to volunteer for
cutting-edge experimental testing.

17
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,500
Kind of cool.

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,000
When it's your turn, remember
to wear loose clothes, no metal,

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,900
and be prepared to receive several
heavy doses of electric current.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
They're watching us right now.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,300
Over there
is the department of English.

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,100
Most of you speak English already
so we can skip that.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
- How long have you been here?
- Eight years.

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,900
You don't seem to know anything.
This is the worst tour ever.

25
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,900
It's the worst school ever.
Doesn't anything cool happen?

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,900
Yeah, cool stuff happens.

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,500
This university
is the coolest place in the world.

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,800
That's because
he's never been anywhere else.

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,000
Go ahead, laugh all you want.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,500
But the fact is, this is the setting
for the greatest story ever told.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
OK?

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,400
It's about this guy I knew,
Josh Parker,

33
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
and his girlfriend, Tiffany.

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,000
It's one of the most
fascinating journeys ever.

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,900
'Josh and Tiffany
were always together,

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
'starting from when they were little.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,900
'They did everything as a team.

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,500
'When Tiffany was 10,
she had her tonsils taken out.

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,800
'Josh stayed in the hospital
for three days.

40
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,900
'They were best friends.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
'What started out as friendship...

42
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,900
'blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

43
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,900
'They spent so much time together
that even their dogs started dating.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,100
'They seemed destined
to be together forever.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,700
'But after high school, they faced
the most challenging challenge ever -

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,300
'a long-distance relationship.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,700
'See, while Josh was enrolled here at
the wonderful University of Ithaca,

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,100
'Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,900
'But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

50
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,300
'to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship. '

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,000
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them ever imagined.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,300
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

53
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,400
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on!

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,300
Seriously! I had to take
two birth control pills today.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,100
You wanna help me study
again tonight?

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Forget tonight. Come over now.

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Let's blow this class off.

59
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,200
'Tiffany and Carla can't come to the
phone but please leave a message. '

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,200
Hey, Tif, it's me... again.

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,600
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still trying to get hold of you.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Everything's cool, though.
I'll catch you later.

63
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Call me back, OK? OK. Bye.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,300
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video.

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,400
I haven't talked to you
in a few days and...

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm thinking you don't like me...
I'm kidding.

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,300
Hey, guys.

68
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,700
But I am getting a little worried so
gimme a call when you get a chance.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,500
Barry says hi.

70
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
So gimme a call
as soon as you can. I miss you.

71
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Call me, OK? Bye.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
- What's up, guys?
- Not much. You?

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was just finishing my tape to Tif.

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Mitch, what are you doing?
Are you hungry? Huh?

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
- You gonna feed him?
- No, I'm checking the temperature.

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,000
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Can I drop a mouse in?

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
Mitch only eats once a week,
on Saturdays.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,100
Maybe we could cut a mouse in half,

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,100
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

81
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now?

82
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
What time is it? Oh, shit!

83
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,500
Do me a favour -
when this is rewound, mail it for me?

84
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,600
- No problem. Leave it there.
- Thanks, man.

85
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,200
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
Can we please feed him now?

87
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
No. If you overfeed him he could die.

88
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,500
So? It'll be worth it.

89
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,100
- Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,600
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,500
Studying. I'm starting
to question this college thing.

93
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
There's so much reading.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,700
- Right.
- Yeah.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,200
- You going to EL's tonight?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I gotta run,
class has started.

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,300
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry.

98
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,900
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it?

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,400
- It's not your business, Jacob.
- I can tell.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,400
- I'm not having this conversation.
- What conversation?

101
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,600
You need to stop this.
We're not a couple.

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,400
We've never been a couple,
and never will.

103
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,600
This week
I'd like you to think about

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
Plato's Dialogues
of the middle years.

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,200
"The Republic", "Phaedo",
"Symposium".

106
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,900
Now, this will all be
on next week's mid-term,

107
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
so I suggest you read up on it.

108
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,900
Ah, Jacob,
do you have anything to add?

109
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,600
Just a reminder.

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,300
The mid-term will cover
all of the in-class lectures

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,800
as well as
all of the assigned readings.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,700
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads.

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,400
I prefer yellow.
It's easier on the eyes.

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
OK. OK? Yeah. Thank you, Jacob.

115
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,100
And... see you all next week
for the mid-term.

116
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,800
- Josh.
- Yes?

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,700
I saw you hitting on Beth.
NOT a good idea.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,600
- She's spoken for.
- What?

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,000
She'll come back to me.
They always do.

120
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,100
So... Mr Parker.

121
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,900
Do you intend
to be ready for this exam?

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,400
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

123
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,700
Because I was
looking over the books last night

124
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,400
and you need a B on this test
just to pass this class.

125
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Actually,
I double-checked that, Professor.

126
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,400
He needs a B+.
We can't bend on this.

127
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,700
I got it.

128
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,200
- Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays.

129
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,100
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

130
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,800
I might lose my financial aid
or not be allowed back.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,700
Well, you're fucked, then.

132
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,000
So come to my party, hook up
with Beth, and enjoy your last week.

133
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,100
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I'm invested in this relationship.

134
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Invested? Who are you, Charles
Schwab? Listen to yourself!

135
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
I would give my life...

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,100
for one evening
of consensual sex with that girl.

137
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,800
I've gone this long without cheating.

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,700
You're already cheating!

139
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Any time you pass up sex
you cheat yourself.

140
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,100
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs

141
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,900
and take advantage
of young girls is shrinking daily.

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
I gotta make a call.

143
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm telling you, you pass this up,
it'll haunt you forever.

144
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Your dick will never forgive you.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,400
What do you think, man? Don't you
want to experience something new?

146
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,100
It ain't easy being Josh's penis.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,900
We've been here two months,
and I feel like I'm in a coma.

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
- Stop it.
- I wish I was your dick, EL.

149
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,200
If something doesn't happen soon,
I'm gonna leave.

150
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,500
- Enough.
- 'Hello? '

151
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,400
Carla, it's Josh. Sorry to bother
you, is Tiffany around?

152
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,600
Tiffany is not here.

153
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,700
She didn't sleep here
last night... again.

154
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,300
And it would be great
if for one hour you didn't call.

155
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,100
- Right.
- If she wanted to talk to you

156
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
she'd call you.

157
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,200
Deal with it.

158
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,000
- You bitch!
- Does she sound hot?

159
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,400
We've never gone this long
without talking. Something's wrong.

160
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,500
She found someone else,
like you should.

161
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,700
The clock is ticking. Before you know
it you'll be 40 and paying for girls.

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,100
# She good-looking
got a mojo cooking

163
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
# Yeah, wouldn't give me
the time of day

164
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,600
# But if my occupation
was stars and constellations

165
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,400
# We could get together
in the Milky Way

166
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
# And everybody wanna know somebody

167
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,700
# Everyone wants to drop your name

168
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,700
# You need no reservation
no special invitation

169
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,600
# No college education
if you've got fortune and fame... #

170
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,600
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

171
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I should really warn you,

172
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,000
it's been known to affect
your decision-making abilities

173
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
and lower your inhibitions.

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,600
Good. That's the plan.

175
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,300
No, that-that's...
Yes, that is the plan.

176
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,200
- You bring cash?
- Why?

177
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,700
- We've got chicks for sale.
- What?

178
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,100
# Hey, now I'm snappy
got my mojo... #

179
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,100
Trust me. I've been goin'
to this school seven years

180
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,000
and I know the key
to a well-rounded college education

181
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,400
is experimentation.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,900
Let me show you.

183
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,900
This is an auction. Remember...

184
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,500
you are not buying the girl,

185
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,800
only her company, and sale does not
constitute sexual relations.

186
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,700
I know. Believe me, I've tried.

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Without further ado,
let's introduce our first... person.

188
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Laura!

189
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,200
Laura's from Long Island.

190
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,300
She likes the outdoors
and loves seafood.

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,300
- OK, let's start the bidding at $5!
- $3.50!

192
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,700
Good God, moneybags,
she's not a Happy Meal.

193
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,100
- $5.
- OK, we've got five. Do I hear 10?

194
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,500
10 bucks.

195
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,500
Who's got 15 bucks
for a lovely evening with Laura?!

196
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,600
OK, we got 15. Who can beat 15?
Going once, going twice...

197
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Sold... to the captain.

198
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,900
There you are.

199
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,400
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not much.

200
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
- You look great.
- Thank you.

201
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,400
You're welcome.

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,900
Listen, Jacob's here,
and he's a total psycho...

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Can you go outbid him?

204
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
You know what,
I didn't bring that much money.

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,400
You don't understand. He's obsessed.

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,700
See? That's fun, right?

207
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,200
OK, PK. Now, I want you two
to kiss each other.

208
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,700
All right, has anyone seen Beth?
There she is!

209
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,400
Say hi to the crowd, Beth.

210
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
Hi.

211
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
Can I hear a $5 opening bid?

212
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,400
- $5 right here!
- Who can beat five?

213
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,200
- Seven.
- $10.

214
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,900
- $10! Going once. Going twice.
- $15!

215
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,600
- 20.
- 25!

216
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,100
25. Who can beat 25? Going once.

217
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,800
- Going twice.
- 26.

218
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,000
- 26, going once.
- 30!

219
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,300
- OK, can anyone beat $26?
- I just said 30!

220
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,200
There must be someone
who can beat $26?

221
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,400
- Me, right here! 30!
- Sold! To my man Josh for $26.

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
You heard me.
I bid $30 loud and clear.

223
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,200
Your bid didn't count.

224
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
- Why?
- Because you're a TA.

225
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
- So?
- This auction is for students.

226
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
Goodbye.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,900
# On and on until the early morning

228
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,000
# They're rockin' on and on
until the early morning... #

229
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,900
Thanks for doing that. I owe you one.

230
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,200
- You owe me more than one.
- Do I?

231
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
Technically.

232
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
Well...

233
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,400
are you ready to collect?

234
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,200
I think so. Yeah.

235
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,600
We're touching.

236
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,700
It's a lot of fun.

237
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,700
We're having a good time.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Who's Tiffany Henderson?

239
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Just some girl I used to date
since I was, like, five.

240
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,100
But that's over now. She blew me off.

241
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Oh, poor baby.

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You must be very hurt.

243
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,200
Do you need some special attention?

244
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,100
Well, I am pretty upset.

245
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,100
Did that help?

246
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
That helped a lot.

247
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,400
I have an idea.

248
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
What do you say?

249
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Uh, I don't think so.

250
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Come on! It'll be fun.

251
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,700
- I've always wanted to try this.
- No...

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
Yes.

253
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm gonna interview you.

254
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
Fine.

255
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,900
OK.

256
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,300
- OK, Josh.
- Yes.

257
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,300
What do you look for in a girl?

258
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,200
Um, well, let's see.

259
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,300
She should be smart and funny and...

260
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,400
That's good, too.

261
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,200
Do you feel better yet?

262
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,100
I feel a little bit better.
Yeah. A little...

263
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,700
What else do you look for?

264
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,600
She should be attractive and...

265
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
nice and...

266
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,500
Topless. And topless.

267
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,200
And she should kiss me.

268
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
What else?

269
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,500
She shouldn't stop kissing me.

270
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,000
Why don't you keep doing that?

271
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,100
# Tiny salmon swimming in a stream

272
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,100
# Tiny salmon
chasing that impossible dream

273
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,100
# The mynah bird says

274
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
# The chimpanzee says

275
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,700
# The friendly owl says

276
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
# But the salmon can only say

277
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,100
# And it's sad #

278
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,900
# Good morning, everyone.

279
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
# Good morning, everyone.

280
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
# How are you and you and you #

281
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,200
What are you so happy about?

282
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,500
I don't know.
Do I seem happy this morning?

283
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,800
Well, you're bouncing around here.

284
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,700
You do seem
unusually light-hearted.

285
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,700
Maybe it's because I had
the best time of my life last night.

286
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Twice! And once this morning.

287
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,000
You and Beth?

288
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
- Oh, yeah.
- Shut up. What happened?

289
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
No way! You're lying.

290
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm not lying.

291
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,800
You can't make out with someone
then pretend you had sex.

292
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
- That's really uncool.
- I'm not pretending.

293
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Forget it. I know you're lying.
I guarantee it.

294
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,400
You wanna bet?

295
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,100
Great. I'm gonna bet
on something you can't prove.

296
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,800
You videotaped it!

297
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No, no, no, I didn't!
Gimme that! Gimme that!

298
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,900
- No way! This is amazing!
- I was kidding, I was kidding!

299
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,200
- Gimme the tape.
- Huh? Come on.

300
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,300
- We're gonna see it sooner or later.
- He's got a point.

301
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,900
Oh-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no!

302
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
Give it to me. No, give it to me.

303
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,700
- EL, no.
- Josh, please? We need this.

304
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,600
OK, listen, seriously.
You can't tell anyone you saw this.

305
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,300
Oh, yeah.

306
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,900
OK. PK!

307
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,000
Barry, hit the lights.

308
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,100
It's boner time!

309
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
'Hey, Tif. It's me
coming to you live from Ithaca. '

310
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,200
I thought I asked you
to mail this yesterday?

311
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,800
Yeah, you did. I mailed it today.

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Fast-forward to the horny stuff.

313
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,300
Is this the shit
you've been sending Tiffany?

314
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,800
Oh, my God.

315
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,000
# It's you... #

316
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,300
Oh, fuck!

317
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

318
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Oh, God!

319
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,700
W- wait a second.

320
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,800
Tell me you mailed
the Beth tape to Tiffany.

321
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
Yes!

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,100
Shit! Oh, no! Oh, no!

323
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Hey, hey.

324
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Did you make a copy?

325
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,700
If you made a copy,
we could watch the copy.

326
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Don't answer it!

327
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,400
'Hey, it's
Josh and Rubin. Leave a message. '

328
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,700
'Hi, Josh. It's Tiffany.

329
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
'Sorry we haven't spoken.

330
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,700
'Listen, my grandfather passed away.

331
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,600
'I've tried calling you
a few times, but no one picked up.

332
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,400
'I didn't want to leave
this message on your machine

333
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,900
'but by now you're probably
a little worried so...

334
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,500
'Anyway, I'm at my parents'
house helping my mom.

335
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
'She's really a wreck.

336
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,400
'If I don't speak with you,
I'll call Monday.

337
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,300
'I'll be OK. I just need some time.

338
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,300
'Bye. I love you. '

339
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,200
That's not fair.

340
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,700
How come she gets to see the tape
and we don't?

341
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,300
She gets back there Monday.
That leaves three days to get there.

342
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,800
Get where? Austin?

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,300
- That's like 10,000 miles from here.
- 1,800.

344
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,000
You wanna drive 1,800 miles
in three days? Just fly.

345
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Do you have money for a ticket?
I don't.

346
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,300
- All right, so we're driving.
- You're coming?

347
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,700
What else am I gonna do,
stay here and learn?

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Road trip.

349
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,700
Just a minute. Hold on.

350
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,600
He's probably jackin' off.

351
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,600
What do you guys want?

352
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,500
Kyle, this is an emergency.

353
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Wait. Let me at least
go back and call my dad.

354
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,400
Call your dad?
Would you listen to yourself?

355
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,800
You're 19 years old,
and you're a fucking sissy.

356
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,300
All you ever do is sit
in a library and play Myst.

357
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,400
It's pathetic.

358
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
He's trying to say that
this is your chance to do something.

359
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,800
Be a risk-taker. Come with us.

360
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,600
You're just saying that
because you want my car.

361
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,100
No! No, we've always liked you.

362
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,700
Or just give us the car.
That would make him a risk-taker.

363
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,000
Shut up, all right?
He's coming with us.

364
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,900
Come on, Kyle. It'll be fun!

365
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,000
Aren't you even curious
where we're going?

366
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,000
No.

367
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,500
OK, we're going to the University
of Austin. Sure you won't come?

368
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,200
I don't like Massachusetts.

369
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,900
Austin's in Texas.
You're thinking of Boston.

370
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,900
You've never left this town,
have you?

371
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
No, not really.

372
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,100
That could turn
into a debilitating phobia.

373
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
OK.

374
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,900
- Can I feed Mitch?
- Yes, actually you can.

375
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,700
There's a brown box of mice
by his cage.

376
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,200
Give him one tomorrow. Just one.

377
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,100
- I'll feed him a mouse tomorrow.
- OK.

378
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,900
You can count on me.
OK? I'm reliable. OK?

379
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,500
You guys do good.
Have a good trip, safe trip.

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Buckle up your seat belt.
I'm gonna feed the snake!

381
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,500
I'll feed the snake,
I'll watch the snake.

382
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,500
'So off they went. '

383
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,300
They had 1,800 miles to go,
and only three days to do it.

384
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,900
It was a killer journey and one
that changed them all forever.

385
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
The end.

386
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,000
- So we're gonna go look over here.
- Whoa. That's it? This story sucks.

387
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,300
- What happened with the tape?
- Right. The tape.

388
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,300
Well, um...

389
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,600
Well... Like I said,
they were on a race against time.

390
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,500
# The smoke stack spitting black soot
into the sooty sky

391
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,000
# The load on the road brings a tear
to the Indian's eye... #

392
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,600
Since we didn't get to see the tape,

393
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,300
- can you at least describe it?
- No.

394
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,200
# The elephant won't forget
what it's like inside his cage

395
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,000
# The ringmaster's Telecaster
sings on an empty stage... #

396
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,500
Admit that Beth is amazing.

397
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,500
I admit it, she's amazing.
She's perfect.

398
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,300
I don't know why you feel so guilty.
Technically you haven't cheated.

399
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,500
What are you talking about?

400
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,400
There are these rules that guys have,

401
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,000
an understanding
as to what constitutes cheating.

402
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,000
Take your situation, for example.

403
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,100
It's not cheating.

404
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,700
Not when you're in a different
area code - not to mention state!

405
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
That makes no sense.

406
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't look at me, Kyle.
I don't make the rules.

407
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,600
This is legit. I've read an article.

408
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,000
There's a whole bunch of them,
like loopholes.

409
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,800
Say you were sleeping with
two girls at the same time,

410
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,500
it's not cheating
because they cancel each other out.

411
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
- Ahh.
- Exactly!

412
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,200
Or if you're too wasted
to remember...

413
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
It is not cheating.

414
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,100
Because if you
can't really remember it,

415
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,200
it never really took place.

416
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,600
# Uh-huh

417
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,100
# Whoo-oo... #

418
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,600
OK, I've got one. Ready?

419
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,500
It's OK if you spread peanut butter
on your testicles

420
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
and let your dog lick it off.

421
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,500
- Because it's your dog!
- Jesus Christ!

422
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,800
- You know, because it's your dog!
- We got it.

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
# Whoo-oo, uh-huh

424
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,400
# Goddam right, it's a beautiful day

425
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,800
# Uh-huh, goddam right #

426
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,800
Somebody's gonna die tomorrow.

427
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,700
That's right.
One of you is marked for death.

428
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,600
And first thing tomorrow morning,

429
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,200
a chosen one
will experience nature's wrath

430
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,300
in all its fury.

431
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,600
Who are you?

432
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm Beth.

433
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,400
Are you here for the feeding?

434
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
Excuse me?

435
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,500
You're early. It's not till tomorrow.

436
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,500
You should come back.

437
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,000
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

438
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
I think I'll pass.

439
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Have you seen Josh?

440
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,200
He went to visit his girlfriend.

441
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
Tiffany?

442
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,800
I thought they broke up.

443
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,500
I mean this girl who's a friend
of his. You know what I mean.

444
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,500
Where did he go?

445
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,900
Austin?

446
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,100
Austin, Massachusetts?

447
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,500
You mean Boston, Massachusetts?

448
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah, that's what I said. Boston.

449
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

450
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,700
He is such an asshole.

451
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,100
I can't believe
he just lied to my face like that.

452
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,200
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that?

453
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,200
- She was topless?
- Girls don't stand around naked.

454
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,700
Yeah, they do. OK? This is my story.
You wanna hear it or not?

455
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,400
- It just doesn't make any...
- Shh. Please, no interruptions, OK?

456
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,100
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked! Really naked!

457
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
I know guys can be jerks.

458
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,100
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

459
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

460
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,000
All men are perverted pigs.

461
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,000
All they care about...
really, all they THINK about is sex.

462
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,100
- You're so right. I feel so used.
- Face it, we're all used.

463
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,700
In most men's eyes, we're just flesh.

464
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,600
- It's so sick!
- It IS sick. Think about it.

465
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
If they had it their way...

466
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,100
God, I don't even want to know
what would happen

467
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,600
if they had it their way!

468
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,800
What am I supposed to do
now that he's gone?

469
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,900
- Go to Boston and bust his ass.
- Right.

470
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,800
Confront him
and his little girlfriend.

471
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,900
Face to face. You totally should!

472
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Show her what an asshole Josh is,
right?

473
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,900
Hmm...

474
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,300
# I'm freakin' you, baby

475
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,300
# Drivin' you crazy

476
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
# I'm freakin' you, baby

477
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,300
# Drivin' you crazy

478
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,600
# I'm freakin' you, baby... #

479
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,300
Ooh! These, too.

480
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
# I'm freakin' you, baby

481
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
# Drivin' you crazy... #

482
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,000
Kyle, come here for a second.

483
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,900
We're a little
short on cash right now,

484
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,900
so we need to put this
on your credit card.

485
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,900
We'll give you the cash
when we get back, I promise.

486
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,700
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

487
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,500
Hello! This IS an emergency.

488
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,800
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt?

489
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,400
# I'm freakin' you, baby
drivin' you crazy

490
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,200
# When I get to your place

491
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,300
# I wanna turn up the highs
and turn up the bass... #

492
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,800
We're in no-man's-land.

493
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,600
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

494
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,600
This is gonna save us five hours,
minimum. Thank me later.

495
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,300
We should go back to the interstate.

496
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,600
- We're not goin' back.
- Yeah, have some faith.

497
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,900
It's a challenge.
That's why it's a short cut.

498
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,700
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

499
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Damn it! Fuck!

500
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
I give us 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

501
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,100
If we turn around we'll lose
five hours backtracking.

502
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,500
Turn around? Why? Because of this?
We could make it.

503
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Make it? You mean jump it?

504
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,000
No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.

505
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,300
It can be done. This incline
is 30 degrees roughly, right?

506
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,400
The factory weight
of the car is 1,600lbs.

507
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,300
Add us, plus cargo...

508
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,600
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50mph,

509
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,000
our trajectory
will clear 10 feet, easy.

510
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,900
No way. Absolutely not.

511
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,300
We'll go 60 just to be certain.

512
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,200
We're goin' back.
It's impossible.

513
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,100
You sure?

514
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,800
With physics I'm always sure.

515
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm driving.

516
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,900
I don't think you guys heard me.

517
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,400
This is my car
and we're not gonna jump any rivers.

518
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Kyle, it's 10 feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

519
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,300
Look, I can spit across this gap.

520
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,900
Yeah.

521
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,600
Well...

522
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,700
better make it 75.

523
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,900
- OK. Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

524
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,800
No, you guys. No.
EL, get out of my car.

525
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,900
Kyle, in the car. Come on.

526
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,200
We're PK.

527
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
You know we need to hit 60?

528
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,900
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop!

529
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Thank you! Yes!

530
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
What did I tell you?

531
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Oh, my God.

532
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,400
Oh, my God!

533
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,400
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

534
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,900
I only said we'd make it across.

535
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,900
I never said
the wheels would stay on.

536
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,300
What the hell are we gonna do now?!

537
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm totally screwed!

538
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I don't have time...
to be walking... through the woods!

539
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Josh, we'll call a tow truck,
have the axles fixed.

540
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,400
We'll lose half a day at most.
It's just the wheels.

541
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,900
The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

542
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,900
they just turn around
and screw me over.

543
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Just something about Josh,
he's just different.

544
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,100
I feel like we had a connection.

545
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
I don't think
I'll ever be able to trust a guy.

546
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,200
You shouldn't! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was back in 1985

547
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,100
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

548
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,500
It was a regular-size van.
Before that mini-van crap.

549
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,100
So there's no hope, huh?

550
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,600
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

551
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,900
You can keep that.

552
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,600
God. Crap.

553
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,900
Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

554
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,900
We almost died in that explosion.

555
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,700
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

556
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

557
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,100
I must live.

558
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Yeah, right. We all must live.

559
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,500
Before we do that,
we must get back on the road.

560
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,900
We shouldn't be going
to sleep right now!

561
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,400
'Let's just lay
an indication here and there. '

562
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,800
'And a whole bunch of colour... '

563
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,100
Excuse me.

564
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,700
I'm sorry, do you need to get that?

565
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,100
Do you need something?

566
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,600
Yeah.
This is sort of an unusual question.

567
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,900
But do you have any marijuana
I might buy?

568
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,100
Our car exploded last night
and I'm practically all out.

569
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Am I a drug dealer?

570
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,100
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking, though.

571
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,100
No? OK, that's OK. Thanks.

572
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,000
Is there anything else
I can help with?

573
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,500
Perhaps you'd like an 11-year-old
prostitute. We can do that.

574
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,400
Or maybe we can off someone
for you. Huh?

575
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,200
I've got it.
Why don't we start small?

576
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,800
Would you like a fresh towel?

577
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,300
You could roll that up and smoke it.

578
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,600
Dick.

579
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
By the way, Cheech,

580
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,100
that credit card
you guys gave me was maxed out,

581
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,300
so don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

582
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,900
Um, Mr Earl Edwards?

583
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,100
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

584
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,400
That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

585
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,300
I tried three times, sir. If you
have another card, I'd be happy to...

586
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,500
Don't give me any attitude.

587
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,500
You go fix
that little toy back there,

588
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
and charge this friggin' card.

589
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,200
We've been coming here for 20 years.

590
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,700
- We've only been open eight years.
- Do it now.

591
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,000
Relax, it's not a big deal.

592
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,500
You don't understand,
when Josh finds out he'll freak.

593
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,600
You can't rent a car without
a credit card. You just can't.

594
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,000
So, what are we gonna do?

595
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,200
Tell you what. Stay here.

596
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,200
Take him out
for breakfast or something.

597
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I'll go take care of this.

598
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Earl, Cookie, we have a situation.
Now, brace yourselves.

599
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,600
The police have found Kyle's car
abandoned in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

600
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,200
It's been blown to bits.

601
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,100
We checked with the university -
he's missing.

602
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,700
Mother of God.

603
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
- Good morning.
- Hello.

604
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,200
Hi. How can I help you?

605
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah, hi. I was sent over here
to check out bus 111,

606
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,100
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

607
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,300
You seem to be having problems
with the... rotator splint.

608
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Engines have rotator splints?

609
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,400
Yeah.

610
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,300
She runs good now, but not for long.

611
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,700
I can have it back to you
as good as new in a week.

612
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,700
Let's see.
Well, Jared's still in Aliquippa,

613
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,800
- I take it he called you from there?
- Yeah.

614
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,600
Five days.
Well, I think we can work that out.

615
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,300
Would you please not feed my dog?

616
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
I didn't.

617
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,000
You can't feed
Seeing Eye dogs treats.

618
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,800
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

619
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Don't roll your eyes at me.

620
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,500
French toast.

621
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,900
Bacon. Good for you.

622
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,200
- And scrambled eggs.
- Thank you.

623
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,700
Excuse me, but this has powdered
sugar on it, and I ordered no sugar.

624
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,900
I can't have
too much sugar in the morning.

625
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,300
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're absolutely right.

626
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,100
Tell you what, let me take this back
and bring you out a new piece.

627
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,700
Is everybody good? OK, great.

628
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,500
Do you know where my possessions are,
because I can't...

629
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,000
- Wait, no. They were in the car.
- That's... that's hilarious.

630
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,200
All right,
let me warm that up for you.

631
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
- There you go.
- Thanks.

632
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,500
Excuse me. And the French toast
will be out in just a minute.

633
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,400
- OK, thank you.
- OK, great.

634
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,700
French toast, no sugar.

635
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,100
- All right? Sorry about that.
- No problem.

636
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,000
That's a nice guy.

637
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,900
It's good.

638
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,600
OK!

639
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,600
I don't wanna know
how you got this.

640
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,400
- I stole it from a blind chick.
- I don't wanna know.

641
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,300
What? I'm gonna give it back.

642
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,300
Probably.

643
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,000
# Going to work, I hate it

644
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,500
# Shakin' that stick
that drives people crazy

645
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,900
# Doin' that stuff that you do

646
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,400
# Quit messin' me up with your voodoo

647
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,500
# You drive me crazy with that

648
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,100
# Boogie-oogie-oogie-oogie-oogie

649
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,800
# You drive me crazy with that boogie

650
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,500
# Boogie, boogie

651
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,300
# Your lips are hot and spicy

652
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,100
# Servin' up cooked beans and rice

653
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,100
# I feel like
she's a hoppin' and stompin'

654
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,300
# Makin' love to the gators
in the swamp... #

655
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,400
Can we please stop soon?
I need to use the bathroom.

656
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,400
Actually, I don't have to go yet,
so we'll stop in a couple of hours.

657
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,500
OK.

658
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,200
I'm kidding, Kyle. We'll stop.

659
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,200
Jeez, you have to stand up
for yourself. Be more assertive.

660
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
OK.

661
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,300
What's your deal?
Why are you so worried?

662
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,200
I don't know. I guess it's my dad.

663
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,500
He's, like... strict.

664
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,200
He really is gonna kill me
when he finds out about that car.

665
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,700
So you screwed up. Big deal.
People make mistakes.

666
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,400
He'll get over it.
Besides, that car sucked anyways.

667
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,600
I really do need
to go to the bathroom.

668
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,100
- We're makin' a pit stop.
- Again?!

669
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,100
You're about to experience
first-hand...

670
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,800
exactly what it means to be in
the lower region of the food chain.

671
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,900
Mitch is going to bite into you.

672
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,600
He's going to squeeze.

673
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,400
He'll actually start digesting you
while you're still alive.

674
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,800
But don't be scared.

675
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,000
No. No, no.

676
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,100
It'll be a quick death.

677
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,600
Be brave.

678
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,400
You'll barely feel it.

679
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,400
Come on.

680
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,700
Come on. You gonna fuckin' eat him?

681
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,100
Josh, wait up a second.

682
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,400
This is supposed to be a road trip.

683
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,600
All we do is drive the whole time.
It's ridiculous.

684
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,300
- No one forced you to come.
- We're making great time.

685
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,800
And if Tiffany saw that tape,
it'd be a good thing.

686
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
What is that supposed to mean?

687
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,400
Beth is an angel. She's here
to help you change your life.

688
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,300
Besides, did Tiffany
ever let you videotape her?

689
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
I think not.

690
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,700
It's a sign, Josh.

691
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,500
Hello?

692
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,500
- 'Professor Anderson? '
- Who's calling?

693
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,600
Hi, Professor, it's Josh Parker.

694
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,800
Oh, uh...

695
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,600
Hello, Josh.
What can I do for you?

696
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,600
- Well, I was in a car accident.
- 'Oh. Oh, my God. '

697
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,800
I'm PK.
It's just I'm in kind of a bind.

698
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,600
All my notes and books
were destroyed.

699
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,400
Is it possible to get an extension?

700
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,600
'Maybe take the mid-term
a couple days later? '

701
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,800
Oh, sure.
Yes, it sounds like an emergency.

702
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,900
How about an extra three days?

703
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,900
- 'Would that work? '
- Yeah, that would be fantastic!

704
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,200
- Are you sure?
- 'Just glad you're not hurt. '

705
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,500
I'm marking it down right now.

706
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,400
'That's great, Professor. Thank you. '

707
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,500
OK, goodbye.

708
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,800
Who was that?

709
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,900
Oh, that... that was Josh Parker.

710
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,500
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

711
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,200
He was just confirming
the date of the exam. Such a worrier.

712
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,100
It's gonna be OK. I'll find him.

713
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,300
And we'll find whoever did this,
I promise. It's gonna be OK.

714
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:20,600
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody
was raped and murdered here.

715
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,100
What the hell gives you that idea?

716
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,800
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

717
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,200
- Well?
- Nothing yet.

718
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,200
Good thing is,
there's no evidence of a struggle.

719
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,600
No blood or clothing or anything.

720
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,400
And we haven't found
a single drop of semen yet.

721
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,600
Hi. I'm visiting my friend from home.

722
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,100
But she doesn't know I'm coming.
It's a surprise.

723
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
How nice. How can I help you?

724
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,000
I've never been here before.
I don't know where she lives.

725
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,700
What's her name? I can look it up.

726
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, OK. Tiffany Henderson.

727
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,100
Do I know you?

728
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,700
No, you don't.
Actually, I know your boyfriend.

729
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,300
OK. Who are you?

730
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,700
I'm Beth.
Could we just sit down for a minute?

731
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
OK.

732
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,600
Um, this is really hard for me,

733
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,100
but it's definitely
something you should hear.

734
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,000
Your boyfriend is cheating on you...
with me.

735
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,700
We were together Thursday night.

736
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,900
Twice.

737
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,600
And once again Friday morning.

738
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,600
I thought you should know.

739
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,900
Sorry.

740
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,500
Tiffany! What the hell are you doing?

741
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,800
- Who's that guy?
- That's her boyfriend.

742
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,000
THAT's her boyfriend?

743
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,700
Yeah. He's been cheating on her.

744
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Baby, I love you!

745
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,900
I- I'm sorry,

746
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,900
but you have the most beautiful feet.

747
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,300
Ohh... Would you like
a foot massage?

748
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,500
No, I would not like a foot massage.

749
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,000
I would hate
a foot massage!

750
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,400
OK. I'm sorry. Relax.

751
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,300
Are there any guys out there
who are just normal?! Huh?!

752
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,000
Unleash the fury, Mitch.

753
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,300
Unleash the fury.

754
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,500
Come on, Mitch.

755
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,100
Eat him.

756
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,200
Please, Mitch. Go get him, boy.

757
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,200
He's right there. Kill him.

758
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Maim him. Bite him.

759
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,400
UNLEASH THE FURY!

760
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,000
Wow, this is cool.

761
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,300
I've never been in
a fraternity house before.

762
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,100
Is this gonna work?

763
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,500
Of course it's gonna work.
I know the handshake.

764
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,000
Hi.

765
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,000
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

766
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,500
I'm Rubin Carver,
a Xi Chi brother from Ithaca.

767
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,300
We're just passing through
and looking for a place to party,

768
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,800
maybe even a place to crash.

769
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,600
Xi. Chi. Xi, Chi.
Xi, Xi, Xi.

770
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,300
Chi.

771
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,100
Hmph.

772
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,600
Wow!

773
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,400
Ahem. Uh, everyone, this is Rubin.

774
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,500
Apparently, Rubin is our fraternity
brother from our Ithaca chapter.

775
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,700
These are his friends.

776
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,000
Listen, uh, we've interrupted
your dinner so we'll just...

777
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,500
Hey, don't be crazy.

778
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,500
There's plenty of food to go around.

779
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,600
You guys are welcome to stay.

780
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,900
You know, this food's pretty good.

781
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,400
Hey, you do realise
this is a national black fraternity?

782
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,700
They know you're not a member.

783
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,100
I'm sorry. I don't think
about that kind of stuff.

784
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,600
OK, relax. OK?
They're just messing with us.

785
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,900
They're pissed because he lied.

786
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,700
- I say we get out of here.
- Shh, relax.

787
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,200
Someone's got some explaining to do.

788
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,800
- Look what we found in his bag.
- What?! What is that?!

789
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,600
No, I've never seen that before!

790
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,900
What are you doin'?
Are you in the Ku Klux Klan?

791
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,300
- Whoa, whoa. That is not ours.
- That's not mine!

792
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,100
OK, hold on, th-there's
obviously some explanation.

793
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,100
Yeah, there is. See, your boy's
an evil bigot and now he's gonna die.

794
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
Justice!

795
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,600
Kyle. Kyle.

796
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,900
Kyle!

797
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,000
There you are. I thought we lost you.

798
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,700
- Am I in the hospital?
- You passed out.

799
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,900
They were messin' with us, Kyle.
It was a joke.

800
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,300
Racist?
But I watch Oprah Winfrey every day.

801
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,400
It was a joke, outtie. A joke!

802
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,000
I get it.

803
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,500
Sure, put a Klan hood in my bag.

804
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,400
Yeah. Oh, that's funny.

805
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,300
Whoa.

806
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,200
I need a wine cooler.

807
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,700
- Hey, have mine.
- Thanks.

808
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,700
# It's tricky to rock around

809
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,200
# To rock around,
that's right on time

810
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,900
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky

811
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,100
# It's tricky to rock around
to rock around that's right on time

812
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,300
# It's tricky
trick-trick-trick-tricky

813
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,400
# I met this good girlie
her hair was kinda curly

814
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,100
# Went to her house and busted out
I had to leave her early

815
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,500
# These girls are really sleazy,
all they just say is "Please me"

816
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,500
# Spend some time and rock around

817
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,600
# I said it's not that easy

818
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,300
# It's tricky to rock around

819
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,600
# To rock around
that's right on time

820
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,500
# It's tricky, it's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky

821
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,600
# It's tricky to rock around... #

822
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,000
# In New York the people talk
and try to make us cry

823
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,000
# They really hawk but we just walk
because we have no time

824
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,100
# And in the city it's a pity

825
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,900
# Cos we just can't hide

826
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,000
# Tinted windows don't mean nothing,
we know who's inside

827
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,600
# It's tricky to rock around

828
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,800
# To rock around
that's right on time

829
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,200
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky... #

830
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Isn't he just
the cutest little thing?

831
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,300
Oh, yeah, Kyle's the man!

832
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,000
# Tricky, tricky,
tricky, tricky, huh! #

833
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,700
You mean never? Not even once?

834
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,200
Well... I mean, I've had sex before.

835
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,800
Just, um,

836
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,300
never with a person.

837
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,200
Right.

838
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, I think that's kinda cool.

839
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,800
- You do?
- Yeah.

840
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,100
I mean, you should hold out.
It should be special.

841
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,500
Wait till you're in love.

842
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,500
I think I love you.

843
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,500
You are so cute.

844
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,500
# Inside each other

845
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,900
# You can see inside me

846
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,300
# Will you come inside me?

847
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,500
# Do you want to ride further up?

848
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,200
# If you can see inside me

849
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,700
# Will you come inside me?

850
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,800
# Do you want to ride... #

851
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,900
I take it you don't have a condom?

852
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,800
Uh... no.

853
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,600
Um, I guess I'm all out.

854
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,700
Well, Lawrence probably has some.

855
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,000
Why don't you try that drawer?

856
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,300
Next to the Old Spice,
behind the belts.

857
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,100
Good guess.

858
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,500
You know what?

859
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,700
Um, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing and, um...

860
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm... Oof.

861
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,700
Shhh. Relax, baby.
Let Rhonda handle this.

862
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,400
# Time's a-changing

863
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,700
# More so each year

864
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,200
# But the early mornin'

865
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,300
# Snow the pimp is here

866
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,700
# So let it rain

867
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,500
# And let the guitar rock... #

868
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,300
- Thanks for a great time.
- Take care.

869
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,300
Stay cool.

870
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,200
Hey, Devon.

871
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,300
What's up?

872
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,700
# Well, well, well, well, well

873
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,800
# And I'll be catching them pike

874
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,400
# Like on the 10 pound test, success

875
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,100
# Never 'fess, take a guess

876
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,900
# I'll be the early morning
snow pimp... #

877
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,100
Let's go, Kyle.
We want details. What happened?

878
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,000
Well, we had a few drinks,

879
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,500
danced a little, and, you know...

880
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,600
No, we don't know.
Why don't you tell us?

881
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,300
What the hell is that?

882
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,600
Did you kill a cheetah?

883
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,600
What? No. These are her underwear.
She gave 'em to me.

884
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,000
I boinked her!

885
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,900
Boinked?

886
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,100
Yeah, did you just say
the word "boinked? "

887
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,700
Well, Kyle,

888
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,900
I hope you got the boinking
out of your system,

889
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,800
cos we got a lot of driving
to do today.

890
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,900
Do not get your hopes up
about visiting Graceland,

891
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,100
cos we're about the mission at hand.

892
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,300
- Josh.
- What?

893
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,900
That sounds like a good plan,
except for one little thing.

894
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,300
- What little thing?
- We're out of money.

895
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,900
OK, before you fill out these,
I have to ask some questions.

896
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,900
If you qualify, you can
make a sperm deposit. Understood?

897
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,300
Mm-hmm. Fire away.

898
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,400
Tell the truth, because if you don't
the test will and you won't get paid.

899
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,100
So, first off, have any of you
done any drugs in the past 36 hours?

900
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,500
And that includes marijuana.

901
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,800
PK, next.

902
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:50,100
Have any of you had sex
or masturbated in the past 24 hours?

903
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,900
Well, I guess I'm out.

904
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,900
Because I had sex last night...

905
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,900
with a girl!

906
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,100
That's nice.

907
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,700
You'll find everything you need
in these binders.

908
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,600
Would you each take a cup.

909
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,100
- PK.
- And yours.

910
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,500
I'd appreciate it if you'd
return those after you're finished.

911
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,600
OK. Uh, thanks.

912
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,400
Cheers.

913
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,300
Excuse me. Do you have anything
with Asian women?

914
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,500
I have this thing for Asian chicks,
and there's none here.

915
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,300
This isn't Peep World.
Our selection is limited.

916
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,000
- You're gonna have to make do.
- OK.

917
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,700
You've been more than helpful.

918
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,900
Is something wrong?

919
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,000
Well, no.

920
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,300
But... I just couldn't help
but notice that...

921
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,900
Is there something between us?

922
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,200
I mean, I was thinking
that maybe you might want to...

923
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,600
I don't know...
help me out with a little...

924
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,500
professional assistance?

925
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,600
Do you need some help?

926
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,600
Yes, I do.

927
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,700
'Dr Morris, dial 1-1-8, please.

928
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,100
'Dr Morris, please dial 1-1-8.'

929
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:24,200
The moment I saw you out there,
I thought you were incredible.

930
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,400
You're not like most of the girls
I know. You're a woman.

931
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:33,200
That's fine. Turn around, drop your
pants, hands flat on the table.

932
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,100
Oh, my God.

933
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,400
- This is great. Wow. Like this?
- Exactly.

934
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:45,900
I have to admit,
I love you in that uniform.

935
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Do those nylons go all the way up,
or are they, like thigh high?

936
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm gonna perform a procedure
called milking the prostate.

937
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,300
It's an anally-induced ejaculation.

938
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,600
Anal?

939
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,200
You're gonna feel strong pressure
from inside your rectum.

940
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,800
Come on, you don't have
to get all scientific, baby.

941
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,800
I mean, we can just talk...

942
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,900
Stop! OK, keep doin' it. Yaaah!

943
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,600
Right there! Ahhh!

944
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,800
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

945
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,100
OK. All done.

946
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,800
That was awesome!

947
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,700
Wait. Wait. Does that work?

948
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,600
I mean,
is it even medically possible?

949
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,300
Oh, yeah, it works.

950
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,400
It works like a charm.

951
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,900
But back to our story.

952
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,600
'It was Sunday morning
back in Ithaca,

953
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,100
'when things suddenly took
an unexpected turn. '

954
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,600
I'm a mouse.
I'm a mouse. Eat me. Eat me.

955
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,300
Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.
Eat me. Eat me.

956
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Come on.

957
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,400
You better eat him, Mitch,
before I do.

958
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,200
He's tasty.

959
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,500
He's tasty, Mitch. Oh! Oh!

960
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,200
Mmm! Mmm!

961
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,000
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Why'd you lie to me?

962
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,300
I didn't lie.

963
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,500
You-you told me
that Josh went to Boston.

964
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,700
- I didn't. I said Austin.
- You said Boston.

965
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,200
Because of you,
some guy's life is ruined.

966
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,800
So what? Besides, wherever he went,
he went because of you.

967
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:21,400
- What do you mean, because of me?
- Look, it's obvious.

968
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,900
Josh likes you. It's disgusting.

969
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,400
I knew you'd come back.

970
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,400
- What do you want?
- So, how was your getaway with Josh?

971
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,200
- I wasn't with Josh.
- Sure. Doesn't matter, though.

972
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,900
Cos Josh won't be back next semester.

973
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,500
He's about to flunk philosophy.

974
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:45,200
- What are you talking about?
- He thinks that he has an extension,

975
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,500
but thanks to
a... certain someone - me -

976
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,400
he doesn't.

977
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,600
He's an idiot.
You psycho.

978
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,500
Oh, my God!

979
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,700
# I wanna rock

980
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,700
# Turn it down, you say

981
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,600
# All I gotta say to you
time and time again I say no!

982
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,200
# No, no, no!

983
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,600
# Tell me not to play

984
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,000
# All I gotta say to you
when you tell me not to play

985
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,000
# I say no, no, no, no

986
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:43,400
# So if you ask me why
I like the way I play

987
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,900
# There's only one thing
I can say to you

988
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,100
# I wanna rock! Rock!

989
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,100
# I wanna rock! Rock!

990
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,100
# I want to rock! Rock... #

991
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,000
'That night I set the guys up
at my grandparents' house.

992
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,600
'I haven't been there in a long time.

993
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,000
'When I was seven years old
I set their dog on fire

994
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,900
'and wasn't invited back.

995
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,300
'But I hear it's still real nice. '

996
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,400
I'm serious. "Please",
"Thank you", "This is delicious"

997
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,500
are the only words
you're allowed to say.

998
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,200
What? I'm great with old people.
Grandmas love me.

999
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,900
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. "Manilow"?

1000
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,500
- Barry's last name is Manilow?
- Yeah.

1001
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,100
- His name is Barry Manilow?
- Yeah.

1002
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,500
- Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

1003
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,900
Oh, look at you boys.

1004
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,300
Jack, they're here!

1005
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:51,700
# I see you, baby, shakin' that ass

1006
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,500
# Shakin' that ass,
shakin' that ass... #

1007
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,300
Jack, Barry's friends are here.
Come and say hi.

1008
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,900
The boys are here.

1009
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,700
- Oh, hey, fellas.
- Hi.

1010
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,900
- Hey, how's it going?
- Wait. Let me get up.

1011
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,700
- I'll give you guys the full tour.
- Oh, honey!

1012
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,900
Careful. Your boner!

1013
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,200
Well, what do you want me to do,
cut it off?

1014
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,000
I'll tell you what, fellas,

1015
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,900
we'll start by showin'
you where you're gonna sleep.

1016
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,400
I'll show you
what we call the guest room.

1017
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,400
Follow me, boys. The guest room...

1018
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,500
Ohhh.

1019
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,800
# Y'all know
what I'm talkin' about

1020
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,400
# Don't be lookin' at me
like that now

1021
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
# Come on... #

1022
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,600
Excuse me.

1023
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,000
You remember this kid?

1024
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,000
No, sure don't.

1025
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Fuckin' airhead.

1026
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,700
Let me ask you once more.
Have you seen my son?

1027
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Ow. Now that you mention it,
there were a few guys in.

1028
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,000
If you loosen my arm,
I could get their bill.

1029
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,400
Use your other arm.

1030
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,900
- How many were there?
- A few.

1031
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,800
Aaah! Four!

1032
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,500
One of 'em was trying to score drugs.

1033
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,700
Honey, look. They made two calls to
Austin, Texas. Maybe they went there.

1034
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,600
Havin' a smoke?

1035
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,700
Uh... yeah, yeah.

1036
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,100
I can't sleep, either.

1037
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:06,000
Goddam Viagra
gets my heart racing like a lab rat.

1038
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Are you OK?

1039
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,500
- You look kinda goofy.
- No. No, it's nothing.

1040
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,300
- Come on, out with it.
- OK.

1041
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,000
Well... I almost died two days ago.

1042
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,400
- What?
- Our car exploded.

1043
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,700
I could be dead right now.

1044
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,400
And since that happened,
I find myself asking why.

1045
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,800
You know? Like...

1046
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,100
What is my reason for living?

1047
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,000
Are you gonna
pass that doobie, or what?

1048
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,100
Doobie? Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

1049
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,200
Uh, thanks.

1050
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,800
You know what your problem is?

1051
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,400
You're all brains.
Not enough cock and balls.

1052
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,600
Actually, uh, people have been
telling me that my whole life.

1053
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,900
In the sixth grade I got so worried
about the situation in Iraq,

1054
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,800
that I was on
an adult dosage of Xanax.

1055
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,300
And by eighth grade,
I was in therapy three times a week.

1056
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,900
And the truth is, weed is the
only thing that could balance me out.

1057
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,900
You know what I mean? Like...

1058
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,400
You PK?

1059
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,500
Hey, old man.

1060
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,000
I got the fuckin' munchies real bad.

1061
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,200
How 'bout you?

1062
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,100
OK, Tiffany,
it's time to stop being so sad.

1063
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,200
Look at all this mail you got!

1064
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,300
Look how many nice people
care about you.

1065
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,800
You even got a package from Josh.

1066
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,500
Really?

1067
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,100
Shall we open it
and see what he says?

1068
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, come on, Tif. Let's open it.

1069
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,500
- It's a tape.
- Oh.

1070
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,800
Well, pop it in.

1071
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,500
Maybe I should watch this on my own.

1072
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,600
Oh, come on.

1073
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,000
This'll definitely cheer you up.

1074
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,700
'What do you look for
in a girl? '

1075
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,900
'Well, let's see.
She should be smart... '

1076
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,200
'and, um, funny.

1077
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,700
'And, uh...

1078
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,000
'That's good... that's good, too. '

1079
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,100
'What else do you look for? '

1080
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,200
'Um... She should be, uh, attractive.

1081
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,300
'And, um, topless.

1082
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,300
- 'Uh-huh. '
- 'And she should kiss me. '

1083
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,100
Bye-bye.
You boys be good now.

1084
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,100
- Bye-bye.
- I'll tell Barry you said hello.

1085
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,700
Hey, Jack, have that bitch make me
some blueberry pancakes. Now.

1086
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,500
# Amour, amour

1087
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,400
# I built a lovin' machine

1088
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,400
# I bow all night long

1089
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,500

01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,800
# Yeah... #

1096
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,000
Excuse me. Ahem.

back slash...

1099
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,600
OK, look.
Some people are here

1100
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,900
and they are being very rude.

1101
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,000
OK. Call you back.

1102
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,300
I'm sorry, but we need your help.

1103
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,700
- Do you know Tiffany Henderson?
- Room 109.

1104
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Well, her grandfather died,

1105
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,500
and she asked me
to pick up her mail.

1106
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,600
Oh, how sad. Do you have the key?

1107
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,200
Well, she didn't bring it to the
funeral so I was hoping you could...

1108
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,400
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you need the key.

1109
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,900
Don't worry. Her mail will be here,
safe and sound.

1110
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,800
It's not like that, you see?
She needs something.

1111
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,700
- This is an emergency.
- Don't make a big deal out of it.

1112
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,700
Well, it's not a big deal, but
you need the key. Rules are rules.

1113
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,100
No one's asking you to do anything
wrong. Just, you know, look away.

1114
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,200
Go have an Eskimo pie.

1115
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,700
You guys are gonna have to leave.

1116
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,500
We're not leaving without that mail.

1117
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,900
Listen to the man before you get
some Jackie Chan on your face.

1118
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,400
- Come on, let's go.
- That means now, asshole.

1119
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,500
Jesus!

1120
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,500
I think he broke my nose. Oh, God!

1121
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,300
Come on, Susie.

1122
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,100
- You're a wrestler?
- You bet, Mary. You wanna go?

1123
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
- Let me see it.
- Oh, God!

1124
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,400
All right.

1125
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,200
- Who's my bitch?
- What?!

1126
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,500
That's it. No, no, no!

1127
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,700
OK, everyone, freeze!

1128
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,200
This here is pepper spray,
and we will use it.

1129
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,200
These guys jumped me.
I was just sitting behind my desk!

1130
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,400
Kyle?

1131
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,900
- Dad?
- That's your dad?

1132
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,200
Freeze now! Everybody freeze!

1133
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,600
Put your weapon down now!

1134
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,600
My son was kidnapped!

1135
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,600
Whoa, whoa... Who was kidnapped?

1136
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,100
I wasn't kidnapped.
These are my friends from school.

1137
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,000
What are you talkin' about?

1138
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,500
We all drove down here together.

1139
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,500
What?

1140
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,900
Then explain to me how
the frigging car got blown to hell!

1141
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,400
- Well, see...
- It was stolen.

1142
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,000
That's right. Tell him, Kyle.

1143
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,000
Uh-huh. Exactly.

1144
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,000
Stolen?

1145
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,900
What about the damned credit card?

1146
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,400
It was inside,
and that was stolen, too.

1147
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,100
Bullcrap! This is ridiculous! Why
didn't you tell us where you were?

1148
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,000
Because I knew you'd get mad! See?

1149
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,800
- I'm not mad! You're going with me.
- Josh?

1150
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,100
- Tiffany!
- What the... What's going on?

1151
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,200
- Nothing.
- Damn, dude, she is hot!

1152
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,300
My girlfriend's pagin' me.
Can we let them go?

1153
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,200
- Good idea.
- No one is going anywhere!

1154
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,900
- He's comin' with me.
- Get off of me!

1155
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,400
I'm going back with these guys.

1156
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,000
Shut your mouth and don't talk back.

1157
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,600
Why don't YOU shut up?

1158
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,400
What the hell did you just say to me?

1159
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,500
I said, you shut up.

1160
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,800
You've always told me
to stand up for myself.

1161
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,700
Well, now I am.
Leave me alone, you jerk!

1162
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:23,200
You ungrateful...

1163
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
- What...
- Go this way.

1164
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,700
Go away! Go away!

1165
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,100
What was that all about? I mean,
Josh, what are you doing here?

1166
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,600
I just missed you. That's all.

1167
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,600
I missed you, too, but it's crazy
for you to drive all the way here.

1168
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,600
What?
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

1169
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,300
I am. But Josh, you have your
entire life to live up at school.

1170
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,200
This isn't healthy. Besides...

1171
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,800
I realised a few things
this past week.

1172
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,400
You did? Like what?

1173
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,800
Like, we're in college.

1174
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,400
The window of opportunity to go out
and have fun and meet new people

1175
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,300
is getting smaller by the day.

1176
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,600
- It is?
- Come on, Josh.

1177
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
We've been together forever.

1178
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:26,800
I mean... you're pretty much
the only guy I've ever been with.

1179
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,000
What do you mean,
"pretty much the only guy"?

1180
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:34,300
Well, I was 14, and you were away
at camp, but that was years ago.

1181
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,400
Besides,
we're in different area codes.

1182
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,000
I've been thinking a lot
about us, too.

1183
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,400
The real reason I drove down...

1184
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,500
Hold that thought.

1185
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,700
Hello?

1186
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah, he's right here.

1187
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,000
Who is this?

1188
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,500
Hold on.

1189
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,100
It's for you. It's Beth.

1190
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,300
Who's Beth?

1191
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,400
Uh...

1192
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,900
Beth? What are you doing?

1193
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:23,100
I'm not sure what's going on between
us but I need to tell you something.

1194
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:27,900
I'm actually glad you called,
cos I wanted to tell you something.

1195
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,600
OK, you first.

1196
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,800
I can't really talk right now,

1197
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,100
but I'll explain everything
when I get back.

1198
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,700
'OK? Really. I promise. '

1199
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,600
Uh, I- I gotta get going, OK?

1200
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,100
- Wait! Do you want to hear mine?
- Right. Sorry.

1201
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,000
Is it good?

1202
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,800
Not really. Jacob lied to you.

1203
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,500
There's no extension
on your mid-term.

1204
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,100
What?

1205
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:58,000
'He tried to trick you. If you
don't get back you're gonna fail. '

1206
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,000
Shit!

1207
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,700
'She should be smart and funny. '

1208
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
- 'Aren't you glad I called? '
- Yes. Thank you.

1209
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,900
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, OK? Bye.

1210
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,000
- Is this for me?
- Hmm?

1211
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,600
Oh, God, no, no, no! You don't...

1212
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,000
What the hell is this?

1213
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,500
'I can see myself on TV,
I think it must be rewound. '

1214
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,300
It's Barry.

1215
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,400
'Hey, look...

1216
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,900
'Look at that. I can see my bum.

1217
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:41,300
Why would you send this to me?

1218
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,900
So wait - you guys broke up,
then you hugged and then you left?

1219
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,600
Yeah, pretty much.

1220
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,400
Loser! Always have sex with the girl
one last time before you break up.

1221
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,400
Everyone knows that!

1222
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,100
It's not like that. I've known her
my whole life. She's my best friend.

1223
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,900
So, what do we do now?

1224
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,000
- Wanna smoke some drugs?
- I don't think so.

1225
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:10,500
My mid-term starts in exactly
46 hours so I got to get back.

1226
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,300
Although I'm gonna fail anyway,
so it doesn't matter but...

1227
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,000
- Which class was it?
- Ancient Philosophy.

1228
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,600
I can teach you ancient philosophy
in 46 hours.

1229
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,300
You can?

1230
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I can teach a monkey in 46 hours.

1231
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,000
You just got to find a way
to relate to the material.

1232
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:32,700
Like, OK...
You like pro wrestling, don't you?

1233
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,600
- Who doesn't?
- OK.

1234
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,000
Socrates was like
the Vince McMahon of philosophy.

1235
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,000
He started it all.

1236
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,500
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

1237
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,100
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

1238
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,900
# Life is a cigarette

1239
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,300
# You smoke to the end

1240
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,200
# But if you rocket the middle bit

1241
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,300
# Then you burn all your friends

1242
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,200
# The wider your eyes,
the bigger the lies

1243
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,600
# Yes, it's true... #

1244
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,700
Oh, what was the 20-Man Battle Royal?

1245
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,600
Participation explains predication.
Aristotle.

1246
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,200
Right.

1247
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,900
You know this! You'll be fine.

1248
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,700
Freeze, right there! Don't move!

1249
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,800
Is this philosophy?

1250
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,200
If you hear anything, give me a call.

1251
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,200
A bomb threat is serious.
Take my card.

1252
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,200
PK.

1253
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,700
OK, let's move it.

1254
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,900
What's goin' on
with this bomb threat?

1255
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,300
False alarm, people.
Everyone back inside.

1256
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,800
We're gonna do this thing.
That's right.

1257
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,700
- Josh.
- Beth!

1258
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,800
Hey, um... thanks for calling.

1259
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:27,800
Uh, it's been a really weird week.

1260
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:32,000
So, how'd you do?

1261
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,100
On the exam? Pretty good, actually.

1262
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,200
- You did?
- Yeah.

1263
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,900
Were you surprised?

1264
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,700
You weren't back
in time for the exam,

1265
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,700
so I, uh, called in a bomb threat.

1266
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,200
You did that?

1267
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,700
That's insane.

1268
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,900
I wasn't gonna let Jacob
get you kicked out.

1269
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,500
Besides, I might need you
around next semester.

1270
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,500
So I did good, right?

1271
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,200
Good?

1272
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,300
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1273
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,600
Mom?

1274
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,000
I'm so sorry.

1275
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,600
Mom?

1276
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,500
I got carried away
with the story there.

1277
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,700
So, anyway,
Josh got a B+ on his mid-term.

1278
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,900
He got to stay in college.

1279
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,300
'And he and Beth are still together.

1280
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,300
'They're still really into
making their... home movies.

1281
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:56,600
'In fact, they have about 70 hours
of unedited amateur video. '

1282
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,700
It's pretty wild.

1283
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,700
I know, because I bought some of it.

1284
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,600
That guy Jacob?

1285
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,000
'He left school. He went on to become
the leader of some cult in Iowa.

1286
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,200
'He tried organising a mass suicide.

1287
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,400
'Only problem is,
he drank the Kool-Aid first

1288
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,600
'and, well, everyone else
just kind of changed their minds. '

1289
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,900
Too bad.

1290
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,400
As for Rubin... Remember Rubin?

1291
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,700
Remember how he claimed that
he was destined for great things?

1292
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,300
The people of Earth need me.

1293
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,100
Well, he was right.

1294
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:38,000
Rubin used cross-pollination
to develop a strain of marijuana

1295
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,800
that is not only remarkably potent...

1296
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,200
but completely undetectable
by any drug tests.

1297
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,400
Oh, my God.

1298
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,200
'He was named
High Times' man of the year. '

1299
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,200
As for EL, despite his
swinging philosophy on sexuality,

1300
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,900
he got serious with some girl he met.

1301
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,100
And you want me to use two fingers?

1302
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,200
'I believe she was pre-med. '

1303
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,200
Did I say two? Better make it three.

1304
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,400
Then there's Kyle.

1305
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,800
'Kyle and his father
reconciled their differences. '

1306
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,600
Hi, Dad. Merry Christmas.

1307
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,800
'He brought his girlfriend home. '

1308
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,600
Rhonda, this is my father, Earl.

1309
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,800
Dad, this is Rhonda.

1310
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,900
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1311
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,400
Come here.

1312
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,100
That's the end of the tour.

1313
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:39,100
I hope you strongly consider becoming
part of the Ithaca tradition,

1314
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,500
as we lead future generations
of young people

1315
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,600
forward into the new century.

1316
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,200
Thanks a lot. You were great. Thanks.

1317
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,600
- Thank you so much.
- No, it was fun.

1318
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:54,300
I'll see you in the fall.
Thank you. Thank you.

1319
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,300
- OK. Thank you.
- I'd like to say thank you.

1320
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,700
I mean, uh, that was...

1321
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,200
really great.

1322
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,100
Thank you.

1323
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,200
Thank you.

1324
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,900
Thank you.

1325
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,300
Thank you.

1326
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,400
Mom?

1327
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,600
Thank you.

1328
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,900
Thank you, Mommy.

1329
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,100
I'm pumping your mommy.

1330
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,500
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh

1331
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,300
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh #

1332
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,100
# OK, what is it tonight?

1333
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:09,100
# Please, please tell me
what the hell is wrong

1334
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,900
# Do you wanna eat, do you
wanna sleep, do you wanna drown?

1335
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:17,100
# Just settle down
settle down, settle down

1336
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,100
# I'll give you candy,

1339

# Just marry me,
marry me, marry me now

1340
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,900
# Oh, hey

1341
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,000
# I'm so sick of you tonight

1342
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:50,200
# You never stay awake
when I get home

1343
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,600
# Is something wrong with me,
something wrong with you?

1344
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,500
# I really wish I knew,
wish I knew, wish I knew

1345
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:01,800

1349
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,900
# Oh, hey

1350
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,500
# You've become so distant

1351
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,200
# Stop touching me!

1352
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,100
# Are you in love with this guy?

1353
