at 39 1/2 Institute Street,
into a cold-water flat

110

what was actually happening

and the great changes...

Or more likely signed it up real quick.

Because we, the unwashed,
the invisible, the powerless, the kids,

121

would want more.

and I unlatched its full alligator case,

180
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,065
and I slowly opened it up,

181
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,862
and up from the green velvet lining...

182
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,656
came the sweet smell...

183
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,952
of a cherry wood cocktail of power,

184
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,164
pleasure, salvation,

185

dreams, and dreams and dreams.

186
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,213
So I took lessons, dedicatedly.

187
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,134
I took lessons for two solid weeks...

188
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,681
and I quit.

192

Learning the guitar,
not only was it fucking hard,

193
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,442
but the lessons were boring!

194
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,529
Just give me the three magic chords,
please!

195
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,531

196
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,367
and shout!

197
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,955
But I was a seven-year-old kid
and my hands barely fit around the neck

198
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,834
and I couldn't waste my mother's
hard-earned cash week after week,

199

That back it was gonna have to go.

00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,969
But the morning before I returned it,
I strapped it on one more time.

201
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,225
I took it out into the backyard
where the neighborhood kids were,

202
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,770

stood the grandest tree in town.

It was a towering,
beautiful copper beech tree.

And on sunny days,
I lived under its branches.

275

Its roots were a fort for my soldiers
and a corral for my horses.

276

And I was the first on my block

277

to climb high into its upper reaches,

278
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
leaving behind a world that...

279
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,273
I didn't care for much already.

280
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,736
And up near the top,
I had the wind in my face

281
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,947
and I had all the dreaming room

282
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,074
that you could want.

283
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,036

from the Catholic Church,

the priest's rectory, the nuns' convent,

294
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,950
the St. Rose of Lima Grammar School,
all of it

295
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,244
just a football's toss away,

296
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,913

into five little houses

on two adjoining streets.

305
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:49,610
And when the church bells rang,
the whole clan would hustle up the street

306
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,865
to stand witness to every wedding
and every funeral

307
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,576

00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,958

the thrown rice from the weddings,

310
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,713
pack it away in small brown paper bags
and take it home and save it,

311
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,717
and run up the street and throw it
at the next wedding...

312
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,677
and the next wedding...

313
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,222
and the next wedding.

314
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,601
We also had front row seats
to watch the townsmen

315
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,271

an endless array...

316
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,399

my sister and I...

328
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,437

amongst the gravestones.

When it rains,

332

the moisture in the humid air
blankets the whole town

333
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,708
with the smell of moist coffee grounds
wafting in from the Nescafé plant

334
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,459
on the town's eastern edge.

335
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,879
Now, I don't like coffee,

336
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,716
but I loved that smell.

337
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,888
It was comforting. It united our town,

338
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,765
just like our clanging rug mill,

339
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,020
in a common sensory experience.
There was a place here.

340
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,064
You could hear it, you could smell it.

341
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,693
A place where people made lives

342
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,237
and where they worked
and where they danced

343
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:02,075
and where they enjoyed small pleasures
and played baseball and...

344
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
and suffered pain.

345
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,498
Where they had their hearts broke

346
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,376
and where they made love,

347
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,296
had kids...

348
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,841
where they died...

349
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,931
and drank themselves drunk
on spring nights.

350
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,060
And where they did their very best,

351
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,063
the best that they could,

352
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:37,027
to hold off the demons,
outside and inside,

353
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,030
that sought to destroy them...

354
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,910
and their homes, their families,

355
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,164

[audience applauding and cheering]

408
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,579
My father worked
as a 16-year-old floor boy

409
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,872
in that rug mill.

410
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,376
And then he went off to war.
When he came home, he got married.

411
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,337
They shut the rug mill down,
and so he went to work

412
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,548
on the Ford Motor plant line
in New Brunswick.

413
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,384
Then he worked at the Nescafé plant
in Freehold,

414
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,095
worked in a plastics factory in town.

415
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,557
He was a truck driver, a bus driver,
drove a taxi.

416
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,518
He lived mostly at home,
except for his second home,

417
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,104
which was a little local bar
in the center of town.

418
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:10,860
Now, to a child, bars in Freehold
were these citadels of great mystery.

[audience chuckles]

420
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,781
When you walked through barroom doors
in my hometown,

421
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,825
you entered the mystical realm of men.

422
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,954
On the rare night
that my mother would call my father home,

423
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,249
we would slowly drive through town
until we drew to a stop

424
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,917
outside of a single lit door.

425
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,878
She'd look at me and say,
"Go in and get your dad."

426
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,008
[clicks tongue]
This both thrilled and terrified me.

427
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,886
Thrilled me,
because I had been given the license

428
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,846
by my mother,

429
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,807
-the law...

430
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,934
...to go into the bar!

I'm a kid!

432
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,189
But it terrified me,

433
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,358
because to enter the bar

434
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:56,948
is to enter my father's privileged,
private, and sacred space.

435
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,412
He was not to be disturbed
when he's down at the bar.

436
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,665
-Everybody knew that.
- [audience chuckles]

437
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,208
So, I would walk in.

438
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,588
And I was waist-high, and like a Jack
who climbed some dark beanstalk

439
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,714
into a land of giants,

440
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,635
all I remember is the men towering
over me on their way out the door.

441
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,346
Now, once you were in,
to the left against the wall

442
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,057
was a line of red leather booths

443
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,934
that were filled
with husband and wife tag team drinkers.

444
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,687
Now, they were your hard-core regulars,

445
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,482
there night after night
after night, all right?

446
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,651
Now, to the right was the bar,

447
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,447
a line of stools filled by a barricade
of broad working-class backs,

448
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,618
clinking glasses, too loud laughter,
and very few women.

449
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:46,081
I would stand there lost in the noise
and the hustle of the crowd

450
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,251
and I would drink in
that dim smell of beer

451
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,046
and booze and aftershave.

452
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:58,051
That, to a kid,
that was the scent of adulthood.

453
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,471
It was the scent of manhood.

454
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,599
I  wanted some of that, you know?
[chuckles]

455
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,062
Finally, somebody would notice me
and draw me over to my pop.

456
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,606
Now, my view from the floor
was the first thing I'd see

457
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,817
is the chrome legs of the barstool.

458
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,529
Then I'd see his black shoes,
white socks, dark green work trousers,

459
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,072
powerful legs and haunches.

460
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,951
My dad, till the day he died,
had the legs and an ass of a rhinoceros.

[audience laughs]

462
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,789
And-- and his trousers always looked
like they were stretched,

463
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,918
stretched over those legs and ass somehow.
I don't know how.

464
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,921
He was always busting out, you know?

465
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,299
Uh, then I would see
his black Garrison work belt,

466
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,093
his green work shirt, and then his face.

467
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,679
By the time I got there,
his face was flushed red,

468
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,849
red as a tomato because he was Irish,

469
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,227
and whatever he drank
went straight to his face.

470
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:54,274
All right? He couldn't hide a thing
when he came home, you know? Uh...

471
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,736
And not only was it red,
but it was like... [mumbles]

472
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:03,867
...it was, like, distorted, too,
into some sort of booze mask, you know,

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,120
by... by Mr. Schlitz and-- and...

474
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,500
It was so foreign to me as a child that,
uh...

Fuck, I don't know! [laughs]

478
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,887
But it was scary, and he'd be peering
down over his shoulder,

479
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,348
down through cigarette smoke
and he'd be looking at me like,

480
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,477
"I've never seen you before
in my fuckin' life."

I'd hear, "Go outside.
I will be right out."

And I would follow my breadcrumb trail
back out the barroom door,

532
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,221
Now, those whose love we wanted
but didn't get,

533
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,473
we emulate them.

534
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,769
It's the only way we have in our power

535
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,983
to get the closeness and the love
that we needed and desired.

536
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,861
So, when I was a young man
and looking for a voice

537
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,948
to meld with mine, to sing my songs,
and to tell my stories,

538
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,075
well, I chose my father's voice.

539
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,205
Because there was something sacred
in it to me.

540
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,001
When I went looking for something to wear,

541
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,879
I put on a factory worker's clothes,

542
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,590
because they were my dad's clothes.

543
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,013
And all we know about manhood
is what we have seen

544
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,306
and what we have learned

545
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,477
from our fathers,
and my father was my hero

546
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
and my greatest foe.

547
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,819
Not long after he died, I had this dream.

548
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,946
I'm on stage,
I'm in front of thousands of people

549
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,075
and my dad's back from the dead,
and he's sitting in the audience.

550
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,203
And suddenly, I'm kneeling next to him
in the aisle.

551
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,166
And for a moment,
we both watch the man on fire on stage.

552
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,174
And then, to my dad, who for years,

553
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,344
he sat at that kitchen table, unreachable,

554
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,555
in what I was too young

555
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,809
and I was too stupid
to understand was his depression.

556
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,896
Well, I kneel next to him in the aisle...

557
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,398
and I brush his forearm...

558
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,902
and I say, "Look, Dad,

559
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,363
that guy on stage.

560
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,076
That's how I see you."

Now, my mom
was a different story altogether.

571
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,776
I'm gonna release you
from suicide watch right now.

572
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,487
[audience chuckles]

573
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,990
Snap out of it! Come on.

574
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,577
Because my mother was bright, happy.

575
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,246
She'd merrily make conversation
with a broom handle.

576
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,834
She believed that there was good faith,
good heart, good hope in all citizens.

577
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,172
She gave the world a lot more credit,
perhaps, than it deserves,

578
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,757
but that was her way.

579
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,926
Now, on school mornings-- I hated school.

580
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,886
That's just Rock Star 101.

581
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,805
[audience chuckles]

582
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,558
If you don't hate school in my business,

583
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,019
please keep your fucking day job,
all right?

584
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,354
[audience laughs]

585
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,732
Because it's a sign.
It's a sign that, brother,

586
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,860
you're going nowhere, man. Nowhere.

587
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,947
You need to have hatred in your heart

588
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,116
to get to the top where I am, all right?

589
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,411
You've got to hate, all right? Uh...

590
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,497
So, of course I hated getting up.

591
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,583
And, uh, my mom had perfected
this technique in the morning

592
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,169
where she'd stand over my bed
with a glass of ice water

593
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,337
and give me 30 seconds.

594
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,840
You know, "Five, four, three, two..."

595
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,260
Boom! Niagara Falls.

596
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,138
I would get dressed,
I would drift downstairs to breakfast,

597
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:51,060
where I would feast daily
on a huge bowl of Sugar Pops.

598
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,729
A fine product...

599
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,897
[audience chuckles]

600
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,316
...with just one problem.

601
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,695
They don't put enough sugar
in those Sugar Pops.

602
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,907
So, I wasn't content
until I snowed more sugar

603
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,619
on my Sugar Pops
until they looked like the Himalayas.

604
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,873
And then... Mmm!
[in gruff voice] "Good!"

605
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,919
[in normal voice]
With a buzz on and a kiss from my mom,

606
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,296
I was off

607
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,633
with my sister, lumbering up the street
with our book bags

608
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,928
as my mom's high heels clicked lightly
in the other direction

609
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,973
toward Lawyers Title Insurance Company
in town center.

610
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,558
She was a legal secretary.

611
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,477
That was the job she did
since the day she got out of high school,

612
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,021
50 years that followed.

613
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,566
Goes to work, doesn't miss a day,
never sick,

614
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,027
never down, never complains.

615
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,279
Work doesn't appear to be a burden
for her,

616
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,282
but it's a source of energy
and of social pleasure.

617
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,910
Now, some evenings, I would meet my mother
at closing time,

618
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,872
and we would be the last
to leave the office,

619
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,541
and this was always a great privilege
to me.

620
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,128
I would have my mother all to myself.

621
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,006
And with the building empty,
her high heels would echo

622
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,383
down the long linoleum hallway.

623
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,554
And with the fluorescent lights out,
lawyers' cubicles empty,

624
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,725
secretaries' desks empty,
typewriters covered,

625
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,481
silent, the building was so still
after all the noise of the day.

626
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,234
You know, it was so--
It got so quiet, it was as if...

627
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:28,366
It-- It was as if the building itself
was resting

628
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,578
after a long day of service
in the interests of our town.

629
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,831
And then suddenly,
we'd be through the front door

630
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,166
and out on Main Street

631
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,586
in the five o'clock rush hour,
and she would stride along,

632
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:45,549
statuesque, and I would be running
alongside her just...

633
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,261
trying to keep up and I would be,
you know, looking up at her.

634
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,681
And, uh, it's a sight
that I've never, never forgotten.

635
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,851
My mother walking home from work.

636
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,853
It had some...

637
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,443
just some eternal impact on me.

638
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,445
You know? Uh...

639
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,574
She-- She always had
these very ethnic features.

640
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,575
She had...

641
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:15,121
coal-black hair, Italian olive skin,
and when she was young,

642
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,082
she wore that red lipstick
that was very fashionable

643
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,792
in the '50s.

644
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,421
And she'd be looking down at me
with a look that, for me,

645
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,966
was like the grace of Mary, you know?
[chuckles]

646
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,928
Made me understand,
for the first time, how good it feels

647
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,390
to feel pride in somebody that you love,

648
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,226
and who loves you back.

649
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,647
You know, she let the town know
that we are handsome,

650
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,109
responsible members
of this shit-dog burgh,

651
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,194
pulling our own individual weight

652
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,489
doing what has to be done
day after day.

653
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,659
We have a place here that we have earned!

654
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:58,956
And we have a reason to open our eyes
at the break of each day

655
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,084
and breathe in a life
that's steady and good.

656
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,549
Now, my mom was truthfulness,
consistency, good humor,

657
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,512
professionalism, grace,
kindness, optimism, civility,

658
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,307
fairness, pride in yourself,

659
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,810
responsibility,
love, faith in your family,

660
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,981
commitment, joy in your work,
and a never-say-die thirst

661
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,109
for living, for living and for life.

662
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,113
And most importantly, for dancing.

663
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,744
My mother and her two sisters
were dancing machines, all right?

664
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,456
They grew up in the '40s
with the big bands and the swing bands

665
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,584
and they--
they learned to jitterbug and-- and...

666
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,587
[mumbles]

667
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,465
It was in their bones, you know?

668
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,552
My mom is seven years into Alzheimer's.

669
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,764
And she's 93.

670
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,894
But dancing and the desire
and need to dance is something that...

671
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,771
it hasn't left her.

672
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,317
Remains an essential,
primal part of who she is.

673
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,987
It's beyond language.
It's more powerful than memory.

674
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,742
And when she comes in the door,
we make sure there's music on.

675
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,621
She wants to dance, you know?

676
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,500
Uh, these things were the embodiment
of my mother.

677
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
They were her heart.

678
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:30,673
She carried on and she carries on
as if they never,

679
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,551
never deserted her.

And without a doubt,

866
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,740
I am definitely the best thing
that I've ever seen.

867
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,742
[audience laughs]

868
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,079
I've already played in front
of every conceivable audience.

869
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,664
I have played firemen's fairs,

870
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,877
midnight madness, supermarket openings,
drive-in movies,

871
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,339
uh, in front of the concession stand
in between films.

872
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,008
I've played beach parties,
officers' clubs,

873
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,676
pizza parlors, coffee shops,

874
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,389
bowling alleys, trailer parks,
roller rinks, VFW halls,

875
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,267
CYO canteens, the Elks Lodge,
YMCA gymnasiums,

876
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:40,397
hockey rinks, county fairs, carnivals,
high school dances, weddings,

877
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,483
fraternity parties,
[loudly] bar mitzvahs...

878
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,278
-[audience laughs]
-...soul revues, battle of the bands,

879
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,783
Sing Sing Prison,
and Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital.

880
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,286
[audience laughing and applauding]

881
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:02,794
Send me your murderers and your maniacs
and let me entertain them, all right?

882
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,964
That's what I do. That's all true.

883
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,425
That's all before I was 23 years old.

884
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,552
I'm frustrated. I listen to the radio

885
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,096
and I think, "I'm as good as that guy.

886
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,764
I'm better than that guy.

887
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,474
So why not me?"

888
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:23,148
Answer: because I live
in the fucking boondocks, all right?

889
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,943
Let me explain this to you.
I live in the boondocks.

890
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:31,197
There's nobody here,
and no one comes down here.

891
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,867
It's a grave.

892
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:40,290
There was no Jersey, Jersey,
Jersey Shore, Jersey Almighty shit.

893
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,960
-[audience laughs]
-[scattered applause]

894
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,920
I invented that.

895
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,007
[audience laughing, cheering,
and applauding]

896
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,347
Before me...

897
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,559
Jersey was Jeserkhistan.

898
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,562
Jeserkhistan!

899
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:07,650
One of the little -stan things
that nobody knows a fucking thing about.

900
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,776
You know?

901
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:13,156
And New York was a million miles away

902
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,201
from the Jersey Shore.
In my little town as a child,

903
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:20,288
we knew no one who had ever been
to New York City.

904
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,248
[audience chuckles]

905
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,627
Jesus Christ, it was--
it was only an hour away!

906
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,212
[audience laughs]

907
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,090
But no, you might as well have said
you're going to the fucking Moon.

908
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,470
"Hey, we're going to the Moon,
you wanna go?" "No, no, no.

909
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,931
No, New York. No..." [mutters]

910
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:38,932
We were provincial.

911
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,644
Everybody was afraid
of the big city. [laughs]

912
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,939
And there was no Internet,
there was no ET, or MTV,

913
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,691
or cable TV, or satellite, or...

914
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,987
This is before anyone and everyone's
ass crack from Anyplace, USA...

915
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,573
could be seen all over the world,

916
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:59,577
uh, should they choose,
in the push of a key, in the next instant.

917
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,247
So who was gonna come
to the Jersey Shore

918
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,042
to discover the next big thing in 1971?

919
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,963
[no audible dialogue]

920
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,130
You're correct.

921
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,050
[audience laughs]

922
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,428
No-fucking-body.

923
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,305
[audience laughs]

924
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,599
All we heard down there
was the sound of...

925
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,310
one hand clapping.

926
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,521
Wasn't gonna happen.

927
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,647
I had one shot.

928
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,774
My girlfriend
at the time did me a great favor.

929
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,860
Brought a guy who had
a successful recording band

930
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,614
down to the Student Prince,
our club in Asbury Park,

931
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,408
to discover us.

932
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,245
We got up on a little stage
in a club that fit 150 people.

933
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,746
It was about half full.

934
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,623
And we played for this guy

935
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,501
like we were at Madison Square Garden.

936
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,588
Everything we had, all night long.

937
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:56,843
We played five sets,
from 9:00 p.m. till 3:00 a.m.

938
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,888
At the end of the night,
I was soaked to my bones.

939
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,017
I got off the bandstand,
this guy walked up to me.

940
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,477
He looked me in the eye,
shook my hand and said,

941
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,772
"You guys are the best unsigned band
I've ever seen."

942
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,735
Then he slept with my girlfriend
and left town.

943
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,029
[audience laughs]

944
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,328
That's the end of that story.

945
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,204
[audience chuckles]

946
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,664
[scattered applause]

947
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,041
It's a sad ending.

948
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,710
I mean, I don't--
But that was enough for me.

949
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,297
I gathered together the men...

950
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:39,010
and I said, "Gentlemen,
we are going to have to leave

951
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,139
the confines of the Jersey Shore

952
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,434
and venture into parts unknown...

953
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,354
if we want to be seen,

954
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,524
heard by anybody or discovered."

955
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:57,654
I found a manager, surfboard manufacturer
from the West Coast--

956
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,074
he'd moved East-- by the name
of Carl Virgil "Tinker" West.

957
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:05,912
Now, together, he,
Mad Dog Lopez, and myself

958
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,247
we lived in the surfboard factory.

959
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:13,086
In the industrial wastelands
of Wanamassa, New Jersey.

960
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:17,465
Tinker said he had some remaining
rock 'n' roll contacts in San Francisco.

961
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:21,135
So we all got excited,
and he said if we could get there,

962
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,054
something might happen.

963
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:27,433
So we saved up all our money
until we had $100.

964
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,685
All right?

965
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,562
And then me, Danny Federici,
Mad Dog Lopez,

966
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,815
Little Vinnie Roslin, our bass player,

967
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,275
rigged out Danny's station wagon
for the drive.

968
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,445
Put a mattress in the back
for the drivers to spell each other

969
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,239
and to sleep in on the way out there.

970
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,826
We rigged Tinker's old '40s flatbed
to carry our equipment

971
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,246
and we had three days
to make it across the country

972
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:52,375
for a New Year's Eve gig
in Big Sur, California.

973
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,419
Now, three days means

974
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,797
those are gonna be thousand-mile days.

975
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,634
You can make it, but you can't stop.

976
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,596
You stop for gas and for nothing else.

977
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:11,185
You drive, drive, drive, drive,
72 hours straight.

978
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,522
Somebody's driving all the time
around the clock.

979
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,858
Now, of course, we lost Danny

980
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,027
and the entire station wagon
full of drivers

981
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,448
-in Nashville, Tennessee.
-[audience chuckles]

982
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,658
Now, there's no cellular phones.

983
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,786
Young people, take a moment.

984
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,753
[audience laughs and applauds]

985
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,964
[Bruce] Let's try it.

986
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,634
Imagine a world
without the cellular phone.

987
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,512
When you lose someone

988
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,265
in that world
without the cellular phone...

989
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,643
oh, they're fucking lost.

990
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,729
[audience laughs]

991
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,484
There's no device.

992
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,779
You can't get in touch with them.
They're gone!

993
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,405
Out of your life!

994
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,324
[audience chuckles]

995
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,534
Into the ether.

996
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,873
So now, it's just Tinker and me,
Tinker's dog,

997
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,917
thousands of miles to go,

998
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,754
and we got several problems.
One is I have no license.

999
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:23,758
Second problem is I don't have a clue
as to how to drive.

1000
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,761
And by that, I mean the man

1001
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,473
who would very, very shortly
write "Racing in the Street"...

1002
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,267
[audience laughs]

1003
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:38,105
[applause]

1004
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,692
That's how good I am.

1005
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:48,241
Because, at 21,
I had never driven a fucking block.

1006
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,327
Around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.,

1007
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,539
Tinker's eyes glass over
and he says, "I'm fried.

1008
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,166
I need to get some sleep.
It's your turn to drive."

1009
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,377
I go, "Tink, I can't drive."

1010
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,171
He says, "Springsteen,
there's nothing to it.

1011
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,466
Idiots all over the world are doing it,
all right?"

1012
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,262
He pulls me into a parking lot.
He puts me behind the wheel.

1013
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,389
I start grinding gears,
pumping the clutch,

1014
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:15,685
jerking the truck all over the lot--
It's a 1940s manual transmission.

1015
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,271
I can't get past first gear!

1016
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,650
After a moment Tinker says,
"This isn't going to work,

1017
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,360
but I got another idea."

1018
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,070
He gets in the driver's seat.

1019
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,115
He slips in the clutch.
He smoothly shifts it into first.

1020
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,825
He eases out on the clutch.

1021
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,411
He gets that truck going
on a sweet little roll,

1022
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,163
looks at me and says,
"Now let's switch seats."

1023
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,665
[audience laughs]

1024
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,375
And that's what we did.

1025
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:44,088
I was fine in second, third, and fourth
and I could keep it in between the lines

1026
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,092
as long as I didn't have to stop
or go near first gear.

1027
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:52,388
If I've gotta do either of those things,
I have to wake up Mr. West.

1028
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:55,933
All right? Now, it doesn't matter

1029
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,185
because he's awake anyway,

1030
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,897
because the guy who can't drive
is driving!

1031
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,481
[audience laughs]

1032
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,027
You're not gonna sleep through that!

1033
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,863
So... [mumbles]

1034
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:12,074
You'd be surprised how far
you can go across this big country

1035
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,285
without having to stop. You know, it's...

1036
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:18,623
it's a long ways between things out there,

1037
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,917
and, man, I drove my share

1038
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,085
of 2,000 miles...

1039
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,380
in second, third, and fourth gear.

1040

[chuckles, laughing]

1041

1044
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,061
that trip was...

-[strums Fsus chord]

1046

...was where I saw the United States
at its fullest

1047
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:49,111
and as a young man, I was overwhelmed
by its size and its beauty, and...

1048
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,530
this is a short piece
from the book about...

1049
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,409
riding across the country
for the very first time.

1050
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,080
[plays chords]

1051
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,582
The country was beautiful.

1052
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:06,921
And I felt a great elation at the wheel
as we crossed the western desert at dawn.

1053
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,175
The deep blue, purple shadowed canyons.

1054
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,970
The pale yellow morning sky

1055
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,847
with all of its color drawn out,

1056
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,184
leaving just
the black silhouetted mountains

1057
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,521
in your rearview mirror.

1058
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,400
Then with the eastern sun rising
at our backs,

1059
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,987
the deep reds and the browns
of the plains and the hills

1060
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,532
came to life slowly in front of us.

1061
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:42,957
Your palms turn salty white
on the wheel from the aridity.

1062
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,502
Morning woke the Earth
into this muted color.

1063
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,255
And then came the flat light
of the midday sun

1064
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,800
and everything stood revealed
as pure horizon.

1065
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,388
Just sky, sky, sky, and more sky.

1066
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,391
Lowering onto two lanes of blacktop

1067
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,562
and disappearing into nothing.

1068
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,648
My favorite thing.

1069
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,653
Then the evening
with the sun burning red into your eyes

1070
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,906
and dropping gold
into the western hills in front of you.

1071
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:18,576
All felt like home to me.

1072
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:23,205
And I fell into a lasting love affair
with the desert.

So, it's-- it's 1980.

1117
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,953
I'm 30 years old, I'm on another
cross-country trip with a buddy of mine

1118
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,497
and we stop outside of Phoenix to gas up.

1119
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,874
[inhales] Go into a small-town drugstore,

1120
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,210
I'm rifling through a rack
of paperback books,

1121
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,130
I come across a book
called  Born on the Fourth of July

1122
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:44,174
by a Vietnam veteran named Ron Kovic.

1123
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,719
Now, his book was a testimony
of the experience

1124
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,055
that he'd had as a combat infantryman
in Southeast Asia.

1125
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,932
A week or two later,

1126
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,854
I'm bunked in at the fabulous
Sunset Marquis motel in Los Angeles.

1127
01:11:57,354 --> 01:12:00,774
Uh-- For the uninformed,
it's kind of an upscale,

1129
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:05,529
Uh, small world theory.

1130
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,324
Small world theory proves itself
once again.

1131
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,409
I'd been seeing a young guy
with shoulder-length hair

1132
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,287
sitting in a wheelchair
by the pool for several days.

1133
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:18,834
So, one afternoon he rolled up to me
and said, "Hi, I'm Ron Kovic.

1134
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:21,462
I wrote a book
called  Born on the Fourth of July."

1135
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,091
I said, "Jeez. I just-- I just read it.
And it-- it destroyed me."

1136
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:30,846
He spent the afternoon talking to me
about many returned soldiers

1137
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,265
who were struggling
with a wide variety of problems,

1138
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:38,145
and he wanted to know if I'd take a drive
with him to the vet center in Venice...

1139
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,607
meet some
of the Southern California veterans.

1140
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,777
So I said, "Sure."
The next day, we headed out there,

1141
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,572
and I'm usually pretty easy with people,
but once we were at the center,

1142
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:53,369
I didn't know how to respond
to what I was seeing. Uh...

1143
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:58,040
Talking about my own life
to these guys seemed frivolous.

1144
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:58,957
You know?

1145
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,669
There was homelessness and drug problems
and post-traumatic stress and...

1146
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:06,173
young guys my age
dealing with life-changing...

1147
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,675
physical injuries.

1148
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,929
And it made me think about my own friends
from back home.

1149
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:13,847
Walter Cichon.

1150
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:18,477
Walter Cichon was the greatest
rock 'n' roll front man

1151
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,897
on the Jersey Shore
in the bar band '60s.

1152
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,358
He was in a group called The Motifs,

1153
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,946
and he was the first real rock star
that I ever laid my eyes on.

1154
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,741
He just had it in his bones.
He had it in his blood.

1155
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,327
It was in the way that he carried himself.

1156
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:39,665
On stage, he just was deadly.

1157
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:44,128
He was raw and sexual and dangerous,

1158
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:48,841
and in our little area he taught us,
by the way that he lived,

1159
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,344
that  you  could live your life
the way you chose.

1160
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,304
You could look the way you wanted to look,

1161
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,432
you could play the music
you wanted to play,

1162
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,475
you could be who you wanted to be,

1163
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,769
and you could tell anyone
who didn't like it

1164
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,604
to go fuck themselves.

1165
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,523
-[audience laughs]
-Walter had a...

1166
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:07,818
guitar-playing brother, Raymond.

1167
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,112
Raymond was...

1168
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,906
tall, tall, kind of sweetly clumsy guy,

1169
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:16,827
one of those big guys
who just isn't comfortable with his size.

1170
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:21,039
You know, uh, he's always, like,
"Ooh. Ooh."

1171
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:25,294
Knocking into shit wherever he is.
And wherever that is,

1172
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,548
there is just not enough space
for Raymond, for some reason.

1173
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:31,133
And, uh...

1174
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:35,095
But the strange thing was
he was always dressed impeccably

1175
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:40,184
with a pastel shirt, long pointed collar,
sharkskin pants, nylon socks,

1176
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,104
spit-shined pointy-toed shoes,
slicked-back black hair

1177
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,858
with a little curl that would come down
when he was playing the guitar.

1178
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:50,360
Uh, Raymond was my guitar hero.

1179
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,071
He was just a shoe salesman in the day.

1180
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,992
And, uh, Walter, I think,
worked construction.

1181
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,952
They were only a little bit older
than we were,

1182
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:02,539
never had any national hit records,
never did any big tours,

1183
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,500
but they were gods to me.

1184
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,585
And...

1185
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,755
the hours I spent standing
in front of their band,

1186
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,342
studying, studying, studying,
class in session.

1187
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,345
Night after night,
watching Ray's fingers fly

1188
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,931
over the fretboard,
and Walter would scare...

1189
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,143
the shit out of half the crowd.

1190
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,103
Oh, man.

1191
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,858
They were essential to my development
as a young musician.

1192
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:35,322
I learned so much
from Walter and from Ray.

1193
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,032
And my dream,

1194
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:40,494
my dream was I just wanted
to play like Ray

1195
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,787
and walk like Walter.

1196
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:43,413
And then there was Bart Haynes.

1197
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:47,834
Bart Haynes was the drummer
from my first band, The Castiles.

1198
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,588
He was the first real drummer
I ever played with.

1199
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,549
He was an absurdly funny kid,

1200
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:57,761
classic class clown,
was a good, good drummer...

1201
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:02,641
with one strange quirk--
couldn't play "Wipe Out" by The Surfaris.

1202
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,643
[audience laughs]

1203
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:08,605
This may not seem so critical to you
right now, I understand.

1204
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,234
But in those days,

1205
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:15,696
your skills, your mettle,

1206
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:21,410
your self-worth as a drummer
and as a human being

1207
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,583
was tested in front of your peers
once an evening

1208
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,168
by your performance of "Wipe Out."

1209
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,214
Now, Bart could play
every other fucking thing,

1210
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,300
but when it came to "Wipe Out"...

1211
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,973
beyond his capabilities!

1212
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,391
[audience laughs]

1213
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,809
It was tragic.

1214
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,354
You know, uh...

1215
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,441
One day he got off...

1216
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,278
got up off the drum stool,
he joined the Marines, and...

1217
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,990
Walter and Bart... [exhales]

1218
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:05,829
...they were both killed in the war
in 1967 and '68.

1219
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,625
Bart was the first young man
from our hometown

1220
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,377
to give his life in Vietnam.

1221
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:18,634
So, I really didn't know what to say
to the guys that I was meeting in Venice.

1222
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:22,220
I sat there for most of the afternoon
and I just listened.

1223
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,267
Then in 1982, I wrote
and I recorded my soldier story.

1224
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,770
It was a protest song, a GI blues.

1225
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:33,148
The verses are just
an accounting of events.

1226
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:38,487
The choruses were a declaration
of your birthplace...

1227
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,782
and the right to all of the blood
and the confusion

1228
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:45,118
and the pride and the shame
and the grace...

1229
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,955
that comes with birthplace.

1230
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,461
In 1969, Mad Dog, Little Vinnie,
and myself,

1231
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:59,633
we were all drafted on the exact same day.

1232
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:01,218
All three of us.

1233
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:05,597
We rode together early one Monday morning
from the Selective Service Office

1234
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:10,060
on probably the unhappiest bus
that ever pulled out of Asbury Park,

1235
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,229
because we were on our way

1236
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:16,108
to what we were sure
was going to be our funeral.

1237
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,278
We'd seen it already, up very close.

1238
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:28,078
When we got to the Newark Draft Board,
we did everything we could not to go.

1239
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,039
And we succeeded, all three of us.

1240
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,666
When I go to Washington,

1241
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:35,544
and I have the occasion
to visit Walter and Bart,

1242
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:40,298
I'm glad that Mad Dog's, Little Vinnie's,

1243
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:45,637
for that matter,
my name isn't up on... on that wall.

1244
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:50,142
But it was 1969, and thousands
and thousands of young men to come

1245
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:54,479
would be called, simply sacrificed,

1246
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,566
just to save face for the powers that be

1247
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,860
who, by then, already knew.

1248
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:02,821
They knew it was a lost cause.

1249
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,577
And still, thousands and thousands...

1250
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,329
of more young boys.

1251
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:14,040
So, uh...

1252
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,590
So I do sometimes wonder
who went in my place.

1253

1289
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:24,559
Bands come out of towns,
out of a city, out of a neighborhood.

1290
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:28,354
And they come along
at a particular moment, you know?

1291
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:32,150
Bands are all about what happens
when musicians

1292
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,819
who come from the same streets,

1293

1294
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:44,370
They come together in a whole

1295
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,082
that is greater than the sum
of their parts.

1296
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:50,376
They may not be the best players.
That's not necessary.

1297
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,130
They need to be the right players
and when they play together,

1298
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,967
there is a communion of souls

1299
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:02,597
and a natural brotherhood
and sisterhood manifests itself,

1300
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,767
and a quest, a quest is begun.

1301

You're in search of something,

And you ride shotgun.

1304
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:19,656
In a real band, the principles of math
get stood on their head.

1305
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,325

1365
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:18,019
First night I saw Clarence,
he came walking out of the shadows

1366
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,312
towards the bandstand,

1367
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:24,192
nodded to me, got up,
stood to my right for the very first time.

1368
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,486
He picked up his saxophone.

1369

he whispered that story in my ear.

And then we whispered it into your ear.

1373
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,718
And we carried it together for a long...

1374
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,931

1375
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,936

1379
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:14,158
When I first heard it, I thought it was
the biggest sound I ever heard.

1380
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:16,869
And it was.

1381
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:23,334
His heart and his problems,
they were big.

I guess Clarence and my's friendship

She's a badass!

1576
01:45:44,755 --> 01:45:47,132
Gonna add this song to our set tonight.

1577
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:52,804
All right, this is the final days
of Patti's first pregnancy.

1578
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:58,477
I receive a surprise visit
from my father at my home in LA.

1579
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,438
You know, he had driven 500 miles,
unannounced,

1580
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,523
to knock on my door.

1581
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:05,859
That's his style.

1582
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:08,487
So at 11:00 a.m., we sit

1583
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,907
in the sunlit dining room
and we're nursing morning beers.

1584
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,327
-That's his style.
-[audience laughs]

1585
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,746
It's my father's breakfast of champions.

1586
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:24,294
When my dad, never a talkative man,
right, blurted out,

1587
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,630
"You've been very good to us."

1588
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:31,551
And I nodded that I had, you know?
And, uh...

1589
01:46:33,178 --> 01:46:36,098
And then he says,
"And I wasn't very good to you."

1590
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:41,728
[mumbles] And the room just...

1591
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,942
well, stood still...

1592
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:52,239
as to my shock, the unacknowledgeable
was being acknowledged.

1593
01:46:52,322 --> 01:46:53,156
If I...

1594
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:57,160
If I didn't know better,
I would have sworn an apology...

1595
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,080
of some sort was being made.

1596
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,249
And it was.

1597
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:06,503
Here in the last days, before I was...

1598
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:11,299
to become a father,
my own father was visiting me...

1599
01:47:12,717 --> 01:47:15,220
to warn me of the mistakes
that he had made,

1600
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:19,057
and to warn me not to make them
with my own children.

1601
01:47:20,559 --> 01:47:24,020
[sighs] To release them
from the chain of our sins,

1602
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:27,399
my father's and mine
and our fathers' before.

1603
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:30,444
That they may be free...

1604
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:34,364
to make their own choices
and to live their own lives.

1605
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:41,329
We are ghosts or we are ancestors
in our children's lives.

1606
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:46,084
We either lay our mistakes,
our burdens upon them

1607
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:47,961
and we haunt them.

1608
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:52,632
Or we assist them in laying
those old burdens down,

1609
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:57,554
and we free them from the chain
of our own flawed behavior.

1610
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:02,559
And as ancestors,
we walk alongside of them,

1611
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:06,062
and we assist them
in finding their own way

1612
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:08,440
and some transcendence.

1613
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:11,026
My father...

1614
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:16,364
on that day, was petitioning me

1615
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:20,285
for an ancestral role in my life

1616
01:48:20,368 --> 01:48:24,706
after being a ghost for a long, long time.

1617
01:48:25,957 --> 01:48:30,754
[clicks tongue]   He wanted me to write
a new end to our relationship,

1618
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:34,841
and he wanted me to be ready
for the new beginning

1619
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:37,969
that I was about to experience.

1620
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:45,519
It was the greatest moment
in my life with my dad.

1621
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,188
And it was all that I needed.

1622

[Bruce] All right.

1667
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,599
I never believed that people come
to my shows

1668
01:52:52,682 --> 01:52:55,477
or to rock shows in general
to be told anything.

1669

[audience chuckles]

1670
01:52:57,896 --> 01:52:58,730
But...

1671
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,108
I do believe that they come
to be reminded of things,

1672
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:04,986
to be reminded of who they are
at their most joyous,

1673
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,322
at their deepest when life feels full.

1674
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:10,408
It's a good place to get in touch
with your heart and your spirit.

1675
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:12,285
It's good to be amongst the crowd,

1676
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:15,622
be reminded of who we are
and who we can be collectively.

1677
01:53:15,705 --> 01:53:17,916
Music does those things pretty well.

1678
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,669
Sometimes, they can come in pretty handy.

1679
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,964
And particularly these days,
when some reminding

1680
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:28,426
of who we are and who we can be
isn't such a bad thing.

1681
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,552
You know?

1682
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:34,057
[audience applauds]

1683
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:40,730
I-- I refer back to the weekend
of the March for Our Lives

1684
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:43,233
when we saw all those young people
in Washington,

1685
01:53:43,316 --> 01:53:45,318
and citizens all around the country,

1686
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:48,029
remind us of what faith in America

1687
01:53:48,112 --> 01:53:50,698
and what real faith in American democracy

1688
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,201
and how sacred that is.

1689
01:53:54,285 --> 01:53:57,121
[crowd whooping and clapping]

1690
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:01,543
You know...

1691
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:07,298
that weekend, you just saw
what it actually looked and felt like.

1692
01:54:07,882 --> 01:54:09,467
It was just encouraging

1693
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:12,428
to see all those people out on the street

1694
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:16,599
and all that righteous passion alive
in the service of something good.

1695
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:19,185
To see it's still there,

1696
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:22,939
at the center of the beating heart
of our country...

1697
01:54:24,148 --> 01:54:25,233
and...

1698
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,946
in spite of what we've been going through.
And it was a good day, you know?

1699
01:54:30,029 --> 01:54:31,239
It was just...

1700
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:33,741
it was just one good day.

1701
01:54:34,784 --> 01:54:36,744
But it was a necessary day.

1702
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:40,790
Because these are times
when we've also seen folks marching,

1703
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:46,045
and in the highest offices of our land,
who want to speak to our darkest angels,

1704
01:54:46,379 --> 01:54:50,091
who want to call up the ugliest
and the most divisive ghosts

1705
01:54:50,174 --> 01:54:53,928
of America's past.
And they want to destroy the idea

1706
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:56,764
of an America for all.
That's their intention.

1707
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:59,517
That's what we've been seeing,
in the outrage

1708
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:01,978
of the broken families on the border,

1709
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:07,191
and in hate-filled marches
on American streets this year.

1710
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:13,364
Things I never thought
I would see again in my lifetime.

1711
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:17,327
Things that I thought
were dead and gone...

1712
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:21,331
forever, on the ash heap of history.

1713
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:23,249
You know...

1714
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,920
We've come too far and worked too hard,

1715
01:55:27,003 --> 01:55:30,590
too many good people paid
too high a price,

1716
01:55:31,132 --> 01:55:35,678
paid with their lives,
to allow this to happen now.

1717
01:55:36,846 --> 01:55:38,723
You know... [mumbles]

1718
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:42,936
There's been too much hard work done,

1719
01:55:43,853 --> 01:55:45,146
and sacrifice.

1720
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:48,858
There's a beautiful quote by Dr. King

1721
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,027
that says,
"The arc of the moral universe is long,

1722
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,737
but it bends toward justice."

1723
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:57,533
It is important to believe in those words
and to carry yourself

1724
01:55:58,117 --> 01:56:01,454
and to act accordingly,
to live with compassion.

1725
01:56:02,455 --> 01:56:05,166
And to have faith
in that what we're seeing now,

1726
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,627
it's just another hard chapter...

1727
01:56:08,544 --> 01:56:11,464
in the long, long, ongoing battle

1728
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,175

and I studied and I played

1828
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:33,734
and I worked,

1829
02:05:33,817 --> 02:05:37,404
'cause I wanted to hear and I wanted
to know the whole American story.

1830

I wanted to know my story
and your story.

1833

1834
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,046
where I came from and what that meant.

02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,300

Where was I going?

Where were we going together
as a people?

1837
02:06:02,346 --> 02:06:05,474
And-- and what did it mean
to be an American?

1838
02:06:05,975 --> 02:06:11,689
And to be a part of that story
in this place and in this time.

1839

I wanted to be able to celebrate
and honor its beauty,

its power.

1841
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:21,949

to be a critical voice

that's what the times called for.

It was a beautiful fall November evening.
It was during the writing of my book.

1985
02:16:23,967 --> 02:16:26,678
I drove back to my neighborhood
where I grew up,

1986
02:16:27,554 --> 02:16:28,889

1987
02:16:30,682 --> 02:16:31,766

But, uh...

1991
02:16:37,689 --> 02:16:39,774
All I know is the streets were dead empty

1992
02:16:39,858 --> 02:16:44,529
and the whole place looked
like it had been locked down since 1955.

1993
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:47,782
My corner church was silent and unchanged,

1994
02:16:47,866 --> 02:16:50,118
no weddings, no funerals. I...

1995
02:16:50,577 --> 02:16:53,455
rolled slowly another 50 yards up my block

1996
02:16:53,538 --> 02:16:56,208
to visit my great tree, and it was gone.

1997
02:16:57,584 --> 02:17:02,005
It had been cut to the street
since the last time I had drove through.

1998
02:17:02,797 --> 02:17:06,176
So I got out of the car
and I looked down and there was a...

1999
02:17:06,927 --> 02:17:11,097
square of musty earth that held
the remaining snakes of its roots

2000
02:17:11,181 --> 02:17:13,058
on the edge of a parking lot.

2001
02:17:13,516 --> 02:17:16,728
So I reached down and I picked up
a handful of dirt

2002
02:17:17,103 --> 02:17:19,522
and I just kind of ran it
through my hands.

2003
02:17:20,774 --> 02:17:23,151
And my heart sank like...

2004
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:26,947
like a kid who had suffered
some irretrievable loss.

2005
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:28,448
You know, like some...

2006
02:17:29,824 --> 02:17:32,827
some piece of me was gone. [sighs]

2007
02:17:34,913 --> 02:17:36,206
Um...

2008
02:17:38,416 --> 02:17:40,835
[clicks tongue] I don't know. I guess I...

2009
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:46,091
It was just it had been there
long before I was.

2010
02:17:46,174 --> 02:17:49,177
I assumed it would be there
long after I was gone.

2011
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:51,054
And I liked that.

2012
02:17:51,846 --> 02:17:53,723
It-- It felt eternal.

2013
02:17:54,307 --> 02:17:58,687
It was at the center of our street
and it had rooted

2014
02:17:59,854 --> 02:18:03,817
our neighborhood for so long.

2015
02:18:04,734 --> 02:18:07,821
So I sat there for a while
just cursing the county.

2016
02:18:08,655 --> 02:18:11,157
And listening to the sounds
of the evening come on,

2017
02:18:11,241 --> 02:18:14,244
and I looked again
and I realized it was gone, but some...

2018
02:18:15,245 --> 02:18:17,497
some essential piece of it
was still there,

2019
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:20,166
the air and the space above its roots.

2020
02:18:20,792 --> 02:18:25,005
I could still feel the life
and the soul and the light

2021
02:18:25,964 --> 02:18:28,174
of my childhood friend there.

2022
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:32,429
It's just that its leaves, its branches
and its massive trunk

2023
02:18:32,512 --> 02:18:36,599
were now outlined, shot through,

2024
02:18:37,392 --> 02:18:40,103
by evening stars and sky.

2025
02:18:41,271 --> 02:18:45,483
But my great tree's life couldn't be ended
or erased so easily

2026
02:18:46,234 --> 02:18:48,361
from this place, because it's history,

2027
02:18:49,154 --> 02:18:50,488
and history matters.

2028
02:18:51,531 --> 02:18:53,450
Its imprint was too great.

2029
02:18:53,533 --> 02:18:57,495
It was too old and it was too strong,
and it had been there too long...

2030
02:18:58,413 --> 02:19:00,415
to be done away with so easily.

2031
02:19:00,498 --> 02:19:02,125
It had stood witness

2032
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:07,881
to everything that had happened
on these small streets beneath its arms.

2033

And all the life.

2036
02:19:18,308 --> 02:19:23,396
And we live amongst ghosts,
always trying to reach us...

2037

Oh, man... [mutters]

2042
02:19:41,748 --> 02:19:44,167
I wish he could have been here
to see this.

2043
02:19:47,962 --> 02:19:50,882
But I visit with him every night.

2044
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:55,011
A little bit. That's a grace-filled thing.

2045
02:19:55,095 --> 02:19:56,930
And Clarence, I get to...

2046
02:19:57,931 --> 02:20:01,226
I get to see and be with Clarence
a little bit every night.

2047
02:20:02,602 --> 02:20:03,895
And Danny...

2048

Walter,

2049
02:20:06,731 --> 02:20:07,774
and Bart.

2050
02:20:07,857 --> 02:20:10,568
My own family, so many of them gone...

2051
02:20:11,361 --> 02:20:15,240
from these houses that are now filled
by strangers, but the soul...

2052
02:20:15,907 --> 02:20:17,742
the soul is a stubborn thing.

2053
02:20:18,993 --> 02:20:21,204
It doesn't dissipate so quickly.

2054
02:20:21,287 --> 02:20:22,956
Souls remain.

2055
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:26,042
They remain here in the air,

2056
02:20:26,668 --> 02:20:28,211
in empty space,

2057
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:30,296
dusty roots,

2058
02:20:31,089 --> 02:20:33,675
in sidewalks
that I knew every single inch of

2059
02:20:33,758 --> 02:20:35,635
like I knew my own body

2060
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:37,429
as a child...

2061
02:20:39,514 --> 02:20:41,766
and in the songs that we sing.

2062
02:20:44,853 --> 02:20:47,772
You know... That is why we sing.

2063
02:20:49,566 --> 02:20:52,527
We sing for our blood and for our people.

2064
02:20:54,404 --> 02:20:57,532
Because that's all we have
at the end of the day.

2065
02:21:01,703 --> 02:21:03,121
Each other, and...

2066
02:21:03,746 --> 02:21:06,207
maybe that's what I'm looking for
when I go down there.

2067
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:08,042
I just want to commune...

2068
02:21:09,043 --> 02:21:10,628
with the old spirits,

2069
02:21:11,713 --> 02:21:13,465
stand in their presence,

2070
02:21:14,007 --> 02:21:15,925
feel their hands on me...

2071
02:21:23,516 --> 02:21:24,893
one more time.

2072

[clicks tongue, sighs]

2073
02:21:28,646 --> 02:21:32,233
Anyway, once again, I stood in the shadow
of my old church, you know?

2074
02:21:32,317 --> 02:21:34,611
You know what they say about Catholics?

2075
02:21:35,778 --> 02:21:38,865
-Yeah, there's no getting out.
- [audience chuckles]

2076
02:21:38,948 --> 02:21:42,577
No, no. You know,
once they got you, they got you.

2077
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:45,497
The bastards got you
when the gettin' was good.

2078

They did their work hard
and they did it well.

'Cause the words of a very strange
but all too familiar benediction

2080

came back to me that evening.

2081
02:21:58,468 --> 02:22:01,095
And I want to tell you,
these were words that as a kid,

2082
02:22:01,179 --> 02:22:04,599
I mumbled these things,
I singsonged them,

2083
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:08,895
I... chanted them,
bored out of my fucking mind

2084
02:22:08,978 --> 02:22:11,898
in an endless drone before class

2085
02:22:11,981 --> 02:22:15,568
-every fucking day.
-[audience laughs]

2086
02:22:15,652 --> 02:22:19,489
Every day, the green blazer,
the green tie, the green trousers,

2087
02:22:19,572 --> 02:22:23,993

of St. Rose's unwilling disciples.

But for some damn reason

2091
02:22:32,669 --> 02:22:35,880
as I sat there on my street that night,

2092
02:22:37,465 --> 02:22:41,177
you know, mourning, mourning my old tree,

2093
02:22:42,136 --> 02:22:44,889
and once again surrounded by God,

2094
02:22:46,516 --> 02:22:49,894
those were the words that came back
to me and they flowed differently.

2095
02:22:52,939 --> 02:22:56,442
It was "Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

Just give us this day, and forgive us

2101

our sins, our trespasses,

2102
02:23:14,210 --> 02:23:17,547
as we may forgive those
who trespass against us.

2103
02:23:17,964 --> 02:23:21,676
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil,

2104

all of us,

2105
02:23:24,804 --> 02:23:26,806
forever and ever. Amen."
