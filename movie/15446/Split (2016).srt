some primal core human feeling.

Yeah.

I wanted shock, you know?

00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:09,912
Pure shock, that moment
when you can't believe

511
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,114
you've been betrayed.

512
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:16,652
That shock, right before the pain slams in.

Hello?

527
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:40,569
Because last time we worked together

528
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,705
it was disastrous and nothing has changed.

He's pompous and a tyrant
and I can't work with him.

00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,939
He has this project he wants
me to do and I can't do it.

Why not?

00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:22,044
Because he has no faith, he has no belief.

536

He doesn't think that if
you talk about something,

you can make it better.

He's the logical creative partner for me

539

and he can't actually be my partner.

You're an extraordinary man.

Other people, they get jealous

and they criticize you and your work

545
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:45,334
because they know that
you're vulnerable to it

546
00:56:45,336 --> 00:56:47,769

But I don't really feel
like you're that into me.

talk to me or touch me.

I need to feel like you hear me.

Why does it always have
to be about you, Inanna?

I hear you, okay?

570
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,805
INANNA: I just thought that if we could

571
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,106
talk about the relationship a little,

572
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,775
we can make it better.

573
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,009
No, because when you talk
about the relationship,

574
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,444
it's not you talking about the relationship,

575
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:05,747
it's you talking about
what a bad boy Derek is.

INANNA: That's not true.

577

You always twist what I'm saying,

I don't wanna punish you.

this is all a setup to punish Derek,

00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,457
just like this becomes an ambush.

murdered parts of ourselves

and reclaim them, so we can be whole.

999
02:05:29,289 --> 02:05:30,822
¶ If you wanna say the truth

1000
02:05:30,824 --> 02:05:31,923
¶ Then say it loud, loud, loud

1001
02:05:31,925 --> 02:05:33,424
¶ If you're dishing something wicked

1002
02:05:33,426 --> 02:05:34,792
¶ Don't be proud, proud, proud

1003
02:05:34,794 --> 02:05:36,094
¶ Don't convict it or inflict it

1004
02:05:36,096 --> 02:05:39,831
¶ All around, round, round

1005
02:05:39,833 --> 02:05:41,999
¶ A little goes a long way

1006
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:45,169
¶ Get you through the meltdown

1007
02:05:45,171 --> 02:05:46,904
¶ It'll catch on, it'll catch on

1008
02:05:46,906 --> 02:05:50,208
¶ Spread the love around

1009
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:52,376
¶ A little goes a long way

1010
02:05:52,378 --> 02:05:56,047
¶ See you through the meltdown

1011
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:58,583
¶ It'll catch on

1012
02:05:58,584 --> 02:06:01,118
¶ It'll catch, catch, it'll catch

1013
02:06:09,929 --> 02:06:11,929
¶ I used to be the hater
in the crowd, crowd, crowd

1014
02:06:11,931 --> 02:06:14,532
¶ Kept my nose always pointed
at the clouds, clouds, clouds

1015
02:06:14,534 --> 02:06:15,933
¶ Wouldn't listen to the facts

1016
02:06:15,935 --> 02:06:17,401
¶ Shut 'em out, out, out

1017
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:19,937
¶ Didn't understand what
power was about, 'bout, 'bout

1018
02:06:19,939 --> 02:06:22,774
¶ There's a reason we can
have it all now, now, now

1019
02:06:22,776 --> 02:06:24,308
¶ There's a reason we should spread the love

1020
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:25,977
¶ Around, 'round, 'round

1021
02:06:25,979 --> 02:06:28,079
¶ When you find a person
showing off their golden crown

1022
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:32,950
¶ Then you take it and
melt it down, down, down

1023
02:06:32,952 --> 02:06:36,788
¶ A little goes a long way

1024
02:06:38,258 --> 02:06:42,493
¶ A little bit more and a little bit more

1025
02:06:43,897 --> 02:06:46,030
¶ A little goes a long way

1026
02:06:46,032 --> 02:06:49,100
¶ Send them on a meltdown

1027
02:06:49,102 --> 02:06:51,135
¶ It'll catch on, it'll catch on

1028
02:06:51,137 --> 02:06:54,338
¶ Spread the love around

1029
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:56,474
¶ A little goes a long way

1030
02:06:56,476 --> 02:06:59,911
¶ See you through the meltdown

1031
02:06:59,913 --> 02:07:02,113
¶ It'll catch on, it'll catch, catch

1032
02:07:02,115 --> 02:07:05,149
¶ It'll catch, catch on

1033
02:07:05,151 --> 02:07:07,185
¶ A little goes a long way

1034
02:07:07,187 --> 02:07:10,354
¶ Get 'em through the meltdown

1035
02:07:10,356 --> 02:07:12,223
¶ It'll catch on, it'll catch on

1036
02:07:12,225 --> 02:07:15,459
¶ Spread the love around

1037
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:17,962
¶ A little goes a long way

1038
02:07:17,964 --> 02:07:21,165
¶ See them through the meltdown

1039
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:25,403
¶ It'll catch on, it'll
catch on, it'll catch
