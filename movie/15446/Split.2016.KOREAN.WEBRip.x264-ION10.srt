00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:51,167
Yoon Cheol-jong already recorded two
perfect games on WEDNESDAY BOWLING.

3
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,542
"Even at the grand prix, he's having
a perfect game up to the 9th frame."

4
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:55,501
Last frame!

5
00:00:55,667 --> 00:01:00,250
"If you include the bonus frames, he can bowl up to 3 strikes here."

6
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,334
There's still a long way to go.

7
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:05,542
"Don't lose your focus, Cheol-jong!"

8
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,501
WEDNESDAY BOWLING - FINAL MATCH

9
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,042
Oh! Another strike!

10
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,959
Yoon Cheol-jong is really amazing.

11
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:20,542
He only has two more frames to go for a perfect game.

12
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,542
He better keep his calm.

13
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,751
- It's a strike! - Let's go!

14
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,501
Yoon Cheol-jong is really amazing.

15
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,042
There is only one strike left for the very first perfect game

16
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,167
in the history of WEDNESDAY BOWLING grand prix.

17
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:41,417
Yes! The last one!

18
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:45,459
There's only one left for the perfect game.

19
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,292
SPLIT

20
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:20,259
How much is it here?

21
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:21,925
Turn it off!

22
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,009
I'm sorry?

23
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,551
"I said turn off the music, you piece of shit."

24
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:27,509
Piece of shit?

25
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,759
Is he fucking kidding me?

26
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,342
Do you want to bring it?

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,925
Hey! Get your ass over here.

28
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,217
"Come over here, you son of a bitch."

29
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,426
What?

30
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,800
Fucker.

31
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,259
Mr. Park introduced me.

32
00:02:57,883 --> 00:03:01,259
"Two for 60 dollars, and one for 35."

33
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,134
Even the real one costs $30.

34
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,384
Hey.

35
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,384
Then go buy it there.

36
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,509
Please give me six.

37
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,676
"Sir, let me get that."

38
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,175
What do you have your phone for?

39
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,092
I told you not to call me at 10.

40
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,217
How many times do I have to tell you?

41
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,134
Avoid 10 a.m.!

42
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:43,718
Trying to ruin my day?

43
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,134
"It's past 11, so let's go."

44
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,883
"Hey, hey!"

45
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:50,800
Did you drink?

46
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:51,967
No.

47
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:55,050
- Come closer. Come. - No.

48
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:57,384
"I said, come closer."

49
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,342
Shit.

50
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:00,259
Open up.

51
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,301
You drank.

52
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:06,842
I didn't.

53
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,883
How many times do I have to tell you not to drink?

54
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:12,592
"- Thanks. - Yes, Sir."

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,925
- Bye. - Here.

56
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,967
Thanks.

57
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,301
Is it those Seoul guys?

58
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,134
Songdo Chinese.

59
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,259
Singles?

60
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,009
Why do you think I brought him?

61
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,050
Scotch doubles.

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,925
$300 per game and no raises.

63
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,551
That's pretty big.

64
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,676
"Hey, Min-soo! Long time no see."

65
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:32,134
You gotta get a new car.

66
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,189
Hey!

67
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,054
Wait for me!

68
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:55,640
What are you doing?

69
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:58,800
Red shoes? Red…

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,175
What is this about?

71
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,175
I'm doing this to save our faces.

72
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,718
For our faces? What a taste!

73
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,676
TOWOO BOWLING CENTER

74
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,759
Sweet.

75
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,217
CLOSED

76
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,092
- Hello. - Here's the pretty Ms. Joo.

77
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:25,883
- Sorry we're late. - That's okay. Please sit down.

78
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:27,509
Yes. Hello.

79
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,718
I don't hold anyone's hand before a game.

80
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:35,426
Okay.

81
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,384
You shouldn't go too hard on them today.

82
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,967
I lowered the average when I talked to them.

83
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:49,842
"Oh, Ms.Yoon. You're so beautiful…"

84
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,883
And your body is even more beautiful.

85
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,842
Are you getting ready?

86
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,800
It's to warm you up.

87
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,467
"Oh, thank you."

88
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,092
That's nice.

89
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:06,342
"Here, one for the other player."

90
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,634
Don't drink it.

91
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:23,718
He has good form.

92
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,634
Too bad.

93
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:34,259
It fell in.

94
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,967
- That's too bad. - Shit.

95
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,842
It's in!

96
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,800
Yes!

97
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:47,259
You're on a roll.

98
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,050
Why don't we do $500 per game?

99
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,551
If that's what you want

100
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:57,592
Why not?

101
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,467
How much is that?

102
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,092
"Wow, nice one!"

103
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,551
"All right, that's good."

104
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:31,718
- What the fuck? - That's too bad.

105
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,175
Damn it.

106
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,384
"Hey, what are we going to do? They're too good."

107
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,134
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,384
What is she doing?

109
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:44,883
- Let's finish it here. - What's wrong with you?

110
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:48,050
You're supposed to bowl with the heart.

111
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,967
The one that gives up is the loser.

112
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:04,842
Yes!

113
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,509
- Lets get something to eat. - Shall we?

114
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,175
How much did we win?

115
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,925
We lost 1 and won 13 times.

116
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,592
"- 6,500 dollars. - Wow."

117
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,426
You should be more strategic.

118
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:27,092
Don't try to win all at once.

119
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:30,092
What is it? Does he want to quit already?

120
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,592
I think he'll play a while longer…

121
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,883
"Hey, you should've called me earlier."

122
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,134
"Hey, Bro!"

123
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,551
You're so hard to reach.

124
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,551
- Who is that? - I don't know.

125
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,759
Okay. Nice shot.

126
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,192
This game's… Well…

127
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:58,050
Let's start over now.

128
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,551
- How much? - It's $500.

129
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:03,592
Can we switch players?

130
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,384
Go ahead.

131
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,676
"Okay. He's quite a sight, huh?"

132
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:18,551
"Hey, let's make it simple and do $1,000 a game."

133
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:20,925
"$1,000?"

134
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,134
Yes.

135
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,009
That's too much.

136
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,092
We don't accept credit.

137
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,426
"Come on, we just met."

138
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:32,676
"If one of us runs out on cash, game's over."

139
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,967
- Well? - Okay.

140
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,384
Okay. This is going to be fun.

141
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,134
That's a good one.

142
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,384
It's hard to beat.

143
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,634
Oh.

144
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,342
A snake eye.

145
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,967
That idiot…

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,551
That's too bad.

147
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,800
You're at a crucial part of the game.

148
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,301
I feel bad for you.

149
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,384
Thank you.

150
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,718
Yes. It's over.

151
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:54,426
I told you.

152
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,259
You're supposed to play with your heart.

153
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:00,259
It all got sorted out as soon as you came.

154
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,551
I'm so at ease now.

155
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:06,634
"Your shoulders are too stiff, and your form's all wrong."

156
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:07,426
Are you all right?

157
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:10,676
Let's stop.

158
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:11,842
Are you kidding me?

159
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,259
"We lost $8,000. We ran out."

160
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:17,009
We ran out? Shit. How embarrassing.

161
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,883
"Hey, hey, hey…"

162
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:23,092
"Let's do a one on one for $8,000."

163
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,050
"$8,000?"

164
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
"We don't accept credit, though."

165
00:11:30,718 --> 00:11:32,883
"- Let's see. - Come on, Mr. Baek."

166
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,342
Stay still.

167
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:37,009
Stop holding my hand and read my fortune.

168
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,050
"The max we could get was $6,000."

169
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,534
What are you doing?

170
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,759
I used to be a huge fan of him.

171
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,134
"Life is tough, isn't it?"

172
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:07,134
"Ok, $8,000!"

173
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,634
"Buddy, let's go."

174
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,718
Yes. Nice one!

175
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:24,634
That was lucky.

176
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:33,399
"Let's go, let's go."

177
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,384
Now they're fighting for pins.

178
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:39,009
It's neck and neck.

179
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,384
This is fun.

180
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,634
You know why people get hooked on bowling?

181
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:48,842
Well?

182
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:53,134
'Cuz you think you'd hit a strike next time.

183
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:55,217
It drives you crazy.

184
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,342
"- Geez. - Let's go, Boss."

185
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,342
That's it?

186
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:09,883
Good job.

187
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,301
Good game.

188
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,634
Good try.

189
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,301
Want one?

190
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,800
It will make you feel better.

191
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,259
Here.

192
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:29,509
See you.

193
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:33,301
Did you take that just now?

194
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,217
Did you?

195
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,175
Are you smirking?

196
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,056
Is that a smirk?

197
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,206
Bastard.

198
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,259
- Fuck! Why did you hit me? - Stop it.

199
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,426
- Did you ask me why? - Stop it!

200
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:46,467
Hey! Stop that!

201
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:47,634
"Hey, you…"

202
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,092
- Just give me my pay on time! - Just go! Hurry!

203
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,217
Sheesh.

204
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,925
Shit. Fuck.

205
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:28,259
"Hey, I was gonna call you…"

206
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,858
but I thought you might be busy.

207
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,634
I'm not UNICEF.

208
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:34,009
Why are you using my player?

209
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,134
It was just a small one.

210
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:40,092
"If we win, I'd give out some pocket money."

211
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,592
"If we lose, it'd come out of my pocket."

212
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:43,612
What about the bowling alley?

213
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,301
Who told you you could use it?

214
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:50,551
TOWOO is mine now.

215
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,050
It's still under my name.

216
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,426
Then pay me back what you owe.

217
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:07,259
I tried to save it for you because of your father.

218
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,261
I even got a loan to keep it alive.

219
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,745
You have to start paying back.

220
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:17,676
Of course. I'll pay back.

221
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:20,925
"The interest alone is $30,000."

222
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:25,592
Don't make it harder on yourself…

223
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,134
and just get some easy money.

224
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,592
I'll introduce you to a good place.

225
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:33,050
You should make a use of that face while you're young.

226
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,050
"When you get older, you won't have any other means."

227
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:44,134
I'll pay you back in full with interest this month.

228
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:45,604
What if you can't?

229
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,634
Put it under my name this month.

230
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:52,134
You can ask for an advance at the hostess bar I know.

231
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:55,134
Okay?

232
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:06,759
"Do it right, you piece of shit."

233
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,985
"Hey, what are you doing here?"

234
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,552
"Hey, Cheol-jong."

235
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,134
Fuck.

236
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,842
You can go in first.

237
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,050
I have to talk to Toad.

238
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:22,592
"Yeah, you can go."

239
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,175
We already covered what we have to.

240
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,883
- Go in. - See you later.

241
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:26,950
End of the month.

242
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,800
"Do it properly, fucker."

243
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,301
I heard you played a game today.

244
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:40,134
How can you play with that knee?

245
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,925
You're getting too old for this.

246
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,718
"There's a time and place for everything, you know."

247
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:48,800
You never beat me when we were professionals.

248
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,533
You're in no place to lecture me.

249
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,342
The past doesn't feed you.

250
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,509
Look at yourself now.

251
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,088
You're a crazy bastard.

252
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,509
"You, get up."

253
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,259
Hey.

254
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,800
"If you beat him up like this,"

255
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,092
how could he teach...

256
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,718
bowling to the ladies?

257
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,718
How much should you ask for? Gosh…

258
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:13,175
I thought you went to the navy.

259
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:17,175
Can't you beat a cripple like him?

260
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:21,092
He's no match for me if I put up a fight.

261
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,192
Hey.

262
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,217
Hey. That kid is out of his fucking mind.

263
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,217
He doesn't care about the game money.

264
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,883
He just wants to fight you.

265
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,718
Let's show him what you got.

266
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,426
I'll get your back.

267
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:39,009
What a piece of shit.

268
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,050
"You, come over here."

269
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,017
Hey.

270
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:47,883
What are you doing?

271
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,426
"You both punch with your right, huh?"

272
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:51,718
What the hell are you doing?

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,217
- What are you bastards doing? - Get him!

274
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:54,967
Take it off.

275
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:02,217
Bastard. Are you crazy?

276
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:11,092
You little…

277
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,551
You…

278
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,301
You son of a bitch.

279
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:26,551
"Hey, bastard!"

280
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,134
You son of a bitch. Don't you have any respect?

281
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:31,842
"Hey, hey."

282
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,676
Take it off!

283
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:09,342
"2, 4, 6, 8…"

284
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,384
How many times do I have to tell her? Shit.

285
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,009
Damn it.

286
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,592
Damn it!

287
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,925
It's locked.

288
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,301
Can I help you?

289
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,883
Yes. I heard you're looking for help.

290
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:40,384
"Ah, did Ms. Joo send you?"

291
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:41,821
Come on in.

292
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:13,842
Let's go!

293
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,676
"Hey, look at how funny he bowls."

294
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:36,259
Shit.

295
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,862
Let's go!

296
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:41,050
Look at that.

297
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:18,967
Let's go!

298
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:20,759
Let's go!

299
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:22,509
He's so good!

300
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,467
PARK YOUNG-HOON

301
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,175
He comes here everyday at this time.

302
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:42,883
"Yeah. He just throws,"

303
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:44,676
but all the pins end up falling over.

304
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,426
"He seems a little out of it, right?"

305
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,426
"I thought so, too."

306
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:01,718
Why isn't that bastard coming?

307
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:17,006
You're here.

308
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:23,092
"One for lane 10, please."

309
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:25,367
"Oh, it's you. Have fun."

310
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:50,837
"Hey, kid."

311
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:54,612
There are a lot of empty lanes. Why are you waiting here?

312
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,920
Lane 10 isn't any special.

313
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:57,909
Well?

314
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:03,718
Geez. You're good looking.

315
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,878
Hey.

316
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,883
He keeps ignoring me.

317
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:13,956
Hey. Why are you using a women's ball?

318
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,912
Don't you have yours?

319
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:16,729
Hello?

320
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:21,203
Are you Young-hoon?

321
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:25,634
That ball looks really worn out.

322
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:29,431
Do you want one in a guy's colour?

323
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:33,121
"I'll get you one that spins well. Hey, Young-hoon."

324
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,634
Yes! Yes! Yes!

325
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:39,551
Yes! Yes! Yes!

326
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:40,718
"- No, no… - Yes! Yes! Yes!"

327
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:41,967
- What's wrong? - Yes! Yes!

328
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,759
I'll give it to you for free. A cheap one.

329
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,592
What's wrong with you?

330
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,551
I didn't do anything…

331
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:51,551
He hates it when strangers talk to him.

332
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:52,842
"Just leave him alone, will you?"

333
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,009
I didn't do anything.

334
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,050
- Just get out of there. - What?

335
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:57,800
- Come out. - I was just going to...

336
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,092
Come on!

337
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,384
I was just going to give him a ball…

338
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:03,342
I just told you. He doesn't like strangers.

339
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,799
Hurry up and come out. Come on!

340
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:07,426
I was just...

341
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,175
"I get it, so just come out."

342
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,569
I got it.

343
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:14,800
Hurry up. Come on.

344
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:16,634
- I was going to give him a ball… - Are you serious?

345
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,718
You sure are talkative. Just come out.

346
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,759
Let's go!

347
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,718
He's so precise.

348
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:29,800
We can consider it like the Taiwanese spinning ball.

349
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,967
He only bowls straight.

350
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,342
And he also gets the spare every time.

351
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:38,092
He would never go below 230.

352
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:41,342
I thought you said mentality is the most important.

353
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:43,551
That's where he's the strongest in.

354
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,509
"No matter what other people say, it doesn't psyche him."

355
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,592
That kid's a funny one. I swear.

356
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:50,676
- Is that so? - Yes.

357
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,217
Just look.

358
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,718
His focus never leaves the lanes.

359
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,759
That's what you call focusing.

360
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:01,925
I'm still hesitant.

361
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:02,493
Hey.

362
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,551
What was his name? Min-soo?

363
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:07,783
How much did he get per game as an ex-professional?

364
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,551
Seriously.

365
00:26:09,883 --> 00:26:11,759
You're right.

366
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:15,509
I'm not saying I don't like him.

367
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,676
I think he'll be great…

368
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:20,050
But do you think we'll be able to control him?

369
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,339
Let's go!

370
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:30,800
Bastard…

371
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:49,964
What the…

372
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,989
Where did he go? Shit.

373
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,384
Extra large noodles!

374
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,217
"Extra large noodles, please."

375
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:20,925
Welcome.

376
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,634
"XL NOODLES, FRIED PORK, PARK YOUNG-HOON"

377
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:33,741
I won't eat fried pork.

378
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,676
That's not from today.

379
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,842
I forgot to write it down last time.

380
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,985
"No, thank you. I don't like… I don't like fried pork."

381
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,759
What are you blabbering about? Just sign it.

382
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,259
What a bother.

383
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:06,759
Enjoy.

384
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:10,092
"Did you enjoy it, Young-hoon?"

385
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:11,883
"Yes! Yes, yes, yes!"

386
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,967
Yes! Yes! Yes!

387
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,217
"Hey, come over here!"

388
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,342
What a weirdo.

389
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:28,602
"I love you, Milkiss."

390
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,301
"Milkiss, the milk flavored carbonated drink."

391
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,008
Do you live in the hospital?

392
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:51,384
Yes.

393
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:54,509
Why?

394
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,759
Don't you have parents?

395
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:00,967
Mom is in Seoul and I don't have a dad.

396
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,259
Why aren't you going in?

397
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:07,467
9 p.m. I'll go at 9 p.m.

398
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,426
"You understand everything, don't you?"

399
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,050
You funny bastard…

400
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:23,175
Hey.

401
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:28,883
Do you want to bowl with me?

402
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,925
"Oh, bowling?"

403
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,676
I like bowling. Bowling.

404
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:39,217
"Hey, do you know what a scotch double is?"

405
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,842
Scotch. Scotch.

406
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:44,217
A male and a female player take turns and...

407
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:48,217
"- they play together at the end. - Yes. That's exactly it, kid."

408
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:49,800
"- Scotch double… - Hey, hey, hey."

409
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:55,009
Do you want to be on my team for scotch doubles?

410
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,883
Scotch. A male player and a female player take turns.

411
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:01,509
"Two men can play, too."

412
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:07,092
"- Well? - I'm a male player, too."

413
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:09,092
A man and a man doesn't work.

414
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,050
"You and I are both men, but it doesn't matter."

415
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:17,259
Oh… 9 p.m. I have to go at 9 p.m. Goodbye.

416
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:21,217
"Ok. Bye, Young-hoon."

417
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:25,342
Yes! Yes! Yes!

418
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:28,925
You're not supposed to say his name.

419
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:30,342
I'm sorry?

420
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,217
He always goes crazy when someone calls his name.

421
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,009
Even his doctors don't call him by his name.

422
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,234
"Did you enjoy it, Young-hoon?"

423
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:40,509
"Yes! Yes, yes, yes!"

424
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:41,301
Young-hoon.

425
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:42,526
"Yes, yes!"

426
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,134
Yes! Yes! Yes!

427
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:47,217
Is there anything else I should avoid?

428
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:49,842
How should I know? I've never talked to him before.

429
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:50,925
Why not?

430
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:54,134
Why would I talk to a retard like him?

431
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:56,842
What are you talking about? He's fine.

432
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:00,800
At least I know what he loves.

433
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:02,634
I love it as well.

434
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:03,831
What is it?

435
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:05,081
Milkiss.

436
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,384
Geez.

437
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:12,718
Here comes the gold.

438
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,967
I love Milkiss

439
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,800
"Oh, it's the big bottle of Milkiss."

440
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:19,467
"Sit down, sit down."

441
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:23,217
Hello.

442
00:32:23,301 --> 00:32:25,009
"All right, have a glass."

443
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,509
Do you want to play a scotch double with me?

444
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:41,800
Scotch?

445
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,092
Yes.

446
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:46,467
A male player and a female player take turns.

447
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,175
This guy...

448
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:53,301
"I told you, it can be two men."

449
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:56,925
"No. You can't. No, no."

450
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,509
Who says it's exclusively coed?

451
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:00,800
It's on WEDNESDAY BOWLING.

452
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,967
A man and a woman play in a team.

453
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:04,301
He's killing me.

454
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,384
WEDNESDAY BOWLING?

455
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,217
They stopped airing ages ago!

456
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:12,092
You're so stuck up.

457
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:15,800
They only played coed for fun.

458
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:19,426
It doesn't matter if it's two men or women.

459
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,175
Forget it if you don't want to.

460
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,384
Only teammates share things like these.

461
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:29,842
Right?

462
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:34,217
Of course. Only teammates should share.

463
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,050
Grape flavor.

464
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:37,384
"If you're not going to play with me,"

465
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,551
why should I share?

466
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Here.

467
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:44,175
"My goodness, it's so sweet and sour."

468
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,551
"Hey, it's licorice."

469
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:49,092
This kind tastes the best when roasted.

470
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:52,759
Licorice

471
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:55,967
It's so chewy.

472
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:00,384
I… I'll play second.

473
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:01,800
The man goes second.

474
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,634
"The woman plays first, then the man plays."

475
00:34:03,634 --> 00:34:05,759
"Okay, you can go second."

476
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,634
- Second. Second. - Second.

477
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,842
- That's great. - Grape flavor taffy.

478
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:12,676
"Oh, taffy."

479
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,567
Your form is strange.

480
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,384
What?

481
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,009
Your form is strange.

482
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:27,592
Look who's talking.

483
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:35,009
Let's go!

484
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,467
"Okay, now this finger…"

485
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,134
Hold on...

486
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,342
"Dirty, dirty, dirty."

487
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:00,342
"I told you, it's dirty."

488
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,150
Let's go!

489
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:35,967
Let's go!

490
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:41,551
"Hey, can you get us a game?"

491
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,509
"Of course. $500 or $1,000. It doesn't matter."

492
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:46,718
Scotch doubles.

493
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:49,301
Hello.

494
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:50,800
Why are you so late?

495
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:53,925
There was so much traffic. Hurry up and get ready.

496
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:55,342
I look forward to learning from you.

497
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:57,925
We'll be the ones learning.

498
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,134
You learn more when money's on the line.

499
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,634
"Yes, it's entirely different."

500
00:36:01,634 --> 00:36:06,092
Yes. It's entirely different. Completely…

501
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,050
That idiot…

502
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:09,550
Hold on.

503
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:12,426
"Hey, what are you doing here?"

504
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:14,134
We have to use lane 10.

505
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:15,967
Lane 10?

506
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,925
"No, we'll play on lane 1."

507
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,676
We must play on lane 10.

508
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,301
- You must play bowling… - on lane 10.

509
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,134
It's okay. Let's go.

510
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,551
"Hey, this is new."

511
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,342
It's the newest model. It's a good one.

512
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:29,676
It moves so wildly and...

513
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:32,009
- the back end is a dream. - It looks expensive.

514
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:56,467
What the hell's wrong with him?

515
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,718
Let's go!

516
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,092
Let's go!

517
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:23,092
What's wrong with him?

518
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:25,134
That wierdo…

519
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,759
"Hey, hey."

520
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:32,967
I'll take you home before 9 p.m.

521
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,342
What's wrong?

522
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,800
I have to bowl on lane 10.

523
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:38,301
10?

524
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,384
"You only hit straight, why does it matter?"

525
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,217
"If it's too much pressure, we can forget the bet."

526
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,050
"We're doing this for fun, aren't we?"

527
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,551
It's only the beginning.

528
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:48,842
You're right. We won't know until the end.

529
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,134
"Yes, we won't know."

530
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:53,509
No one knows that our team's gonna win

531
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:54,842
"Lane 10, please."

532
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,967
That's 24 dollars.

533
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:07,883
It's only the beginning.

534
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:08,509
Oops.

535
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:09,759
Oops.

536
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:11,175
Gosh!

537
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:12,634
"Oh, no. There's water on our lane."

538
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,301
- What are we going to do? - There's water on it.

539
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:15,113
What should we do?

540
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:16,925
I better wipe it off.

541
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:19,509
"- Hey, book lane 10. Lane 10. - Okay."

542
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:20,759
I'm sorry about this.

543
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:21,883
It was an accident.

544
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,384
I dropped the bottle.

545
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,301
We can't have dirty floors.

546
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:26,800
What?

547
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,759
"- Nice one. - Good, good."

548
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:46,759
Let's go!

549
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,509
He's got it now.

550
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,883
Yes.

551
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:55,676
Let's go!

552
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,842
He's really got it now.

553
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,259
"I told you, your hook's too wide."

554
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:08,384
The lane's too dry.

555
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:10,009
You should have done a brooklyn…

556
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:10,842
or changed your ball.

557
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:12,467
Ex… Excuse me.

558
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,551
"If it's too much pressure, we can forget the bet."

559
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:16,301
What?

560
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:17,050
It's just the beginning.

561
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,301
You're right. We won't know until the end.

562
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:22,842
Should we raise the bet?

563
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:24,842
Raise it. Raise the bet.

564
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:26,509
Raise the money

565
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,883
Awesome.

566
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:49,842
Did you see the look on their faces?

567
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,718
I almost burst into laughter.

568
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:54,259
They wanna go again next month.

569
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:56,301
"Hey, you should call it higher next time."

570
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:58,384
"We'll suck them dry, all the way."

571
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,467
Of course I will. The straw is ready.

572
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:07,551
Why aren't you eating? It'll go cold.

573
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:09,718
Do you want something else?

574
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:12,842
Sour soup? Fried pork?

575
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,592
What's wrong?

576
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:20,050
There's no cucumber.

577
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:20,659
Cucumber?

578
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,259
I need chopped cucumber on my noodles.

579
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:25,759
It helps with digestion…

580
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,967
and it's full of minerals.

581
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,467
Just fucking eat it.

582
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:29,759
Excuse me!

583
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:31,759
Do you have any cucumbers?

584
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:36,509
"Could you cut this up for us, Sir?"

585
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,800
Are you serious? Is he the king or what?

586
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:42,883
You can do whatever you want.

587
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:44,009
"Okay, Young-hoon?"

588
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,883
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

589
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:53,800
Awesome!

590
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:56,134
- My goodness. - I spilled water.

591
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,634
- What the… - Shit! We're screwed.

592
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,426
What? You're leaving at 9 p.m.?

593
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:20,634
- Kid! - Are you kidding me?

594
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:23,009
"- This is so wrong. - Let them go, let them go."

595
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:25,634
But they better give us our money back!

596
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:37,718
Hey! Do you know what time it is?

597
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:39,842
He's only 10 minutes late.

598
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:43,217
What an ass.

599
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,384
I shouldn't be late.

600
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:54,676
Don't be late.

601
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,676
"Oh, were you a professional?"

602
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:13,718
Yes.

603
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:15,426
Heard you were really famous.

604
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:17,551
Nah. It was just for a little while.

605
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:19,592
"I only recently got interested in bowling,"

606
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:21,883
so I didn't realize.

607
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,718
What happened to your leg anyway?

608
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:33,718
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

609
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:48,800
"A car accident, what else?"

610
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:50,175
I see.

611
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,134
That must have been tough.

612
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:02,759
I talked to the director and it's such a shit show.

613
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,592
His father passed away early and…

614
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:06,800
his mother had an affair and left.

615
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:08,718
Seriously.

616
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:11,384
"It's so crazy, huh?"

617
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:16,967
Gosh.

618
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,426
"When Young-hoon's grandmother died,"

619
00:43:19,426 --> 00:43:22,426
she left a restaurant in his name.

620
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,592
So his mom came back with her new family.

621
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:28,842
Then she threw Young-hoon away like this.

622
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,925
How can someone do that?

623
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:33,134
How can she call herself a mother?

624
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:35,676
"Poor, poor Young-hoon…"

625
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,050
So what do you want me to do?

626
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,718
When are we going to make enough money…

627
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,467
if he goes home at 9 p.m. every night?

628
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:48,009
Wouldn't it be better if he was with us all the time?

629
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,009
So are you going to keep him with you?

630
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:51,342
Are you crazy?

631
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:52,925
I'm not even married.

632
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,759
How can I live with a man in single room?

633
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,342
I knew it. You're telling me to keep him with me.

634
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:04,092
"If I want to keep the bowling alley,"

635
00:44:04,092 --> 00:44:07,301
"I have to make $30,000 by the end of this month."

636
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:07,925
Hmm?

637
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:11,718
Please. We're like family.

638
00:44:12,509 --> 00:44:13,759
Cheers!

639
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:16,092
Damn it…

640
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:18,883
"Sir, that's different from what we agreed on."

641
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:22,467
"You said $1,500 and now $2,000?"

642
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:24,759
"Well, that was over the phone."

643
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,592
"When he leaves, I'd have to renovate the room."

644
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:31,842
But that isn't…

645
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:34,217
"a mental illness or anything, is it?"

646
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:35,388
Pardon?

647
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:40,426
It's an intellectual disability and he also has signs of autism…

648
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:42,842
"You're his relative, right?"

649
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:48,050
"Oh, yes. I'm like his uncle."

650
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:49,842
That makes sense.

651
00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:52,842
"Young-hoon doesn't make eye contact with me,"

652
00:44:52,842 --> 00:44:54,925
but he does with you.

653
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:57,509
He must have grown up with you.

654
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,551
"Yes, we saw each other often. Very often."

655
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:06,050
"Even if your mom calls,"

656
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,883
you have to tell her you're still here.

657
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:08,925
Okay?

658
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:11,800
"Yes, so that she'll keep paying you."

659
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,467
"Yes. Okay, okay."

660
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,718
"If you want to come back, just call me."

661
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:18,842
I'll come to get you.

662
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,092
It's… It's okay.

663
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:31,342
That's enough.

664
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:33,009
The floor can't be dirty.

665
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:40,883
"I said, stop it."

666
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:43,592
The floor has to be clean.

667
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,489
Clean…

668
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,175
"Don't touch anything, you bastard!"

669
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:52,426
Hey. I told you not to get in my way...

670
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,967
if you want to stay here.

671
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:58,134
Don't get in the way. Don't…

672
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,217
Fuck.

673
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,634
Just get your ball.

674
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:06,544
"- I locked it. - Shit, you scared me."

675
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:10,009
- I locked it earlier. - You freaking scared me.

676
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,925
Your arm's all wrong.

677
00:46:39,217 --> 00:46:40,467
Let's go!

678
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:45,301
Can't we just continue playing on lane 10?

679
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:50,509
"One, left foot. Zero..."

680
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,509
- Are you lining up your foot? - Yes.

681
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,342
"Left on one, then right on zero."

682
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:55,883
Then your hands...

683
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:57,384
Lanes and bowling have...

684
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,718
"no relation whatsoever, okay?"

685
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:00,467
Lane 10…

686
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:05,050
It's because of the gap between your arms.

687
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:08,134
Don't lower it too much.

688
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:11,718
Just focus on your arm and nothing else.

689
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:15,342
I have to put my hand in zero. Zero.

690
00:47:17,175 --> 00:47:19,050
"Left on one, then right on zero."

691
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,509
"Lanes don't matter in bowling, you fool."

692
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,509
I have to put my hand in the zero with the ball.

693
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:26,426
What?

694
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:29,800
Put the hand in the zero for the ball to go straight.

695
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,551
Zero…

696
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:35,217
Hand…

697
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,967
I have to put my hand in the zero.

698
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:39,676
What the...

699
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,467
Put the hand in the zero for the ball to go straight.

700
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:44,301
Zero. In the zero.

701
00:47:45,634 --> 00:47:47,800
"- Left on one... - Hey, bandage."

702
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:49,301
I need bandage.

703
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:50,842
- A bandage? - Yes.

704
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,467
Hey.

705
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:59,676
Now the zero is on your head.

706
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:03,842
You have to put your hand in the zero.

707
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:07,050
Okay? Hm?

708
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:09,676
Say something.

709
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,342
I can put my hand in the zero.

710
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:14,676
Zero.

711
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:17,630
What's on your head?

712
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,718
Zero.

713
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:28,942
Let's go!

714
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:36,467
Come on in.

715
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:39,800
"The facilities are not very good,"

716
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:41,342
so just focus on the view.

717
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:43,925
You can look at the layout for now. This way.

718
00:48:44,676 --> 00:48:45,842
This is pretty much the best place...

719
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:47,718
for a bowling alley in this area.

720
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,676
You'll be getting a lot of business. Go ahead.

721
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:53,592
Toad.

722
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:55,800
"Toad, it's not the end of the month yet."

723
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:57,175
I told you I'd pay you back...

724
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,676
including interest by end of this month.

725
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:00,259
This place is still mine for now.

726
00:49:00,259 --> 00:49:02,800
We're just looking around. Go on and play.

727
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:05,634
This place is bound to get busy.

728
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:09,092
"Hey, hey, hey…"

729
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:12,301
You wouldn't have become a professional without my dad.

730
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,175
Don't you remember getting free lessons here?

731
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:16,092
That was so many years ago.

732
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:19,634
"Also, what does that have to do with this?"

733
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:20,800
You're such a joke.

734
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:22,592
Let's keep going.

735
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,426
Let's go!

736
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,384
"Hey, are you organizing a circus?"

737
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:44,718
"- Damn. - Get lost, you prick!"

738
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:46,426
You two are the perfect match.

739
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:49,050
"They say, birds of a feather flock together."

740
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:51,009
Him?

741
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:53,092
He used to be a member of the national team.

742
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:54,718
An ex-member of the national team...

743
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:55,967
- You piece of shit. - Let's go!

744
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:59,301
"Oh, no. Cheol-jong."

745
00:49:59,384 --> 00:50:00,384
Are you all right?

746
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:02,175
- Cheol-jong. - Asshole.

747
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:03,134
"Oh, no!"

748
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:06,259
Cheol-jong!

749
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:10,551
Cheol-jong!

750
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,301
I'll kill them assholes.

751
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:14,384
That piece of shit.

752
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,967
"I was going to let it pass, but…"

753
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:23,676
You shitheads embarrassed me.

754
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,925
Are you okay?

755
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:36,384
"Get out of my bowling alley, you asshole!"

756
00:50:39,592 --> 00:50:40,925
Do you think you can scare me?

757
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:42,467
"Hey, throw a heavy one."

758
00:50:57,551 --> 00:50:59,009
"Make $30,000 by the end of the month."

759
00:51:07,676 --> 00:51:09,467
Cheol-jong!

760
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:13,551
Are you okay?

761
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,050
That fucking asshole.

762
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:23,800
Cheol-jong…

763
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,676
- Damn it… - Strike.

764
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,426
Strike…

765
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:34,883
"Strike, strike."

766
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:40,384
"Strike, strike."

767
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,384
Spare...

768
00:51:42,883 --> 00:51:43,759
Are you reviewing?

769
00:51:44,076 --> 00:51:44,535
Yes.

770
00:51:45,217 --> 00:51:47,175
You're a fucking pro.

771
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,050
Who taught you bowling?

772
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:52,342
My grandma.

773
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:54,050
Was she a professional player?

774
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:54,783
Oh…

775
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,092
She's very good.

776
00:51:57,759 --> 00:51:59,551
She even got an award from the city.

777
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,217
How old are you again?

778
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,104
"26, 26."

779
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:06,467
Born in 1991…

780
00:52:06,842 --> 00:52:08,800
- 26 years old. - You're pretty old.

781
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:12,842
"Here, have a drink."

782
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,551
It's Milkiss for adults.

783
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,883
- Milkiss. Milkiss. - Yes. It's for adults.

784
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:22,009
Drink it up.

785
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:29,009
Isn't it good? Drink some more.

786
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:31,883
Hey.

787
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,301
Isn't it so awesome?

788
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:38,342
It's delicious.

789
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,134
Now you know.

790
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:41,925
It's yummy.

791
00:52:44,551 --> 00:52:46,551
Great. This is great.

792
00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:49,134
Makiss.

793
00:52:49,384 --> 00:52:50,426
"I love you,"

794
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:51,634
- "Makiss." - "Makiss."

795
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,551
- Yes! - Let's go!

796
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,134
Awesome!

797
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:04,925
Good luck!

798
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:14,676
Welcome to bowling!

799
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:17,759
Hey!

800
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:19,259
I said I'll give it to you.

801
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,634
"Didn't you say we made $6,000 today?"

802
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:54,842
"Come on, beef doesn't cost that much."

803
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:57,217
Why are you getting us pork skin?

804
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,492
We can't save enough money like that.

805
00:53:59,492 --> 00:54:01,176
"This is good for your skin and delicious, too."

806
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:02,503
"Here, have some."

807
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,742
If we keep this up...

808
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:10,117
"30 grand is nothing. By next year, I'll be debt free!"

809
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:11,867
Give me a grand.

810
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:17,034
For what?

811
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,451
Just give me some when I ask. That jerk eats like a pig.

812
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:23,742
Look at him!

813
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:29,284
"Hey, kid. Enough candy. Have some meat instead."

814
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:31,159
"Give me money, too."

815
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:33,117
Instead of meat.

816
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:35,659
What?

817
00:54:36,326 --> 00:54:37,201
Money.

818
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:43,159
Of course I'll give it to you.

819
00:54:43,451 --> 00:54:46,342
I'll keep it safe for you…

820
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,867
and then give it to you all at once.

821
00:54:49,825 --> 00:54:52,326
"You'll give it to him, right?"

822
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,867
Of course.

823
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:58,075
You shouldn't trust those assholes at the bank.

824
00:54:58,618 --> 00:55:01,117
They all scam you.

825
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:03,634
I'll keep it safe for you and then…

826
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:06,409
give it to you with interest.

827
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,075
"Just trust me, okay? Don't worry."

828
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,492
Hey.

829
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:17,653
What do you plan on doing with money?

830
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:24,534
"$2.50 for bus 45, $14 for two way intercity bus,"

831
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:26,783
and then $2.60 for city bus.

832
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,034
Give me $19 .10.

833
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:34,159
19 dollars. 19...

834
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:37,242
"- Hey. - Sure thing. Here, it's $50."

835
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:40,034
- Give him one more. - Okay. Here's 100 dollars.

836
00:55:40,992 --> 00:55:41,825
$100.00

837
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:46,168
Where are you going anyway?

838
00:55:51,618 --> 00:55:52,823
Hey.

839
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:56,332
Where are you going?

840
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,201
I have to go on September 13.

841
00:56:01,284 --> 00:56:03,700
I must go on September 13.

842
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:06,357
That's two days from now.

843
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:11,033
Are you coming right back?

844
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,034
"You'll come right back, right?"

845
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:22,201
Where are you going?

846
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:23,950
To my grandma.

847
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:30,073
"Mom loves me too, so I might go see mom too."

848
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:31,326
Grandma?

849
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,409
Lock… It's locked.

850
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,281
We're on the bus.

851
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:55,492
Why don't you tail him then.

852
00:56:58,492 --> 00:57:00,284
I'm hanging up.

853
00:58:02,825 --> 00:58:04,829
"Shit, you freaked me out!"

854
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:06,727
Good morning.

855
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,242
"Hey, what are you doing here?"

856
00:58:09,576 --> 00:58:11,269
I came to see grandma.

857
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:12,659
Is that so?

858
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:15,284
I know someone who lives… I mean died…

859
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:21,867
"What a small world, huh? Fancy running into each other."

860
00:58:21,992 --> 00:58:24,066
We rode on the same bus.

861
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:27,618
Intercity bus at 11:10 a.m. City bus number 1.

862
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:28,492
We rode together.

863
00:58:28,783 --> 00:58:30,117
- Did you see me? - Yes.

864
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:32,017
Damn.

865
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,117
You're such a joker.

866
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:39,992
"Great, now we can go home together."

867
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,201
I… I have to go to mom's to pick up something.

868
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:45,211
"Okay, then."

869
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:47,618
Now?

870
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:57,367
PYEONGYANG RESTAURANT

871
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:07,409
Is it here?

872
00:59:07,783 --> 00:59:09,451
"Yes, it's here."

873
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:11,783
The room's in… inside.

874
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:12,700
I'll be right back.

875
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:13,367
Okay.

876
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:20,117
Long time no see!

877
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:21,950
My god!

878
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:25,277
"Hey, everyone. Look."

879
00:59:50,284 --> 00:59:51,201
Shit.

880
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:56,367
You fucking retard. Hey!

881
00:59:56,742 --> 00:59:59,700
How dare you come here? You little prick!

882
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:02,284
"This isn't your home anymore, okay?"

883
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:05,742
- Fuck. You bastard… - Forget it and just go inside.

884
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:08,189
"I said, go inside!"

885
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:09,967
What are you looking at?

886
01:00:09,992 --> 01:00:11,367
All of you better go before I count to 3.

887
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:13,159
"1, 2!"

888
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:17,675
- Park Young-hoon. - Yes.

889
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,967
- Park Young-hoon. - Yes.

890
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:20,545
Park Young-hoon.

891
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,492
- Answer me. - Yes. Yes.

892
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:24,576
Are you going to listen to me or not?

893
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,075
Why don't you listen?

894
01:00:26,075 --> 01:00:28,409
I told you to call in advance if you want to come.

895
01:00:28,618 --> 01:00:29,618
Didn't I?

896
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:32,409
Look at me. Look at me!

897
01:00:32,534 --> 01:00:34,239
"- Park Young-hoon. - Yes, yes!"

898
01:00:34,618 --> 01:00:37,075
I send you money every month. Why are you here?

899
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:40,075
"Also, I told you to call me in advance."

900
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:42,492
Mom! I finished dinner.

901
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,783
"Oh, my son."

902
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:49,201
Did you finish it already?

903
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,825
"- Oh, you got some on you. - Hey!"

904
01:00:53,534 --> 01:00:54,783
- My pumpkin. - You little…

905
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:57,284
"I'll kill you tonight, you son of a bitch!"

906
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:00,492
- What are you trying to do? - Stop it!

907
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:02,117
- This is our restaurant now! - That's enough.

908
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,783
"I said, that's enough!"

909
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:06,742
Jerk. How much did you drink?

910
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:09,326
Go in. Go inside.

911
01:01:09,618 --> 01:01:10,909
Go inside!

912
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:12,909
Fuck!

913
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:14,884
Shut up.

914
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,284
Call before coming home.

915
01:01:17,075 --> 01:01:19,534
Call. Call before coming home.

916
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:21,984
I have to call before coming.

917
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:34,451
Hey.

918
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:38,492
Is today your grandma's death anniversary?

919
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:44,509
Did she pass away on September 13th?

920
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,045
September 13th is my birthday.

921
01:01:49,284 --> 01:01:51,159
Grandma died because of me.

922
01:01:52,117 --> 01:01:54,075
"I gave her too much trouble,"

923
01:01:54,742 --> 01:01:58,800
so she got rocks in her body.

924
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,825
She went because it was time.

925
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,576
She didn't die because of you.

926
01:02:15,992 --> 01:02:19,242
She got rocks because of me.

927
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:23,338
That's why Santa doesn't come.

928
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:25,541
Santa knows everything.

929
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:33,576
"Aw, damn it..."

930
01:02:46,364 --> 01:02:49,604
Let's have dinner together…

931
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:03,909
What are you doing out here?

932
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:07,867
He's so stuck up. I'm sick of it.

933
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:11,551
What is it?

934
01:03:11,867 --> 01:03:14,367
He won't move since you're not here.

935
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:22,783
Hey. Aren't you coming?

936
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:24,700
Coming.

937
01:03:39,201 --> 01:03:40,855
They won't play.

938
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,463
Why not? Fuck.

939
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:46,992
They heard that we're sucking people dry.

940
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:49,313
Shit. This is bad.

941
01:03:56,825 --> 01:03:58,201
Aren't you Coach Joo's daughter?

942
01:03:58,284 --> 01:03:59,992
"Hello, Mr. Park. It's been a while."

943
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:00,618
Yes.

944
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:08,284
Do you two… know each other?

945
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,289
"Long time no see, Cheol-jong."

946
01:04:11,451 --> 01:04:13,698
Are you well?

947
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:14,618
Yes.

948
01:04:16,492 --> 01:04:19,992
I have to go now.

949
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:21,700
I'm sorry.

950
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:27,835
I'll order you some coffee. Please have it.

951
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:36,325
How do you know Mr. Park?

952
01:04:36,534 --> 01:04:37,534
Well...

953
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:41,201
We were on the same team long time ago.

954
01:04:48,742 --> 01:04:49,742
Yes.

955
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:52,950
"$1,000 per game?"

956
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:57,367
Anything is good for us.

957
01:04:57,741 --> 01:05:00,859
Yes. Who gave you my number?

958
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,742
"Oh, him?"

959
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,988
Mr. Baek.

960
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:08,909
Bang and bang.

961
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:10,783
Boom and boom! Okay.

962
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:12,909
- I can't see a thing. - Low kick? Okay.

963
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,234
"- Sir. - Yeah, what?"

964
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:16,742
Oh.

965
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:19,326
Mr. Yoon. Nice to see you again.

966
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:22,367
Let's just get it started.

967
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:25,167
"Okay, sure."

968
01:05:27,578 --> 01:05:29,855
Are they fucking me?

969
01:05:30,534 --> 01:05:31,909
What the fuck?

970
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:38,199
Let's go!

971
01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:42,098
This is bullshit. Where on earth did you find him?

972
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:45,319
He's his lover.

973
01:05:47,326 --> 01:05:49,201
The rumor was true. Okay.

974
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:53,202
Thanks for the show. That's enough for today.

975
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:54,326
Already?

976
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,161
It's still so early.

977
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:00,783
What's the point? We'll keep on losing.

978
01:06:00,783 --> 01:06:02,318
You shouldn't be so greedy.

979
01:06:02,343 --> 01:06:05,427
Let's go get some dinner. I want to talk to you.

980
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,825
"Good evening, Boss!"

981
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:11,503
Don't act like a gangster.

982
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:15,576
Please go inside.

983
01:06:15,783 --> 01:06:17,284
Is it ready?

984
01:06:18,538 --> 01:06:21,878
Noodles. I have to eat noodles.

985
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:25,700
Try some duck. This is the mainland style.

986
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,950
It still has its head on.

987
01:06:27,034 --> 01:06:27,825
It's really good.

988
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:30,047
We're not here to eat.

989
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,742
You sure are impatient.

990
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,992
Okay.

991
01:06:37,992 --> 01:06:40,992
I have an investor from China coming in two days.

992
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,034
There will be a fun game.

993
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:45,783
It would be a big one.

994
01:06:45,944 --> 01:06:47,319
"It's $5,000 per game,"

995
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:48,909
with separate raises.

996
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:51,909
"From turkey to strikes it's $2,000 by the double."

997
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,734
Do you get me?

998
01:06:54,825 --> 01:06:55,825
"It'll be 4 grand when it's 4 times,"

999
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:57,451
and 8 grand when it's 5 times.

1000
01:06:57,492 --> 01:06:59,367
"At 6th time, it'll be $160,000."

1001
01:06:59,867 --> 01:07:02,242
"- Turkey, strike, three times. - Yes."

1002
01:07:02,242 --> 01:07:03,909
"- Four times is four strikes. - Yes, that's right."

1003
01:07:03,909 --> 01:07:05,618
Five times when it's five strikes.

1004
01:07:05,618 --> 01:07:07,117
Yes. Eat. Eat up.

1005
01:07:07,992 --> 01:07:09,867
The raises will be bigger than the game money.

1006
01:07:09,867 --> 01:07:11,867
That's why it's fun.

1007
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,534
I was thinking about...

1008
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:19,409
scouting you two as my players.

1009
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:21,867
My boys are weak when it comes to mentality.

1010
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:24,618
"You gotta play without thinking like him,"

1011
01:07:24,618 --> 01:07:25,992
but they think too much.

1012
01:07:25,992 --> 01:07:27,492
Well?

1013
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:30,367
"Okay, here's the deal."

1014
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:33,758
"You'll get $10,000 in advance whether you lose or not."

1015
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,867
"If you win, I'll give you 10 percent."

1016
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:41,451
10 percent is a little low.

1017
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,825
Is it? What were you thinking then?

1018
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:50,737
It should be at least 30 percent.

1019
01:07:50,992 --> 01:07:53,217
We have to save face.

1020
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:54,561
What if you lose?

1021
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,618
Are you going to give me 30 percent?

1022
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,909
Why would you think we'd lose? Don't jinx us.

1023
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:05,409
That's what I mean. I don't think you'll lose.

1024
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,451
Let's play together.

1025
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,492
"$10,000 and 15 percent."

1026
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:16,783
"Let me save my face, too."

1027
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:20,284
Okay?

1028
01:08:22,909 --> 01:08:25,259
"Hey, bring the dough."

1029
01:08:25,284 --> 01:08:27,034
"Kid, look over here. Here."

1030
01:08:27,034 --> 01:08:29,117
"I said, look over here."

1031
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,367
Hey!

1032
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,451
Geez.

1033
01:08:35,201 --> 01:08:37,201
Let's go!

1034
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:38,867
Yeah!

1035
01:08:38,992 --> 01:08:40,451
- Head! - Yes!

1036
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:41,867
- Hit it hard. - There.

1037
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,576
- No hitting. No… No hitting. - Gosh.

1038
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:45,201
You're supposed to hit it.

1039
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:47,451
It's for you to hit. Do you see?

1040
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:50,074
- Try it. - Sweet.

1041
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:54,028
"Hey, kid. Calm down."

1042
01:09:06,618 --> 01:09:08,240
What's wrong?

1043
01:09:08,265 --> 01:09:10,920
"- I don't take photos. - Come on, just one."

1044
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,326
Young-hoon.

1045
01:09:31,117 --> 01:09:34,783
Young-hoon. Give me some more.

1046
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,659
You little...

1047
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:51,909
"Young-hoon, what do you want for Christmas?"

1048
01:09:51,992 --> 01:09:53,783
I mean from Santa Claus.

1049
01:09:54,034 --> 01:09:55,618
I can't get toys. No toys.

1050
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,700
It's over for toys.

1051
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:03,451
P… Perfect game. I want a perfect game.

1052
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:05,159
Grandma told me that a perfect game is…

1053
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,700
It's a gift from the heavens.

1054
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:10,742
P… Perfect game.

1055
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:17,534
You're crazy. A perfect game?

1056
01:10:18,034 --> 01:10:19,284
Hey.

1057
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:25,481
A perfect game doesn't come from the heavens.

1058
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:29,650
You just gotta believe in your ball.

1059
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:35,133
"If you really believe you can do it,"

1060
01:10:35,326 --> 01:10:37,284
then you can.

1061
01:10:38,326 --> 01:10:40,436
It's definitely possible.

1062
01:10:44,242 --> 01:10:46,159
You little...

1063
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:48,431
Perfect man.

1064
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:54,994
"Sheesh, are you drinking again?"

1065
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:05,614
Be careful.

1066
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:09,534
"- Seriously. - Oh, my back."

1067
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:11,659
I'm sick of this.

1068
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:13,451
My back…

1069
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:15,367
Do you want water?

1070
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:17,242
"Oh, my back. My poor back."

1071
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:20,242
"- Seriously. - Hey, help him take these off."

1072
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:22,700
Sheesh.

1073
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,284
"Hey, don't touch those."

1074
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,909
What are these?

1075
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,492
It's so pretty.

1076
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:39,242
Can I try it on?

1077
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:43,659
Keep it then.

1078
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:47,492
I don't know how to put it on by myself.

1079
01:11:59,284 --> 01:12:01,134
Just put it on yourself.

1080
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,271
Then give it to someone else.

1081
01:12:30,659 --> 01:12:31,825
Let's go!

1082
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:37,492
Do you want something to eat?

1083
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:39,367
I'll make it quick.

1084
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:46,783
"I checked the lanes already, and there isn't much."

1085
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:50,492
What the…

1086
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:51,492
Fuck.

1087
01:13:06,576 --> 01:13:08,386
Let's have some fun.

1088
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:19,742
"I told you, there's nothing to worry about."

1089
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,117
Toad's out of town.

1090
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:23,201
Maybe he just rented this place out.

1091
01:13:23,326 --> 01:13:26,723
I'm not worried. I was just curious.

1092
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:09,576
"Yes, that's it!"

1093
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,269
What the hell was that?

1094
01:14:50,534 --> 01:14:52,825
Isn't that harder than railroad?

1095
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:55,103
He cut off the flow. Shit.

1096
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:58,542
How's he gonna hit that?

1097
01:15:07,093 --> 01:15:08,759
That's impossible!

1098
01:15:09,187 --> 01:15:10,229
Let's go!

1099
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:12,273
How did he get that?

1100
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,628
Big four!

1101
01:15:18,992 --> 01:15:20,593
Why should we be so nervous?

1102
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:22,367
It's not Toad's money anyway.

1103
01:15:23,576 --> 01:15:25,326
I wasn't nervous.

1104
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,342
"Yeah, don't be nervous, man."

1105
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:30,034
It's not my money. It's my uncle's.

1106
01:15:30,075 --> 01:15:32,992
It's an interesting duo. A cripple…

1107
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:34,771
and a retard.

1108
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:41,117
Mr. Yoon. It's going smooth so far.

1109
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:43,159
Do you want some food to refresh?

1110
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,659
"You gotta energize up to beat the night, right?"

1111
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:06,203
How did you miss that?

1112
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,370
Should we stop here?

1113
01:16:35,451 --> 01:16:36,326
What now?

1114
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,509
What's going on?

1115
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:42,659
What happened?

1116
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:44,117
Why did it all stop?

1117
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:45,659
What's going on?

1118
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:48,004
The gearbox seems to be broken.

1119
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:51,534
Shit. It's not like we can put up the pins one by one.

1120
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:57,663
That old man better not be playing games. Who knows.

1121
01:16:58,117 --> 01:17:01,040
I'll call you when we set a new date.

1122
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:02,742
Good job today.

1123
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,063
"Hey, where did she go?"

1124
01:17:20,825 --> 01:17:22,545
Are you looking for Ms. Joo?

1125
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:23,659
Come with me.

1126
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:30,367
"It's been so long, hasn't it?"

1127
01:17:33,618 --> 01:17:36,034
"Hey buddy, do you drink?"

1128
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,719
Don't give him any.

1129
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,159
"Hey bro, you were such a pro."

1130
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:43,867
It was very impressive.

1131
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:45,075
Don't worry.

1132
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:47,576
I'm friends with this guy. Good friends.

1133
01:17:50,492 --> 01:17:52,509
I hear his parents threw him away.

1134
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:56,867
"Not exactly, but he's staying with me for now."

1135
01:17:58,034 --> 01:17:59,825
How did you even find him?

1136
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,131
I guess you still have an eye for things.

1137
01:18:03,492 --> 01:18:06,783
I will be straightforward.

1138
01:18:08,618 --> 01:18:10,242
Hand him over to me.

1139
01:18:11,783 --> 01:18:13,534
Professional bowling is active these days.

1140
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:15,451
Number of games increased.

1141
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:17,950
"If I train and take him in,"

1142
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,284
media will go crazy over him.

1143
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,618
He'll become a star then.

1144
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:25,159
"He's handicapped, but he's better."

1145
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,576
It's a triumph for mankind.

1146
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,747
He'll become so popular.

1147
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:33,492
This isn't something you can do anyway.

1148
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,659
"No, I don't want to. I won't go elsewhere."

1149
01:18:38,326 --> 01:18:41,284
So you know how to talk?

1150
01:18:41,576 --> 01:18:42,284
"Good, good."

1151
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:45,825
You have to communicate in order to work with me. Right?

1152
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:47,451
I hear you like noodles.

1153
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:51,326
You need cucumbers on noodles.

1154
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:53,825
"Cucumbers? Okay, okay."

1155
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:57,825
I'll buy you noodles and cucumbers every day.

1156
01:18:57,825 --> 01:18:59,950
The thing is…

1157
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:04,534
He doesn't listen to others.

1158
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,075
He's super arrogant and he only listens to me.

1159
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,383
You don't have to worry about that.

1160
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,201
I'll get a coach…

1161
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:16,284
and give him the best support to train him.

1162
01:19:18,326 --> 01:19:20,201
I already talked to Hee-Jin as well.

1163
01:19:20,576 --> 01:19:22,659
I felt bad about keeping TOWOO BOWLING...

1164
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:25,159
since it reminded me of Coach Joo.

1165
01:19:27,075 --> 01:19:28,937
"It's awkward, you know."

1166
01:19:49,976 --> 01:19:52,684
"That's better for Young-hoon, too."

1167
01:19:52,992 --> 01:19:54,909
I didn't say anything.

1168
01:19:59,742 --> 01:20:02,409
"It's better for him to be a professional, too."

1169
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:08,117
Was he okay with separating from you?

1170
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:11,242
Noodles...

1171
01:20:11,492 --> 01:20:12,742
Under

1172
01:20:12,783 --> 01:20:14,576
The clear moon

1173
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:18,534
When I think

1174
01:20:18,534 --> 01:20:21,367
About it

1175
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:25,159
Everything in the world

1176
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,659
- Feels like a dream - Young...

1177
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:34,034
A spring dream

1178
01:20:39,576 --> 01:20:42,075
He left when Toad offered him…

1179
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,451
some noodles.

1180
01:20:50,326 --> 01:20:52,742
"Hey, buddy. It's Milkiss."

1181
01:20:52,742 --> 01:20:54,783
I'll give you this. Let's just play one game.

1182
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:56,117
"No, no."

1183
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:57,326
Do you need more beating?

1184
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,492
Are you fucking crazy?

1185
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:01,409
Don't you dare touch him.

1186
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:04,409
"If any of you ever touch him, I'll just kill you all."

1187
01:21:04,409 --> 01:21:05,783
- Got that? - Yes.

1188
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,492
I'm super good. Cheol-jong is no match for me.

1189
01:21:09,576 --> 01:21:11,659
"- No, no... - You're a fucking ass."

1190
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:12,824
Piece of shit.

1191
01:21:17,992 --> 01:21:21,409
Floor... The floor shouldn't be dirty.

1192
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:25,159
The lane shouldn't be dirty.

1193
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:28,534
Are you here?

1194
01:21:29,242 --> 01:21:31,367
"Do something about this bastard, will you?"

1195
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:34,659
He doesn't listen to me. Fuck.

1196
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:24,826
Let's go!

1197
01:22:25,578 --> 01:22:28,521
Why didn't he just tell me?

1198
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:30,867
"Hey, go get five more headbands."

1199
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:32,242
"Yes, Sir."

1200
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,825
"- All good? I'm leaving. - Hold on, hold on."

1201
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,618
I talked to the interior company.

1202
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:39,367
They'll call you soon.

1203
01:22:39,576 --> 01:22:42,451
"Hey buddy, why didn't you just tell me that?"

1204
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:44,783
How can a headband help?

1205
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:47,034
I told you not to get in my way.

1206
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,451
He's so strange.

1207
01:22:50,492 --> 01:22:51,825
What a retard.

1208
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,906
A headband? What a joke.

1209
01:22:54,454 --> 01:22:55,787
Did he leave already?

1210
01:23:39,089 --> 01:23:42,088
Yoon Cheol-jong is really amazing.

1211
01:23:42,242 --> 01:23:45,242
He only has two more frames to go for a perfect game.

1212
01:23:45,576 --> 01:23:49,020
He better keep his calm.

1213
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:56,490
Nice!

1214
01:23:56,576 --> 01:23:59,075
Let's go!

1215
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:00,945
Let's go!

1216
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:10,742
Your form is strange.

1217
01:24:10,867 --> 01:24:14,618
It's funny. How come he only listens to you?

1218
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,618
"Young-hoon doesn't make eye contact with me,"

1219
01:24:17,618 --> 01:24:19,618
but he does with you.

1220
01:24:19,992 --> 01:24:21,992
He must have grown up with you.

1221
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:31,342
Strike!

1222
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:32,659
Yoon Cheol-jong...

1223
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,201
- Let's go! - got a perfect game!

1224
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:11,941
That retard…

1225
01:25:15,409 --> 01:25:17,409
"Yes, I'll call later..."

1226
01:25:19,326 --> 01:25:22,451
Yes. I'll call you tomorrow.

1227
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:26,551
"Hey, hey, hey."

1228
01:25:26,576 --> 01:25:31,075
"Hey, hey, hey!"

1229
01:25:33,242 --> 01:25:34,700
So you want him back?

1230
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:37,825
"Here's your interest. $30,000."

1231
01:25:38,117 --> 01:25:39,825
"Alright, take him."

1232
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:42,659
"If you change your mind,"

1233
01:25:42,659 --> 01:25:44,659
"I'll kill you, you fucker."

1234
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:48,451
"Why don't you trust me? It's fine, just take him."

1235
01:25:49,117 --> 01:25:49,992
"But,"

1236
01:25:50,992 --> 01:25:52,867
let's play a proper game.

1237
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:54,825
That game with Mr. Baek…

1238
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,825
I plan on making bigger bets.

1239
01:25:57,992 --> 01:26:00,380
I want you to lose for me.

1240
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:04,201
I heard you received 15 percent. I'll give you 30.

1241
01:26:07,326 --> 01:26:08,825
What's the problem?

1242
01:26:10,034 --> 01:26:12,636
Don't you want TOWOO BOWLING back?

1243
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:16,867
The bet's going to be huge. It'll be one huge blow.

1244
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,201
I know you're good at doing this kind of thing.

1245
01:26:25,742 --> 01:26:27,911
I guess you don't want to.

1246
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:33,409
All right. All right. Just give Young-hoon back to me.

1247
01:26:33,451 --> 01:26:34,367
Hurry up.

1248
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:38,618
Take him.

1249
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,659
You piece of shit.

1250
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:51,075
"Are you back, Sir?"

1251
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:52,909
- Did you eat? - Go ahead.

1252
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:07,117
Let's go home.

1253
01:27:10,218 --> 01:27:12,467
I can't get in the way.

1254
01:27:12,492 --> 01:27:14,367
Don't get in the way.

1255
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:17,825
I won't get in the way.

1256
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:21,950
Follow me.

1257
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,242
Gosh.

1258
01:27:50,326 --> 01:27:52,825
"Stay still, you idiot."

1259
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,991
You shit. Just stay still.

1260
01:28:12,075 --> 01:28:14,632
What I want to say is…

1261
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:16,909
This kid…

1262
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,451
He'll become a star in China for sure.

1263
01:28:20,409 --> 01:28:24,075
The Chinese people love human drama.

1264
01:28:25,117 --> 01:28:28,618
I bet all the Chinese will go crazy to bet on your son.

1265
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:31,992
Professional bowling doesn't make any money.

1266
01:28:32,326 --> 01:28:34,618
I was thinking of the Chinese market from the start.

1267
01:28:34,867 --> 01:28:37,909
I don't know such things.

1268
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:41,319
Have a drink.

1269
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:43,884
"You said you trust me, right?"

1270
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:44,950
Well…

1271
01:28:47,201 --> 01:28:48,117
"Sir,"

1272
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:51,374
just trust me. I'll take care of it.

1273
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,362
Then…

1274
01:28:55,451 --> 01:28:57,950
What do you…

1275
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:00,451
need me to do?

1276
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:25,406
PRO-BOWLER APPLICATION YOUNG-HOON

1277
01:29:50,492 --> 01:29:52,105
Let's go!

1278
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:25,039
"Four times is $8,000."

1279
01:30:26,326 --> 01:30:28,409
"In total, it's $13,000."

1280
01:30:34,284 --> 01:30:36,783
Sheesh.

1281
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:43,208
Why did it slip there?

1282
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:48,367
All right.

1283
01:30:50,869 --> 01:30:51,869
Mr. Yoon.

1284
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,060
Let's take a break.

1285
01:30:57,659 --> 01:30:59,909
We'll switch players.

1286
01:31:10,367 --> 01:31:12,909
"Cheol-jong, open the door."

1287
01:31:15,825 --> 01:31:16,950
Cheol-jong!

1288
01:31:18,367 --> 01:31:22,284
"I'm sorry, okay? Open the door!"

1289
01:31:30,742 --> 01:31:32,736
Are you going to make it so obvious?

1290
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:36,117
You should be more discreet than that.

1291
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:37,576
I tried my best.

1292
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,742
Make sure you're back in the game.

1293
01:31:39,742 --> 01:31:40,783
Got it?

1294
01:31:40,825 --> 01:31:41,700
Mr. Yoon.

1295
01:31:44,075 --> 01:31:45,576
What are you doing?

1296
01:31:45,576 --> 01:31:47,534
Were you taking a dump?

1297
01:31:47,576 --> 01:31:48,909
Yes.

1298
01:31:50,326 --> 01:31:52,117
Are you feeling sick today?

1299
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:52,992
No.

1300
01:31:55,534 --> 01:31:56,867
That's good.

1301
01:31:57,367 --> 01:32:00,703
"You weren't doing well, so I cut you off."

1302
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,700
You should get ready to go back in.

1303
01:32:04,075 --> 01:32:05,034
Okay.

1304
01:32:05,201 --> 01:32:07,700
We can't win with just my guys.

1305
01:32:08,367 --> 01:32:12,618
It'll be a long match. We'll take it slow.

1306
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:14,742
Yes.

1307
01:32:20,075 --> 01:32:21,284
Yes!

1308
01:32:22,562 --> 01:32:25,833
- We're gonna win! - It's been a while since we won.

1309
01:32:26,201 --> 01:32:28,700
"All right, let's get the game going."

1310
01:32:29,576 --> 01:32:31,075
Sir.

1311
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,284
"Yes, it's me."

1312
01:32:35,284 --> 01:32:36,451
What is it?

1313
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:41,492
So?

1314
01:32:42,201 --> 01:32:43,659
You're kidding.

1315
01:32:43,783 --> 01:32:47,284
"Okay. I said, okay!"

1316
01:32:52,034 --> 01:32:54,159
I'm really sorry about this.

1317
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:58,825
Something urgent came up.

1318
01:32:58,992 --> 01:33:00,700
I don't think we can do this all night.

1319
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,451
"You're leaving tomorrow, right?"

1320
01:33:04,117 --> 01:33:06,576
- Shit. This really sucks. - How about…

1321
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:09,952
we boost up the game?

1322
01:33:10,326 --> 01:33:12,725
"$10,000 per game. Double the raises."

1323
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,159
"Okay, let's do that."

1324
01:33:22,075 --> 01:33:23,367
Let's try it. Okay.

1325
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:35,117
"It's a bagger, so it's $16,000."

1326
01:33:35,117 --> 01:33:37,992
"If he gets both bonuses, it'll be $32,000. $64,000."

1327
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:39,138
"$120,000!"

1328
01:33:39,242 --> 01:33:41,742
Raise alone is worth 120 grand.

1329
01:33:48,992 --> 01:33:49,992
Let's go!

1330
01:34:11,072 --> 01:34:13,364
They missed their chance at 120 grand.

1331
01:34:13,492 --> 01:34:15,659
"Okay. $10,000."

1332
01:34:17,534 --> 01:34:20,034
"Here's $34,000 then $44,000. Okay."

1333
01:34:21,242 --> 01:34:23,909
Should we bump it up? 20 grand per game?

1334
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,992
Let's double that...

1335
01:34:27,742 --> 01:34:29,451
"and do 40 grand and $16,000."

1336
01:34:31,534 --> 01:34:33,201
"40 grand and $16,000..."

1337
01:34:33,742 --> 01:34:35,117
"All right, let's do it."

1338
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,367
Are you sure about this?

1339
01:34:38,534 --> 01:34:39,700
"Just because I lost until now,"

1340
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,003
doesn't mean I'll keep losing.

1341
01:34:42,201 --> 01:34:44,534
I'll give it a shot.

1342
01:35:05,781 --> 01:35:08,619
Another raise! This game's crazy.

1343
01:35:17,783 --> 01:35:21,117
"Four-bagger is $64,000."

1344
01:35:21,242 --> 01:35:22,992
"Both sides have $120,000 right now."

1345
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,700
This game is crazy!

1346
01:35:30,742 --> 01:35:33,326
"Damn, they just lost $120,000."

1347
01:35:33,451 --> 01:35:35,451
What a waste.

1348
01:35:56,492 --> 01:35:58,492
It's worth 120 grand now. 120!

1349
01:36:00,968 --> 01:36:04,010
There are still two bonus frames left.

1350
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:16,909
I have to drink Milkiss. Milkiss.

1351
01:36:16,909 --> 01:36:21,451
You should drink beer after a bath. Forget Milkiss.

1352
01:36:21,451 --> 01:36:22,825
You have that every fucking day.

1353
01:36:22,867 --> 01:36:24,201
I need Milkiss.

1354
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:25,909
- Let's go. - Okay.

1355
01:36:26,117 --> 01:36:27,534
Did you enjoy the food?

1356
01:36:27,576 --> 01:36:28,576
"Yes, it was delicious."

1357
01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:29,742
"Yes, this place is pretty good."

1358
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,950
You can come whenever.

1359
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:34,742
Hold on. Hold on.

1360
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:38,593
"Anyhow,"

1361
01:36:38,618 --> 01:36:42,201
this kid will be a golden egg in China.

1362
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:49,108
- Then I'll just make his passport and… - Yes!

1363
01:36:51,207 --> 01:36:53,009
They still have the bonus frame left.

1364
01:36:53,034 --> 01:36:55,909
How much is that worth?

1365
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,576
"If they get it, it's 480,000 dollars."

1366
01:37:18,737 --> 01:37:20,842
Toad really came.

1367
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:23,992
This is the machine room.

1368
01:37:24,492 --> 01:37:26,700
Washrooms are that way.

1369
01:37:26,742 --> 01:37:29,618
Didn't I tell you to put up a washroom sign?

1370
01:37:29,659 --> 01:37:30,963
"Sorry, Sir."

1371
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:46,242
What do you think you're doing?

1372
01:37:47,492 --> 01:37:50,609
What are you doing to my player?

1373
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,367
Sir?

1374
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:08,783
You're asking me…

1375
01:38:08,783 --> 01:38:11,485
to protect Young-hoon?

1376
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,990
That old man is not easy.

1377
01:38:16,783 --> 01:38:18,201
Just leave.

1378
01:38:30,945 --> 01:38:33,741
"Please, I'm begging you."

1379
01:38:35,117 --> 01:38:36,786
"Well, a businessman will do anything…"

1380
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,728
if it makes a profit.

1381
01:38:39,078 --> 01:38:43,328
I'll make the game big when that Toad tries to scam us.

1382
01:38:43,867 --> 01:38:46,367
Do you think you can win?

1383
01:38:47,742 --> 01:38:50,300
"If you make a good counterstrike,"

1384
01:38:50,325 --> 01:38:52,325
I'll get my boys running.

1385
01:38:53,906 --> 01:38:56,739
We should play until the end. Let's go.

1386
01:39:01,697 --> 01:39:04,742
Do you know what happened to his leg?

1387
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:09,409
"You probably don't know, huh?"

1388
01:39:12,576 --> 01:39:15,492
It's actually a funny story.

1389
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:51,992
Let's stop here.

1390
01:39:52,732 --> 01:39:54,873
"Sure, why not."

1391
01:40:03,569 --> 01:40:07,278
Why stop now? I can just see it now.

1392
01:40:07,492 --> 01:40:10,700
It's hard to break a flow once it stabilizes.

1393
01:40:10,742 --> 01:40:13,242
"If we do solos, we'll win for sure."

1394
01:40:14,034 --> 01:40:15,451
I'll play.

1395
01:40:15,534 --> 01:40:18,034
I know him inside out.

1396
01:40:18,618 --> 01:40:21,117
A fast ball will leave the 10th pin up.

1397
01:40:21,159 --> 01:40:25,159
You should know when to step back. Let's end it here.

1398
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:29,451
Let's go.

1399
01:40:31,289 --> 01:40:34,622
"You're the 10th pin in my life, you fucker."

1400
01:40:54,390 --> 01:40:55,646
Give me the bag.

1401
01:40:56,242 --> 01:40:57,825
"Hey, Mr. Yoon."

1402
01:40:58,992 --> 01:41:00,367
Good work.

1403
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,659
Let's get something to eat.

1404
01:41:04,075 --> 01:41:05,700
Come on.

1405
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:10,950
I had fun today.

1406
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:12,555
Did your uncle leave?

1407
01:41:13,451 --> 01:41:15,384
You should smile a little.

1408
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:17,034
I think we played enough.

1409
01:41:17,075 --> 01:41:18,284
Let's go.

1410
01:41:22,917 --> 01:41:25,815
I heard you ran into Mr. Park.

1411
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:31,700
Things are not going well for him.

1412
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,367
He fucks up everything.

1413
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,201
"His wife ran away, too."

1414
01:41:38,825 --> 01:41:41,326
That's why one should…

1415
01:41:42,742 --> 01:41:44,742
never commit any crimes.

1416
01:41:47,389 --> 01:41:49,389
Let's play a game.

1417
01:41:49,576 --> 01:41:51,492
You said I never beat you?

1418
01:41:52,534 --> 01:41:56,034
You're wrong. You just forgot.

1419
01:41:58,367 --> 01:41:59,867
Mr. Yoon.

1420
01:42:03,992 --> 01:42:05,696
You go on ahead.

1421
01:42:06,075 --> 01:42:07,451
I have something to take care of.

1422
01:42:07,492 --> 01:42:10,825
"Ah, I can't miss a good game like this."

1423
01:42:11,909 --> 01:42:13,742
Don't mind me.

1424
01:42:13,783 --> 01:42:15,441
I'll stay neutral.

1425
01:42:19,534 --> 01:42:22,326
"If I win, give me TOWOO,"

1426
01:42:22,326 --> 01:42:25,227
and never show up in front of us again.

1427
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:27,950
That's not enough money.

1428
01:42:29,326 --> 01:42:31,825
It wouldn't be a fair game.

1429
01:42:31,909 --> 01:42:32,992
What do you want me to bet?

1430
01:42:33,034 --> 01:42:34,659
Bet your three fingers.

1431
01:42:35,992 --> 01:42:38,492
It really bothers me that you're still playing.

1432
01:42:38,492 --> 01:42:39,897
What are you doing?

1433
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:43,242
"Cut off your own fingers, you asshole!"

1434
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:45,050
"Let's go, Cheol-jong."

1435
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:45,992
"Come on, let's go."

1436
01:42:45,992 --> 01:42:48,034
I don't need money any more.

1437
01:42:48,284 --> 01:42:50,593
Let's stop living like this. Come on.

1438
01:42:50,618 --> 01:42:51,075
Let's go.

1439
01:42:51,075 --> 01:42:52,909
"Go! Hurry up, Kid!"

1440
01:42:52,909 --> 01:42:55,159
Hurry up and come with me.

1441
01:43:09,992 --> 01:43:12,520
May I ask you a favor?

1442
01:43:13,598 --> 01:43:14,842
Take her away.

1443
01:43:14,867 --> 01:43:17,367
"- All right, let's go. - Let me go!"

1444
01:43:19,409 --> 01:43:21,909
"Come on, hurry up."

1445
01:43:22,492 --> 01:43:23,867
Keep your promise.

1446
01:43:25,874 --> 01:43:27,403
Is it a deal?

1447
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:28,576
Okay.

1448
01:43:28,721 --> 01:43:31,739
"Hey, go get a knife."

1449
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:35,622
TOWOO BOWLING. Three fingers. This is exciting.

1450
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:41,286
Fucking retard.

1451
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:15,373
Was her name Mi-Jung?

1452
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:18,159
Your wife was such a sweet woman.

1453
01:44:19,952 --> 01:44:22,734
"She had a sexy body, too."

1454
01:44:23,117 --> 01:44:24,576
Too bad.

1455
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:36,201
Oh?

1456
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:50,480
Yes!

1457
01:45:09,284 --> 01:45:10,451
Let's go!

1458
01:45:11,909 --> 01:45:14,409
"Perfect man, Yoon Cheol-jong. Let's go!"

1459
01:45:14,534 --> 01:45:17,720
"Oh, you know his nickname? Perfect man?"

1460
01:45:23,909 --> 01:45:25,576
WEDNESDAY BOWLING - FINAL MATCH

1461
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:26,950
Let's go!

1462
01:45:35,409 --> 01:45:37,201
It was amazing.

1463
01:45:38,534 --> 01:45:40,509
He was on the news.

1464
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:41,618
"Hey, kid."

1465
01:45:42,367 --> 01:45:46,224
"You don't know how amazing he used to be, do you?"

1466
01:45:47,618 --> 01:45:48,909
He was a legend.

1467
01:45:49,451 --> 01:45:51,576
He gave up on sports and used to drive a truck.

1468
01:45:52,034 --> 01:45:54,034
"After getting a perfect game on WEDNESDAY BOWLING,"

1469
01:45:54,075 --> 01:45:55,409
he was scouted right away.

1470
01:45:55,618 --> 01:45:58,551
He beat all the talented national team members...

1471
01:45:58,576 --> 01:46:01,117
and won at the Korean President's Cup.

1472
01:46:04,451 --> 01:46:06,409
No one could beat him.

1473
01:46:27,783 --> 01:46:30,117
The singles at the President's Cup were amazing.

1474
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:33,034
It sure was.

1475
01:46:34,783 --> 01:46:37,576
But the team games are the real hit.

1476
01:46:37,659 --> 01:46:40,950
"It was really dramatic, right?"

1477
01:46:42,409 --> 01:46:44,034
"Sports is like a drama,"

1478
01:46:44,034 --> 01:46:45,495
don't you agree?

1479
01:46:51,117 --> 01:46:52,201
PRESIDENT'S CUP - TEAM MATCH

1480
01:46:52,242 --> 01:46:55,117
Yoon's left with the 10th pin again.

1481
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:59,514
The winner from the singles played the worst.

1482
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:01,992
He played so badly...

1483
01:47:01,992 --> 01:47:05,373
that some people thought he played bad on purpose.

1484
01:47:06,742 --> 01:47:07,909
What's wrong?

1485
01:47:09,409 --> 01:47:10,700
Something bothering you?

1486
01:47:11,284 --> 01:47:12,409
What's gotten into you?

1487
01:47:13,284 --> 01:47:15,783
"Hey, Cheol-jong. Come in."

1488
01:47:16,618 --> 01:47:19,117
You don't have to if you don't want to.

1489
01:47:19,492 --> 01:47:20,836
Excuse me…

1490
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:25,201
I'm a huge fan of yours.

1491
01:47:25,742 --> 01:47:28,034
What I care about the most…

1492
01:47:28,075 --> 01:47:29,783
is for you to win the singles.

1493
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:33,201
"But after you win at the singles,"

1494
01:47:33,742 --> 01:47:35,909
who cares about the team game?

1495
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:37,582
They would pick the national team...

1496
01:47:37,607 --> 01:47:39,472
from the singles game anyway.

1497
01:47:41,117 --> 01:47:44,700
"Gosh, it's the 10th pin again."

1498
01:47:44,867 --> 01:47:48,201
Yoon keeps missing pin number 10 today.

1499
01:47:48,201 --> 01:47:49,659
The ball keeps going a little too short.

1500
01:47:49,659 --> 01:47:52,242
Yes. This is going to put a bigger gap in their scores.

1501
01:48:06,867 --> 01:48:08,326
Lucky!

1502
01:48:08,742 --> 01:48:11,242
That asshole is always lucky.

1503
01:48:11,534 --> 01:48:14,367
No wonder they still won after doing all that shit.

1504
01:48:14,392 --> 01:48:17,974
NAMYANG will win even if they get just one pin in the bonus frame.

1505
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:27,825
NAMYANG takes the President's trophy for the team round.

1506
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:30,288
"-What? - Foul, foul."

1507
01:48:30,313 --> 01:48:31,444
- What happened?

1508
01:48:31,469 --> 01:48:32,333
" - Guys, we won! Yes!"

1509
01:48:32,358 --> 01:48:34,009
He went over the foul line.

1510
01:48:34,034 --> 01:48:34,909
"If this is the case,"

1511
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:36,534
"the last pitch's score becomes zero,"

1512
01:48:36,559 --> 01:48:39,183
and team WINNESS takes the win.

1513
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:40,916
WINNESS wins.

1514
01:48:42,034 --> 01:48:44,825
Should we consider them lucky?

1515
01:48:44,879 --> 01:48:46,546
How can this happen?

1516
01:48:46,825 --> 01:48:47,950
This is so dramatic.

1517
01:48:47,992 --> 01:48:49,992
Those guys must have put in a lot of money.

1518
01:48:49,992 --> 01:48:52,492
They will kill us.

1519
01:48:53,783 --> 01:48:56,159
"I'll take care of things here,"

1520
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,242
so go somewhere remote to hide.

1521
01:48:59,284 --> 01:49:01,409
We don't know what they're going to do.

1522
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,075
Didn't you get into the accident that day?

1523
01:49:04,117 --> 01:49:05,825
The day you won both games?

1524
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,242
What is this about all of a sudden?

1525
01:49:08,492 --> 01:49:09,867
It's nothing.

1526
01:49:12,034 --> 01:49:13,486
Geez.

1527
01:49:40,089 --> 01:49:40,923
Cheol-jong.

1528
01:49:41,618 --> 01:49:43,409
- Cheol-jong. - Come on.

1529
01:49:43,576 --> 01:49:45,326
"Hey, you shouldn't be falling for him."

1530
01:49:45,367 --> 01:49:47,367
He killed his own wife...

1531
01:49:47,367 --> 01:49:48,867
when he was running away.

1532
01:49:48,867 --> 01:49:50,284
"Shut up, you asshole!"

1533
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:51,867
Cheol-jong!

1534
01:49:52,117 --> 01:49:53,159
Cheol-jong!

1535
01:49:57,201 --> 01:49:58,742
Let me ask you one thing.

1536
01:50:00,075 --> 01:50:03,117
Did you go over the foul line...

1537
01:50:03,783 --> 01:50:05,950
on purpose?

1538
01:50:06,742 --> 01:50:08,534
Do you think I did it on purpose?

1539
01:50:11,783 --> 01:50:15,783
See? I told you I beat you once.

1540
01:50:21,687 --> 01:50:23,730
What happened just now?

1541
01:50:31,618 --> 01:50:33,451
Asshole.

1542
01:50:33,909 --> 01:50:35,909
Are you that curious?

1543
01:50:39,618 --> 01:50:40,534
Hey.

1544
01:50:41,367 --> 01:50:43,159
Finish up the game.

1545
01:50:50,075 --> 01:50:53,075
"No, don't bother answering."

1546
01:50:54,992 --> 01:50:58,950
Now I know that I'm not the only shitty one.

1547
01:50:58,992 --> 01:51:00,492
Piece of shit.

1548
01:51:05,095 --> 01:51:09,054
The bolder one will win now.

1549
01:51:48,492 --> 01:51:51,044
Your form is getting better.

1550
01:51:55,075 --> 01:51:56,075
"Hey, kid."

1551
01:51:56,451 --> 01:51:58,618
You have to get a strike to win.

1552
01:51:59,284 --> 01:52:01,034
Get ready to cut off your fingers.

1553
01:52:37,688 --> 01:52:39,521
"What a game, huh?"

1554
01:52:43,909 --> 01:52:46,982
"Make it a strike, and game's over."

1555
01:52:53,658 --> 01:52:55,893
He'd never make it.

1556
01:53:13,825 --> 01:53:15,576
There are always reasons…

1557
01:53:15,576 --> 01:53:17,800
why someone's life's fucked up.

1558
01:53:17,825 --> 01:53:18,534
Right?

1559
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:28,466
Cripple.

1560
01:53:40,451 --> 01:53:42,950
"You'll never make it, you crook!"

1561
01:54:20,409 --> 01:54:23,484
"Perfect man, Yoon Cheol-jong. Let's go!"

1562
01:54:24,867 --> 01:54:26,867
"Perfect man, let's go!"

1563
01:54:27,326 --> 01:54:28,492
Good game.

1564
01:54:29,618 --> 01:54:32,011
"Now, I call this bowling."

1565
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:36,576
"Perfect man, Yoon Cheol-jong. Let's go!"

1566
01:54:41,492 --> 01:54:42,783
Let's go!

1567
01:54:43,034 --> 01:54:45,534
Ms. Joo. Call me when you're opening the business.

1568
01:54:54,034 --> 01:54:56,783
"Hey, wait for us. Come on."

1569
01:54:58,659 --> 01:55:01,133
"Here, you can have this."

1570
01:55:04,182 --> 01:55:06,557
"You're not supposed to beat me, you fuck."

1571
01:55:19,484 --> 01:55:21,328
You little...

1572
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:24,986
Son of a bitch…

1573
01:55:29,117 --> 01:55:30,333
"That's right, bitch."

1574
01:55:30,358 --> 01:55:32,859
You better crawl at my feet.

1575
01:55:43,534 --> 01:55:45,945
I forgot the spare.

1576
01:55:46,534 --> 01:55:47,742
"No, no!"

1577
01:56:35,088 --> 01:56:37,005
Go. Let's go…

1578
01:56:37,326 --> 01:56:39,825
Let's go home. Home…

1579
01:56:40,819 --> 01:56:43,527
Let's go...

1580
01:56:51,249 --> 01:56:55,499
"Uncle, let's go home."

1581
01:57:02,033 --> 01:57:03,532
"Uncle, let's go home."

1582
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:06,284
"Uncle, let's go home."

1583
01:58:12,117 --> 01:58:16,075
Strike! Perfect! It's a perfect game!

1584
01:58:16,117 --> 01:58:18,242
Park Young-hoon is really amazing.

1585
01:58:18,326 --> 01:58:19,075
Let's go!

1586
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,641
He's the first person to have a perfect game...

1587
01:58:21,666 --> 01:58:25,071
at the Storm Pro-am event.

1588
01:58:25,096 --> 01:58:28,619
Park Young-hoon is amazing. I'm proud of him.

1589
01:58:35,551 --> 01:58:37,551
Park Young-hoon!

1590
01:58:37,576 --> 01:58:39,075
That bastard.

1591
01:58:39,075 --> 01:58:42,659
- Park Young-hoon! - Park Young-hoon!

1592
01:58:43,327 --> 01:58:44,535
Let's go!

1593
01:58:51,342 --> 01:58:54,561
What do you want to eat?

1594
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:55,169
Noodles!

1595
01:58:55,242 --> 01:58:57,201
- Are you fucking kidding? - Come on.

1596
01:58:57,367 --> 01:58:59,492
Noodles? You idiot.

1597
01:58:59,492 --> 01:59:02,075
- You're so stubborn. - Eat something else.

1598
01:59:02,326 --> 01:59:04,742
Makiss. Makiss. Milkiss for adults.

1599
01:59:04,783 --> 01:59:07,950
"Good, that's right. You are my man."

1600
01:59:07,975 --> 01:59:10,267
"- Seriously, no more drinks. - You're..."

1601
01:59:10,292 --> 01:59:11,625
He's an adult.

1602
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:13,567
Today is the day.

1603
01:59:13,592 --> 01:59:14,467
- We'll drink. - No. No drinks.

1604
01:59:14,492 --> 01:59:16,451
- Why not? - No drinking.

1605
01:59:16,492 --> 01:59:20,201
- "I love Makiss!" - Hey, don't speed up!

1606
01:59:21,596 --> 01:59:23,346
Wait for us!
