1
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,553
- Happy birthday to me!
- Happy birthday!

2
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
Oh, that's actually
a really good one.

3
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,197
- Wait. Anybody want this?
- Oh, my god.

4
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,406
That's what happens
when you do a mercy invite.

5
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,542
I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

6
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,010
Dad, I can't invite

7
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,212
everyone in my art class
except for one person

8
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,914
without social networking
evidence

9
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,049
inflicting more pain on
that person than was intended.

10
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,551
And I'm not a monster.

11
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,619
I'm proud of you. I think.

12
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,122
She gets detention a lot,

13
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,791
and she yells at teachers
sometimes.

14
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,526
Then there was that rumor
that went around

15
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,195
that she just kept
running away from home.

16
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,197
Um, maybe she can uber.

17
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,065
I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

18
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,067
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

19
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,771
We are not going
till she gets picked up.

20
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,042
Uh, the car broke down.

21
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:52,044
I'm just gonna take the bus.

22
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:54,279
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

23
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,148
Claire has almost saved
her half of the money

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,883
she needs for a car.
Isn't that right?

25
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,885
And this will be
one of the few times left

26
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,253
I can drive you guys around.

27
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,588
Huh?

28
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,123
Uh, I'm...

29
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,791
Claire: You won't be able to

30
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,427
hear my dad tell jokes
that only he thinks are funny

31
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,163
for an entire car ride
unless you come.

32
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,398
You don't really want
to miss that.

33
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,441
Claire: Wow. I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

34
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,578
- Can I put this in here?
- Uh, yeah, I'll get it.

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,113
Thank you, marcia.

36
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,395
Claire: Maybe he just is into...

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,852
Claire: Maybe he's just content
where he... where he is.

38
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,028
Hey.

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,897
Can I help you?

40
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,466
Claire: What?

41
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,700
Marcia: If this is the one,

42
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,169
he's so... he's really funny.

43
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,171
- He does these weekly videos.
- This is...

44
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,874
See? It's so random.

45
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,976
It's so weird.

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,446
Claire:
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

47
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,148
- I don't get it. Yeah, go back.
- Pause it.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,983
- Why don't you get it?
- I just don't get it.

49
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,318
Marcia: It's, like,
he's blond, and he's cute.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,886
Claire: No, his eyebrows
are just like...

51
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,788
Uh, shut up. His eyebrows?

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,156
Yeah. -That's the one thing
you couldn't get?

53
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,824
Yeah.

54
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,626
I get turned on by eyebrows,
though. -

55
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,328
Marcia: Oh, okay.

56
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,463
That's pretty good.

57
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,034
- Claire: Oh, my god.
- Marcia: What? What?

58
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,469
Marcia: Oh. You see
what he does, though?

59
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,705
- How does he even do that?
- I don't know.

60
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,373
That's the whole point
why I'm showing you.

61
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,576
Marcia: It's so genius.

62
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,511
So bad.

63
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,756
Claire: Hey.

64
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,325
Pardon me, sir.

65
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,393
I think you have the wrong car.

66
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,224
Claire: We woke up in here.

67
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,834
Claire:
What the hell is going on?

68
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,703
What are we doing here?

69
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,671
What happened to my dad?

70
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,740
He's out there.

71
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,445
Do you know
what happened to my dad?

72
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,234
I choose you first.

73
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,742
It's only gonna be a minute.

74
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,483
Pee on yourself.

75
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,251
- Pee on yourself.
- No!

76
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,986
No, no!

77
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,066
Claire: No. No!

78
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,202
No!

79
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,540
Claire: Open the door!

80
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,757
Are you okay?

81
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,761
Marcia:
He wanted me to dance for him.

82
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,402
Marcia: Okay.

83
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,738
The outside door is locked.

84
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,976
Everything's okay.

85
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,713
We're okay.

86
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,050
We're okay.

87
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,860
Man: <i>I hear
the tiniest little splash,</i>

88
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,361
and here it comes.

89
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,031
A freak of nature, like this.

90
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,333
So, he comes across the stream,

91
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:33,171
and he's so tall that the water
doesn't even get to his belly.

92
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,206
Then he stops.

93
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,276
And my heart's coming out
of my chest.

94
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,279
You got buck fever.

95
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,249
Uncle John's got buck fever.

96
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,184
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

97
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,453
- How big was the rack?
- It was huge.

98
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,522
Where are you supposed to look
when you shoot, Casey?

99
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,924
At the body. -Then why was
he looking at the rack?

100
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,260
'Cause he had buck fever.

101
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,063
She'll say anything you say.

102
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,531
You gonna do that when you get

103
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,366
your mentored hunting license
in three years?

104
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,968
No, sir.

105
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,770
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

106
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,173
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

107
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,103
Three students abducted.

108
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,638
The father of one
of the students

109
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,239
woke up dazed
in king of prussia,

110
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,607
reportedly drugged.

111
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,809
He found the kids
and the car missing.

112
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,478
Neighbors are in disbelief.

113
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
A normally quiet community.

114
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,850
Is reeling after this abduction.

115
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,351
If you have any information

116
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,986
concerning the whereabouts
of these girls,

117
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,656
you are urged
to contact the police.

118
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,875
Marcia: It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

119
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,377
There's a second locked door.

120
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,213
Claire: Okay. He's gonna come
in here again any second,

121
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,216
and we're not letting him take
one of us out again.

122
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,653
We just... we just cried
and screamed,

123
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,321
and we didn't hurt him

124
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,991
because we were afraid
to get him upset.

125
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,360
God, that's victim shit. Jesus.

126
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,196
We should fight him.

127
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,732
We should drop
a crazy-ass bomb on him.

128
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,468
I saw him carry one of you
and lay you on the bed

129
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,904
like you weighed nothing.

130
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:49,074
One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

131
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,677
I took... I took six months
of kenpo karate class,

132
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,746
and you distract
the assailant with pain.

133
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,683
Everything is so easy
for you guys.

134
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,653
You do one thing,
you can predict the next thing.

135
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,324
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

136
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,326
Claire:
We're not getting out of here.

137
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,561
You're saying that you're not

138
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,363
gonna fight
with everything in you?

139
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:16,367
You know the only chance...
The only chance we have

140
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,270
is if all three of us
go crazy on this guy.

141
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,141
We have to hurry.

142
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,513
Marcia: We need you, Casey.

143
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,915
Claire is smart.

144
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,685
Let's listen to her.

145
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,621
I'll do it
if you're gonna do it, too.

146
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,191
We can win.

147
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,527
He'll hurt us.

148
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,864
No. Shut up.

149
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,032
Both of you.

150
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,101
Claire: You're gonna pick
your miserable self up

151
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,270
and help us get out of here.

152
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,640
Blow me.

153
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,709
And your six months of karate

154
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,878
at the king of prussia mall
can blow me, too.

155
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,213
No. No, no,
you-you can't do this today.

156
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,748
You can't do this right now.

157
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,750
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

158
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,352
Why do you act
like you're not one of us?

159
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,427
When you're aiming, Casey,

160
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,429
always keep both eyes open.

161
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,265
Cover your target
with the barrel,

162
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,469
then move with it
to get its pace.

163
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,105
I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

164
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,607
You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

165
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,743
You'll learn to stay with it.

166
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,079
Females are smarter
than the males,

167
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,581
but you know that...
It's like humans.

168
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,652
Females use their nose
to stay alive.

169
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,420
They make sure they have cover.

170
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:46,357
They always remember
they're trying to stay alive.

171
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,260
Bucks go off by themselves.

172
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,163
Bucks get dumb
during mating season.

173
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,465
Boys make too much noise.

174
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,868
Yes, they do.

175
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,103
I'm better than a boy, right?

176
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,806
Yes, you are.

177
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,408
John: Hey.

178
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,417
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

179
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,755
We don't even know
what this is yet.

180
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,432
Hey. I, uh... I was inspired.

181
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,570
N-n-n-no, that one.

182
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,173
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

183
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,675
That's supposed to be like a...
Like a tailored jacket,

184
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:40,578
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

185
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,717
Woman: Well, I'm a simple
blouse-and-skirt person,

186
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,887
but these...

187
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,056
These are very artistic, Barry.

188
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,192
Just the kind of thing
Hamptons ladies

189
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:58,863
would spend $15,000 on
to wear once at a charity ball.

190
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,565
Shut up.

191
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,100
You know,
I-i can't stay too long.

192
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,903
This is... this is just a...
Just a visit.

193
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,405
Well, tell me what's going on.

194
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,108
What, you-you mean the e-mail?

195
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,709
Ah, just the usual things.

196
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,077
Just feelings
of being overwhelmed.

197
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,846
Well, the terseness
of your e-mail

198
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,382
made it sound specific
and time-related.

199
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,183
Are... are you looking
for something?

200
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,218
No.

201
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,219
- No?
- No, I'm just...

202
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,553
Just admiring.

203
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,522
- I'm better now.
- How's work?

204
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,690
It's great.

205
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,725
Well, when I last spoke to them,

206
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,395
they believed
you were a model employee.

207
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:34,365
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

208
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,867
- You know this, right?
- I do.

209
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,902
Well, you've managed there
for ten years.

210
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:41,205
You're functioning very well,
Barry.

211
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,442
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

212
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,144
Yes, it is.

213
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,980
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

214
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,849
you've been the most consistent
at your job.

215
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,486
Did something happen, Barry?

216
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,489
How old are you?

217
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,960
Psh... just, the Internet
is inconsistent on this point.

218
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,895
Why is that on your mind?

219
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:07,932
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

220
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,268
Y-you know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves,

221
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,470
and nobody even believes
that we exist.

222
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,139
If ever something
were to happen to me,

223
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,408
I've made arrangements
with a colleague from Baltimore

224
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,676
to take over.

225
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,745
Hmm.

226
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:24,115
Hey, you, uh... you live alone?

227
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,416
You know this.

228
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,452
I'm sorry,
I just meant... how long?

229
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,054
Always.

230
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,725
That must be so lonely.

231
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,999
Uh, you know what?

232
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,667
I'm...

233
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,002
I'm doing much better.

234
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,336
I-I shouldn't have e-mailed you.

235
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,938
I'm-I'm just... Look at me.

236
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,339
I'm too impulsive.

237
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,946
By the way,
is anybody listening?

238
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,681
Does anybody care about us?

239
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,949
Yes.

240
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,784
The university of Paris
has asked me

241
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,386
to do a lecture, in fact.

242
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,522
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

243
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,859
People are believing more.

244
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,362
Let's meet at our usual time
next week.

245
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,631
I would rather
you didn't leave, Barry.

246
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,201
Did something happen?

247
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,236
Don't worry.

248
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,670
This was just a visit.

249
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,205
I'm doing much better.
I actually...

250
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,908
Don't you want
your sketches, Barry?

251
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,311
You're usually
very protective of them.

252
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,180
Yeah.

253
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,083
Thanks.

254
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:37,522
Uh... I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

255
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,358
Thanks for fighting for us,
Dr. Fletcher.

256
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,006
- Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.
- Welcome.

257
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,541
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

258
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:57,842
No, you'll be great.

259
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,010
I'll see you next week.

260
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,745
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

261
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,852
Man: In dj's exclusive

262
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,854
million-dollar
holiday bucks bonanza.

263
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,592
I don't know how you work
with those people.

264
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,562
- Hmm? What people?
- Your patients.

265
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:23,034
Oh, you can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

266
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,802
They always use their thumbs.

267
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,271
Oh.

268
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,374
W-well, we look at people
who've been shattered

269
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,711
and different as less than.

270
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,813
What if...

271
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,649
They're more than us?

272
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,151
What?

273
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,155
Do you believe them?

274
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,823
Your patients.

275
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,092
You know,
just between you and me.

276
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,660
Yes, I do.

277
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,795
Hmm.

278
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,030
Flick it. Flick it.

279
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,401
I don't believe it.

280
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,970
- No? No.
- No offense.

281
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,471
Woman: But when you call,

282
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,839
we'll send you a second
easyfeet... -

283
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,441
absolutely free.

284
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,942
- Just pay separate processing.
- Oh.

285
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,244
So that's two easyfeet...

286
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,079
Now, that... I need to buy that.

287
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,514
This young offer won't last...

288
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,317
Claire: He's back.

289
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,319
Marcia: There's a lady outside.

290
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,298
Woman:
Dennis, admit what you've done.

291
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,699
Dennis: Don't get upset.

292
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,036
Woman: Don't tell me.

293
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,071
I'm getting frightened.

294
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,376
I thought that you
had this under control.

295
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,611
Please tell me
it's not too late.

296
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,079
Dennis: The food is waiting.

297
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,553
Woman: Is she in that room?

298
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,956
- We're here!
- Help us!

299
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,624
- Marcia: We're in here!
- Woman: Dennis, what is this?

300
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,126
- How many are there?
- Dennis: N-n-no...

301
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,128
Don't go in there.
Don't go in there.

302
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,773
Don't worry.

303
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,244
I'll talk to him.

304
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,947
He listens to me.

305
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,691
He's not well.

306
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,893
He knows what you're here for.

307
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,495
He's not allowed to touch you.

308
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,264
He knows that.

309
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,601
Uh-uh.

310
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,837
Hmm?

311
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,929
Man: <i>Karen.</i>

312
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,097
Dr. Fletcher: <i>Joe.</i>

313
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,565
Joe: <i>They said you can't have</i>

314
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,934
<i>your own panel
at the national conference.</i>

315
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,903
<i>They conceded, however,</i>

316
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,539
<i>that you can be part
of the mood disorder panel.</i>

317
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,742
Dr. Fletcher:
<i>It's not a mood disorder.</i>

318
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,378
Joe: <i>Oh, I'm aware
of your beliefs, Karen.</i>

319
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,214
Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

320
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:26,584
Joe: <i>One of your arguments
is a dog?</i>

321
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:29,220
You submitted video
of a dog acting differently

322
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,155
to one of your patients
at different times?

323
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,890
It is more dramatic than that.

324
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,760
<i>They are what
they believe they are.</i>

325
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,796
<i>The brain has learned
to defend itself.</i>

326
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,965
Joe: <i>You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.</i>

327
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,567
Like... like they have
powers or something.

328
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,403
Karen, these are patients.

329
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,338
<i>They have been through trauma.</i>

330
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:54,545
And perhaps now, they are
capable of something we're not.

331
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,983
<i>We have brain scans now.</i>

332
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,987
<i>D.I.D. Patients have changed
their body chemistry</i>

333
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,922
<i>with their thoughts.</i>

334
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,827
He's just trying to scare us.

335
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:14,165
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

336
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,501
What was that line about...
"the food is waiting"?

337
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,136
Does everyone get
how wacked this is

338
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,205
and that we need to get
out of here now?

339
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,550
You... no.

340
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,286
Please keep your area neat.

341
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:36,954
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

342
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,457
To make it easy,
I've color-coded these.

343
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,692
Use the blue bottle
f-for the floor

344
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,830
and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

345
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,135
Uh...

346
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,756
Patricia has reminded me that...

347
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,658
I was sent to get you
for a reason.

348
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,561
That you are sacred food.

349
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,133
And I promise
not to bother you again.

350
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,348
Maybe he has a dog or something.

351
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,184
Think he's gonna feed us
to his dogs?

352
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,286
Claire: <i>Casey.</i>

353
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,456
Casey!

354
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,275
My name's Hedwig.

355
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,244
I have red socks.

356
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,820
He's on the move.

357
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,090
What?

358
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,363
He's... on...

359
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,000
The... move.

360
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,437
Who?

361
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:11,342
Someone's coming for you,
and you're not gonna like it.

362
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,310
You guys make noises
in your sleep.

363
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,712
Tell us.

364
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,648
I'm not supposed to say.

365
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,852
But he's done awful things
to people,

366
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,787
and he'll do awful things
to you.

367
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,189
I have blue socks, too.

368
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,857
We're his food?

369
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,731
How old are you?

370
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,266
Nine.

371
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,338
So you're not the guy
that took us?

372
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,208
No.

373
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,011
You're not the lady?

374
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,679
What are you, blind?

375
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,315
You don't know how they think?

376
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,384
No, they don't...

377
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,652
They don't tell me much.

378
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,754
I just ate a hot dog.

379
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,892
Could you help us, Hedwig?

380
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,362
No, I'm... I'm not even
supposed to be here.

381
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,064
I stole the light
from Mr. Dennis,

382
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,566
but he'll be back real soon,
and...

383
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,434
I can't steal
the light for too long,

384
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:13,203
or he'll know and get angry.

385
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,838
Et cetera.

386
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,242
See ya!

387
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,910
Casey: Wait.

388
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,682
We heard something.

389
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,286
We didn't understand it, but...

390
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,856
now we do.

391
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,294
Do you know what we heard?

392
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,430
What did you hear?

393
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,266
Come here.

394
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,136
I'll whisper it to you.

395
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,007
Okay.

396
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,687
Casey: This guy...

397
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,526
is coming for you.

398
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,265
You're a big fibber.

399
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,101
I never lie, Hedwig.

400
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,004
But... but Mr. Dennis...

401
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,641
He said that he followed
those two girls for four days

402
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,844
and that he knew
that they were the ones

403
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,380
that-that-that he would want.

404
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,150
When you're not around,

405
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,819
Dennis and the lady talk
about it.

406
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,622
They talk about how he wants
a boy this time.

407
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,324
They're going to give him you.

408
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,260
N-no, miss... miss Patricia,
she said...

409
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,429
She said she's not mad
at me anymore.

410
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,665
Sh-she sings to me sometimes.

411
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,668
I think miss Patricia
is still a little mad at you.

412
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,871
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

413
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,140
She thinks I'm stupid.

414
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:59,843
She... she thinks
I make silly mistakes.

415
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,311
Look at me.

416
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,281
We're like your babysitters.

417
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,353
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

418
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,857
We all need to get out of here.

419
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,627
You could show us the way out.

420
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:19,196
We could be gone before
anybody gets back, but...

421
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,398
We have to hurry, Hedwig.

422
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,767
We have to hurry
and get out of here.

423
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,205
Wait... wait a minute.

424
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,742
It took forever
to get this place safe

425
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,044
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

426
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,846
You can't get out of here.

427
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,649
- I have to blow my nose.
- No, no, wait. Please don't go!

428
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,086
Marcia: Who's coming?

429
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,489
This is seriously scary.

430
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,657
No one's coming.

431
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,629
Casey: He said something.

432
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,669
He said something
about making the room safe.

433
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,672
This is all new drywall.

434
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,409
What was unsafe?

435
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,145
Wait.

436
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,280
Wait, are we sure about this?

437
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,471
Casey, you were right.

438
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,473
There's something here.

439
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,809
He was covering up a way out.

440
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,744
Tell me if you see him.

441
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,349
Marcia:
Casey, tell us what you see.

442
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,691
Casey: He's here.

443
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,259
You can't let him in.

444
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,528
You can't let him in.
This is our one chance.

445
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,265
Casey: We're not gonna make it.

446
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,000
Claire: Yes, we are.

447
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,671
Claire: Oh, my...

448
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,543
What...?

449
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,512
Hey, what are you guys doing?

450
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,617
Hedwig: Hey.

451
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,221
Okay, okay, quit it.

452
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:00,023
Okay, guys?
Let me... can you let me in?

453
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,493
Give us a second.
We're changing.

454
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,775
Hedwig: What are you guys doing?

455
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,866
Let me in...

456
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,302
Guys, you're not being funny.

457
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,215
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

458
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,717
I'm gonna slap you
in your face and your...

459
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,318
Just give me as much time
as you can.

460
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,654
Hedwig: You're gonna get...

461
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:31,936
You're gonna get me into
trouble.

462
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,494
Guys...

463
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,264
Casey: Marcia.

464
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,864
Dennis: Hey!

465
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,071
Hey!

466
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,478
Dennis: Hey!

467
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,606
I thought I lost you.

468
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,978
Would you, uh...

469
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,114
Would you step outside, please?

470
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,490
You like to make fun of us,

471
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,059
but we're more powerful
than you think.

472
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,861
Step outside.

473
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,065
Dennis: Please.

474
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,542
Y-you shouldn't trick children.

475
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,779
That shows who you are.

476
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,720
Look at your sweater.
It's-it's ruined.

477
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,388
It's dirty.

478
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,259
Remove it.

479
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:55,092
I'm trying to be good.

480
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,143
You will not see
your friend again.

481
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,980
She will be kept separate.

482
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,718
And take off your skirt.

483
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,153
You take off your shirt.

484
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:25,355
Your clothes, you got all dirty
from the dust.

485

can have high cholesterol. One.

488
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,623
There have been cases
where one identity

489
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,525
is allergic to bee stings.

490
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,959
The others are not.

491
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,495
Are there moments
where two identities

492
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,931
can coexist at the same time?

493
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,500
There are times
when two identities

494
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,870
can take the light or the spot

495
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,806
or consciousness
at the same time.

496
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,043
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

497
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,646
And her left
and right hand were...

498
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,649
Were taking notes
in different handwritings

499
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:28,952
about separate things
at the same time.

500
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:32,689
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

501
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,493
As much as the difference
between you and me

502
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:40,697
and every person
in that auditorium.

503
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,499
The identities
have different iqs.

504
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,501
They have different
physical strengths.

505
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:48,171
One personality
is a Russian weightlifter

506
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:52,008
and can lift three times
his body weight.

507
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,511
Their ability to hyper-focus

508
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:58,915
and have different experiences
is astounding.

509
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,188
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

510
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,391
unlocked the potential
of the brain?

511
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,397
Is this the ultimate doorway

512
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:18,401
to all things we call unknown?

513
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:25,275
Is this where our sense
of the supernatural comes from?

514
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,925
It's about depth and, uh...

515
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,460
And-and curves and...

516
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,262
Hey, you see that one?

517
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,498
It's-it's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

518
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,837
Who are you?

519
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,143
Barry.

520
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,380
I don't think you are.

521
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,317
I've developed a nose
for sensing

522
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,954
whom I'm talking to
and whom I'm not.

523
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,722
Have I done something?

524
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:15,292
You've e-mailed
for an unscheduled appointment

525
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,160
two days in a row.

526
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,729
We... we're just
feeling overwhelmed.

527
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:23,133
I... garden-variety issues.

528
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:28,071
I think orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

529
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,840
had the light for a moment
and e-mailed me.

530
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,276
And you're here to tell me
everything's okay.

531
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,679
I e-mailed you.

532
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,050
May I talk to one of them,
please?

533
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,189
That can't happen.

534
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:49,326
I... told them that I wanted

535
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,661
to spend the session
with you today.

536
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,198
I'm going to ask again.

537
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,202
To whom am I speaking with now?

538
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:01,204
Dr. Fletcher...

539
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,306
It's Barry.

540
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,709
It doesn't seem like Barry.

541
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:08,445
Barry is an extroverted leader.

542
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,613
Yes, I am.

543
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,551
I'm gonna take
a professional guess

544
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:18,154
based on the description
of all 23 identities

545
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:23,026
that live in Kevin's body
that I've gotten from Barry.

546
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:29,032
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

547
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,903
But he's been banned
from the light

548
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,306
because, among other reasons,

549
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:40,043
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

550
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,979
which he himself knows is wrong

551
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,415
and has fought against
with little success.

552
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,385
I'm encouraged
we can finally meet.

553
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,187
And I've guessed this
because you've adjusted

554
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,590
the chocolate dish twice
since you came in here,

555
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,358
and I understand you have ocd.

556
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,527
Oh, now I see.

557
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,362
Now I see. That's clever.

558
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,364
That's clever,
but I'm-I'm-I'm not Dennis.

559
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,534
And you and Patricia
have been banned from the light

560
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,503
for quite a while now.

561
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:09,072
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

562
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,341
Patricia and Dennis
are very unstable.

563
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,942
I'm not Dennis.

564
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,178
Have you both taken charge now?

565
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,747
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

566
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,289
You must forgive me. It's...

567
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,292
My job is to challenge you.

568
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:33,196
And, as you must know by now,
I have plenty of opinions

569
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,632
about how everyone
should live their lives.

570
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:39,636
You... a-ask me something
about fashion.

571
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,571
I'll prove it, or I'll...

572
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,807
Look, look, look, look. Lindt.

573
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,777
Yeah, look.

574
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,881
You see? I'm not Dennis.

575
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,484
You want me to do
something else?

576
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,085
You got ice cream?

577
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,954
Oh, and this shirt's
a cotton blend anyway,

578
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,156
and the collar
is from three seasons ago.

579
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,559
Snood? I mean, come on.

580
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,780
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

581
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,182
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

582
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,185
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

583
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,454
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

584
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,756
Ah, this is wrong
on so many levels.

585
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,494
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

586
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,095
You're getting a little soft

587
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,630
- around the middle, jai.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,665
Dr. Fletcher:
The authors of Hooters

589
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,968
play on our incessant need
for fat

590
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,437
and man's incessant need
to be in the proximity

591
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,005
of augmented breasts.

592
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,275
It's like Henry v
ran a fast food franchise.

593
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:53,610
It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.

594
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,211
Right.

595
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,848
Jai: Hey, how'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

596
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,350
How can I say this, jai?

597
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,886
You're not the most meticulous
of people.

598
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,070
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

599
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,305
He walked right
through the trash.

600
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,840
No, jai.

601
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,842
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

602
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,777
That was an act.

603
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,315
What are you up to, Dennis?

604
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:36,185
Or is it Patricia
who's deciding things?

605
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,324
Marcia: <i>We're not gonna die.</i>

606
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:44,193
<i>Bad things happen.</i>

607
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>But not like this.</i>

608
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,666
Casey...

609
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,601
Talk to me.

610
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,040
We need to get to a window
or a door or something.

611
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,741
Don't you think?

612
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,759
The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

613
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,929
or can't outsmart this animal.

614
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,635
See, you didn't used to like
to come out here.

615
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,204
This is like
our family tradition, right?

616
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,641
Good shot, big brother.

617
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,476
Thank you, John.

618
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,219
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

619
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,225
Eat.

620
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,501
It's good?

621
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:01,237
It's got paprika in it.

622
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,006
Mmm.

623
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,175
I'm sorry.

624
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:12,215
I think I'll put
a pretty flower in your hair.

625
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,585
There we are.

626
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,595
That's to show
how important you are.

627
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,430
Come along.

628
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,365
We'll have a proper meal.

629
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,138
I understand, this must all seem

630
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,040
so unsatisfactory for you.

631
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:40,410
But we are doing
the best we can.

632
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,697
Good?

633
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,234
Mm-hmm?

634
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,338
Can Claire come eat with us?

635
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,840
No.

636
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,676
No, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

637
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:18,181
She almost ruined
our big reception.

638
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,183
Mmm.

639
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:27,223
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

640
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,092
Hmm.

641
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:31,461
I'll make you a second sandwich.

642
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,101
Do you know...

643
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:42,772
A family of lions
can eat 35 pounds a day?

644
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,211
A buck can lose 30%
of its weight

645
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:51,380
during mating season
chasing does around.

646
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,015
They're crepuscular, right?

647
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:57,286
Means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

648
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,689
Good for you.

649
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,773
It's crooked.

650
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,208
I... forgive me.

651
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:33,689
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

652
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,661
That's 12 less than a dog.

653
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:41,063
I thought that was a fun fact.

654
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,261
Casey: No!

655
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,965
Go to your room.

656
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,934
Shut the door. Do it now.

657
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,171
In the sun,

658
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:58,407
we will find our passion.

659
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,476
In the sun,

660
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,980
we will find our purpose.

661
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,487
You've always been protected.

662
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,890
You've never truly suffered.

663
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:17,026
And that's why we chose you.

664
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,228
You've always been asleep.

665
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,833
You never had a chance.

666
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,434
Shh.

667
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,108
You never had a chance.

668
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,076
Dennis: The dark-haired girl,

669
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,878
she's gonna be kept
in another closet.

670
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,747
I... you might as well know
at this point.

671
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,716
The beast...

672
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,119
He's coming for you.

673
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,055
All three of you,
you're gonna be kept separate.

674
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,890
Y-y-you've got...

675
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:51,227
You've got a... you've got
a crumb on your shirt.

676
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,429
You've got...

677
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,731
Please take it off.

678
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,868
Just...

679
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,870
Just take it off.

680
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,154
Hey.

681
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,590
Hedwig: It wasn't nice what
you said about miss Patricia.

682
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,492
You lied.

683
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,799
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

684
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,868
You guys lied to me,

685
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,871
made me scared, et cetera.

686
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,810
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

687
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,879
I like this shirt.

688
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,714
Thank you.

689
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,217
Do you know who Dennis
and miss Patricia are?

690
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,119
Casey: No.

691
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:29,325
See, every one of us
has to wait in a chair,

692
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:33,396
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

693
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:36,532
But Barry lost that power
because of me.

694
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,170
I can wish myself
into the light any time I want.

695
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:45,541
It's a... it's a special power.

696
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:50,846
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

697
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:52,515
That's why Dennis
and miss Patricia

698
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,850
said I could be with them.

699
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:58,854
Dennis and miss Patricia,
they believe in the beast

700
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:00,823
and what he can do.

701
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,861
Have you seen him?

702
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:09,665
The... beast?

703
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,367
N-no.

704
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,035
Can I kiss you?

705
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,704
I wanted to kiss the other girl
with the dark hair,

706
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,807
but she's in trouble.

707
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,913
So, do you want to?
I mean, I don't know much

708
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,549
- about kissing, though.
- Yeah.

709
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,387
Okay.

710
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:34,090
Uh, okay, here we go.

711
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:37,093
I'm so nervous.

712
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:40,029
One, two...

713
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,530
Three.

714
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,014
You might be pregnant now.

715
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,552
Am I a good kisser?

716
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,954
Yeah.

717
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,422
I like dancing.

718
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,057
Do you like dancing?

719
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:12,061
I-I... I like dancing
to my cd player in my room.

720
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:14,396
Kanye west is my main man.

721
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:17,933
I... we got my...
My cd player set up in my...

722
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,835
My room right-right...
Right next to my window.

723
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,570
I'm like...

724
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,242
I'm... mmm.

725
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:28,777
Mmm. Mmm.

726
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,980
- We gots the moves.
- Wow.

727
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,452
Hey, maybe I could
watch you dance

728
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:39,822
and listen to music with you.

729
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,958
No, my music's in my room.

730
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,027
Oh, right.

731
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,532
- Maybe...
- Yeah?

732
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:52,434
You could sneak me there.

733
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,870
Are you trying to trick me?

734
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,339
Et cetera?

735
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,208
I'll tell on you.

736
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,843
- Hey...
- I'm-I'm telling on you.

737
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,511
I'll tell you something.

738
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,947
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

739
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,348
- Mm-hmm.
- Like a test.

740
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,918
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

741
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:17,960
I get into trouble at school
on purpose.

742
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,967
So I can get sent to detention.

743
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,407
To get away...

744
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,542
From everyone.

745
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,450
So that I can be alone.

746
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:56,065
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

747
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,234
Okay.

748
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,735
But after Mr. Dennis

749
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,737
has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

750
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,706
I have to go.

751
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,107
He's got an appointment.

752
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:07,209
Wh-when I fall asleep,
one of the others

753
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:10,212
keeps trying to reach
the doctor lady to tell on us.

754
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:12,548
Barry: That pant, it's got
a... it's got a red lining.

755
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,417
You can see it in the long slit
down the side.

756
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,219
Dr. Fletcher:
We've been talking about

757
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,888
silk-and-wool blend
for 20 minutes.

758
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,558
Well, can I guess
that you e-mailed me

759
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,395
in the middle of the night
for an emergency session

760
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:29,064
due to garden-variety issues?

761
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,136
I was down, and I e-mailed you.

762
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,438
And I woke up,
and I feel better.

763
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,807
I-I feel better.

764
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,577
I had a thought.

765
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,412
Uh-uh.

766
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,914
I want to talk
about the incident at work.

767
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:47,483
It's okay, Barry.

768
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,118
You're safe.

769
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,887
I just want to bring
the details back.

770
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,857
We'll just talk
about the details.

771
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,560
A high school
from Camden, New Jersey

772
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:01,096
was on a field trip
at your place of work,

773
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:04,133
and two young ladies
came up to you.

774
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:07,102
And one took your hand

775
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:09,071
and put it under her shirt
on her breast,

776
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,739
and the second one did the same.

777
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,842
And then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

778
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,178
You surmised
that it might be on a dare.

779
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,014
You said they were 17 or 18.

780
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,116
You said it upset you for days.

781
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,751
It was just a teenage prank.

782
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,820
I-I get that now.

783
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,157
And see, that's my mistake.

784
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,095
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

785
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,597
Although you said you were fine

786
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,102
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

787
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:44,139
I believe that this
brought up issues

788
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,142
from when you
were a child and abused.

789
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:49,978
Sometimes another incident
of abuse

790
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,880
can cause suppressed
personalities

791
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,649
to take the light.

792
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:58,787
Dennis, if this is you,
I completely understand

793
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,956
why you felt the need

794
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,958
to take over
and protect the others.

795
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,226
Please.

796
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,061
Doctor, not this again.

797
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,797
The others told me
that you and Patricia

798
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,367
told the group about this beast.

799
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:14,870
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

800
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:19,475
that Dennis and Patricia
tell the others to scare them.

801
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,177
How this beast
can crawl on walls

802
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,848
like the best rock climbers,
using the slightest friction

803
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,183
and imperfections
to hold his body close

804
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:31,420
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

805
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:36,625
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

806
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,399
Do you really believe
the stories about the beast?

807
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,701
Hmm.

808
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:49,037
If this is you, Dennis,

809
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,007
I understand
why Kevin needs you.

810
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,677
You are strong and disciplined,

811
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,780
you are precise,

812
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:00,616
and you will not
be taken advantage of.

813
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,253
You can trust me.

814
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,957
For example,
I do have the ability

815
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,627
to use Kevin's full name
and bring him forward

816
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,262
as he has in the past.

817
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:16,598
But I wouldn't do that.

818
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,769
I know that that
would be chaos for all of you.

819
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,805
Everyone would grab the light.

820
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:26,575
I don't want
to hurt any of you that way.

821
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:28,811
You don't have to hide.

822
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,515
I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

823
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:39,388
You are not evil to me.

824
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,126
You were necessary.

825
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,699
Dennis, is that you?

826
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,583
They keep calling us
"the horde."

827
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,921
The others, you know?

828
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:17,593
Miss Patricia and I,
we are ridiculed.

829
00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:19,194
Now, we're not perfect,

830
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:22,664
but we don't deserve
to be ridiculed.

831
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,167
We're all struggling.

832
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,069
They have to admit that.

833
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,410
I am pleased to meet you,
Dennis.

834
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,580
You, too.

835
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,552
I assume you don't know
who e-mailed me

836
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:45,888
for the emergency sessions?

837
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,723
One of the others.

838
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,225
Are you in charge?

839
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah, we've taken charge.

840
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:55,163
We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

841
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,966
We're all here to protect Kevin.

842
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,701
He's very weak.

843
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:05,207
He doesn't know
how powerful we can be.

844
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,010
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

845
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:13,715
And how you and Patricia,

846
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:17,085
the other undesirable identity,
became aligned?

847
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,590
That's okay.

848
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:24,660
Do you still have
strong beliefs?

849
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,828
That depends on what.

850
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:30,699
This story of the beast.

851
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,407
One thing, Dennis,
that may comfort you

852
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,208
if you are confused

853
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,912
is that you've met
the other alters.

854
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,582
You're all in a room
in chairs, right?

855
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,917
Mmm, yeah.

856
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,852
But you never met the beast.

857
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:53,388
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

858
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,424
Because he resides
in the train yard,

859
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:56,959
as the story goes,

860
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,294
because Kevin's dad left
on a train.

861
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,731
But the fact is you and Patricia

862
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:04,967
have never met the beast.

863
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,935
Have you?

864
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,437
No.

865
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:12,274
That's because
he's not an alter.

866
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:15,344
He's not the 24th identity.

867
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,880
He's a fantasy.

868
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,135
Hurry up. Let's go.

869
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,037
Come on. It's time.

870
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,141
Shh.

871
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,013
Shh, shh.

872
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,691
Wow.

873
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,094
I know.

874
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,930
This is your cd player?

875
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:16,765
Yeah.

876
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,236
You don't like it?

877
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,739
- It's... it's not new or...
- No.

878
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,341
No, I'm just, uh...

879
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,544
I'm-I'm confused.

880
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:32,180
You said it was near a window.

881
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:33,915
Oh, that's here.

882
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,752
Watch.

883
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:38,253
Now it's closed.

884
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,022
Now it's open.

885
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,125
Now it's closed.

886
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:46,828
Now it's open.

887
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,773
Did you think
it was a real window?

888
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,112
So you could leave, et cetera?

889
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,051
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

890
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,453
I...

891
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:14,556
Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

892
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,258
Please.

893
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,226
Miss Patricia says that nobody

894
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,929
will make fun of me anymore
when the beast comes.

895
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:23,465
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am,

896
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,233
and then all
of the silly mistakes,

897
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,735
they won't matter anymore.

898
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:28,637
I-I-i think you should go
back to your room.

899
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,938
- No! Wait, please.
- Ow!

900
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,606
I want to hear
your kanye west albums.

901
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:32,908
- Ow.
- Show me your room.

902
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,476
Let's stay here.

903
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:37,112
- I'm sorry I asked to leave.
- I can't.

904
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:39,414
You said you wanted to show me
something cool, right? -No.

905
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,982
- Show me something.
- I don't want to.

906
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,717
- Please.
- I...

907
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,022
This!

908
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,430
Oh, wow.

909
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,200
It's nice.

910
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,435
It's not a toy.

911
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,142
This is real?

912
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:09,945
Yes.

913
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:12,013
It's Mr. Dennis's.

914
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,084
He doesn't even know I stole it.

915
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:19,588
Pretty cool, right?

916
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,791
You can listen
to people talking,

917
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:24,893
and they don't even know
you're listening.

918
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,830
Who does this talk to?

919
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,532
Don't touch that.

920
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,968
I just want to see if it works.

921
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,671
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

922
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:38,406
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

923
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,243
Man: Yeah, east gate here. What up?
- You gonna... shit.

924
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:47,215
Don't talk.

925
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,384
- Man: What up?
- Don't talk.

926
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:53,321
Hello?

927
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,023
- I'm gonna slap you!
- No!

928
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,658
Man: Who's this?

929
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,161
Hello. Hello.
My name is Casey Cooke.

930
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:01,663
I'm being held in a basement.

931
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,225
I've been abducted
with two other girls.

932
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,269
Man: Who the hell is this?

933
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,178
Man: Hello?

934
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,381
Casey Cooke.

935
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,548
I've been abducted.

936
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,918
You need to find me.

937
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,219
Man: Betty, is that you?

938
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:25,687
This isn't funny.

939
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:26,688
Casey: Call the police.

940
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:28,356
I must be near you.

941
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:31,059
I'm being held
in a basement or something.

942
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,394
Man: Okay, Betty, listen.

943
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,529
Tell Larry and fish I said hi.

944
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,932
Tell him I still got
his orange headphones and...

945
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:39,301
I don't know where I am.

946
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:40,969
There's a man here.

947
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,371
He abducted us,
and he's going to kill me.

948
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:55,317
I only have a few hours left.

949
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,822
Casey: Please.

950
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,225
Casey: I'm begging you.

951
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,996
Somebody save us.

952
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,898
Man: Wait, who is this?

953
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,867
And how did you get one
of our walkies?

954
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,244
Patricia: Put your hands
together in contrition.

955
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,781
In the sun,

956
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,883
we will find our passion.

957
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,520
In the sun,

958
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:38,026
we will find our purpose.

959
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,806
I read that on a sympathy card
in a supermarket.

960
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:55,677
It was for funerals,
but I thought it was beautiful.

961
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,753
Dennis will explain the meaning
of this evening.

962
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:42,524
The beast is a sentient creature

963
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:46,428
who represents the highest form
of human's evolution.

964
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:50,498
He believes the time
of ordinary humanity is over.

965
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,736
I hope this makes you feel calm.

966
01:07:56,405 --> 01:08:01,943
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

967
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:04,612
I was gonna ask
for your last shirt, but...

968
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,381
But I won't.

969
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,850
Because tonight
is a sacred night.

970
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,120
It's almost over.

971
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,396
Casey.

972
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:23,198
Come on.

973
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,233
Let's pretend
we're animals again.

974
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,968
Come on.

975
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,205
Casey, come on.

976
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,973
This is our game.

977
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,478
I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

978
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,900
Come on, take off your stuff.

979
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:00,635
Animals don't wear clothes.

980
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,070
Come on.

981
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,905
Yeah, yeah.

982
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:05,340
Come on.

983
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:32,433
Hey, Casey bear.

984
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,771
This isn't funny.

985
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,544
Is it loaded?

986
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,781
Casey...

987
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,751
I'm your uncle.

988
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,657
Stop it, Casey.

989
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,725
Put that gun down.

990
01:09:57,727 --> 01:10:00,328
I'm getting upset.

991
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,829
I'm about to get very angry.

992
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,498
Give me the gun!

993
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,207
Could've killed me.

994
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,975
Th-this place is closed.

995
01:11:20,977 --> 01:11:22,277
- No, it's-it's okay.
- You can't get in.

996
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:23,811
Dr. Fletcher: No, it's okay.

997
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,120
Hello, Dennis.

998
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:35,723
One of the others
e-mailed me just now.

999
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:39,060
- Is everything okay?
- We're fine.

1000
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:43,665
Dennis, Kevin is really lucky
to have you.

1001
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,800
You are quite extraordinary.

1002
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:49,070
I just don't want you guys
to get hurt.

1003
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,445
You think we're extraordinary?

1004
01:11:57,447 --> 01:12:00,415
I like you, Dennis.

1005
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,116
May I come in?

1006
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:03,985
And can we talk?

1007
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:09,757
I know you want
to tell me something.

1008
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,226
Why don't you just tell me?

1009
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,277
Dennis:
We're very similar, you and I.

1010
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:31,979
Both on the outside, looking in.

1011
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,881
Please, sit.

1012
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,517
I don't get many visitors.

1013
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,853
Uh... I'll get you some water.

1014
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,689
They got a proper quarters
for me in a building

1015
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,525
on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

1016
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,627
When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

1017
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:49,163
they said I could have it.

1018
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,632
Dr. Fletcher:
Who are you going to meet?

1019
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,308
Dennis: I want to talk about...

1020
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,845
Kevin and...

1021
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:07,215
What his mother did to him.

1022
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:09,884
I remember it all.

1023
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,720
I'm happy
you're suddenly so open.

1024
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,390
Kevin's mother
had rather malevolent ways

1025
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,159
of punishing a three-year-old.

1026
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:20,061
Is that when you arrived
in the light?

1027
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,763
Yeah.

1028
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,166
The one way
to avoid her attention

1029
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:29,504
was to keep everything
spotless, everything perfect.

1030
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,841
I know you're coming
from good intentions, Dennis,

1031
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:36,911
but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

1032
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:41,449
I've lost so many patients
into the system.

1033
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,950
I want you to know, Dennis,

1034
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:45,787
I will never stop fighting
for you.

1035
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:49,590
My patients
have become my family.

1036
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,925
They are what I've chosen

1037
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,261
instead of
a more traditional path.

1038
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:56,731
I hope you feel you can be
truly honest with me.

1039
01:13:56,733 --> 01:14:00,802
I actually want
to be honest with you.

1040
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,371
I lied before.

1041
01:14:03,373 --> 01:14:07,141
When you asked if I'd ever
met the beast,

1042
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:09,143
I said no.

1043
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:11,312
That really isn't true.

1044
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,617
You wrote about a woman
in Germany

1045
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,320
who'd been blind for ten years.

1046
01:14:19,322 --> 01:14:23,224
And then it was discovered
that she had d.I.D.

1047
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:27,228
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

1048
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,932
And you speculated
that her optical nerves

1049
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:34,569
regenerated
because of her beliefs.

1050
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,771
What are you trying to say?

1051
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:38,773
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

1052
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:41,409
that all of us
would find hard to believe.

1053
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:44,679
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

1054
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,647
You protect the broken.

1055
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,349
When you said that you thought

1056
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:50,918
this situation
was extraordinary,

1057
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,254
I knew you can maybe understand.

1058
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:54,922
Understand what?

1059
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:57,925
The beast...

1060
01:14:57,927 --> 01:15:00,428
Is real.

1061
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,029
He's just emerged.

1062
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:05,500
You were right about everything.

1063
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,568
What does he look like?

1064
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,539
He's much bigger than I am,

1065
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:14,709
and I'm the biggest
of all of us.

1066
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,444
He's tall.

1067
01:15:16,446 --> 01:15:18,946
He's very muscular.

1068
01:15:18,948 --> 01:15:21,282
And he's got
a long mane of hair,

1069
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:25,887
and his fingers are...
Are twice the length of ours.

1070
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:30,024
He believes
we are extraordinary.

1071
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:35,229
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

1072
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,934
You say the same things.

1073
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,305
He's on the move.

1074
01:15:44,307 --> 01:15:47,208
What does that mean?

1075
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,977
I don't understand.

1076
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:53,247
He can't be real.

1077
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:57,552
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1078
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:03,024
And there's another whole part
of the story, isn't there?

1079
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:06,327
About the eating
of the impure young?

1080
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:09,597
What does "impure" even mean?

1081
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,999
Well, we should discuss that

1082
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,168
so that you can
understand fully.

1083
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,103
Understand what?

1084
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,972
Sometimes...

1085
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,342
there's just no other way.

1086
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,480
Who are you going to meet?

1087
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,618
Him.

1088
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,524
You know what?

1089
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:39,527
I would love to take notes
on all of this.

1090
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:43,731
We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

1091
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:45,032
Really?

1092
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,901
You're okay with this?

1093
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:50,471
This has been so wonderful...
You being so open.

1094
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:52,807
I can see that you feel
very empowered

1095
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,375
by the philosophies
of the beast.

1096
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,711
- I...
- I'm going to go now.

1097
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:58,112
I knew you would understand.

1098
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,514
I'll see you.

1099
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,795
Dr. Fletcher: Would you mind...

1100
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,899
if I used your bathroom?

1101
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,170
No.

1102
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:27,341
It's down the hall,
near the stairs, on your left.

1103
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,081
Dennis: How we doing?

1104
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,983
I'm okay.

1105
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:17,124
Are you real?

1106
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,063
Marcia: Who is it?

1107
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:23,397
Help me.

1108
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:28,035
- Help me.
- Marcia: Is someone there?

1109
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,337
- Oh, my...
- Claire: Help me.

1110
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:32,306
Please help me.

1111
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,844
They will never reach
their potential.

1112
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:38,379
They don't really matter.

1113
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,381
Listen to me, Dennis.

1114
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,751
I should've listened better.

1115
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:46,554
I should've understood
what you're capable of,

1116
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,222
how powerful you are.

1117
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,758
Patricia says
your way isn't working.

1118
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,194
The world will understand now.

1119
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:57,998
Dennis,
this is an egregious wrong.

1120
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,001
These young women are suffering.

1121
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,436
This is a crime.

1122
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,939
I can't let you keep them here.

1123
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,440
We've gotta stop this.

1124
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:08,943
This identity is monstrous.

1125
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:10,845
I'm really sad
you feel this way.

1126
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,080
Can't you see? He is formed

1127
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,249
because of your time
in this place.

1128
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,412
Claire: There's a lady.

1129
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,214
Someone's here.

1130
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,885
We need to get out
of these rooms.

1131
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,388
Is there anything in your room?

1132
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,656
Anything that we could use?

1133
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,966
Claire: There's nothing in here.

1134
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:09,970
There's a hanger.

1135
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,497
Thank you, Dennis.

1136
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:38,599
Here you go, sir.

1137
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,886
It sounded like
there were slide bolts

1138
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,222
on the outside of our doors.

1139
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,891
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1140
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,029
Claire: Stay calm.

1141
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:16,430
We're getting out of here.

1142
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,965
We're gonna get Casey.

1143
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:21,168
Claire: You can do this, marcia.

1144
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,572
With regard
to chahamana's defeat

1145
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,407
and Muhammad of ghor's conquests

1146
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:03,410
between 1192 and 1200,

1147
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:07,748
I would liken it
to Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1148
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,185
that prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

1149
01:23:11,187 --> 01:23:15,589
Like prithviraj's defiance,

1150
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:19,193
we should stand up
to the horde's advances.

1151
01:23:19,195 --> 01:23:21,628
In the face
of their scare tactics,

1152
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,098
we should show...

1153
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,633
I hate my Insulin shots.

1154
01:23:26,635 --> 01:23:29,636
No one else around here
has to take them.

1155
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,773
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1156
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:35,342
All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

1157
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,644
say that we're the same person.

1158
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:41,048
Just personalities, huh?

1159
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,883
How do you explain
I'm the only one

1160
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,685
that needs these,
you motherfu...

1161
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,626
Barry: I'm wearing cargo pants
from the '90s.

1162
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:55,029
And a scarf.

1163
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,297
If it wasn't for the Varvatos
t-shirt underneath,

1164
01:23:57,299 --> 01:23:59,900
I'd be a mess.

1165
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:03,003
I got no taste
for things right now.

1166
01:24:03,005 --> 01:24:07,307
<i>I'm worried sick.</i>

1167
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:11,211
<i>I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.</i>

1168
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,880
I decide who gets the light,
right?

1169
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:15,816
I think someone
is stealing the light from me

1170
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,352
when I'm not aware.

1171
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:22,022
<i>The horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.</i>

1172
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:25,025
<i>I don't know where
they're going with this,</i>

1173
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:27,061
<i>but it scares me.</i>

1174
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:30,491
Claire: Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

1175
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,760
On the couch,

1176
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:36,730
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

1177
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:49,476
Jesus. It's an animal!

1178
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:52,579
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1179
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:34,781
K-Kevin. Kevin.

1180
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,518
Kev... kev...

1181
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,046
Thank you...

1182
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:10,050
For helping us till now.

1183
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,890
Kev... kev...

1184
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,716
Barry: <i>I guess I should tell.</i>

1185
01:29:15,718 --> 01:29:17,317
<i>Dr. Fletcher about this, but...</i>

1186
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:19,886
She'll worry.

1187
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:21,955
She's such a sweet woman.

1188
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:27,361
I believe I will go
for a nice walk

1189
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:31,698
and think this through
organizationally.

1190
01:29:34,036 --> 01:29:38,338
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1191
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,740
Ciao.

1192
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,489
Claire.

1193
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:06,159
Marcia.

1194
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:30,917
Claire.

1195
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:32,486
Claire, let's go.

1196
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:45,992
Casey: "Kevin Wendell crumb."

1197
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,853
Casey: Kevin Wendell crumb?

1198
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:19,960
Kevin Wendell crumb.

1199
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,365
Kevin Wendell crumb!

1200
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:39,012
Woman: <i>Kevin Wendell crumb.</i>

1201
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,449
Kevin Wendell crumb...

1202
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:44,517
You made a mess.

1203
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:47,787
Come out here.

1204
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:51,558
Kevin Wendell crumb!

1205
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,226
You made a mess!

1206
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:54,694
Get out here!

1207
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,256
Who are you?

1208
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:25,191
Wh-what's happening?

1209
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:29,329
Something horrible.

1210
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,166
What'd I do?

1211
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:36,002
Did I hurt you?

1212
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:47,681
Dr. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher.

1213
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,451
Who did that?

1214
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,121
You did.

1215
01:34:55,123 --> 01:34:57,557
I swear I was on a bus.

1216
01:34:57,559 --> 01:34:59,893
I don't remember anything
after that.

1217
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:02,295
I...

1218
01:35:02,297 --> 01:35:06,232
This is still
September 18, 2014, right?

1219
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,144
There's a shotgun I bought.

1220
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:22,015
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1221
01:35:22,017 --> 01:35:23,917
The shells are in
my uniform closet

1222
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:25,752
out in the service hall.

1223
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,123
Kill me.

1224
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,228
Then kill me.

1225
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:42,602
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

1226
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:43,670
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1227
01:35:43,672 --> 01:35:45,004
He can't handle reality.

1228
01:35:45,006 --> 01:35:46,539
My name is Jade.

1229
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,908
Has Dr. Fletcher
been getting our e-mails?

1230
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,577
This is what we have to do.
We can...

1231
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,513
As in 1008,

1232
01:35:53,515 --> 01:35:57,517
when anandapala suffered the
shahis' most crushing defeat

1233
01:35:57,519 --> 01:36:01,020
and mahmud overran the entirety
of the punjab region,

1234
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:03,723
taking the famed temple
of kangra,

1235
01:36:03,725 --> 01:36:06,559
we have been wronged
by this alliance,

1236
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:09,763
this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

1237
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:12,565
Their actions
do not represent us.

1238
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:15,068
They... are every...

1239
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:18,037
Everybody, just take a minute!

1240
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:20,774
Oh, baby girl.

1241
01:36:20,776 --> 01:36:22,976
They've been stealing control
of the light from me,

1242
01:36:22,978 --> 01:36:25,712
but the group are gonna work
through this.

1243
01:36:25,714 --> 01:36:27,981
Honey, my name is Barry.

1244
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:40,560
Hedwig: You shouldn't have used
the walkie-talkies.

1245
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,732
They almost caught us.

1246
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,935
Stop it, Hedwig.

1247
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:51,504
Oh, they were right.
Look at you.

1248
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:53,506
You're so frightened of us.

1249
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:59,312
Dennis and miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1250
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:02,182
I'm gonna give the light
to them now.

1251
01:37:02,184 --> 01:37:06,853
No one's allowed
to make fun of me anymore.

1252
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:21,434
Patricia: Thank you, Hedwig.

1253
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,340
Everything's fine now.

1254
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:29,442
Kevin Wendell crumb.

1255
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,346
Kevin is asleep.

1256
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:35,515
We've made him sleep far away.

1257
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:38,051
You can call his name
all you like, dear, but...

1258
01:37:38,053 --> 01:37:40,987
He's not going to hear you.

1259
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:44,324
The beast has shared
with us his dream

1260
01:37:44,326 --> 01:37:47,627
of a larger group
to sustain him.

1261
01:37:47,629 --> 01:37:49,229
No.

1262
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:52,899
Ten to twelve unworthy young
next time.

1263
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:54,667
No. No...

1264
01:37:54,669 --> 01:37:59,005
This is just the start.

1265
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:03,409
No. No.

1266
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:19,492
Okay. Okay.

1267
01:39:18,887 --> 01:39:20,186
Let go!

1268
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:57,323
Help!

1269
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:01,761
No! No!

1270
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:08,434
No.

1271
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:26,152
It runs in our family.

1272
01:40:26,154 --> 01:40:28,621
My daddy died, too.

1273
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:31,958
Same way... heart attack.

1274
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,129
But you don't need to worry.

1275
01:40:36,131 --> 01:40:38,364
I'm going to take care of you.

1276
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:43,669
Now...

1277
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,806
You won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

1278
01:40:46,808 --> 01:40:49,776
John: <i>I know you won't, sweetie.</i>

1279
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:14,767
Beast: We are glorious!

1280
01:41:14,769 --> 01:41:19,005
We will no longer be afraid!

1281
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:32,518
Only through pain...

1282
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,987
Can you achieve your greatness!

1283
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:55,808
The impure are the untouched,

1284
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:59,812
the unburned, the unslain.

1285
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:05,651
Those who have not been torn

1286
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:08,921
have no value in themselves

1287
01:42:08,923 --> 01:42:13,226
and no place in this world.

1288
01:42:13,228 --> 01:42:16,462
They are asleep.

1289
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:22,168
All right...

1290
01:42:37,952 --> 01:42:41,654
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1291
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:46,526
Can't you see I am not human?

1292
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:50,196
Kevin is a man.

1293
01:42:50,198 --> 01:42:52,431
I am much more.

1294
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:27,660
You... y-you are
different from the rest.

1295
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:42,575
Your heart is pure.

1296
01:44:42,577 --> 01:44:46,012
Rejoice!

1297
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:54,954
The broken are the more evolved.

1298
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:03,529
Rejoice.

1299
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:06,692
What in the name
of Mary and Joseph?

1300
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:10,096
What are you doing in this area?

1301
01:46:50,872 --> 01:46:53,339
Just keep walking, honey.

1302
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:55,307
They won't do nothing.

1303
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:33,646
Vince, call the police.

1304
01:47:33,648 --> 01:47:37,316
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1305
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:59,905
Okay.

1306
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:04,210
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1307
01:48:45,285 --> 01:48:48,020
Man: Third deceased...
Name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1308
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,289
Still trying
to locate the family.

1309
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:09,909
Woman:
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1310
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:22,054
Your uncle's here.

1311
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:25,257
You ready to go?

1312
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,675
Dennis: It didn't go through.

1313
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:25,551
We are what we believe we are.

1314
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:33,492
Hedwig: Holy shit.

1315
01:50:33,494 --> 01:50:36,095
This is so cool!

1316
01:50:36,097 --> 01:50:39,565
Ah!

1317
01:50:39,567 --> 01:50:42,701
They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

1318
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:46,639
Dennis: They're gonna have to.

1319
01:50:49,175 --> 01:50:51,377
Hedwig: So what do we do now?

1320
01:50:54,814 --> 01:50:56,582
Patricia: We trust in him.

1321
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:00,686
He'll protect us.

1322
01:51:01,955 --> 01:51:03,922
Look...

1323
01:51:03,924 --> 01:51:05,858
At what he can do.

1324
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:11,430
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1325
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:23,208
Female reporter: <i>The suspected
murderer Kevin crumb</i>

1326
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:27,279
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder d.I.D.

1327
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:30,783
The rumors coming out of the
scene are almost unbelievable.

1328
01:51:30,785 --> 01:51:34,386
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1329
01:51:34,388 --> 01:51:37,489
after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

1330
01:51:37,491 --> 01:51:40,292
Reports even indicate one
of his personalities

1331
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:42,394
is an amalgam
of the various animals

1332
01:51:42,396 --> 01:51:45,064
in the Philadelphia zoo
where he worked.

1333
01:51:45,066 --> 01:51:46,565
The press is already referring

1334
01:51:46,567 --> 01:51:48,867
to the alleged attacker
by a dark name,

1335
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,537
leaked by a source
close to the case.

1336
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:53,572
Because of his many
personalities,

1337
01:51:53,574 --> 01:51:56,108
he is being called "the horde."

1338
01:51:57,677 --> 01:51:59,745
This is like that crazy guy
in the wheelchair

1339
01:51:59,747 --> 01:52:02,414
that they put away 15 years ago.

1340
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:05,884
And they gave him
a funny name, too.

1341
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,986
What was it?

1342
01:52:07,988 --> 01:52:09,421
Mr. glass.

1343
01:52:09,423 --> 01:52:11,123
Oh, yeah.
