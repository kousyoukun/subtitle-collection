1
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:55,894
Her name was Odessa Cotter.

2
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:58,163
I called her Dessie.

3
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:02,391
As best as anyone knows, she was
the first woman to rock me to sleep.

4
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:08,024
There wasn't anything
extraordinary about her, but,

5
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,398
I guess there's
always somethin'...

6
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:14,076
extraordinary about
someone who changes...

7
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,820
and then changes
those around her.

8
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,562
That's me.

9
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,490
- Morning, Mary Catherine.
- I was only seven years old.

10
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,161
Excuse me, Odessa.
I didn't mean to run you down.

11
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,777
- Is that a car or a boat?
- It's a piece of sausage.

12
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,199
- You tell her, sweetness. - Odessa,
we're having a cocktail party tonight,

13
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,334
so I'm sending you to Oak Park
with Mary Catherine...

14
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:36,773
- just as soon as Claudia gets here.
- Yes, ma'am.

15
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,339
Honey.

16
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:45,280
- Look what you did. Boop. Gotcha.
- Has anyone seen my racket?

17
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:47,377
- Oh, I know where it is.
- Bye-bye.

18
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,150
- Bye.
- Oh, my clubs.

19
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:53,338
- I wanna cut something.
- Not today, young lady.

20
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,124
Ah, your hands are sticky.

21
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,823
- Oh, she's been beside herself for weeks.
- That's 'cause you never discipline her.

22
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,263
- Where are you going?
- One guess, Sherlock.

23
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,399
- Trey and I are playing at the club.
- Oh, well.

24
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:06,824
- I wanna see Trey's car.
- Here are my clubs, honey.

25
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:09,299
- If you can get 'em to the pro shop.
- I'm givin' a party tonight.

26
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,773
Catch Sara.
She's on her way to the club.

27
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,175
I can't play with the grips like that.
Thank you, sweetie.

28
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,778
- I'll see you at 6:00, huh?
- See you at 6:00.

29
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:51,234
Odessa, just have 'em
waitin' out here at 3:00.

30
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:54,454
- I should be back from the beauty parlor
and Junior League by then. - Yes, ma'am.

31
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,970
- You be good, Mary Catherine.
- I will.

32
00:04:58,157 --> 00:04:59,924
Bye!

33
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:07,365
Feel a tickle comin'.

34
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,135
Go on.

35
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,278
Y'all come on now.
It's time to eat.

36
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:48,292
Hey!

37
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:56,148
Hey!

38
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,623
What you doin' here?

39
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:08,529
Can't you hear me, nigger?
What are you doin' in this park?

40
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:10,892
Just takin' care of
Mrs. Thompson's...

41
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,493
Don't give me any of
that mealy-mouthed crap!

42
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,151
Now, this park
is whites only,

43
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:19,836
and that means niggers like you best
answer with "yes, sir" when spoken to.

44
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,316
I don't care who
you're takin' care of!

45
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:28,059
You don't understand
nothin', do you?

46
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:33,588
Go on. Get your stuff together
and get on out of here!

47
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,498
Come on, Mary Catherine.
Get your friends. We got to go.

48
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,906
I never heard such
nonsense in all my life.

49
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,937
Let me just see about this.

50
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,098
Hello. Could I speak to
Commissioner Sellers, please?

51
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,461
Mrs. Norman Thompson.

52
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,240
Well, would you tell
Clyde Sellers...

53
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,044
that one of his policemen threw my
nine-year-old daughter out of Oak Park?

54
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,012
He knows who I am.

55
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,688
- I really appreciate you coming by
this afternoon. - Oh, not at all, ma'am.

56
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,425
- I'm just sorry about the
misunderstanding. - Thank you.

57
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:51,280
Mrs. Cotter, I would like to apologize
on behalf of myself,

58
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:52,929
the police department,

59
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:56,130
and the city of Montgomery for
what happened today in Oak Park.

60
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,315
Hope y'all come back to
the park someday soon.

61
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,518
I hope I didn't cause you too
much trouble, Mrs. Thompson.

62
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,588
I'm sorry if I embarrassed your
maid in front of the children.

63
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,166
Thank you.

64
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:13,293
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

65
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,463
I regret that this happened
in the first place.

66
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:18,296
- Well, send the commissioner my best.
- I will, ma'am.

67
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,569
Shh.

68
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,658
Y'all come on inside.

69
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:45,172
Alabama's got a small line,
but they're agile.

70
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:47,502
Oh, my God.

71
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,218
How's my little Boo-Boo?

72
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,201
Tunker's here.

73
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,603
Tunker.
Tunker, welcome.

74
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:57,180
- Hello, Norman.
- I'm glad you could make it.

75
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,474
Yeah.
It's a nice-lookin' party here.

76
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:01,949
- Yeah. We try. We do.
- Hello, Miriam.

77
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,138
- That a bartender?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:09,634
- Does I has to tip him?
- Well, being you're my baby brother,

79
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,305
why don't we just say that the
drinks are two bucks, all inclusive.

80
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,491
Thanks. Thanks. Hey, y'all lucky
to get a bartender at all.

81
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:18,594
The niggers are all
movin' to Philadelphia.

82
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,375
- Why's that? - 'Cause they hear
there ain't no work in Philadelphia.

83
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,603
- I don't get it.
- Honey, you never get jokes.

84
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,513
What?

85
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,994
Tunker, don't be so loud
this close to the bar.

86
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,964
- Oh, he didn't hear me.
- You better be careful.

87
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,820
She'll have you out there
apologizin' to him.

88
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,879
What's this?

89
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:50,410
- Nothin'. It was just somethin' stupid,
that's all. - I'd like to know.

90
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,716
Go on.
Tell him.

91
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,942
Some young policeman
threw our maid out of Oak Park.

92
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,262
Mary Catherine and her friends were
right there, and he was extremely rude.

93
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:02,397
So I called up Clyde Sellers,
and he had him come out and apologize.

94
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,399
Well, what were you doing sending
your maid into that park anyway?

95
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,345
Tunker, she was takin'
care of the children.

96
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,765
But you shouldn't have the poor fellow come
out and apologize to a nigger, Miriam.

97
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,868
That's plain old wrong.

98
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,705
Tunker, it's not like she was parading
her own children around the park,

99
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,239
for heaven's sakes.

100
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,275
And you know,
I did grow up with a maid,

101
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:24,311
and I've had them all my life, and I know
what's right and I know what's wrong.

102
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:27,683
And I will not have my judgment impugned
by some wet-behind-the-ears patrolman...

103
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:29,118
or by you.

104
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Excuse me.

105
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:35,392
Oh, hi, Liz.
How are you?

106
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:38,933
She's a hellcat, Norman.
I always thought so.

107
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,934
<i>Mr. Sandman</i>

108
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,770
<i>Bring me a dream</i>

109
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,641
<i>Make him the cutest
that I've ever seen</i>

110
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,076
My world was a bubble
when I was seven.

111
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,213
Wars could have been going on
outside our front door,

112
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,914
and I would have been
all the happier.

113
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,816
Thank you, darling.

114
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:05,091
- In a way, a war was about
to start in Montgomery. - Hey!

115
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,160
- A war of wills...
- Give that back!

116
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:09,897
in the cradle of
the Confederacy.

117
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,864
- It began on a crisp December day.
- Hey!

118
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,138
Give it back!

119
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,450
Give it back.

120
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,511
Give it back!

121
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:29,718
Mama!
Where you at?

122
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,221
What you comin' in here
screamin' like a banshee about?

123
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,992
A lady gave these out
to everybody after school.

124
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,761
I'll read it to you.

125
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,931
"This is for...

126
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,333
Monday the"...

127
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,271
Boy, you can't read. We're gonna
die of consumption waitin' for you.

128
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,775
- Can so! Give it back! - Franklin, give
him the paper and let him read it.

129
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,813
Watch it.

130
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,251
"Another Negro woman has
been arrested and thrown in jail

131
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:02,823
because she refused to get up
out of her seat on the bus...

132
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,425
for a white person
to sit down.

133
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:08,095
It is the second time
since the Colvin case...

134
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:12,047
that a Negro woman has been
arrested for the same thing.

135
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,203
This has to be stopped. "

136
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,271
"We're therefore asking
every Negro...

137
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:20,688
to stay off the buses Monday
in protest of the arrest and trial.

138
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:25,207
Don't ride the buses to work,
to town, to school...

139
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:26,949
or anywhere on Monday.

140
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,219
You can afford to stay
out of school for one day,

141
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,454
if you have no other
way to go except by bus.

142
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:35,761
You can also afford to stay
out of town for one day.

143
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,996
If you work,
take a cab or walk.

144
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,433
- Please, children"...
- I heard about that last night.

145
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:44,068
- That woman was Miss Parks.
- Rosa Parks?

146
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,272
Yep. They had to bail her out
of jail for sittin' in the bus.

147
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,977
- See, the problem is...
- I'll tell you what the problem is.

148
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,114
I ain't never seen people get so
worked up over a piece of paper.

149
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,016
- I think it's dumb.
- I think you're dumb!

150
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:59,787
- Shut up, Franklin.
- I bet nobody rides the bus.

151
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:03,514
- Franklin, sit up.
- Well, if that don't get all.

152
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:07,561
Here we are without a car,
and somebody tellin' us not to ride the bus?

153
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:10,198
Theodore and Franklin ready
to follow along like lap dogs.

154
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,801
If that ain't cuttin' your
nose off to spite your face.

155
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:16,906
She's mad 'cause she ride the bus
out to Newtown on Saturday,

156
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:20,251
- to see that boy she think like her.
- Shut up.

157
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,925
I'm tired of hangin' my head
in the shadow of crackers.

158
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,028
I wanna ride at the
front of the bus.

159
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:44,162
Lord, we thank you for this
food we're about to receive.

160
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:49,007
Watch over our
souls tonight...

161
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:51,969
and help us live your
word tomorrow.

162
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,098
In Jesus' name, amen.

163
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,923
Right around the fence.

164
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,956
That bus is as empty
as my grave.

165
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,992
It starts to rain,
people get on that bus.

166
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,628
No, they won't,
not unless they stupid as you are.

167
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,567
Mama! If we can't ride the bus,
then do we have to go to school?

168
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,429
Boy, you ain't never
took the bus in your life.

169
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:16,606
Now get in there and help
me clean off that table.

170
00:15:25,017 --> 00:15:27,052
Hello, Mrs. Thompson?

171
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:30,088
This is Odessa.

172
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,491
Mrs. Thompson, I think I'm gonna
be awfully late to work today.

173
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:38,063
Odessa, this is Monday. You know
how badly I need you on Monday.

174
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:42,234
Yes, I know, Mrs. Thompson,
but, as I said, I...

175
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:47,007
Well, this wouldn't have anything to do
with the boycott business, would it?

176
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:51,411
Well, Mrs. Thompson, the buses usually
come past my house pretty near full,

177
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,981
but today there ain't a soul
on 'em except the driver,

178
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,084
and this last one had
a police car following it,

179
00:15:56,086 --> 00:16:00,646
- so, ma'am, I ain't likely to
ride the bus today. - Hmm.

180
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,427
Well, I was goin' to Curb Market
this mornin' anyway.

181
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:09,132
- You live down on Cobb Street,
don't you? - Yes, ma'am.

182
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,554
Well, then I'll meet
you on the corner of

183
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,808
Court and Mildred
in about an hour.

184
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:16,105
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

185
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,887
Odessa, I'm not gonna be
able to carry you home.

186
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:17,108
Mama needs help with Shelly's dinner,
so I'm gonna have to go over later.

187
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,534
Yes, ma'am. Go and show your
mama how you're helpin'.

188
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,027
Oh.
That's sweet.

189
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:50,579
Good evening, ma'am.

190
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,284
Whose turn is it
to do the dishes?

191
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,731
- Theodore's.
- No, it ain't mine.

192
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:11,569
- Well, who did 'em last night? - I did 'em.
It's Theodore and Franklin's turn.

193
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,205
You got a choice: clean the
dishes or clean the outhouse.

194
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,875
- Mama's home!
- Good. She can do the dishes.

195
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:20,142
After you called, we waited
for you to come home, Mama.

196
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,596
- We just ate while we waited.
- He's been waiting all night to say that.

197
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:24,948
- Can I fetch you some supper? - Theodore
and Franklin keep makin' fun of my cookin',

198
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,590
and Daddy won't
get them to stop.

199
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,345
Still comin' to that mass meetin'?
It's in 15 minutes.

200
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,697
- Selma, get your coat.
- What?

201
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,594
Listen to a bunch of preachers talkin' 'bout
us plain folks wearin' out our shoes today

202
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,883
while they drove around
in their cars?

203
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:39,867
No, thank you. I put in my time at church
on Sunday morning, not Monday night.

204
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,870
- Can I go, and Selma watch Franklin?
- I wanna go too!

205
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,673
"I wanna go too!"

206
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:49,119
Theodore gets to
have all the fun.

207
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:03,294
- I think she cut up the cleanest
parts and fried it. - Shut up, fool.

208
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:07,061
Mom, I'm sorry about supper.
I think it got worse as it got cold.

209
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,634
Just let me get my shoes off.
I'll be ready in a minute.

210
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:14,606
Mmm. I got to give that girl
some cookin' lessons.

211
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:19,845
- Mama, your feet. - I just got to get
me some shoes that fit, that's all.

212
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,393
I'll get up and change my dress.
I'll be ready in a minute.

213
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:27,063
Don't wanna be late.
Might not get a seat.

214
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:30,489
You quit that horsin' around
in my... Get off my bed!

215
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,695
- Get in there.
- Daddy?

216
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:37,532
You can't let her walk
down to the church.

217
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:41,236
Don't worry about it.
It'll make her feel better to go.

218
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:43,059
It really will.

219
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:53,569
The only weapon that we have in our
hands this evening is the weapon of protest.

220
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:00,926
And we are not wrong.

221
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:04,613
We are not wrong
in what we are doing.

222
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:09,913
If we are wrong, the supreme
court of this nation is wrong.

223
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,675
If we are wrong,

224
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:20,096
the Constitution of
the United States is wrong.

225
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,977
If we are wrong,
God Almighty is wrong.

226
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:36,798
And we are determined here in
Montgomery, to work and fight,

227
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,668
until justice runs
down like water,

228
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,858
and righteousness
like a mighty stream.

229
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:32,496
Well, now, ain't you all
full of the day?

230
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,083
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

231
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,307
Course, when I got up
this morning, I like to die.

232
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:40,028
Once I started movin' around,
I felt pretty good.

233
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:44,173
- You walked all of that way
across town? - Yes, ma'am.

234
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,255
- Ooh, that's a long walk, woman.
- Yes, indeedy.

235
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:53,817
You know, you come into town
and go to one of the mass meetings.

236
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,953
You feel like you could
walk forever too.

237
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:58,961
Mmm, I gots me a ride to work,
and I sleep through it most of the time.

238
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:00,848
I don't need no inspiration.

239
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,590
Odessa.

240
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,197
Now, I hear that gettin' up early,
movin' around,

241
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:27,576
does a soul good
in the mornin'.

242
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:31,814
I just wonder what it does
for 'em in the afternoon.

243
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:39,667
<i>Pass me not,
O gentle savior</i>

244
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:45,031
<i>Hear my humble cry</i>

245
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:50,247
<i>While on others
thou art calling</i>

246
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,243
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

247
00:22:55,473 --> 00:23:00,759
<i>O savior, savior</i>

248
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:06,354
<i>Hear my humble cry</i>

249
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:11,591
<i>While on others
thou art calling</i>

250
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:16,641
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

251
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:22,233
<i>Savior, savior</i>

252
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:27,651
<i>- Hear my humble cry
- Hear my humble cry</i>

253
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,680
<i>While on others
thou art calling</i>

254
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:38,722
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

255
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,302
I think I'm gonna have to ask
Mrs. Thompson for some days off.

256
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,952
You be careful.

257
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:53,453
Lot of folks losin' their jobs.
Christmas next week.

258
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,136
Yeah.

259
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,523
Mrs. Thompson ain't as bad as some.
She called that policeman out for me.

260
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,386
I ain't never seen a white woman
do nothin' like that before.

261
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:06,858
Odessa, don't you go foolin'
yourself 'bout that white woman.

262
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:10,044
She don't know us,
and she don't want to know us.

263
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,453
She may have a heart of gold, but she
the one that sent you to that park,

264
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:15,421
and you ain't have
no say in it.

265
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:18,210
That policeman was
apologizing to her, not you.

266
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:20,681
Well, still and all,

267
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:25,631
I cannot keep comin' home too tired to do
the cookin' and too late to do the cleanin'.

268
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,331
- You can always take the bus.
- What?

269
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,077
What did you say?

270
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,247
I guess it's like
the preachers say,

271
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:51,816
"There's an easy answer
for everything. "

272
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:54,338
Nobody said it
was gonna be easy.

273
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:05,197
Mary Catherine, will you stop messing with
that silverware and sit down in that seat.

274
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,967
I'm just playing.

275
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:11,237
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Odessa's got a lot of work to do.

276
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,809
Odessa, I'm going to Junior League,
so you'll have Mary Catherine.

277
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,677
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is that all the silver you've done?

278
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:20,215
I've been feeling
a little poorly today.

279
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:26,974
Well, you've been feeling poorly all week,
and next week is Christmas.

280
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,641
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:35,298
Now, I know you can't ride the bus,
and I'm not a taxi service,

282
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,270
but I can't have you come in here in the
mornin' and draggin' around all day, Odessa.

283
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,039
Not this close to Christmas.

284
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,743
I go to Curb Market early
on Tuesdays and Fridays,

285
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:47,344
so I can pick you up between 7:30
and 8:00 on those mornings.

286
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,144
Until you can start
riding the bus.

287
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,905
The other days, you're gonna
have to get here on your own.

288
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,220
Mary Catherine?

289
00:26:01,756 --> 00:26:03,239
Mary Catherine!

290
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:07,067
I don't want you to go tellin' Daddy
I've been carrying Odessa to work.

291
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,237
Now, I've got a good
reason for this, okay?

292
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:11,404
- Yes, ma'am.
- No slips.

293
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,332
Santa might
get unhappy.

294
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:14,910
Understood?

295
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:17,141
Okay.
Bye-bye.

296
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:25,693
Of course, what I cared about that
Christmas were the little things...

297
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:31,360
the presents I'd asked for and the way I
thought my older sister owned the world.

298
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,339
Mommy, Mommy!

299
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,797
- They're here! They're here!
- Oh!

300
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,905
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, Mom.

301
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:42,207
Father says you never
wrote a Christmas list.

302
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,943
- I did mine a month ago.
- Jeepers, Boo-Boo.

303
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:47,179
- I'm not Boo-Boo.
- Yes, you are, Boo-Boo.

304
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:48,963
Let me get these bags
to Sara's room,

305
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:50,810
and then I want to take
you all out for a surprise.

306
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:52,962
- You mean after dinner.
- No, I mean now.

307
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:54,737
- Honey!
- It'll be a lot of fun, honey.

308
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,730
I know Sara's hungry, and I just made
her favorite, chicken tetrazzini.

309
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,538
- Ew!
- Mother!

310
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,784
I stopped eating chicken tetrazzini
when I was nine years old.

311
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,301
Besides, I had my heart set
on eating at The Elite.

312
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:10,128
- She made me promise at the airport.
- Honey, I've been cooking all day long.

313
00:27:10,325 --> 00:27:13,384
I promise, I will eat cold
chicken tetrazzini all week.

314
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:20,521
This is the...
the new subdivision.

315
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,787
It's... 41 lots.

316
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:26,317
I wasn't gonna bring you
out here till Christmas, but,

317
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:29,734
they put up these, uh...
these street markers,

318
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:32,788
and I was just sure that somehow
you were gonna find out. Look.

319
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,560
- Is that named after me?
- It sure is.

320
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:41,088
And, honey, look.
Over there, that's Mary Lane.

321
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:45,017
And it runs into Catherine Court,
so you have two streets named after you.

322
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,545
- Really? Two streets?
- Yes, indeed.

323
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:49,960
And way back there,
you can't see it, but...

324
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,086
that's Miriam Street.

325
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:56,104
So now all the women in my life
have somethin' named after 'em.

326
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:58,150
And years and years
from now,

327
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:02,393
you can look back and know that
people lived their lives on your street,

328
00:28:02,428 --> 00:28:04,256
and whenever they said
where they lived,

329
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,176
they used your names.

330
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:08,830
Merry Christmas.

331
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,719
<i>The air force has spotted an
unidentified object on radar</i>

332
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,553
<i>coming south over Alaska.</i>

333
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:31,677
<i>Fighters were launched from bases
in Alaska to confirm the sighting.</i>

334
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,925
<i>They say it appears to be
a small sleigh flying in the air.</i>

335
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,183
<i>Could it be Saint Nick?</i>

336
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,006
They've run the same Christmas
Eve story for centuries.

337
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,509
You'd think this entire city
would die of boredom.

338
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,903
- What's wrong with it? - I mean,
who do they think they're kidding?

339
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,679
Nobody who really believes
in Santa Claus is listening.

340
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:52,079
You don't still believe
in Santa Claus, do you?

341
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:56,268
- No.
- Good.

342
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:59,067
If there was a Santa Claus,
he would have surely swooped down

343
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,932
and replaced that old thing.

344
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,188
Well, I wouldn't hold my breath
waiting for that to happen.

345
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:06,756
I know.
I'm back in Montgomery again.

346
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,821
Harness the mule.

347
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:12,986
It's time to go down to the
well and draw some water.

348
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,430
- Miriam.
- Shh. I'm right here.

349
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,655
Shh.

350
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:33,175
Honey, you're gonna have to
tell me which pile to put these in.

351
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,374
Relax, honey.
It'll be fine.

352
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:39,438
- I like the layout.
- Well, let's see. Mary Catherine.

353
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,548
Honey. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, honey.

354
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,372
Now, wave.
Wave to the camera.

355
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,127
Good.

356
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:14,542
- Okay. Sara?
- Come on.

357
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,901
Merry Christmas, honey.

358
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,684
Sweetness?
Mary Catherine.

359
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:22,387
Whoo!

360
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,316
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Look at the presents.

361
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,817
Come on, Mary Catherine.

362
00:31:32,048 --> 00:31:34,232
Merry Christmas, Odessa.

363
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:38,570
Miriam, the Eighth Army
has arrived.

364
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,803
Good morning, Odessa.
The turkey and the ham are in the fridge.

365
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:44,747
They're thawed, and the turkey is
ready to be stuffed and cooked.

366
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:46,684
Now, the casseroles
still need to be cooked.

367
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:51,424
375, but not until 1:00.
We can't have cold casserole.

368
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:54,191
You could get started on
the deviled eggs though.

369
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:56,926
And when Claudia gets here,
one of you will have to vacuum.

370
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:59,636
Now, don't forget to
put out the milk punch.

371
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:01,742
Last year, we were
halfway through the day,

372
00:32:01,777 --> 00:32:03,959
and nobody thought to
put out the milk punch.

373
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:05,988
Oh, I know I must be
forgettin' somethin'.

374
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:07,965
Oh!
Merry Christmas, Odessa.

375
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,615
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Thompson. - Mother!
Do I have to wear this stupid dress?

376
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:15,638
Sara, I ordered these dresses specially
for all of us. Now, they're cute.

377
00:32:15,673 --> 00:32:17,148
Mother!

378
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:21,587
Dessie, look what I got.
Isn't she pretty?

379
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:24,723
She's got three whole outfits,
with shoes and socks and everything!

380
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:28,168
- Three whole outfits!
- Look at her bonnet and her dress

381
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:30,547
- and the ribbons and the shoes!
- Oh, she's beautiful!

382
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,875
Oh!

383
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,339
Wait until you see
what else I got.

384
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,342
He come runnin' down the stairs,
be so excited,

385
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:43,711
he'd fly right on right on
and hit his grand keister.

386
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,647
Land on the road.

387
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,715
Does he still do that?

388
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,321
Now let's see if Tunker wants
some of these limas.

389
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:55,390
Hey, did you see that thing
in the paper this morning?

390
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:59,643
- I think Grover Hall has lost his mind.
- What are you talking about? What thing?

391
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:02,010
Didn't you read the paper
this morning, Norman?

392
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:05,235
He's talking about the ad that Grover
let the coloreds put in the paper,

393
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,473
demanding that we
give in to them.

394
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:09,263
Well, it's stupid.

395
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:11,937
It's about one of the stupidest things
that ever happened to this city,

396
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:14,338
because who really cares
about the buses?

397
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:17,131
Ah, you don't understand.

398
00:33:17,522 --> 00:33:19,472
This is just a test.

399
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:24,379
In the paper this morning, they said
they want all the bus drivers' jobs.

400
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:28,752
- Wouldn't that be great.
- No. It seems to me...

401
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:31,184
that the way to handle this
thing is to play it down.

402
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:34,320
Supreme court's just itching
to force this whole issue.

403
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,233
Let 'em sit where they want.

404
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:39,687
It just won't work that way.

405
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:43,232
I, for one, won't stand for the niggers
in Montgomery running around

406
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:45,166
yappin' about how they won.

407
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:47,158
And don't you think it's
gonna have consequences.

408
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:50,959
Norman, don't you understand?
If they get by with this bus thing now,

409
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:54,470
in a few years you won't even be
able to have this Christmas dinner...

410
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:57,851
'cause you'll have to have the
maids sittin' right beside you.

411
00:33:58,267 --> 00:34:01,922
It's Communism is what it is. Just a
bunch of Communists. All of 'em.

412
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:04,574
None of 'em are from
Montgomery either.

413
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,278
That Martin Luther King...
He hasn't even lived here a year.

414
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:13,236
These niggers just want too much,
and they're not willing to work for it.

415
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,492
- Rolls, Mrs. Thompson?
- No, thank you.

416
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:21,720
Well, that's the way I feel.

417
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:24,376
I don't care who hears me.

418
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,473
- Thank you, Odessa.
- Thanks, Dessie.

419
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,607
Thank you.

420
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:53,583
Claudia. Claudia, Odessa.
That was a magnificent meal. It was.

421
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,172
- Here's a little something for you.
Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

422
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,133
Merry Christmas, Odessa.

423
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,838
We, uh...

424
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,935
We were just talkin'
about the bus boycott.

425
00:35:04,294 --> 00:35:07,826
- Claudia, I know, I know you get a
ride with your husband. - Yes, sir.

426
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:11,045
But, Odessa, you're here
five days a week.

427
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,949
How do you get to work?

428
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,936
- Today I walked.
- I mean, on a normal day.

429
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:26,379
Well, I can't take the bus,
Mr. Thompson, so I... I just...

430
00:35:27,423 --> 00:35:30,391
will find me a ride
where I can.

431
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:35,312
But if it were safe
to ride the bus...

432
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:37,738
you'd still rather walk
than sit in the back?

433
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:42,201
Yes, sir, I would
have to say I would.

434
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:45,393
That's a long walk.

435
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:49,741
Yes, sir.
Mighty long.

436
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:56,238
That was...
It was a delicious meal.

437
00:35:56,462 --> 00:36:00,451
- It really was. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:09,442
Well?

439
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,022
Well...

440
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,398
I see your point...

441
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:20,698
- but I can't blame her because I don't
think she's a problem. - The hell she's not.

442
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,212
Why don't you get a new maid,
get a white maid?

443
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:27,026
- Mother, she's been with us for
nine years. - She's a problem.

444
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:32,033
She's not uppity like some.
Not to your face.

445
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:37,091
But slowly, they all start
asking for more, doing less.

446
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:39,591
Norm?

447
00:36:41,336 --> 00:36:44,601
You got a good family,
good community here.

448
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,931
When was the last time you
locked your door at night?

449
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,211
Never.

450
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:53,391
If you give in...

451
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,179
what do you think is gonna
happen to this city?

452
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:02,227
What do you think is gonna
happen to your family?

453
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,605
No, you gotta hold the line.
We all do.

454
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:11,625
And if she'd rather walk...

455
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,823
bleed out the soles of her feet
till she begs to ride that bus.

456
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:22,550
Ooh, Mr. Thompson had a look in his eyes
when he asked you 'bout gettin' to work.

457
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:26,182
Girl, I can't believe what you said. It's
one thing I learned in this life is when

458
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:29,382
you got your hand in the lion's mouth,
it's better just to pat him on the head.

459
00:37:29,466 --> 00:37:32,855
Mr. Thompson's all right. He didn't
mean nothin' by that. But I tell you,

460
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,167
Mrs. Thompson's mother almost got
a plate of rolls busted upside her head.

461
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:38,255
- Ooh, and on Christmas Day.
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,304
- Lord, spare that woman's soul.
- Mmm.

463
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:43,144
I know you got to work here,
but if she said that to me,

464
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:46,126
I'd have thrown those rolls down
and given her my apron,

465
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:50,322
told her the next time I serve her is
the day after she walks to my house

466
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,683
- and cooks my Christmas dinner.
- Go ahead, girl.

467
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,215
But I tell you, see, I sit up there and let
her call me a lazy nigger, and I'll walk.

468
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,867
I'd walk until I
got no legs left

469
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:03,098
if I thought it was gonna give my
children a better shot in the world.

470
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:06,632
You work so hard, have some
woman say what that woman said,

471
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,492
and make you wonder who gonna
be sittin' in the backseat in heaven.

472
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,464
- And on Christmas Day.
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:14,250
- See you tomorrow, girl.
- Okay.

474
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:33,356
I ain't takin' that.
Listen, I gotta go. All right.

475
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,554
Bye. See you.
Merry Christmas.

476
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:39,576
Y'all ain't gonna make me
late for Christmas service.

477
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,113
We ain't goin' nowhere
without Theodore.

478
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:44,831
Besides, you don't look
like you're dressed yet.

479
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:47,849
What are you
talkin' about?

480
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,982
Mama, you just
don't look ready.

481
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:56,278
Theodore! See if you can find something
in there for your mama to wear.

482
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,952
Has everybody
gone crazy?

483
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:05,176
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

484
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:08,032
- Merry Christmas, Mama.
- Merry Christmas, Mom.

485
00:39:10,545 --> 00:39:12,400
Open 'em.

486
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,951
I don't know
how you did this.

487
00:39:38,986 --> 00:39:41,329
I don't know how
I did it either.

488
00:39:50,923 --> 00:39:52,793
Well, you know, ain't...

489
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,331
they ain't gonna wait for us over at
the church now. Come on, y'all. Here.

490
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:14,264
Mm-hmm.

491
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,835
Well, come on.

492
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:17,744
Mama's gonna find out she's been
hoggin' that phone and tan her hide.

493
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:22,555
I gotta go to the shed. Get them lights
straight before I get back here.

494
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,845
Well, yeah, I could get
there if I wanted to.

495
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,595
Yeah. Why not? Stop!
Get away, stupid.

496
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,548
Sorry.
Excuse me.

497
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:35,533
All right. Hold on.
I'm gonna leave right now.

498
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,734
Yeah, I can get there.
Yeah, I got a way.

499
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,372
I'm hangin' up the phone,
all right? All right?

500
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,009
Okay.
Bye.

501
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,668
Shoot.
Everybody's lost their minds.

502
00:42:07,616 --> 00:42:11,642
- Where's Selma? - She went down
to Leticia's for some hot chocolate.

503
00:42:12,398 --> 00:42:14,459
Did Leticia call?

504
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:18,084
What you got
behind your back?

505
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,490
- Nothin'.
- What is it?

506
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,790
It's just somethin'.
Stop!

507
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:26,625
Let's see. About worth a shit.
Open your hand before I break it!

508
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,634
Did Selma give you
that quarter?

509
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:32,877
I can't say.
You hurt my arm.

510
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:35,175
Damn!

511
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:04,605
- I don't want no trouble.
- I'm just riding the bus, sir.

512
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,751
I ain't caused no trouble. I don't
want any trouble. You understand?

513
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,540
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

514
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:22,964
Selma.
Damn!

515
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,210
I don't care if God himself
comes down and asks.

516
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,432
You don't tell nobody
that Selma and I left.

517
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,889
I know.
Kickin' us out of class.

518
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:07,449
- My dad is not gonna care.
- It's his fault, not ours.

519
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:09,489
- I know it's his fault.
- Huh.

520
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:12,681
- His dad won't care.
- Never does.

521
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:16,175
- My dad will.
- Hey. We got a nigger on the bus.

522
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,010
She must be
from out of town.

523
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,674
She must be.

524
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:22,941
- Hey. Hey. Do you wanna
have some fun? - Yeah.

525
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,990
We're gonna have some fun.

526
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:31,486
Have some fun.
She's kinda cute too.

527
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:33,541
Yeah, for a nigger.

528
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:36,543
Go on.

529
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,441
You from out of town?

530
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:47,284
He asked you a question.

531
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,028
No, I'm not
from out of town.

532
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:55,052
You call him "sir. "

533
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,937
Sir.

534
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:03,273
Hey, in case you hadn't heard,
niggers quit ridin' the bus around here.

535
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:05,353
Or ain't you a nigger, girl?

536
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:08,634
Say
"I'm a nigger, sir. "

537
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:13,057
- Say it! - Y'all are gonna have
to sit down back there.

538
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:15,035
This girl is sittin'
where I wanna sit.

539
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:17,216
She's supposed to be
at the back of the bus.

540
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,648
All right. You three,
get off the bus... right now.

541
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:30,413
I said, now, or I'll call the police
and have you thrown in jail.

542
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:32,724
You think I won't do it?

543
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:35,229
You think I won't do it?

544
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:41,039
Old fart.

545
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:45,499
Don't bring your trashy ass
back on my bus again.

546
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,598
I'll call your daddy.

547
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,589
Damn fools.

548
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,782
I'm gonna teach you
to ride our bus!

549
00:46:17,154 --> 00:46:19,412
Your water's
in the ditch, nigger.

550
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:25,313
- Mommy.
- Never mind. Come on.

551
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,772
Catch that nigger!
Come on back, nigger!

552
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,529
What do you want?
What did I do wrong?

553
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:56,732
- Why'd you run, nigger bitch?
- Get away from me.

554
00:46:57,234 --> 00:46:59,270
Get away!

555
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,844
Don't talk that way
to me, nigger.

556
00:47:05,846 --> 00:47:07,812
Leave my sister alone!

557
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:15,697
Why'd you push me,
nigger?

558
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:20,321
- Hit him!
- No!

559
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:32,739
No!

560
00:47:45,622 --> 00:47:47,590
Go down, nigger!

561
00:47:53,798 --> 00:47:58,068
Hey! If you wanna
hit someone, hit me!

562
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:06,586
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
get you hurt. - I'm not hurt.

563
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:11,168
Get his ass in the car. Let me take
you home before I get lynched.

564
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,628
- I didn't wanna fall.
- You stood long enough.

565
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:36,347
Hello.

566
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,726
My God. What happened
to your face?

567
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,462
It's my fault.

568
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:56,362
I tried to ride the bus, and Theo got
beat up by some white boys 'cause of it.

569
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:01,769
You tried to ride the bus?

570
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:05,208
Is that what you're tellin' me?
You tried to ride the bus,

571
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:08,703
and that's why his face looks like that?
What's wrong with you?

572
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:25,342
Wash your face, Selma.
Get Theo cleaned up here.

573
00:49:31,275 --> 00:49:35,119
If you own a car, but you must
be at work during the day,

574
00:49:35,412 --> 00:49:38,811
we have fine young men
who can drive your cars,

575
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:41,890
allowing you to still
contribute to the boycott.

576
00:49:42,654 --> 00:49:45,947
And now the choir will sing
"We're Marching to Zion. "

577
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,793
Those of you who can help
us with the carpooling,

578
00:49:48,828 --> 00:49:52,393
come forward during
the singing of this song.

579
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:04,293
<i>- We are marching

580

00:50:06,928 --> 00:50:11,310

<i>- To that beautiful

597
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:48,692
<i>- City of God, Hallelujah

598
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:50,396

601
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,997

00:50:57,032 --> 00:50:59,357
<i>- Lord, we are marching

603
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:01,707
<i>- On up to Zion

00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:04,131

610
00:51:15,024 --> 00:51:20,447
<i>That beautiful city of</i>

611
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:25,429
<i>God</i>

612
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:54,906
I'm sorry I'm late.

613
00:51:54,941 --> 00:51:57,099
I just had this stuff to
take care of downtown,

614
00:51:57,134 --> 00:51:59,675
and I didn't see any sense in
making the trip out here twice.

615
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,172
I've got this club luncheon, which means
I have to go to the beauty parlor...

616
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:05,260
as soon as I get back, and then I have
this Junior League thing this afternoon.

617
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,779
- Now, what is he doing?
- Oh, they're tryin' to break the boycott.

618
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,330
They just follow behind people
and try to give 'em tickets.

619
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:33,163
You just drive nice and slow, Mrs. Thompson.
He'll go back to the lot.

620
00:52:39,396 --> 00:52:42,022
Is that the big
boycott carpool stop?

621
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:44,660
Oh, yes, ma'am,
I believe it is.

622
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:52,754
Is that woman drivin'
for the carpools?

623
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:55,953
Well, I don't know if she is,
but I know there's a lot of women

624
00:52:56,016 --> 00:52:58,313
from the air force
base who do.

625
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:13,094
I come to find
out from Odessa,

626
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:15,896
they are drivin' these maids
around on a regular basis.

627
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:19,670
- What? - There are white
women drivin' for the carpool.

628
00:53:19,857 --> 00:53:23,422
- Are you sure? - Yes. Odessa says
they're from Maxwell Field.

629
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:25,791
I should have known
they were Yankees.

630
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:29,077
But they had police out there,
and they were followin' people around.

631
00:53:29,226 --> 00:53:32,077
For a while, Odessa and I
thought they were followin' us.

632
00:53:32,883 --> 00:53:35,850
- Miriam, are you drivin' your
maid to work? - No, Laura Ann.

633
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,411
Two days a week I go to the Curb Market,
and I just pick her up on those days.

634
00:53:39,586 --> 00:53:43,368
And you were talkin' like you thought those
white women drivin' the carpools were wrong.

635
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:47,845
You're just as bad. Robert says this
whole boycott would end tomorrow if

636
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:51,972
- people like you would stop drivin' their
maids to work. - Is that what Robert says?

637
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:55,411
Well, my maid has a car,
so I don't have to worry about it.

638
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,077
Well, I told Cathy,

639
00:53:58,157 --> 00:54:01,654
that if she wanted to boycott,
that was fine, but she'd be on her own.

640
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:04,988
She fed me all this junk about:
"Oh, I's not wantin' to boycott.

641
00:54:05,023 --> 00:54:08,875
I's just walkin' 'cause I can't ride
with all these police and stuff. "

642
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,685
I told her, "Fine. Just be at work
on time and don't leave early. "

643
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,901
One club.
Well, you better well believe

644
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:19,703
- she's sittin' up front at those
church rallies. - Pass.

645
00:54:19,738 --> 00:54:22,540
- One spade.
- Pass.

646
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:25,803
I don't really care what happens to
the boycott, but I do care if I have a maid,

647
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:29,039
and if that means drivin' her sometimes,
well, that's what it means.

648
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,676
Two clubs.

649
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:36,540
<i>40,000 local Negroes continue
to walk and ride in carpools,</i>

650
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:39,294
<i>as the city buses roll
without passengers.</i>

651
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:43,653
<i>An announced settlement with Negro
ministers proves to be an empty promise.</i>

652
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:46,565
<i>In day 49 of the
Negro Bus Boycott,</i>

653
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,116
<i>dramatic new developments
from City Hall.</i>

654
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:52,948
<i>Good evening.
I'm Carl Stephens, WSFA News.</i>

655
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:58,174
<i>Mayor Gayle announced today he was calling
off negotiations in the Negro bus boycott.</i>

656
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,108
Must be Tunker.
I have to go.

657
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,884
Honey, that's not polite.

658
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,293
Sit at the table when
we have company. Hi!

659
00:55:09,537 --> 00:55:13,239
- How's my little Boo-boo? - Oh, she doesn't
like to be called Boo-boo anymore.

660
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:16,409
- They make fun of her at school.
- Aw...

661
00:55:17,632 --> 00:55:19,369
Well then...

662
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:24,202
I will never call you that again.
If you just...

663
00:55:24,348 --> 00:55:26,453
Give your Uncle
Tunker a little

664
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:28,391
- ... sugar.
- ... sugar.

665
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:34,778
Ah! I always liked Mary
Catherine better anyway.

666
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:39,188
That's the type of name you'd
expect for a princess or a queen.

667
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:44,425
- 'Cause you are a princess. My beautiful
little princess. - We better be off.

668
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,497
- Well, good luck.
- Luck?

669
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:49,943
Citizens' Council don't need luck.
Not with men like your daddy.

670
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:52,147
Oh, I thought you were going
to a business meeting.

671
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:54,658
- No. Citizens' Council meeting.
- Oh.

672
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,012
Norman, could I talk to you
for a minute, please?

673
00:56:04,755 --> 00:56:08,733
Norman. These are the people
you said couldn't count to 10.

674
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:10,877
You're gonna go to
one of their meetings?

675
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:13,673
The whole thing has
just gotten out of hand.

676
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:16,394
And now the mayor, the city commission,
they've all joined.

677
00:56:16,429 --> 00:56:18,690
So for me, it's either joining
this group or the Klan.

678
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:21,323
Oh, honey.
That's not true.

679
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:23,727
The mayor and the commission
are politicians.

680
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:26,660
They'd join the circus if they
thought it'd get 'em reelected.

681
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:30,269
You're beginnin' to let your little
brother lead you around by the nose.

682
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:33,827
Listen, I don't care whether you like Tunker
or not, but don't you tell me what to do.

683
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:38,629
I'll make up my own mind, and I'll join
any goddamn group I please.

684
00:56:41,822 --> 00:56:44,016
- Are you ready?
- Sure.

685
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:58,348
- Well, this is not at all what
I expected. - Yeah.

686
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:05,168
See. No white sheets.
No secret oaths.

687
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:07,538
You mean I don't get to
learn a coded handshake?

688
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:10,604
- Is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
- Norm Thompson. - Yeah.

689
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,184
Oh, hi. Jeff Sewell with
Avalon Brothers here in town.

690
00:57:13,186 --> 00:57:15,025
- Oh, right. Nice to see ya.
- Glad you could be out tonight.

691
00:57:15,027 --> 00:57:18,462
- Thank you. - By the way, I've just
been put on the planning commission.

692
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:21,198
- Uh-huh. - If you ever have a
zoning problem, you give me a ring.

693
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,434
- I can put you right.
- Thanks, Jeff.

694
00:57:25,114 --> 00:57:28,900
Over half the small business owners
in town are members of the council.

695
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:31,731
You mean half the white
small businesses.

696
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:35,063
If you call what the niggers do business,
Commissioner Sellers.

697
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,514
- How you doing, Clyde?
- Holdin' on.

698
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,594
Didn't think you'd be
out here after that

699
00:57:39,629 --> 00:57:42,023
phone call I got from
your wife a while back.

700
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:46,564
She was right though. The police
department's gotta keep its nose clean.

701
00:57:46,919 --> 00:57:50,251
Hope you can get the rest of that country
club crowd to some of these meetings.

702
00:57:50,378 --> 00:57:51,892
If the niggers keep pushin'
the way they are,

703
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:55,095
- we'll get 'em off the golf
courses for ya. - No, no.

704
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,140
What I want is to get
'em on the course.

705
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:02,546
Best caddy I ever had
was a nigger.

706
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,473
Testing.
One, two, three.

707
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:15,359
Testing.
One, two, three.

708
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:21,024
- I know the journey... has been hard.
- Yes. Yeah.

709
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:26,118
- Many of you are tired.
- Right. Yeah.

710
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:29,068
- Still tired.
- We've seen the city,

711
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:34,098
and it's turned its back
on its black children.

712
00:58:36,825 --> 00:58:41,051
We've seen the mayor
and city commission,

713
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:44,918
which has taken a stand...

714
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:49,335
- for injustice...
- Yes. Amen.

715
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,656
- and bigotry.
- Yes.

716
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:56,072
- Moses.
- Moses.

717
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,343
- Moses!
- Yes. Moses.

718
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:04,647
- Fought the pharaoh long
and hard for his people. - Yes.

719
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:10,399
- What? Oh!
- But Moses stood tall for his people.

720
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:12,930
Tall, yeah.

721
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:16,491
When the children of Israel...

722
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,998
were led out
into the wilderness,

723
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:25,303
- they didn't walk for just
one month or two. - No.

724
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:30,472
- They walked for 40 long years.
- All right. All right.

725
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:35,404
They just bombed
Reverend King's house.

726
00:59:47,664 --> 00:59:48,964
Wait.

727
00:59:51,335 --> 00:59:54,102
Let us pray.

728
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:57,903
- Father, I've just heard
terrible news. - Yeah.

729
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,829
I've heard that a bomb
was thrown at the house...

730
01:00:03,035 --> 01:00:06,442
of a young man
so full of spirit.

731
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:10,722
Father, we pray...

732
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:16,885
- in thanks, for sparing the life of
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. - Yes!

733
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:24,626
- Lord, be by our side.
- Yeah.

734
01:00:25,005 --> 01:00:30,158
These dark days... hold our hand
as we walk through the night.

735
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,837
- Yeah.
- Yes.

736
01:00:31,872 --> 01:00:35,609
- Lord, don't pass Montgomery by!
- Yes.

737
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:42,393
- Don't pass Montgomery by tonight.
- Yeah.

738
01:03:10,358 --> 01:03:12,626
Oh.

739
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:36,266
- Is there anything you need, honey?
- No, no.

740
01:03:36,757 --> 01:03:38,611
When's Odessa gettin' here?

741
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:41,925
Well, she's probably gonna be a
little late on account of the rain.

742
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:44,916
Isn't she usually
here by now?

743
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:47,118
Not really.

744
01:03:48,432 --> 01:03:50,989
You mean she
comes in late a lot?

745
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,717
Odessa gets here just fine every day.
Now, I've got to go.

746
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:59,270
She'll be here soon enough.

747
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,005
Miriam.

748
01:04:02,144 --> 01:04:03,961
Yeah.

749
01:04:05,662 --> 01:04:08,206
Just how does Odessa
get to work?

750
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,170
Well, I was goin' over to
the Curb Market today anyway,

751
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:17,878
and that's over on Madison
near where Odessa lives,

752
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:22,181
- and I was just gonna go ahead and
pick her up. - You're gonna do what?

753
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:25,218
How often do you
drive her around?

754
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:30,169
Well, I go to Curb Market
twice a week.

755
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,604
- That's it. - Here I am tryin'
to hold my head up as a

756
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,633
white man in this town,
and you're cartin' a nigger maid.

757
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:41,148
No wonder none of 'em are ridin' the buses.
They have you to carry 'em around.

758
01:04:43,427 --> 01:04:44,962
What should I do?

759
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,999
Odessa walks to work three days
a week. She can walk five.

760
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:50,568
You can just get on the
phone and call her now.

761
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,937
- Norman.
- Now, damn it!

762
01:05:08,722 --> 01:05:10,557
Hello.

763
01:05:13,964 --> 01:05:17,979
Yes, ma'am, I can be to work.
I'll just be a little late.

764
01:05:55,491 --> 01:05:57,462
- Oh.
- Miriam?

765
01:05:57,799 --> 01:05:59,840
Damn.

766
01:06:08,786 --> 01:06:11,611
I'm sorry I got
so upset before.

767
01:06:12,508 --> 01:06:15,252
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

768
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,668
I know you don't
keep up with things.

769
01:06:33,988 --> 01:06:37,694
Even I thought this boycott business
was silly when it first started.

770
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:40,388
And if it wasn't
being made into...

771
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:45,105
such a circus by the coloreds,
I'd still think it was silly. But...

772
01:06:45,824 --> 01:06:47,848
...it's not anymore.

773
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:52,256
And drivin' Odessa
to work, it...

774
01:06:52,928 --> 01:06:56,319
just wasn't the right thing to do.
You know that.

775
01:06:59,356 --> 01:07:04,050
I think Odessa... has been
a wonderful maid for us,

776
01:07:04,091 --> 01:07:06,965
and when she's here,
that's what she is: A Maid.

777
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:11,901
And that's not the real Odessa. We don't
know that woman. Can't ever know her.

778
01:07:12,014 --> 01:07:16,860
It's like... a dog knowin' a cat.
It's a different species.

779
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,376
And you drivin' her to work is
tellin' her that she's just like us.

780
01:07:20,423 --> 01:07:22,910
And she's not,
and she never can be.

781
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:28,568
Even if I thought you didn't
understand that, and I know you do,

782
01:07:28,668 --> 01:07:31,652
I still couldn't let you
drive her to work.

783
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:36,151
Do you know what would happen to you...
if the wrong people saw you?

784
01:07:36,628 --> 01:07:40,615
You saw the pictures from Tuscaloosa
when they kicked that niggra out.

785
01:07:41,533 --> 01:07:46,876
There are people here, now,
that are ready to do those things.

786
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:51,011
Don't go off on your own.

787
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:54,782
You ask me.

788
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,550
I know what's best.

789
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,973
Mrs. Thompson?

790
01:08:44,365 --> 01:08:48,197
- Mrs. Thompson?
- Odessa. I didn't know if you'd make it.

791
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:50,799
I did the breakfast dishes.

792
01:08:52,515 --> 01:08:55,937
Mrs. Thompson...
why did you call me at home,

793
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:58,955
and tell me you couldn't carry
me to work anymore?

794
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,963
Well, if...
If you won't ride the bus,

795
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:07,164
Mr. Thompson doesn't see
why I should have to suffer.

796
01:09:07,362 --> 01:09:10,005
I ain't asked you to suffer,
Mrs. Thompson.

797
01:09:14,672 --> 01:09:17,832
It wasn't me, Odessa.
It was Mr. Thompson.

798
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:21,226
He was home with a cold today,
and he found out.

799
01:09:23,802 --> 01:09:25,876
Let me get you somethin' dry.

800
01:09:36,595 --> 01:09:38,914
- Here ya are.
- Thank you.

801
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:45,035
So, what are you gonna do?

802
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:49,421
I don't know.

803
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:52,955
I can't walk,
and I can't ride the bus.

804
01:09:53,445 --> 01:09:56,782
Can't you just walk until
this whole mess is over?

805
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,995
Mrs. Thompson,
you a good woman.

806
01:10:04,178 --> 01:10:07,911
But I gotta find me another job.
I gotta quit.

807
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,940
I gotta be able to take
care of my children.

808
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:16,236
Well, uh, I understand.

809
01:10:17,807 --> 01:10:21,109
You know, it's... It's funny
the way people are.

810
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:24,416
This mornin' Norman was actin' so sick,
and then he found out I'd been drivin' you,

811
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:27,464
and he got so mad,
he jumped out of bed.

812
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:32,306
I guess that got his blood goin', and he
started feelin' better and went on to work.

813
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,330
Norman's just always been where
everything's segregated. That's...

814
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:43,866
That's just the way he thinks.

815
01:10:48,025 --> 01:10:51,945
When I was 15, my girls club went
on a bus trip across the country.

816
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:55,039
It was in the '30s,
but my family had some money, and,

817
01:10:55,074 --> 01:10:57,706
I remember we went
to Portland, Oregon.

818
01:10:58,193 --> 01:11:00,775
It was the middle of the summer,
and it was hot, and,

819
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:04,514
the bus driver found this public
pool for us. We went swimmin'.

820
01:11:04,849 --> 01:11:09,045
Then these two colored boys came
and got in the water. And let me tell ya,

821
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,237
you've never seen 20 girls get out
of a pool so fast in all your life.

822
01:11:14,595 --> 01:11:17,564
We just...
We just didn't know any better.

823
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:21,300
But I remember watchin'
those other kids in the water.

824
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:25,020
And they just kept right on swimmin'
with those colored boys, and,

825
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:27,685
they didn't seem any
the worse for it.

826
01:11:30,288 --> 01:11:32,784
So the rest of the world
around ya is...

827
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,855
livin' that way, and so you
just don't question it.

828
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,933
Years ago...

829
01:11:45,303 --> 01:11:48,903
I decided I'd live with Norman
for the rest of my life.

830
01:11:49,224 --> 01:11:52,678
And part of that means
livin' the way he lives.

831
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:58,927
But sometimes...
Sometimes Norman says things.

832
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:04,260
It makes me wonder if he saw as much of the
world durin' the war as he thought he did.

833
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:14,723
But he's a good man.
He's a good provider.

834
01:12:15,908 --> 01:12:19,654
In a lot of ways, he's a better
husband than I am a wife.

835
01:12:20,054 --> 01:12:22,439
He's better with the children.
He...

836
01:12:22,474 --> 01:12:26,515
You know, he can say a word and
make 'em smile. I can't do that.

837
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:29,791
Mrs. Thompson, he can't be
a mother to 'em.

838
01:12:32,029 --> 01:12:33,775
Odessa.

839
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:36,555
You do the motherin'.

840
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:39,769
I saw the way you held Mary Catherine
when she had the chicken pox,

841
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:42,158
and you hadn't even had it.

842
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:46,059
Mrs. Thompson, anybody
would have done that.

843
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:49,582
I wonder.

844
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:53,201
Would I have done that
for your daughter?

845
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:05,282
Mrs. Thompson, I don't want your
children to grow up scared of mine.

846
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:12,504
It's just that a lot
of the wives are scared.

847
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:16,895
I'm a little scared.

848
01:13:17,312 --> 01:13:19,729
We all scared.

849
01:13:20,372 --> 01:13:22,934
But what's scarin' you, Mrs. Thompson?
Who you are?

850
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:25,610
Or who Mr. Thompson
wants you to be?

851
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

852
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:02,947
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

853
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,114
- Let me take your coat.
- Thank you.

854
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:11,371
- How's your cold?
- Oh, I'm miserable. I feel like crap.

855
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:13,614
Well, that's nice, honey.

856
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,987
Odessa walked to work today.

857
01:14:16,022 --> 01:14:18,949
- Oh, you told her she had to?
- In the rain.

858
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:20,534
From Cobb Street.

859
01:14:21,174 --> 01:14:23,477
But she's not walking again.

860
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:25,579
- No?
- No.

861
01:14:25,612 --> 01:14:28,611
You have your job, and I
guess you do it just fine.

862
01:14:28,962 --> 01:14:33,177
My job is to run this house. And as
long as it's clean, supper's cooked,

863
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:35,951
and the laundry... the laundry
gets done, I don't...

864
01:14:37,342 --> 01:14:40,461
I don't think it's any of your
business how it happens.

865
01:14:40,648 --> 01:14:43,792
Wait a second. Aren't you forgettin'
who pays the bills around here?

866
01:14:43,827 --> 01:14:47,002
Well then, what time should
I be ready tomorrow?

867
01:14:47,394 --> 01:14:48,846
Ready for what?

868
01:14:48,987 --> 01:14:52,213
Well, I'm gonna go downtown with you in
the mornin' and help you with your job.

869
01:14:52,248 --> 01:14:54,590
You seem so intent on
helping me with mine.

870
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:57,324
Or if you don't like that idea,
I do have a college education,

871
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,692
so I'll just go out and
get a job of my own.

872
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:02,805
It'll probably be somethin' secretarial,
but I'm sure I'll manage.

873
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,421
You will have to take on a lot of
the housework, which will include

874
01:15:05,495 --> 01:15:07,262
finding a maid who
can get out here.

875
01:15:07,435 --> 01:15:10,613
But the money I earn will be my own,
and I'll do with it what I damn well please.

876
01:15:10,642 --> 01:15:12,818
- You're serious...
- And that includes givin' it all to that

877
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:15,002
Reverend King and the Montgomery
Improvement Association,

878
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:17,651
so they can put an end to
this whole boycott mess.

879
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:27,282
Now, do you really care
if I drive Odessa to work?

880
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,722
We're havin' pork chops
for supper,

881
01:15:36,757 --> 01:15:39,938
and I told Mary Catherine that you'd
read to her before she went to sleep.

882
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,940
Did you get Mary Catherine
to bed?

883
01:15:55,242 --> 01:15:56,923
Yeah.

884
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,655
What are you doin'?

885
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,495
Oh, are you just not
gonna talk to me?

886
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:16,475
Honey, there's no reason
to be so mad.

887
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,711
- Norman, talk to me.
- You already made up your mind.

888
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:29,319
- No need to talk to me.
- Honey, I'm doin' what I think is right.

889
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,554
Where are you going?

890
01:16:33,624 --> 01:16:35,911
Norman, I'm still your wife.

891
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:39,828
Yeah, that's all you are.

892
01:16:57,249 --> 01:16:59,518
Odessa, come on,
sit up front with me.

893
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:32,691
Odessa, how does that
carpooling system work?

894
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,993
Well, I don't use it often,
Mrs. Thompson,

895
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:40,804
but I believe that drivers
come at the end of day,

896
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:44,935
to places like Cloverdale, and they pick
up the women that need the rides.

897
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:48,733
It's a little more organized
than that, isn't it?

898
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,328
Yes.
Yes, it is.

899
01:17:58,009 --> 01:18:00,389
They look for the ringleaders
of the boycott,

900
01:18:00,528 --> 01:18:02,850
they pull 'em over
and give 'em tickets.

901
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:06,403
If they see too many coloreds in the car,
they pull them over too.

902
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:09,176
I'll probably get
lots of tickets.

903
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:12,711
You know, Mrs. Thompson,
it ain't just tickets.

904
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:16,717
Once you step over there, I don't
know that you can ever step back.

905
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:19,929
But the boycott
needs the help.

906
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:25,554
Mrs. Thompson, this boycott's
gonna survive without you drivin'.

907
01:18:25,561 --> 01:18:28,533
Odessa, I wanna do this.

908
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:30,882
I wanna help.

909
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:35,448
There's a lot of ways you can help, Mrs.
Thompson. You can just write a check.

910
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,205
If I wrote you a check,
it would be Norman's money.

911
01:18:39,353 --> 01:18:41,816
This is somethin' I can do.

912
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,235
This whole mess is just about
ridin' the bus anyway.

913
01:18:47,686 --> 01:18:50,340
That's what it is now.

914
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:53,834
But we gonna win this thing,
Mrs. Thompson.

915
01:18:54,128 --> 01:18:56,141
When it's all said and done...

916
01:18:56,522 --> 01:18:58,914
people are gonna look at you,
Mrs. Thompson,

917
01:18:58,949 --> 01:19:01,713
and they're gonna say
that you were part of this.

918
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:05,659
Well, let people say
what they're gonna say.

919
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,244
And what about when it
isn't just the busses?

920
01:19:09,381 --> 01:19:11,981
When it's the parks
and the restaurants?

921
01:19:12,145 --> 01:19:15,167
When it's colored teachers
in white schools?

922
01:19:15,442 --> 01:19:18,853
What about when we start votin',
Mrs. Thompson? 'Cause we are.

923
01:19:19,078 --> 01:19:23,059
And when we do,
we are gonna put Negroes in office.

924
01:19:23,962 --> 01:19:27,897
What about when the first colored
family moves into your neighborhood?

925
01:19:31,482 --> 01:19:35,092
You know, Mrs. Thompson,
ain't nobody gonna think any less of you

926
01:19:35,268 --> 01:19:38,186
if we just turn around
and go back to the house.

927
01:19:51,434 --> 01:19:53,628
I don't want all
them beans, Selma!

928
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:56,275
Eat what you're gonna eat, and I'll
let you have the rest for breakfast.

929
01:19:56,383 --> 01:19:59,144
- Mama!
- Don't be a crybaby.

930
01:19:59,315 --> 01:20:02,636
- But it's beans!
- Hush up, and let's say the blessing.

931
01:20:04,107 --> 01:20:07,252
I'll say it.
I'll say the blessing tonight.

932
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:14,907
Lord, I'm gonna ask you to bless this
food for which we are thankful to receive.

933
01:20:15,052 --> 01:20:19,217
Watch over our souls tonight,
and help us live your word tomorrow.

934
01:20:20,017 --> 01:20:25,057
And, Lord, please watch
over Miriam Thompson too.

935
01:20:25,797 --> 01:20:29,475
In Jesus' name we ask this.
Amen.

936
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,331
I got my reasons.

937
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,110
- Amen.
- Amen. - Amen.

938
01:21:04,254 --> 01:21:07,823
Hi! I'm with the carpools.
Y'all goin' downtown?

939
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,240
Yes, ma'am.

940
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,280
Mornin', ma'am.

941
01:21:50,607 --> 01:21:53,896
My mother began drivin'
five and six days a week.

942
01:21:54,294 --> 01:21:56,542
My father knew
she drove Dessie,

943
01:21:56,764 --> 01:21:59,534
but he didn't know she drove
for the carpools.

944
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:17,377
I may be a little late,
so I'll get my own dinner.

945
01:22:24,433 --> 01:22:28,493
- I am... - You know, we all are goin'
down to this thing this evenin'.

946
01:22:28,634 --> 01:22:29,986
You comin'?

947
01:22:30,222 --> 01:22:33,396
- Well, I was plannin' on it.
- Yeah.

948
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:38,467
Listen. I want you to come
see somethin' with me first.

949
01:22:38,801 --> 01:22:41,534
- Say 6:00, 6:15?
- Okay.

950
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,521
Good.

951
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:45,811
Good.

952
01:23:00,865 --> 01:23:04,697
When we started stakin' this place
out and takin' down tag numbers,

953
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:07,861
we, uh, came up
with a few surprises.

954
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:11,927
That, uh, wagon registered
to you is one of 'em.

955
01:23:12,065 --> 01:23:14,913
She's been here the last
couple of nights at this time.

956
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:17,491
Drivin' for a few weeks,
apparently.

957
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:20,457
I didn't find out
until this mornin'.

958
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:25,215
- Well, Norman, you had to know.
- Not like this!

959
01:23:26,364 --> 01:23:30,193
I'm sorry, but now you
can't ignore it anymore.

960
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:35,652
- Well, I won't. - Now...
She's got Mary Catherine over there.

961
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:38,559
Don't go makin' a scene in front
of the child. Let me go. Hmm?

962
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:41,407
- This is my problem. I can handle it.
- Yeah, handle it.

963
01:23:41,453 --> 01:23:43,715
At home, in private.

964
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:46,143
Not in front of the girl
and a bunch of niggers.

965
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:48,896
I can get rid of 'em.
I'll get 'em out of there.

966
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,337
Let it wait for a few minutes till things
start up. Then she'll wanna leave.

967
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:55,887
- Yeah, well, don't you get
cute with me. - Hey!

968
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:58,841
I made plans to be here
tonight a long time before

969
01:23:58,896 --> 01:24:02,743
- we found out about your wife,
and so did you. - Huh, Christ.

970
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:05,590
Give me five minutes.
Hmm?

971
01:24:05,926 --> 01:24:07,798
Let's go.

972
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:20,885
- Winston. Good to see ya.
- Good to see ya.

973
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:22,617
- Charlie.
- Hi.

974
01:24:22,704 --> 01:24:25,690
Police pulled out
about 20 minutes ago.

975
01:24:25,746 --> 01:24:28,258
There are a couple
folks already here.

976
01:24:28,302 --> 01:24:30,911
All right.
All right.

977
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,227
- ... Gay Meadows in the middle
of the day. - Mm-hmm.

978
01:24:41,391 --> 01:24:44,114
- We need some cars on
those routes. - Okay.

979
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:46,579
Now, uh...

980
01:24:47,467 --> 01:24:48,989
Miriam.

981
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:51,973
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

982
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,544
- Is he trouble?
- No. I can handle this.

983
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,963
Excuse us.

984
01:24:59,242 --> 01:25:04,027
Miriam, you shouldn't be here.
Is that Mary Catherine over there?

985
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:08,073
You shouldn't be bringin'
her into a place like this.

986
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:10,922
Well, Tunker, I don't think
it's any of your business.

987
01:25:11,203 --> 01:25:14,096
I don't think you
heard me right, boy.

988
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:16,350
I'm okay.

989
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:21,300
Miriam, don't be tellin' me
this isn't any of my business.

990
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,900
- Well then, don't try to run my life.
- You should leave.

991
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:28,063
- Tunker, there are some women dependin'
on me for a ride. - Can I help you?

992
01:25:28,474 --> 01:25:30,767
They'll be here any minute.

993
01:25:30,994 --> 01:25:33,449
- I'll leave then.
- Yeah, you got an ashtray?

994
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,824
If you don't have any business here,
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave the lot.

995
01:25:37,976 --> 01:25:41,891
Well, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you got your black ass out of my face.

996
01:25:41,983 --> 01:25:44,939
Miriam.
Miriam.

997
01:25:46,554 --> 01:25:52,120
In a few minutes, 150 men are gonna
shut this lot down... any way they can.

998
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:54,583
I think Norman might be
interested to find out

999
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:57,582
why his little girl was
smack in the middle of it.

1000
01:25:57,688 --> 01:26:01,752
Winston, what do you think I should
do with a nigger like this one?

1001
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:06,894
Charlie!

1002
01:26:08,104 --> 01:26:10,844
- Charlie!
- Get off my back, nigger.

1003
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:14,324
- What's happening?
- Come on, baby.

1004
01:26:17,762 --> 01:26:20,698
- Charlie!
- You gonna hit me, black boy, huh?

1005
01:26:21,311 --> 01:26:23,447
Odessa, we've gotta go.

1006
01:26:25,771 --> 01:26:29,274
You ain't drivin' your
nigger maid out of here.

1007
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:31,953
Get away from my car.

1008
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:36,759
No, you get away from your car.
You wanna act like a nigger?

1009
01:26:36,913 --> 01:26:40,771
Then you just get your daughter and
walk with the rest of the niggers.

1010
01:26:43,804 --> 01:26:48,574
What do y'all think we ought to do
with Mrs. Martin Luther Coon, huh?

1011
01:26:53,163 --> 01:26:56,655
- We're gonna show you what we
think about niggers. - Martin. Martin!

1012
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:58,425
Martin.
All right.

1013
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,952
If she leaves, she walks
with the rest of the niggers.

1014
01:27:08,509 --> 01:27:12,400
Miriam, you lost this one.
Let's go.

1015
01:27:12,689 --> 01:27:15,673
- Get her out of here.
- Don't let him treat you that way.

1016
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:18,516
- Shut this parking lot down.
- You a man or a mouse?

1017
01:27:23,627 --> 01:27:28,626
Go to hell, Tunker. Just go to hell, you...
ignorant son of a bitch.

1018
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,534
Let's get these niggers
out of here!

1019
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,492
Mommy!

1020
01:27:57,899 --> 01:27:59,667
Mommy!

1021
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,811
Get 'em out of here!
Get 'em out!

1022
01:28:08,607 --> 01:28:12,087
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1023
01:28:12,193 --> 01:28:15,523
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1024
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:18,827
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1025
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:22,367
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1026
01:28:22,535 --> 01:28:24,841
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1027
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:28,906
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1028
01:28:29,215 --> 01:28:32,367
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1029
01:28:32,528 --> 01:28:35,990
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1030
01:28:36,243 --> 01:28:39,735
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1031
01:28:40,091 --> 01:28:43,267
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1032
01:28:43,442 --> 01:28:46,680
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1033
01:28:52,038 --> 01:28:55,225
Walk, nigger, walk!
Walk, nigger, walk!

1034
01:28:55,436 --> 01:28:58,875
Walk, nigger, walk!

and by God, I'm gonna move you!

01:29:12,152 --> 01:29:15,578
Open up a space to let her through.
We can get her out of here!

1039
01:29:15,966 --> 01:29:19,318
Why you still standing there? You bunch

01:29:19,461 --> 01:29:21,684
and cause trouble without thinkin'
we're gonna do anything about it?

Well, I got news for ya! We are gonna
do somethin' about it, hear me?

It would be years
before I understood

01:31:03,187 --> 01:31:06,995
what standin' in that line
meant to my mother.

1070
01:31:07,215 --> 01:31:10,313
And as I grew older, to me.

50,000 boycotted the

1079
01:31:47,112 --> 01:31:50,744
I knew one.
Her name was Odessa Cotter.

I come to say to you
this afternoon:

1090
01:32:22,179 --> 01:32:24,919
- However difficult the moment...
- Yes, sir.

1091
01:32:24,954 --> 01:32:27,008
however frustrating
the hour...

1092
01:32:27,317 --> 01:32:29,296
it will not be long.

1093
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:34,129
- Because truth crushed to
earth will rise again. - Yes, sir!

1094
01:32:34,324 --> 01:32:36,954
- How long? Not long.
- Yes, sir.

1095
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:40,290
- Because no lie can live forever.
- Yes, sir!

1096
01:32:40,564 --> 01:32:43,264
- How long? Not long.
- Not long.

1097
01:32:43,434 --> 01:32:47,090

what you sow. - Yes, sir.

- How long? Not long!
- Not long.

1099
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,250
Because the arc of the
moral universe is long,

1100
01:32:53,344 --> 01:32:55,777
- but it bends toward justice.
- Yes, sir.

How long?
Not long!
