1
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,091
Boys, let's go.

2
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,729
Come on, tighten it up.

3
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:11,736
Condition unit one!

4
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:13,571
Condition unit one, copy that.

5
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:16,074
On the ground.
Show me hands, let's go.

6
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:17,475
Hands!

7
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,478
<i>Code blue!
Fight in progress!</i>

8
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:46,437
Come on, let's fight, man!
Let him go!

9
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,240
At least let me get my shoes.

10
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:04,522
- Mary Anne.
- Hello.

11
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:06,891
Thank you.

12
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,596
Adonis got into a fight today...

13
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,097
and he's in holding.

14
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:16,367
If you wanna see him,
we're gonna have to go up there.

15
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,037
He's a good kid, he just...

16
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,938
fights.

17
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,808
All the time.

18
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,986
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,021
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

20
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,271
Johnson, got a visitor.

21
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,776
Adonis.

22
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,717
Come on in.

23
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,287
I'd like you to meet Mrs...

24
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,459
Could we have a moment, please?

25
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,894
Sure.

26
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,364
I'll be right outside.

27
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,443
Why were you fighting?

28
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:36,614
I'm not going to another group home.

29
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,684
I'm not from a group home.

30
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,621
- You a social worker?
- No.

31
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:47,125
I am not a social worker.

32
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:56,234
Nigga said something about my ma
so I beat his ass.

33
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,505
I'm sorry about your mother.

34
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:05,209
I know what it's like to lose someone.

35
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:11,015
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

36
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:14,285
I hurt myself, pushed family away.

37
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:16,354
I don't have no father.

38
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:20,358
- What did you say?
- I said I don't have no father.

39
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,694
That's not true.

40
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:28,733
He passed before you were born,
but you had a father.

41
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:32,970
You knew him?

42
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,443
He was my husband.

43
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,480
Adonis, I would like
it very much...

44
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,949
if you would come
and stay with me.

45
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:51,055
Do you think you'd wanna do that?

46
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:05,269
What was his name?

47
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:16,581
<b><u>••• <font color=#FF0000>C R E E ></font> •••.</b></u></b>

48
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:00,878
- Hey, James.
- Don, sit down.

49
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,984
What you got there?

50
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,726
You're joking, right?

51
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,728
You get a promotion
and you're quitting?

52
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,698
Look, this career just ain't for me.

53
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:22,500
What are you gonna do?

54
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,271
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

55
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,424
<i>Just wanna talk to you
about my job.</i>

56
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,893
You see your new office?

57
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,162
Yeah. But...

58
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,064
Well, what's it like?

59
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:56,100
This is a big deal, this promotion.

60
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,970
Did they hire your assistant?

61
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:06,711
- Thank you.
- Very proud of you.

62
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:24,729
<i>Superfight Two
with Rocky Balboa, the challenger...</i>

63
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:28,232
<i>and, of course, Apollo Creed,
the world champion.</i>

64
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,635
<i>And there's the bell.
Comes over in a hurry now.</i>

65
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,603
<i>He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.</i>

66
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,672
<i>He starts to take command
early here...</i>

67
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,942
<i>and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.</i>

68
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,477
<i>A good right hand thrown at him.</i>

69
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,979
<i>Another right and another right
thrown by the champion.</i>

70
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:47,085
<i>Creed is going for the knockout.
Just holding that right hand...</i>

71
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,588
<i>There it is! He unloaded that.
But here comes Balboa!</i>

72
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:52,590
<i>Got him in that corner,
and there's lefts and rights.</i>

73
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:55,626
<i>Here comes Balboa coming back out.
A left and a right to the head.</i>

74
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,462
<i>But now it is Creed coming back.</i>

75
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,564
<i>Creed with the left hand.</i>

76
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:02,633
<i>Balboa appears to be
getting hit often.</i>

77
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,746
Take it to him.
Take it to the body.

78
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,748
There you go!

79
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,183
Make your time count, baby.

80
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:22,153
You know what's coming up.
There you go.

81
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,455
Check it out.

82
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:29,394
- What you doing here, man?
- 15 and 0,15 knockouts.

83
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:32,997
In Tijuana? No, bro.

84
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,932
That's barroom brawling.

85
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,634
Well, I'm all in anyway.

86
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,903
So I figure we start out local,
just to get our momentum going...

87
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,271
then we can move
wherever we wanna move.

88
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,939
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

89
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:45,476
Adonis, these boys come in here,
this how they survive.

90
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,011
They gotta fight for life.

91
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,747
Kill or be killed.
People die in there.

92
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,817
Your daddy died in the ring.
This ain't no joke.

93
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,087
I don't know him.
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

94
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,756
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

95
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,492
Nah, I ain't training you.

96
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,828
You know I ain't training you.
Nobody training you.

97
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:05,563
I'm gonna make sure about that.

98
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,234
We making champs in the Delphi Gym!

99
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:13,538
We not dancing! We not singing!
We fighting!

100
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:16,074
You struggle every day,
you fight for something.

101
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,742
You damn right!

102
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,045
Hey, listen up!

103
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,481
Adonis.

104
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,250
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

105
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,485
Adonis, get out the ring!

106
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:29,454
All you gotta do
is land one clean head shot...

107
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,722
What I gotta put up for it?

108
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,162
Put up your hands.
You a pro, right?

109
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,565
No, no, no.

110
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:42,333
You gonna get the shit
knocked out of you.

111
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,035
You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.

112
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,336
Better listen to your family, boy.

113
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,607
Oh, my God.

114
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,609
At least put on your head gear.

115
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,644
No head gear?

116
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,278
It's good.

117
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,150
Killer, right?

118
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:01,686
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

119
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,288
Where were you at
when I was iin group homes?

120
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,891
- You miss a meal?
- Nah!

121
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,459
Which one of your killers
in here next?

122
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,695
You pick him!
You pick who's next!

123
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,530
I'm next.

124
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,843
Hey, I just need one round, bro.

125
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,578
All right, you wanna warm up?

126
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,914
I don't need no warm-up.
Get my stuff.

127
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,253
I see you got your head gear on.
Good job.

128
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,993
No.

129
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,967
Don't run.

130
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,932
Told you I'd win.
I told you.

131
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,768
I tried to tell you something, bro.
You don't wanna listen.

132
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,403
You don't wanna listen.

133
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:28,306
You wanna learn things
the hard way, huh?

134
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:45,223
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

135
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:48,159
I just came home,
I wanted to talk to you.

136
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:51,663
- Yeah?
- I quit my job.

137
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:02,073
Where did you get this? Mexico?

138
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,408
It's not that bad.

139
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,743
"It's not that bad."

140
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:08,846
I ought to knock you out myself.

141
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,215
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs...

142
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,452
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

143
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,721
How many times I had to wipe his ass
because he couldn't use his hands?

144
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:19,657
Is that what you want? No.

145
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,260
You want brain damage.
Yeah, you do.

146
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:24,429
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

147
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,663
I can get hurt doing anything.

148
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,800
Apollo didn't get hurt, got killed!
People get killed!

149
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:32,337
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

150
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,272
You're better than this.

151
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm leaving soon.

152
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:43,381
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

153
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,250
So I wanted to tell you face-to-face.

154
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:50,989
You are your father's son...

155
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,024
and you're part of him.

156
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,895
But it doesn't mean
you have to be him.

157
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,265
I'm gonna call you.

158
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:07,305
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

159
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,709
you don't have to call me.

160
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,554
All right, smile!

161
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,999
How you doing?

162
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:44,702
This was taken from the 10th round
of the first fight, right?

163
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,871
Good call.

164
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,840
How'd you know that?

165
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:52,343
I heard about a third fight
between you and Apollo...

166
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,479
behind closed doors.

167
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,381
That true?

168
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,349
How'd you hear about that?

169
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,318
Who won?

170
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,889
Its kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

171
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,491
Donnie.

172
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:09,027
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

173
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,795
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about training me.

174
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,630
Training you.

175
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,633
I don't do that stuff no more.
Sorry about that.

176
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,804
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.
So I'm gonna dose up.

177
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,539
How good was he?

178
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,109
Who? Apollo?
Yeah, he was great.

179
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,645
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

180
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,180
So how'd you beat him?

181
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,381
Time beat him.

182
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,918
Time takes everybody out,
it's undefeated.

183
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,320
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

184
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,188
When Mickey died,
he came and talked to you, right?

185
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,757
Talked you out of quitting?

186
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,660
Took you to L.A., trained you...

187
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,462
brought you back.

188
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,706
- How do you know all this?
- How do you think?

189
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:02,613
- What are you, like a cousin?
- He's my father.

190
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:06,150
No, he isn't.
I don't believe you.

191
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,318
Call Mary Anne.

192
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,720
Mary Anne. His wife.

193
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,388
The house number still works.

194
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:15,493
Oh, that's right. You haven't
talked to her since the funeral.

195
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,296
She said you gave
a nice speech, though.

196
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,843
Yeah.

197
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:34,412
Nice speech.

198
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,348
I want you to train me.

199
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,351
I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

200
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,887
You at least owe me that.

201
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,326
I can tell the way you talk,
you been to school.

202
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:51,095
So I figure you got some brains.

203
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,665
Why would you want to pick
a fighter's life...

204
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,199
when you don't have to?

205
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,002
If Apollo was around,
he would tell you that, too.

206
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,437
Well he ain't around.

207
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,540
I been fighting my whole life.
I ain't got a choice.

208
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:05,376
It's always about a choice.

209
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,878
I was in the ring.

210
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:10,114
I saw how it went down.
That fight should've been stopped.

211
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,582
I should have stopped it.

212
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,484
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

213
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,654
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

214
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:21,326
I think he'd rather be here,
talking with you.

215
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,475
There is a resemblance.

216
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:46,017
I'm usually here all the time...

217
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,986
so if you're ever
in the neighborhood, come by...

218
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,287
if you need something.

219
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,155
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

220
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:54,225
I don't go there.
I haven't been there in a long time.

221
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,430
Since we're pretty much like family...

222
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,966
who won the third fight?

223
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,671
He did.

224
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>In boxing...</i>

233

<i>with a seven-year
prison sentence looming.</i>

234
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:08,566
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

235
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,835
<i>I hate letting me family down.</i>

Now it's my turn.

245
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,102
I've never lost.

246
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:47,005
I've never even been knocked down,

<i>A champion in a dark

251
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,989
No respect, man.

252
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm Donnie.

253
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,515
Yeah?

254
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,417
And I just moved in upstairs.

255
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,453
Okay. What do you want, Donnie?
It's late.

256
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:09,887
I can hear your music.

257
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,223
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

258
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:15,226
Well, it is, all right?
I gotta wake up early and work out.

259
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,295
Got you.

260
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:21,232
You gotta wake up early
and do your jawns.

261
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,534
Keep your body tight.

262
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,603
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

263
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,738
Thanks...

264
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:24,429
Snap it back!

265
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,271
Breathe, Leo, breathe.

266
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,340
Good boy.

267
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,984
Hey.

268
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,921
- Can I help you?
- Looking to sign up.

269
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,457
- Where you from?
- L.A.

270
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,691
Hollywood!

271
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,526
Which gym?
I know all those guys.

272
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,563
Don't have one.
I'm more self-taught.

273
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,032
Self-taught?

274
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,368
You know Balboa?

275
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,136
Yes, we grew up together.

276
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:07,438
Most members just work themselves out.

277
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:12,443
For an extra $20 a month, I can give
you drills, check in on you when I can.

278
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,579
Yeah, that works.

279
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,454
Double jab.

280
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,324

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,200
<i>But you can take it all.</i>

287
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:12,370
<i>I might try to run.</i>

288
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,906

<i>Got you right where I want.</i>

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,353

<i>Boxing fans have been waiting years...</i>

298
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:50,675
for the Superfight between "Pretty"
Ricky Conlan and Danny Wheeler.

299
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,178
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

300
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,116
Conlan punched Wheeler after words
were exchanged during the face-off.

301
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,251
Wheeler suffered a broken jaw...

302
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:05,590
<i>and has already announced plans
to sue Conlan and the WBC.</i>

303
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,998
Hey, Unc!

304
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,367
Unc!

305
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,603
How you doing?

306
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,405
Did you call me "Unc"?

307
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,874
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

308
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,642
What's an "O.G."?

309
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,678
Old-ass gangster.

310
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,546
"Unc" is good.

311
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:32,083
- I can do that.
- It's all good.

312
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,118
So why'd you come by?
You hungry?

313
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,388
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.
Figured I'd stop by.

314
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,890
Okay.

315
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:44,362
- Maybe ask you a question.
- Sure. I can do all this.

316
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,467
What are some drills I can do
to get my hand speed up?

317
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,436
Some guys up there,
I bet they can help you.

318
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,539
There's a guy there named Pete.
He's a pretty good trainer.

319
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,442
Yeah, but he's with his fighter
most of the time.

320
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:00,078
I mostly just train myself.

321
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,715
They know you're a Creed?

322
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:07,552
I don't go by that.
I'm trying to make it on my own.

323
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,653
Name's Johnson.

324
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,288
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

325
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,858
Plus, just makes life easier.

326
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,265
Plus, if you train me...

327
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,102
nobody around knows me.
We could fly under the radar.

328
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,538
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

329
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,507
I told you before...

330
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,210
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

331
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,716
Tha's cool, but maybe you could
just give me some drills.

332
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,753
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

333
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,324
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

334
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,292
My God.

335
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,535
All right. I got a few.

336
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,072
- But that's it. Okay?
- Of course.

337
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:05,009
Five rounds of jumping rope.

338
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:09,447
Three rounds on each of the bags...

339
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,848
When you get to the heavy bag...

340
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,018
just don't keep throwing your hands
because you can hurt them.

341
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,854
It's also about
using your legs, all right?

342
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:21,359
And then five rounds of...

343
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,695
shadow...

344
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,662
O-W.

345
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,764
- There's a "W". Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

346
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,100
And that's it.

347
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,402
- All right?
- Yeah.

348
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,037
Okay, here you go.

349
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,172
That is perfect.

350
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,307
Good luck with that.

351
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,079
All right, got it.
Hold that real quick.

352
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,456
All right, man.

353
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,324
Wait, don't you want this?

354
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,625
I got it right here.

355
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,327
What if you lose that
thing or it breaks?

356
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,230
It's already up in the cloud.

357
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,370
What cloud? What cloud?

358
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,140
Hey, Ma, it's me.

359
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,976
I was just calling to let you know
I'm doing good...

360
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,978
and I got an apartment.

361
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,881
<i>It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.</i>

362
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,816
<i>I miss you.</i>

363
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,451
<i>I wanna hear from you...</i>

364
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,454
so call me back when you get a chance.
All right.

365
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,942
What, it's too loud?

366
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,579
No, I just heard you down here working.

367
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,149
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

368
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,717
Maybe get some food?

369
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,453
- Where you from, Donnie?
- I'm from L.A.

370
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,222
So is this how y'all ask
females out in L.A.?

371
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,224
Just wanted to know
if you were hungry.

372
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,927
- Not a date.
- Right.

373
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,532
You know what? It's all good.

374
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,367
It's okay.

375
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,235
Hey, yo.

376
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,438
I am hungry.

377
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,646
I only have an hour.
Do you know where you wanna go?

378
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,316
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're from Philly, right?

379
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,421
Okay.

380
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,061
Good luck, man.

381
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,077
- So where are we?
- North Philly.

382
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,345
So this is Max's.

383
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,981
Hey, superstar!
What's going on?

384
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,583
I'm well, thanks.
How you doing?

385
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,586
- You looking wonderful as always.
- Thank you.

386
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,520
How you doing there, my friend?

387
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,223
This my neighbor
and he's a West Coast boy.

388
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,591
Ain't never had a steak before.

389
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,559
Listen, I'm gonna treat him
like he was my neighbor.

390
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,194
That's how good
we gonna take care of you.

391
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,763
- You like pickles?
- Nah.

392
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,964
Okay, mayonnaise.

393
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,400
Put some peppers on that jawn,
both kinds.

394
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,735
Ketchup, extra cheese.

395
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,437
- How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

396
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,172
No, let me get these.

397
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,374
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

398
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,677
You said it wasn't a date, though.

399
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,312
It's not.

400
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,748
- Where we eating at?
- Right there.

401
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,917
<i>So I heard you back there,
"jawn" this, "jawn" that.</i>

402
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,753
- What's a "jawn"?
- It's a noun.

403
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,589
See, these is jawns.

404
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,458
This is a jawn.

405
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,593
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

406
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,462
You got a jawn?

407
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,165
- Like, a dude?
- No.

408
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,600
I got too much going on right now.

409
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,337
- Shows and stuff?
- Yeah.

410
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,505
I'm opening
Electric Factory next month.

411
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,075
- What's that?
- It's a big venue out here.

412
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,845
A lot of people got their start.
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

413
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,281
That's wassup.

414
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,019
Can I ask you something personal?

415
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,493
I got progressive hearing loss.

416
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,463
Just started wearing
these this past year.

417
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,232
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

418
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,767
For now.

419
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,070
So it's progressive, so eventually...

420
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,972
Yeah.

421
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,608
Yeah.

422
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,243
I'm just getting ready for it.

423
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,580
Like I'm getting used to these,
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

424
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:41,019
But I really can only
remember bad words.

425
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,621
Ones that aren't that useful like...

426
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,059
The fuck's that?

427
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:52,096
You cant tell? This is the bull,
the horns, this is...

428
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,632
Yeah, this is bullshit.

429
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,701
That's your favorite?

430
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,138
You don't really seem
like a boxer to me.

431
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,939
You're in shape and all but...

432
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,642
I don't know.
Aren't most boxers like...

433
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,577
- Like what?
- Like street.

434
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,680
I'm not saying you're
a square or anything...

435
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,182
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

436
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,817
My pop was a fighter.

437
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,919
Right. That makes sense.

438
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,487
Did he fight pro?

439
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,656
Something like that.

440
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,359
Does he train you?

441
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,528
My pop died before I was born.

442
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,233
I'm sorry to hear that.

443
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,404
So what made you wanna sing?

444
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,381
It makes me feel alive.

445
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,286
Where's your next show?

446
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,756
That place that you saw me at,
Johnny Brenda's.

447
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:56,294
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

448
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,999
Can I roll with you?

449
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,268
I wanna show up, you know.
Show some love.

450
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,207
Let me think on it.

451
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,698
Okay.

452
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,334
Here we go, Paulie.

453
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,204
Happy birthday, my friend.

454
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,941
I didn't forget ya.

455
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,511
Your favorite.

456
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,180
Miss ya, pal.

457
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,784
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

458
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,688
The best of the best.

459
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,591
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

460
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,964
It's getting harder to walk up
this hill. What does that mean?

461
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,768
Anyway, it's a good day today.
It's a good day, got no problems.

462
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,437
Bills are paid.

463
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,908
Only thing is, it's tough to
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

464
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,211
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

465
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:25,416
Anyway, shall we see
what's new in the world today?

466
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,860
- Hey, Rocky!
- Hey, how you doing?

467
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,561
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

468
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,664
Hey, Rock!
Long time no see, brother.

469
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,832
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

470
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,001
- Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.
- How you doing?

471
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,936
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

472
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,938
- Welcome back, man. It's been a while.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

473
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,307
- How do you feel?
- Good.

474
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,008
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

475
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,977
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

476
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,012
- Didn't know you were coming by.
- I didn't either.

477
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,814
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

478
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,383
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

479
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,885
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

480
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,053
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

481
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,021
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

482
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,790
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky...

483
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,692
he's 17 and 0.

484
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,493
Things are really opening up for us.

485
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,362
Leo!

486
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,534
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

487
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,703
Little training, little motivation.

488
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,605
- Let me think about it.
- Sure, sure.

489
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,574
- How you doing, kid?
- It's an honor to meet you, champ.

490
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,776
Nice to meet you, too.
17 and 0, very good.

491
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,611
Yeah, I was supposed to
fight under Ricky Conlan's card...

492
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,247
- but it got cancelled.
- Hey, Unc!

493
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,683
Unc.

494
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,785
- He talking to you?
- Yeah. I think so Yeah.

495
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,087
- You made it.
- Yeah.

496
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,856
Just walked by. Here I am.

497
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,027
- How you know Hollywood?
- We met at the restaurant.

498
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,463
That's it.

499
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,768
Okay, Rock. Okay.

500
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,437
You need anything,
you let me know.

501
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,440
- Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.
- Thanks.

502
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,678
17 and 0. Kid's got a future.
Tough.

503
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,847
Can I talk to you a minute?

504
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,821
I don't even know
what I'm doing here

505
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,090
because I got other
plans for my life...

506
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,759
and this wasn't part of it.

507
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,727
Your father was special.

508
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,030
Tell you the truth,
I don't know if you're special.

509
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,332
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

510
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,000
It ain't gonna come overnight.

511
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,802
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this...

512
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,737
you're gonna get knocked down,
you're gonna get up...

513
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,873
and you're gonna see
if you got the right thing.

514
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,876
But, you gotta work hard.

515
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,080
I swear to God,
if you're not gonna do it, I'm out.

516
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,517
Every punch I've ever thrown
has been on my own.

517
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,420
Nobody showed me how to do this.

518
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,189
I'm ready.

519
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,827
Come on.
Let's do this.

520
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,463
Step into my office.

521
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,431
You serious?

522
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,599
I am serious.
This is old school.

523
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,468
You should be able to grab
one of these birds.

524
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,705
- 30 seconds?
- Yeah, in your dreams.

525
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,208
Come on! You call that fast?

526
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,251
No! Again.

527
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,920
I thought you were fast.

528
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,588
Come here!

529
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,124
Get them legs moving!

530
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,926
Little harder, little faster!

531
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,930
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

532
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,342
Control your tempo
then build slowly.

533
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,411
More.

534
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,513
Build, build, build.

535
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,115
Go!

536
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,197
That bell don't mean school's
out, Donnie. Keep going.

537
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,833
That bell means hell.

538
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,636
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

539
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,238
Come here! God damn it!

540
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:43,207
Oh, my God!

541
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,811
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

542
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,815
All right, Donnie,
get into your stance.

543
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,485
Make a small target,
turn sideways. Okay.

544
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,088
You see this guy here
staring back at you?

545
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:57,889
Yeah.

546
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,691
That's your toughest opponent.

547
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:03,394
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

548
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:08,032
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

549
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,101
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

550
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,869
All right, one to the gut.

551
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,505
Now, every time you punch this guy,
what's he doing?

552
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,040
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

553
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:20,144
So either you block it, slip it
or get out of the way. Go.

554
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:27,185
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

555
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,054
Good luck.

556
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,465
- Hey.
- Yo.

557
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,134
What's up? Is it cool?

558
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,569
Yes.

559
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,738
Smells good in here.

560
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:52,143
I don't even know what fighters drink.
Do you drink tea?

561
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,978
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

562
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,613
Yeah.

563
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,817
- So this is the house.
- This is it.

564
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,054
What you working on?

565
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,859
<i>Hey.</i>

566
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,994
<i>Hey.</i>

567
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:15,833
<i>This your boy Donnie
From L.A. to Philly.</i>

568
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,936
<i>Philly, the home of the cheesesteaks.</i>

569
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,772
<i>Oh, I want a cheesesteak.</i>

570
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,908
<i>I'm so hungry
Hungry for the title.</i>

571
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,244
<i>I'll settle for a cheesecake.</i>

572
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,714
<i>Cheesecake, the cake that you make
The cake that you got.</i>

573
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,382
- Where the beat go?
- Sorry.

574
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,856
Hey, check you out.

575
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,264
Yeah!

576
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,231
<i>One, two, three.</i>

577
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,735
I like that. Very good.

578
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,873
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

579
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,243
Donnie, get up.
You gotta keep moving.

580
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:36,881
It's tough but you gotta do it.
You get a "B" in tough.

581
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,017
Kid's looking good, champ!

582
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,020
Yeah, he's getting there.

583
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,291
Hey, Hollywood,
what do you weigh right now?

584
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,694
I don't know, probably like 180.

585
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,763
Why?

586
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,437
Get down to a buck 75, we'll make
something happen, if you're interested.

587
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,638
- Hell yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

588
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:03,374
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

589
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:06,544
175? That's your boy's weight.

590
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,545
How you doing, Leo?

591
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,280
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

592
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,848
He could use a fight to keep warm.

593
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,650
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

594
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,919
People will come out to see you
in the corner again, champ.

595
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:18,022
We'll make it like the old days.
Get the whole city there.

596
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:19,691
Make a few bucks for everybody.

597
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:20,825
No, I understand that.

598
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,361
But I'm just getting used
to this kid right now,

599
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,263
and he's getting
better every day...

600
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,031
but he's gonna take a while.

601
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,032
He's hungry.

602
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,835
You gotta feed him every now and again.
You know that.

603
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:34,205
Thanks. I appreciate it, chef.
We'll be okay. Thanks.

604
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:36,975
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

605
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,544
Rock, what we training for?

606
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:40,812
Yeah, what are we training for?

607
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,548
We're training to win, not get killed.
You're not ready yet.

608
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,383
I can lose five pounds.
I can lose five pounds like that.

609
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,918
It's nothing, It's easy.

610
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,087
Hit the bag.

611
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,190
Come on.

612
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,493
This kid's like a tough
Philadelphia fighter.

613
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,495
I ain't never even seen you
battle before.

614
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,398
Yeah, but I've watching him,
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

615
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,567
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

616
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,902
- Okay.
- All right, listen.

617
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,272
Let me make you an offer
you can't refuse.

618
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:08,172
Are you crazy?

619
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,575
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

620
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:11,209
Right.

621
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:14,612
I got six weeks to get in shape.
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it takes.

622
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,714
At the end of the six weeks, you
don't think it's right, call it off.

623
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:17,415
Really?

624
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:21,486
This is what I'm here for, all right?
I'll go 24/7 with this shit.

625
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,955
Matter of fact,
we can go get my stuff right now.

626
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:26,257
- For what?
- So I can move into your spot.

627
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,393
Start training camp.
Old school, remember?

628
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,228
No, no one's been in my house
in a long time...

629
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,096
and I don't think
you'd be comfortable there.

630
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,898
What, you walk around naked?

631
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,233
No.

632
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:37,035
We're good then.

633
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,216
You better not walk
around naked either.

634
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,484
That's for sure.

635
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,596
- Last one?
- Yeah, that's all of it.

636
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,065
Hey!

637
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,633
Hey!

638
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,068
You're moving?

639
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,705
Yeah, today's been crazy.
I didn't get a chance to tell you...

640
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,673
but I'm gonna be living
with my uncle for a while,

641
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:16,674
training for the next fight.

642
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:17,976
That's your uncle?

643
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,377
He's white.

644
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,679
Yeah, a long time.

645
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,083
He's gonna be staying with me,
and when we ain't training...

646
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,251
you're welcome to come on over.

647
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,021
Cool, thank you.
I'ts nice to meet you.

648
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,760
Why you giving me that look?

649
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,130
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

650
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,399
I'm gonna call you.

651
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:44,102
All right, I'm not gonna
hold my breath.

652
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,744
<i>That Bianca girl looks kind of nice.</i>

653
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,711
You like her?

654
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:55,546
Yeah, she cool.
What, this one?

655
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,748
Yeah.

656
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:59,017
Women weaken legs.
You know what I mean?

657
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,552
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

658
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:03,521
- It's Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

659
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:06,257
Paulie was my best friend
even though he wasn't so friendly.

660
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:08,359
What happened to him?

661
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,395
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

662
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,896
Kind of a mess.
We'll straighten it up later.

663
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,198
It'll be comfortable.

664
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:17,969
Oh, man, this is a dope pic!
That's your boy?

665
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,505
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

666
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,477
- Did you train him, too?
- I tried...

667
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:30,581
but he just didn't like fighting,
didn't take to it.

668
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:33,084
He still around here?

669
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,721
No, he moved to a place called
Vancouver with his girlfriend.

670
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:39,590
I think they're having a grand old time
up there...

671
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,793
and I hear from him
now and then...

672
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,963
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

673
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:48,433
Me and all that stuff...
Rocky's son.

674
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:52,337
He's happy.
I'm happy for him.

675
00:47:56,941 --> 00:48:00,511
Why don't you unpack, all right?
Make yourself comfortable.

676
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,848
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant
and I'll be back.

677
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,017
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

678
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,719
You got it.

679
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,571
All right, Paulie!

680
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:55,233
<i>Baby love you.</i>

681
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,369
Hey, if s time to train.
This is how you start.

682
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:01,072
Get your engine going.

683
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:10,949
I'm gonna take you
to this place called

684
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:12,717
the Front Street Gym
up in North Philly.

685
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,185
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

686
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:15,119
You're gonna train there,

687
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,055
because I don't want you to
train in the same place...

688
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:19,290
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

689
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,525
Yeah, that makes sense.

690
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,194
Don, don't get in.
I want you to run alongside.

691
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,829
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

692
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:27,298
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

693
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:30,501
- How close is it?
- It's close enough.

694
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,236
All right.

695
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,976
Hey, wait!
Let me warm up real quick.

696
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,129
You made it. Hey.

697
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,931
I tought you said it was close.

698
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:04,535
Not that close.
This is Frankford. Tough place.

699
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:09,107
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
is the place to go.

700
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:13,778
Philly fighters, I think they're
the toughest guys in the world.

701
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,981
In a lot of ways. Maybe
it's in the water, I don't know...

702
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:18,883
but great place though.

703
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,586
- What's up with all these bikes?
- It's a Philly thing.

704
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,655
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

705
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,856
going up and down the street.

706
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,124
Do you ride?

707
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:30,628
No. I had a Harley once but I fell off,
so I decided to use my feet.

708
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:33,364
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

709
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:37,101
He's no pushover, so you're gonna
have to work, you know what I mean?

710
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,704
What do you think?

711
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:42,507
- Not bad?
- Not bad at all.

712
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:47,545
Yeah. This'll get the job done.
Really will.

713
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,315
Look at these guys!

714
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:53,217
Hey! The gang's all here!

715
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:58,356
Donnie, look at this.
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

716
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,125
- Hey, Padman. Good to see you.
- Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

717
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,962
This guy is so good with the mitts,
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

718
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:05,296
He's got a lot of knowledge.

719
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,498
And Stitch, best cut
man in Philadelphia.

720
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,700
Hope we don't need him.

721
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,201
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

722
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,302
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work wit you.

723
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:15,006
And over here is Elvis Grant.
He makes the best gloves in the world.

724
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,842
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot...

725
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,910
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

726
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,146
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves
so what your hands don't get so bad...

727
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,716
- What? Is that coffee I smell in there?
- Yeah, that's coffee.

728
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,250
All right, you guys
get to know each other.

729
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,418
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

730
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,020
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

731
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,355
Let me introduce you to my son.

732
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,223
This is my son, Amir. That's the
one you're gonna be sparring with.

733
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,224
- Amir.
- What's up? Donnie.

734
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,525
Nice to meet you.

735
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,501
Right hand fast.

736
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,637
Let it go, let it go.

737
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:49,073
Push off that back foot.

738
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:50,575
Come on, Donnie,
a little quicker.

739
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,811
Come on, Donnie. Back it up.
No, just like he's doing. Yeah.

740
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:55,780
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

741
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,482
That's your power.

742
00:51:57,982 --> 00:51:59,217
Fast, pop it fast.

743
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,151
I'm popping as fast as I can.

744
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:01,986
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

745
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:04,555
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

746
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,325
I came out hew
to work with you, though.

747
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,795
This is how I work, okay?
There's some things I can't do.

748
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:13,531
I can't do this anymore.
I can never hold the pads like that.

749
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,667
But I'm looking at you.
I m working with you.

750
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,335
I'm working with this.

751
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,903
Lighten it up.

752
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:20,305
Am I still taking them real shots?

753
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,141
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

754
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,610
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

755
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,545
This easy work, Pop.

756
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,082
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

757
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,152
Time! Bell! Bell!

758
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:35,353
Taking real shots thought!

759
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:36,988
What you mean?

760
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,589
- Cut it out!
- Take those gloves off right now!

761
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:39,891
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

762
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:43,628
Take your soft ass back to L.A.!
You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

763
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,697
Fuck this gym!

764
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,532
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no way.

765
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,667
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

766
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:52,570
You can't learn anything when you're
talking. That's a fact of life.

767
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:54,706
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

768
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:58,810
Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?

769
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:02,380
- There you go. Good.
- You good. It's okay.

770
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:04,582
All right. Now let's go to work!

771
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,484
Double jab. Yup.

772
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:07,986
Go ahead over the top.

773
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,221
Right hook here. Over here.

774
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,459
One step at a time,
one punch at a time...

775
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:15,560
one round at a time.

776
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,495
One step at a time,
one punch at a time...

777
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,597
one round at a time.
Turn right.

778
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:23,735
Come on, let's go.

779
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:25,069
Fast, pop it fast.

780
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,505
Right upper cut. Right up top.

781
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:34,312
Good.

782
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,447
I want you to let it all out.

783
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,082
Now right here.

784
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,485
Everyone's ever disrespected you,
see them.

785
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:42,687
Anything you ever wanted...

786
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:44,656
go after it.

787
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:50,061
Now's your time!
Make a statement!

788
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:53,331
One step!

789
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,800
One punch!

790
00:53:57,135 --> 00:53:58,703
One round at a time!

791
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,146
There it is.

792
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,448
You cheated!

793
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:25,830
- Rock.
- Hey, how you doing, Pete?

794
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,703
Something wrong?

795
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,307
Rock, I knew. I knew
there was something with this kid.

796
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:39,611
Rocky, I have been trying for years
to get you to come work with us.

797
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:40,311
It's okay.

798
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:42,080
All of a sudden, this
kid from Hollywood

799
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:43,281
gets you out of the shadows.

800
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:45,149
No. No shadows.

801
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,685
I just didn't want to do nothing
in the gym, that's all.

802
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:50,655
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

803
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:53,891
Kid's name is Adonis.
Kid has Creed's blood.

804
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:57,061
Now this fight just got big time.

805
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:00,231
I apologize.

806
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:03,568
Do me a favor.
Can we keep this between ourselves?

807
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,669
- Come on.
- No.

808
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:06,204
I'm asking you as a favor.

809
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:08,706
I want him to make
a name on his own.

810
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,544
Come on, Pete.

811
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,217
Yeah. Secret's safe
with me, Rock.

812
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,388
I appreciate it.

813
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,598
Keep going.
You're looking good.

814
00:55:34,299 --> 00:55:36,067
Go on, get moving.

815
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:57,155
Hey. So how's everybody
feeling tonight?

816
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,625
I'm about to go over the ABC rules
and the rules governed by the state.

817
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:03,428
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

818
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,530
A fighter cannot be
saved by the bell.

819
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,699
What we mean
by "no three knockdown rule"...

820
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:11,669
is basically whatever the referee
sees fit for competition.

821
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,210
Unc, cut my gloves off.

822
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,379
- What's wrong?
- My gloves, just cut 'em off!

823
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:22,947
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

824
00:56:22,981 --> 00:56:23,982
Are they too tight?

825
00:56:24,082 --> 00:56:26,584
I'm freaking out right now!
I gotta take a shit!

826
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,920
Somebody gonna wipe
my ass for me?

827
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,788
- Oh, shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

828
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:32,523
All right, relax.

829
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,292
I'll cut you out of these gloves.
It happens.

830
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:36,094
Hey, ref, I'm gonna
need some help here.

831
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:39,364
- D, I'm gonna be right outside.
- That's right.

832
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:41,199
Can you just stall for
10 minutes or something?

833
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,267
I gotta put the gloves back on.

834
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,969
- All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.
- I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

835
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:46,337
It ain't no problem.
You got 10 minutes.

836
00:56:46,371 --> 00:56:46,938
First for me.

837
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,706
All right, come on.
It'll be all right.

838
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,907
Yeah.

839
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:51,542
A little nervous?

840
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,011
Nerves?

841
00:56:53,044 --> 00:56:54,312
Hurry up!

842
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,752
Blue corner, red corner.

843
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,489
All right, fellows, y'all had
your intructions in the dressing room.

844
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:07,926
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

845
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:11,162
Any questions from the blue corner?
Questions from the red corner?

846
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:13,231
Touch them up.
Be ready on seconds out.

847
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,967
- Right It's about you.
- Yep Yep.

848
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,102
It's all about you.
Now, you wanted this.

849
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,371
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

850
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:21,539
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

851
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:23,474
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

852
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:25,410
Let's go, Unc.

853
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,880
It's all about today!

854
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:32,183
There is no tomorrow!
Let's go!

855
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:34,552
Nice!

856
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,456
Move and target, move and target!

857
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,959
Jab! Get the jab!

858
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:44,295
His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?

859
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,768
Hands up. Hands up, kid.

860
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,345
Breathe, kid, breathe!

861
00:58:05,717 --> 00:58:08,286
Let's go, boy!
Let's go, boy!

862
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,088
Way to get out of there.

863
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:11,556
Keep moving, Donnie!

864
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:14,726
Move your head! That's it.

865
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:16,361
Get on him! Get on him!

866
00:58:20,732 --> 00:58:22,033
Break! My break!

867
00:58:23,134 --> 00:58:24,469
Let's go, boy!

868
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:28,039
The you go!
There you go! Good.

869
00:58:28,106 --> 00:58:28,673
Back off.

870
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,843
Leo! Leo! Leo!

871
00:58:32,477 --> 00:58:34,078
One punch on top.

872
00:58:38,216 --> 00:58:41,185
Keep moving. That's right.
Block left. Block left.

873
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,559
Relax.

874
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,695
Let's go, boy!
Come get this shit! Come get it!

875
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:53,231
You're doing good, kid!
Keep the pressure up!

876
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,171
Break!

877
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:01,739
Let's go, Leo!

878
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:02,707
Come on!

879
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,741
Let's go.

880
00:59:03,775 --> 00:59:05,677
Keep moving!
Keep coming forward!

881
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,378
Great shot!

882
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:10,848
Come on, Donnie!

883
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:15,420
What are you doing?

884
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:18,056
Time!

885
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:23,194
Okay! All right.

886
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:27,999
It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Through your lungs. Deep breath.

887
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:31,069
Look at me, I like what
you doing out there, all right?

888
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:33,371
You're a little tight.
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

889
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:37,108
Here's what I want you to do. I want
you to throw your left under the radar.

890
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,643
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

891
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,946
You're gonna see an opening, put it
right on his chin, that'll drop him...

892
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,415
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

893
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,651
Your old man did that to me.
It worked.

894
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:48,920
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

895
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:53,291
Leol Leo! Leo!

896
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:03,935
Come on!

897
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,213
Come on!

898
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,061
Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!

899
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:31,596
Break!

900
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:34,232
Come on!

901
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:39,404
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

902
01:00:42,774 --> 01:00:44,809
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on, kid! Come on!

903
01:00:44,842 --> 01:00:46,644
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

904
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:48,046
Three! Four!

905
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,213
We got him, Rock!

906
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:50,214
Five! Six!

907
01:00:51,683 --> 01:00:52,584
Seven! Eight!

908
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:54,586
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

909
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:55,620
That's it, baby!

910
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:57,355
We got one, Rock!

911
01:00:57,388 --> 01:01:01,492
- We got one! Yeah, we got!
- Unbelievable!

912
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:02,961
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

913
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:05,430
Come on, man! You did it.

914
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:08,766
- You okay?
- Give him some room. Rock. Rock. Rock.

915
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,368
Lucky shot.

916
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,403
Come on in! Bianca!
Bianca! Come in!

917
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:16,040
Sorry! Sorry!

918
01:01:16,975 --> 01:01:19,177
You didn't say you had hands like that!

919
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,579
Why didn't you say
you had hands like that, though?

920
01:01:21,613 --> 01:01:24,782
Well, but girl, I'm square though.
I'm square though.

921
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:26,718
You good?
What we doing after this?

922
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,619
Let's go for it.

923
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:29,120
- Let's got tear the city up!
- Okay.

924
01:04:14,452 --> 01:04:15,954
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

925
01:04:15,987 --> 01:04:18,323
No, don't do that.
I'm right here.

926
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,068
What's up?

927
01:04:30,101 --> 01:04:32,604
You got something
you wanna tell me?

928
01:04:43,915 --> 01:04:45,350
I didn't lie.

929
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:47,852
You might as well have. You told me
that your dad was some fighter.

930
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:49,754
You didn't say he was
the most famous fighter ever lived.

931
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:51,623
People look at me differently
when they know.

932
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:55,093
- They look at Apollo differently too.
- Yeah, Donnie. But I'm not people.

933
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:56,427
I don't care about that shit.

934
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:58,963
I do care about you
keeping it 100% with me, though.

935
01:04:58,997 --> 01:05:01,866
Well, listen.
You're right, okay?

936
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:04,335
No, seriously, look. You...

937
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:08,806
100% honesty from here on out.

938
01:05:10,275 --> 01:05:13,811
All right. So his...
His wife, tht's not your mom?

939
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,249
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

940
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,551
All right?
She died when I was young.

941
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:23,821
I bounced around foster care
for a couple years.

942
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:26,591
In and out of juvie.

943
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:29,427
Then Mary Anne tracked me down
and took me in.

944
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:32,263
Anything else?

945
01:05:34,399 --> 01:05:35,667
Ask me.

946
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:38,803
How many females
have you been with before me?

947
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:40,905
Anything else?

948
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:43,574
Look, Bianca, come on now,
you different.

949
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:44,442
How?

950
01:05:44,475 --> 01:05:47,245
When I'm around you I feel like
I know you my whole life.

951
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:49,914
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

952
01:05:49,948 --> 01:05:52,083
Whatever. That's in passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

953
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,385
- I can't see that happening.
- Why not?

954
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:56,654
- You motivate me.
- Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

955
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:58,122
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

956
01:05:58,156 --> 01:06:00,158
No, I'm gonna find the real
in what you're saying.

957
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,331
Don't worry, it's cool.
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

958
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,066
Oh, really?

959
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,435
I don't mind that.

960
01:06:12,837 --> 01:06:14,038
What?

961
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:19,777
- You do look like him, though.
- Oh, my God. I hate that!

962
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:21,746
Just to get on my nerves!

963
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:29,053
<i>Welcome to PTI, boys and girls.
We begin today with the boxing world.</i>

964
01:06:29,087 --> 01:06:30,188
<i>Adonis Johnson...</i>

965
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:33,024
<i>a little-known boxer
being trained by Rocky Balboa...</i>

966
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,792
<i>handed light heavyweight
title contender...</i>

967
01:06:34,826 --> 01:06:39,464
<i>Leo Sporino a second-round TKO
defeat in Philadelphia last night.</i>

968
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:42,166
<i>An anonymous source confirmed
to ESPN that Johnson...</i>

969
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,970
<i>is the youngest biological son
of Apollo Creed.</i>

970
01:06:46,037 --> 01:06:47,839
<i>Fact that was kept
under wraps because...</i>

971
01:06:47,872 --> 01:06:50,108
<i>Johnson was the product
of Creed's infidelity.</i>

972
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:52,777
<i>The boxing world is excited to have
another Creed in the ring...</i>

973
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:57,348
<i>but, Wilbon, does knowledge of this
affair damage Apollo Creed's legacy?</i>

974
01:06:57,382 --> 01:06:57,815
<i>Damage his legacy?</i>

975
01:06:57,849 --> 01:07:00,952
<i>Let's go back for a second.
A little history on Apollo Creed.</i>

976
01:07:00,985 --> 01:07:04,422
<i>I certainly have him right up there,
as maybe the best of all time.</i>

977
01:07:04,455 --> 01:07:05,456
<i>End of discussion.</i>

978
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,258
<i>He slipped. He made a mistake,
like a lot of people.</i>

979
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:09,761
<i>This isn't gonna be the first,
particularly in the boxing world!</i>

980
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:10,395
<i>Yeah.</i>

981
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:12,563
<i>But I'm not gonna say
it's gonna kill his legacy!</i>

982
01:07:12,597 --> 01:07:14,299
<i>I think it's an embarrassment...</i>

983
01:07:14,332 --> 01:07:16,801
<i>and I think the family must have felt
this embarrassment...</i>

984
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:19,037
<i>because they kept it
under wraps for so long.</i>

985
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,872
<i>- But I really have one question.
- What?</i>

986
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:23,508
<i>Can the kid fight
as well as the old man?</i>

987
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:24,842
<i>That's a stretch.</i>

988
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:29,514
<i>I found us our next payday.</i>

989
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:33,184
Check it out.

990
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,588
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

991
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:38,222
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

992
01:07:38,256 --> 01:07:39,624
He's got one fight under his belt.

993
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:43,861
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

994
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:46,798
No one cares about
Balboa anymore.

995
01:07:46,831 --> 01:07:49,500
Kid's here because of a name alone.

996
01:07:49,534 --> 01:07:51,035
You're gonna do it.

997
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,637
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

998
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,673
Listen to me.
This is not a negotiation, all right?

999
01:07:55,707 --> 01:07:56,941
You're the idiot that ran around.

1000
01:07:57,008 --> 01:07:59,877
Toxteth with a gun.
Do you remember that?

1001
01:08:00,178 --> 01:08:03,715
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in...

1002
01:08:03,748 --> 01:08:07,418
and lost us millions in the process.
Millions, okay? So look at it again.

1003
01:08:10,288 --> 01:08:14,659
- I don't wanna be remembered like this.
- I don't care how you're remembered.

1004
01:08:14,726 --> 01:08:18,229
I care about your kids having a roof
over their head when you're done.

1005
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,164
Do you understand?

1006
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:30,041
Hello?

1007
01:08:30,074 --> 01:08:33,378
It's Tommy Holiday.
I look after Ricky Conlan.

1008
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,682
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Listen.

1009
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:40,318
Is it true about the kid?

1010
01:08:42,053 --> 01:08:44,055
About the kid?

1011
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:51,195
Think you and the kid have got
30 minutes for a business meeting?

1012
01:08:53,498 --> 01:08:56,901
All right, I'll tell you what.
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1013
01:08:56,935 --> 01:09:01,573
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta
be fast because we're training.

1014
01:09:01,606 --> 01:09:03,441
<i>- I can be there. Couple of days.
- Yeah.</i>

1015
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:04,909
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1016
01:09:04,943 --> 01:09:06,644
Okay.

1017
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:13,051
Oh, man.

1018
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:16,054
<i>Thanks for taking the time.
I'll be right to it.</i>

1019
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:19,691
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months...

1020
01:09:20,592 --> 01:09:22,660
and we've beaten everybody.

1021
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:25,597
You want me to fight Conlan?

1022
01:09:25,697 --> 01:09:27,699
I think it would be
a very wise move.

1023
01:09:27,865 --> 01:09:30,134
You've been down in Mexico
doing pro fights?

1024
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:32,337
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1025
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,772
And with the Sporino fight,
that makes you 16-0.

1026
01:09:34,806 --> 01:09:40,445
Now, nobody needs to know these fights
* on some hole in the wall, do they?

1027
01:09:43,815 --> 01:09:45,316
You think I'm ready?

1028
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:48,119
Donnie, this man came here
because he knows you're a sure thing.

1029
01:09:48,152 --> 01:09:51,356
- Right? It's a sure victory.
- That is not true.

1030
01:09:52,991 --> 01:09:54,859
Yeah, it is.

1031
01:09:57,629 --> 01:09:58,730
Okay, listen.

1032
01:09:58,763 --> 01:10:00,431
All right.

1033
01:10:01,132 --> 01:10:04,302
This could be my guy's last fight.

1034
01:10:04,335 --> 01:10:07,705
And I wanna make it count.
Now, on that note...

1035
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:11,843
We would need you to change
your name to Creed. It's just a formality.

1036
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:19,050
And what if I say no?

1037
01:10:20,285 --> 01:10:24,322
Well, then... there's no fight.
Without the name, there's no fight.

1038
01:10:24,355 --> 01:10:26,224
It's a non-starter.

1039
01:10:27,592 --> 01:10:29,027
Okay. Okay.

1040
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:32,630
Why don't you both take a day,
talk about it...

1041
01:10:32,697 --> 01:10:35,934
and we'll see what you say, okay?

1042
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:38,536
It's a good deal.

1043
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:41,906
Can't do it.
Nah, it's not my name.

1044
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:46,344
And plus, I wanna make it
on my own merit anyway.

1045
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,079
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1046
01:10:48,112 --> 01:10:50,682
You got a funny way of showing it.

1047
01:10:50,815 --> 01:10:52,016
What's that supposed to mean?

1048
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,619
I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky
like best friends?

1049
01:10:54,652 --> 01:10:58,189
It feels like you're trying to tap
into whatever it is he left behind.

1050
01:10:58,222 --> 01:11:01,492
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1051
01:11:01,526 --> 01:11:05,063
- What are you afraid of?
- What are you afraid of?

1052
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,598
I don't know.

1053
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:09,567
I mean this hearing shit
don't scare you?

1054
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:13,972
I always knew it would
happen eventually...

1055
01:11:14,405 --> 01:11:17,175
so my plan has always just been...

1056
01:11:17,475 --> 01:11:20,144
to do what I love
for as long as I can.

1057
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:24,816
I think that's all we ever do.
You know?

1058
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,953
So, what are you afraid of?

1059
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:33,591
I'm afraid of taking on the name
and losing.

1060
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,694
They'll call me a fraud.
Fake Creed.

1061
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:39,230
Why don't you think
about what's true?

1062
01:11:39,664 --> 01:11:41,899
You love to fight, right?

1063
01:11:43,868 --> 01:11:46,404
- Yeah, it makes you happy, right?
- Yeah.

1064
01:11:46,437 --> 01:11:50,141
Yeah, and you are
Apollo Creed's son, right?

1065
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:55,346
- Yes.
- So then use the name.

1066
01:11:56,347 --> 01:11:58,349
It's yours.

1067
01:12:12,697 --> 01:12:15,566
- Hey, Unc, you down there?
- Yeah.

1068
01:12:25,977 --> 01:12:28,646
I know you don't want me
to do this, right?

1069
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,183
I can think of better
things to do, Donnie.

1070
01:12:32,216 --> 01:12:34,085
But if we did do it...

1071
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:37,221
how we get it done?

1072
01:12:45,697 --> 01:12:47,332
Well...

1073
01:12:51,269 --> 01:12:55,473
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1074
01:12:55,506 --> 01:12:58,343
Definitely has a lot more
experience than you.

1075
01:12:58,376 --> 01:13:02,213
And he's faster than you are.
He's the champion.

1076
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,816
And since he's the champion...

1077
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:07,952
you gotta bring the fight to him,
like I did.

1078
01:13:07,986 --> 01:13:12,257
You gotta go to the body. Dig.
And in doing that...

1079
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:17,228
you're in a very dangerous place
because you can get laid out.

1080
01:13:17,729 --> 01:13:20,932
It ain't easy for me
to be in your corner, kid.

1081
01:13:21,532 --> 01:13:25,970
I don't know if you're ready for it.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1082
01:13:27,272 --> 01:13:29,540
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1083
01:13:29,607 --> 01:13:32,410
If it was anybody else in my corner...

1084
01:13:32,443 --> 01:13:34,279
I wouldn't do it.

1085
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,782
But I got you.

1086
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:43,021
So make the call.

1087
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:46,858
All right.

1088
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:57,335
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1089
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,009
I'm fighting
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1090
01:14:11,082 --> 01:14:12,784
- Don't work him too hard, Rock.
- Yeah.

1091
01:14:12,817 --> 01:14:14,085
He's still a puppy.

1092
01:14:14,118 --> 01:14:15,887
Come on, come on.

1093
01:14:16,254 --> 01:14:18,423
Close the distance. That's it.

1094
01:14:18,456 --> 01:14:20,425
Yeah. One, two.

1095
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:22,860
Good.

1096
01:14:22,894 --> 01:14:24,762
Come on. Body, come here.

1097
01:14:24,796 --> 01:14:26,564
Yeah. Got a good hit.

1098
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:29,834
Okay.

1099
01:14:30,468 --> 01:14:31,970
Come on.

1100
01:14:32,503 --> 01:14:35,807
Dig deep.
Body, body, body. Good.

1101
01:14:37,942 --> 01:14:40,211
You up to moving around?

1102
01:14:41,512 --> 01:14:43,014
Take a break.

1103
01:14:49,487 --> 01:14:51,222
Hey, Unc, you all right?

1104
01:14:51,256 --> 01:14:52,090
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

1105
01:14:52,123 --> 01:14:53,258
I'm all right. It's out.

1106
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,426
- I'm all right.
- All right.

1107
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,262
Just let me walk.

1108
01:14:57,328 --> 01:14:58,696
Just... I'm good.

1109
01:14:58,730 --> 01:14:59,797
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1110
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:03,334
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1111
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:05,270
I don't know. I don't know.

1112
01:15:05,303 --> 01:15:06,304
Come here.

1113
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:07,906
Just let me walk.

1114
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:11,376
No, we got to call someone
and get you to the doctor, okay?

1115
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,777
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1116
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,612
- Off the rope. Come on, I got you.
- Easy.

1117
01:15:14,646 --> 01:15:16,180
Hey, Stitch!

1118
01:15:16,214 --> 01:15:17,749
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

1119
01:15:17,782 --> 01:15:18,583
No, I'm really...

1120
01:15:18,616 --> 01:15:20,118
Hey, somebody help!

1121
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:28,960
Hi.

1122
01:15:28,993 --> 01:15:30,228
- Hi.
- Donnie.

1123
01:15:30,261 --> 01:15:32,096
Dr. Kathari.

1124
01:15:32,463 --> 01:15:34,332
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1125
01:15:34,365 --> 01:15:36,601
I'm feeling good, real good.
I could go now.

1126
01:15:36,634 --> 01:15:38,803
Heard you fell down.
Was that the first time you've fallen?

1127
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:40,638
Well, without being punched.

1128
01:15:40,672 --> 01:15:43,107
I'm gonna give you some more fluids.
That should help you feel better.

1129
01:15:43,141 --> 01:15:45,176
And we're gonna run some tests
in the morning and get you out of here.

1130
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:47,645
Can you do this fast?
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1131
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,448
Just relax. All right?
Go to sleep.

1132
01:15:50,481 --> 01:15:51,783
I'll check on you later.

1133
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:52,784
Thank you.

1134
01:15:52,817 --> 01:15:55,353
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

1135
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,023
- Donnie, we gotta train.
- Yeah, go to sleep.

1136
01:16:06,998 --> 01:16:08,766
<i>You guys need any more help?</i>

1137
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,768
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

1138
01:16:10,835 --> 01:16:12,403
- You got it? What you need?
- Thought you got lost for a minute.

1139
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:13,571
Nothing, nothing.

1140
01:16:13,605 --> 01:16:17,842
I have not seen food look like this
in this house ever.

1141
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:18,743
Yeah?

1142
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:23,615
Yes. You know, usually everything
I have has sauce or something on it.

1143
01:16:23,648 --> 01:16:25,183
Get some of these collard greens.

1144
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:26,484
All right. Yo just...

1145
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:28,186
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1146
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:30,755
Bianca, you're beautiful...

1147
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:33,191
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1148
01:16:33,224 --> 01:16:36,160
I think you're gonna be
a great champ, like your father.

1149
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:37,795
Maybe even better.

1150
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:41,399
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

1151
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:44,302
Here we go. Cent'anni.
100 years.

1152
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:47,305
- I'm honored.
- Lucky me.

1153
01:16:48,907 --> 01:16:51,342
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1154
01:16:52,343 --> 01:16:53,745
Right, that's it.

1155
01:16:53,778 --> 01:16:56,147
Now, wanna throw the hook
on the same side.

1156
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:59,083
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

1157
01:16:59,183 --> 01:17:00,451
Very good.

1158
01:17:01,953 --> 01:17:04,188
A little more vicious than that,
little more power.

1159
01:17:04,222 --> 01:17:07,659
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1160
01:17:07,692 --> 01:17:08,793
Hey, Rock.

1161
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:10,662
Yeah.

1162
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,397
Good. You're looking good.

1163
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,400
- Are you getting jealous?
- Yeah, a little.

1164
01:17:18,436 --> 01:17:20,405
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

1165
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:24,175
Hello? Yeah?
Yeah.

1166
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:30,481
Yeah, okay.

1167
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:32,483
All right, thanks.

1168
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,892
Mr. Balboa.

1169
01:17:43,795 --> 01:17:46,631
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

1170
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:51,703
Well, we went through
your test results...

1171
01:17:51,736 --> 01:17:57,408
and your biopsy came back showing signs
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1172
01:17:58,276 --> 01:18:00,311
What's that do?

1173
01:18:00,378 --> 01:18:03,281
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1174
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:16,094
I know that sounds scary,
but the good news is we caught it early.

1175
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:18,830
However, we will have
to remove the tumor...

1176
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:22,000
in your lymph nodes
and start chemotherapy immediately.

1177
01:18:23,601 --> 01:18:25,837
My wife tried that.

1178
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:28,873
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment...

1179
01:18:28,907 --> 01:18:30,375
this is the best plan of action.

1180
01:18:30,408 --> 01:18:33,478
No, I understand,
but my wife tried that...

1181
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:35,747
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1182
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,016
Didn't turn out so good.
But it's okay.

1183
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:41,319
With treatment, you'll still have
a very good chance of recovery.

1184
01:18:41,653 --> 01:18:43,521
Without it...

1185
01:18:45,723 --> 01:18:50,161
- I'm okay with it, really.
- Well, at least take these.

1186
01:18:50,194 --> 01:18:54,132
It has information on your diagnosis
and options for treatment.

1187
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:56,701
- We can start...
- Thank you very much.

1188
01:18:56,801 --> 01:19:01,105
Listen, I'd appreciate if you
wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?

1189
01:19:07,412 --> 01:19:10,048
Oh, man! There's so much traffic,
you wouldn't believe it.

1190
01:19:10,081 --> 01:19:12,050
That senior bus
was running late, huh?

1191
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:14,552
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1192
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,054
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

1193
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:18,089
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

1194
01:19:18,156 --> 01:19:19,123
Good.

1195
01:19:19,157 --> 01:19:20,892
I've been waiting on you.

1196
01:19:21,192 --> 01:19:24,829
Come on, just put your gloves on
and stop talking so much.

1197
01:19:35,173 --> 01:19:39,477
We got a few things to do.
It's all about you.

1198
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:42,580
I already had my career.
I did okay.

1199
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:45,149
What's your excuse?
You got no excuse.

1200
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:49,020
Now is the time for you
to rise to the occasion there.

1201
01:19:49,053 --> 01:19:50,421
- Just gonna put my...
- I can do it.

1202
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:52,891
Okay, all right.

1203
01:19:53,524 --> 01:19:55,059
Now...

1204
01:19:55,793 --> 01:20:00,265
I want you to always, always,
always pay attention to yourself first.

1205
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:03,501
If I'm not here to start with,
just start moving around.

1206
01:20:03,534 --> 01:20:06,638
All right. Mouthpiece.
Know what I'm saying?

1207
01:20:08,339 --> 01:20:09,908
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1208
01:20:09,941 --> 01:20:11,142
Yeah, whatever, coach.

1209
01:20:11,175 --> 01:20:13,044
All right, get going there, champ.

1210
01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:14,279
Bell.

1211
01:20:14,312 --> 01:20:16,047
Come on, Creed!

1212
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:26,925
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1213
01:20:29,594 --> 01:20:30,595
All right, Amir.

1214
01:20:30,662 --> 01:20:33,097
All right, champ.
Don't work too hard.

1215
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:55,720
This shit for real?

1216
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:00,792
Doesn't matter.

1217
01:21:01,526 --> 01:21:04,429
What you should be thinking about
is that fight coming up.

1218
01:21:04,462 --> 01:21:06,931
That's the only thing that should be
on your mind, nothing else.

1219
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:09,234
What you mean, don't think about this?
When you starting treatment?

1220
01:21:10,702 --> 01:21:14,639
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1221
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:17,542
If you don't jump on this quick,
you're gonna end up dying.

1222
01:21:17,976 --> 01:21:20,011
I know.

1223
01:21:20,044 --> 01:21:22,213
And you're all right with that?

1224
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:25,283
I am.

1225
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:27,118
Man, you sound crazy, man.

1226
01:21:27,185 --> 01:21:28,720
Give me the keys.
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1227
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:30,021
I'm not crazy at all.

1228
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:32,590
If I could take
everything that was good...

1229
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:35,059
and put it into a bowl or something...

1230
01:21:35,093 --> 01:21:39,564
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to buy
one more day with my wife"...

1231
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:41,032
I'd do it.

1232
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:44,569
I would die a happy man, right then.

1233
01:21:44,836 --> 01:21:46,838
Not gonna happen.

1234
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,642
So...

1235
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:55,079
everything I got has moved on
and I'm here.

1236
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,284
But you know what?
It's okay.

1237
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:03,655
Because I said to myself,
"If I break, if I'm hurt, whatever."

1238
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:05,990
"I ain't gonna fix it.
Why bother?"

1239
01:22:06,024 --> 01:22:09,360
And I'm just some bum
just living in your crib, just nothing.

1240
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,195
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1241
01:22:11,262 --> 01:22:13,998
But you got your whole
future ahead of you.

1242
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:15,600
Mine?

1243
01:22:17,502 --> 01:22:21,172
Back there,
like all them guys on that wall.

1244
01:22:21,205 --> 01:22:24,375
In the back, in the past.

1245
01:22:24,442 --> 01:22:26,544
We re going nowhere.

1246
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:29,113
I am to you just an old trainer.

1247
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:32,517
That's what brought us together.
You know?

1248
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,719
We're not a real family.

1249
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:42,527
That was just in our heads, kid.

1250
01:22:51,636 --> 01:22:54,539
What'd you do?
What'd you do?

1251
01:23:03,114 --> 01:23:05,383
Why did you say that?

1252
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:26,905
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1253
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:28,840
It's good.

1254
01:23:33,077 --> 01:23:34,679
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

1255
01:23:34,712 --> 01:23:36,281
- Hey!
- What up?

1256
01:23:38,883 --> 01:23:40,051
You okay?

1257
01:23:40,451 --> 01:23:43,254
Yeah. How you doing?
You good?

1258
01:23:43,288 --> 01:23:45,356
Yeah, I'm good
I'm a little nervous.

1259
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,525
There's just a lot of people here.
Not really my crowd, you know?

1260
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:48,693
Yeah, I can see.

1261
01:23:48,726 --> 01:23:50,795
Look, it's the boxing boy.
Lil Apollo Creed.

1262
01:23:50,828 --> 01:23:52,330
I know his girl.

1263
01:23:52,363 --> 01:23:54,599
- What's up, Bianca?
- Hey.

1264
01:23:54,632 --> 01:23:56,000
You don't know nobody no more?

1265
01:23:56,034 --> 01:23:57,335
Nah, I said hello to
you when I walked past.

1266
01:23:57,402 --> 01:23:58,202
You didn't say nothing to me.

1267
01:23:58,236 --> 01:24:00,305
Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.

1268
01:24:00,338 --> 01:24:01,439
Hey, man, why don't you
come over here...

1269
01:24:01,472 --> 01:24:03,308
and grab this pic with me
real quick for the 'Gram?

1270
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:05,009
Yeah, that's cool.

1271
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:07,378
Come on, man.
You know he busy, man.

1272
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:09,180
Welcome to my city, champ.

1273
01:24:11,182 --> 01:24:13,184
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

1274
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:14,719
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1275
01:24:14,752 --> 01:24:16,321
Don't call me that.

1276
01:24:16,354 --> 01:24:17,922
Don't call you that?
Don't call you what?

1277
01:24:17,956 --> 01:24:20,959
You just called me "Baby Creed".
I said, don't call me that.

1278
01:24:21,059 --> 01:24:22,994
Hey, fam, dig this.
I was showing you love, man.

1279
01:24:23,027 --> 01:24:24,329
You ain't got to come off like that.

1280
01:24:24,395 --> 01:24:26,030
Yo, that's cool, that's all love.

1281
01:24:26,064 --> 01:24:28,433
I know it's cool.
You definitely know it's cool.

1282
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:30,268
When you talking to me,
you talking real tough, you feel me?

1283
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:32,170
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1284
01:24:32,203 --> 01:24:34,939
Get a VIP pass next to your pop,
talking to me like that.

1285
01:24:34,973 --> 01:24:36,074
No!

1286
01:24:36,107 --> 01:24:37,442
Hold up, nigga!

1287
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:40,144
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1288
01:24:40,178 --> 01:24:44,182
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

1289
01:24:44,215 --> 01:24:45,416
I'll kill your ass!

1290
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,918
Donnie! Donnie!

1291
01:24:47,318 --> 01:24:49,854
- How's he doing?
- He's all right now.

1292
01:24:49,888 --> 01:24:51,589
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

1293
01:24:51,623 --> 01:24:53,057
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1294
01:24:53,091 --> 01:24:54,459
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1295
01:24:54,492 --> 01:24:55,860
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

1296
01:24:55,894 --> 01:24:57,662
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

1297
01:24:57,695 --> 01:24:58,997
Yeah.

1298
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:01,733
Hey, Donnie.

1299
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:08,373
How you doing, son?

1300
01:25:09,407 --> 01:25:13,244
I know a lot of cops and they said,
"Your friend's locked up."

1301
01:25:13,278 --> 01:25:16,681
Friends? You're just
a trainer to me, right?

1302
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:21,452
I'm sorry about what I said to you,
back at the gym.

1303
01:25:21,486 --> 01:25:23,087
That was just me talking.
I didn't mean it.

1304
01:25:23,154 --> 01:25:25,123
You just stay away from me.

1305
01:25:26,424 --> 01:25:27,425
Listen, Donnie...

1306
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,327
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what...

1307
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,629
Get your hands off me, old man!

1308
01:25:31,663 --> 01:25:34,332
Get your sick ass out of here!

1309
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,668
Leave!

1310
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:38,336
You here talking like you my family!

1311
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:40,438
You got my real family killed!

1312
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:55,486
I ain't leaving...
till I tell you what's on my mind.

1313
01:25:56,154 --> 01:25:58,456
You hate me, that's what it is.

1314
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:02,694
Or maybe you're mad with
somebody who ain't here, Donnie...

1315
01:26:02,727 --> 01:26:04,762
who can't defend himself.

1316
01:26:05,129 --> 01:26:06,531
You know?

1317
01:26:06,564 --> 01:26:10,235
Now, I understand what you're going
through, young man. I've been there.

1318
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:12,971
And I know what it's
like to feel abandoned...

1319
01:26:13,004 --> 01:26:14,439
to be mad at everything.

1320
01:26:14,472 --> 01:26:17,041
And you're a better person than that.

1321
01:26:18,076 --> 01:26:21,613
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

1322
01:26:21,646 --> 01:26:23,648
It's taking a toll on you.

1323
01:26:27,185 --> 01:26:29,854
You're still caught in his shadow.

1324
01:26:31,322 --> 01:26:35,660
- You got to move, Donnie.
- Just leave, man.

1325
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:24,008
Let's go, Johnson.

1326
01:27:49,267 --> 01:27:50,902
Bianca!

1327
01:27:52,403 --> 01:27:54,539
Yol Stop knocking on my door
like the police.

1328
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:56,975
- Can you at least let me apologize?
- No, it doesn't work like that.

1329
01:27:57,008 --> 01:27:59,177
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone, sure.

1330
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,646
But you assaulted
the headliner to my show...

1331
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,581
a show I worked really hard to get.

1332
01:28:03,648 --> 01:28:05,717
What if I came to your fight
acting like an ass?

1333
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,719
Would that be cool with you?

1334
01:28:08,086 --> 01:28:09,687
Nah, I didn't think so.

1335
01:28:11,289 --> 01:28:14,559
How'd you do though?
You kill it?

1336
01:28:14,959 --> 01:28:16,761
Yeah, we did good.

1337
01:28:16,794 --> 01:28:19,097
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

1338
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,465
But I never meant
to let you down.

1339
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:24,903
Then what did you mean to do, D?
Just have a little ego contest?

1340
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,343
Rocky's sick.

1341
01:28:42,921 --> 01:28:44,389
He's got cancer.

1342
01:28:44,422 --> 01:28:47,058
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did...

1343
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:49,027
but I found out right
before your show.

1344
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,395
How bad is it?

1345
01:28:50,428 --> 01:28:54,399
They want him to start chemo but,
you know, he's too macho to do that.

1346
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:57,735
Jesus.

1347
01:29:01,606 --> 01:29:04,642
Well, maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

1348
01:29:05,677 --> 01:29:08,646
I don't think he'd wanna hear
anything I got to say.

1349
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:14,285
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1350
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:17,522
Hey, Bianca,
don't close me out right now.

1351
01:29:19,224 --> 01:29:21,192
Look, we both
got a lot going on right now...

1352
01:29:21,226 --> 01:29:23,928
so I think you should focus on yours
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1353
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:25,430
I'm sorry.

1354
01:29:26,097 --> 01:29:27,832
What's that mean?

1355
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:30,768
I get it, I messed up.

1356
01:29:32,237 --> 01:29:35,673
I trusted you!
Can you please not shut me out?

1357
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:40,511
I'm sorry, okay?

1358
01:29:42,013 --> 01:29:44,182
I need you right now.

1359
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:20,752
Nigga, what's up?

1360
01:30:20,818 --> 01:30:22,820
What's up?

1361
01:30:22,887 --> 01:30:25,657
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1362
01:30:27,992 --> 01:30:30,328
Yeah.

1363
01:30:31,462 --> 01:30:33,531
That's what up.

1364
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:20,979
Look like you lost five pounds.
You ought to sit down and eat.

1365
01:31:34,525 --> 01:31:36,361
I mean, what I look like?

1366
01:31:36,394 --> 01:31:39,497
Letting you train me
while you sit around and die?

1367
01:31:44,302 --> 01:31:46,938
Just like any other fight.

1368
01:31:46,971 --> 01:31:51,376
This fight? I seen it before.

1369
01:31:52,076 --> 01:31:55,280
It gets as bad as it can get...

1370
01:31:55,947 --> 01:31:58,516
and most of the time,
you don't win it.

1371
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:59,751
Yeah, but I don't care.

1372
01:31:59,784 --> 01:32:02,353
I ain't training
if you don't get the treatment.

1373
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,189
So if I fight, you fight.

1374
01:32:37,455 --> 01:32:39,357
- Hey.
- What's up?

1375
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,560
- You been to the gym?
- Nah, I've been here.

1376
01:32:42,594 --> 01:32:45,897
Okay. Here you go.
Remember this?

1377
01:32:46,064 --> 01:32:47,799
Get up.

1378
01:32:48,299 --> 01:32:49,334
- Ready?
- What's...

1379
01:32:49,367 --> 01:32:50,935
I want you to shadow box.

1380
01:32:50,969 --> 01:32:53,104
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

1381
01:32:53,137 --> 01:32:54,405
You're serious?

1382
01:32:54,439 --> 01:32:56,341
- Want me to do it for you?
- No. It's all good.

1383
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:58,343
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

1384
01:32:58,376 --> 01:33:00,178
Time!

1385
01:33:00,645 --> 01:33:02,447
There you go.

1386
01:33:09,787 --> 01:33:11,089
We used to do that with one hand.

1387
01:33:11,122 --> 01:33:13,858
I don't wanna say anything though.

1388
01:33:19,197 --> 01:33:21,232
Don't hit the lady.

1389
01:33:21,499 --> 01:33:23,134
She'll probably drop you.

1390
01:33:33,778 --> 01:33:36,314
All right.
Come on, almost there.

1391
01:33:36,915 --> 01:33:38,416
Come on, Unc.

1392
01:33:43,821 --> 01:33:45,590
Oh, God.

1393
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,197
That's your thing, yes!

1394
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:27,865
More! Yes!

1395
01:34:30,802 --> 01:34:32,270
One. Two? The deal was two!

1396
01:34:32,303 --> 01:34:33,238
I can't, no.

1397
01:34:33,271 --> 01:34:34,772
I'm dizzy.

1398
01:34:45,516 --> 01:34:47,151
Double jab.

1399
01:34:47,719 --> 01:34:48,920
Step on right under there.

1400
01:34:55,393 --> 01:34:56,628
Good.

1401
01:34:56,995 --> 01:34:58,563
At least we got the speed.

1402
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:03,001
We just need him to sit down
so when he hits something, he breaks it.

1403
01:35:05,703 --> 01:35:07,171
Good.

1404
01:35:07,205 --> 01:35:09,340
Step with it, you gotta step with it.
Come on!

1405
01:35:10,575 --> 01:35:11,709
Little bit more.

1406
01:35:11,743 --> 01:35:14,045
Little bit more, dig down.
Good.

1407
01:35:14,078 --> 01:35:15,713
Good. Keep it right.

1408
01:35:16,114 --> 01:35:17,115
Yes!

1409
01:35:18,483 --> 01:35:21,219
- Look, he's doing the same thing.
- Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1410
01:35:21,252 --> 01:35:24,422
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

1411
01:35:37,569 --> 01:35:39,070
Wow, beautiful.

1412
01:35:39,637 --> 01:35:42,507
- Yo, you going to see Rock?
- Yeah, let's go!

1413
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,374
We got you! Let's go!

1414
01:35:43,441 --> 01:35:45,577
Make history, Creed! Let's go!

1415
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:52,050
What up? Come on y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

1416
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,518
That's what I like, man!

1417
01:35:53,551 --> 01:35:56,654
Let's go see Rock on Front Street!
Ride with me!

1418
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,498
You wanna say hello?

1419
01:37:49,133 --> 01:37:52,136
- Place looks like a church.
- Yeah, fell like an art museum.

1420
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,671
Yeah, beautiful.

1421
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,808
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1422
01:37:56,841 --> 01:37:59,077
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

1423
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,311
Okay.

1424
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,761
Don't let him get to you.

1425
01:38:16,794 --> 01:38:21,099
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming.
Let's get straight into questions.

1426
01:38:22,133 --> 01:38:23,601
Young lady to the left.

1427
01:38:23,668 --> 01:38:26,971
Conlan, can we expect
any more fireworks at the weigh-in?

1428
01:38:27,038 --> 01:38:29,073
I've been doing some
anger management classes...

1429
01:38:29,107 --> 01:38:30,642
and trying to control
temper of mine.

1430
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:33,111
I just gonna make sure
he forgets it all by Saturday night.

1431
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:36,881
Okay, next question.

1432
01:38:36,915 --> 01:38:38,449
Young man in the glasses.

1433
01:38:38,483 --> 01:38:40,685
What about the contrast
between you two?

1434
01:38:40,718 --> 01:38:44,355
You, the overnight success versus
Conlan's rags to riches background.

1435
01:38:44,389 --> 01:38:46,925
Nothing happened overnight.
I've been fighting for some time now...

1436
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,326
That's exactly how it happened
for this guy.

1437
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:51,930
He's an overnight success,
never had a damn fight in his life.

1438
01:38:51,963 --> 01:38:54,532
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

1439
01:38:54,566 --> 01:38:57,268
One more. There's a lot of talk
about legacy in this fight.

1440
01:38:57,302 --> 01:38:58,736
Johnson, can you speak to that?

1441
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:00,972
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

1442
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:01,873
Legacy?

1443
01:39:01,906 --> 01:39:03,675
Are we at some kind of comedy club?

1444
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:06,945
The guy next to him, now that's
what we're talking about legacy.

1445
01:39:06,978 --> 01:39:08,379
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

1446
01:39:08,413 --> 01:39:09,681
My father worked on the docks.

1447
01:39:09,714 --> 01:39:12,483
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

1448
01:39:12,517 --> 01:39:15,587
- People like silver spoon over there...
- You don't know nothing about me.

1449
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,721
I know enough about you.

1450
01:39:16,754 --> 01:39:18,189
- I'm here now though. I'm here now.
- You found yourself here.

1451
01:39:18,223 --> 01:39:19,424
You a false Creed.

1452
01:39:19,457 --> 01:39:21,159
All right, I'll show you right now.
My pops ain't here.

1453
01:39:21,192 --> 01:39:21,960
Sit down!

1454
01:39:21,993 --> 01:39:23,561
You wanna fight here?
I'll do it right now!

1455
01:39:23,595 --> 01:39:26,197
I can do it right now, bitch!
We can do it right now!

1456
01:39:27,332 --> 01:39:28,533
"Creed" my asshole!

1457
01:39:28,566 --> 01:39:29,667
Keep it down!

1458
01:39:29,701 --> 01:39:32,270
- Yo, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1459
01:39:32,303 --> 01:39:34,138
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1460
01:39:34,339 --> 01:39:37,208
I'm gonna knock that smile
off your face.

1461
01:39:42,914 --> 01:39:45,250
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

1462
01:39:48,987 --> 01:39:50,955
Unc, you okay?

1463
01:39:50,989 --> 01:39:53,324
Yeah, I'm good.
Just couldn't sleep.

1464
01:39:53,358 --> 01:39:54,225
Yeah, me either.

1465
01:39:54,259 --> 01:39:57,328
- Is it okay I sit down?
- Course.

1466
01:39:58,096 --> 01:39:59,731
Donnie...

1467
01:40:00,131 --> 01:40:03,368
I'd like you to do me a favor
when all this is over.

1468
01:40:03,401 --> 01:40:05,136
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

1469
01:40:05,169 --> 01:40:08,673
It's not important
but I just wanna lock it in, okay?

1470
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:12,076
- Yeah, you got it.
- There you go.

1471
01:40:14,946 --> 01:40:18,116
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?

1472
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:21,419
No, you keep looking at the door.

1473
01:40:27,959 --> 01:40:31,262
- Do you hear something?
- No.

1474
01:40:33,831 --> 01:40:37,435
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

1475
01:40:43,274 --> 01:40:45,977
How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?

1476
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:48,479
Y'all two are killing me.

1477
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:53,518
Oh, and listen.
Would you guys just keep...

1478
01:40:53,551 --> 01:40:54,786
We know.

1479
01:40:54,819 --> 01:40:56,020
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

1480
01:40:56,054 --> 01:40:57,488
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

1481
01:40:57,522 --> 01:40:59,157
Got you.

1482
01:41:03,561 --> 01:41:06,998
- You wanna come in?
- Yeah.

1483
01:41:07,298 --> 01:41:08,933
Please.

1484
01:41:23,915 --> 01:41:25,216
- I got it.
- Good.

1485
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,217
All right.

1486
01:41:28,052 --> 01:41:29,320
All right.

1487
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:34,993
A lot of room.

1488
01:41:35,627 --> 01:41:38,162
Didn't we have enough surprises
for one weekend?

1489
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,031
That's not me.

1490
01:42:12,096 --> 01:42:14,465
Very nice colors.

1491
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,903
Why don't you take 'em into the
other room and see how well they fit.

1492
01:42:21,272 --> 01:42:22,473
Yeah.

1493
01:42:24,742 --> 01:42:25,877
Hey, champ.

1494
01:42:25,944 --> 01:42:28,947
All right, Donnie.
I'm proud of you.

1495
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,249
That's gonna bring him luck.

1496
01:42:53,905 --> 01:42:56,140
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

1497
01:42:56,174 --> 01:42:57,642
That don't matter.

1498
01:42:57,675 --> 01:42:59,978
You're never been
this far away from home.

1499
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,446
That don't matter.

1500
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:06,684
What matters is what you leave in that ring
and what you take back with you.

1501
01:43:06,718 --> 01:43:08,353
You know what that is?

1502
01:43:08,386 --> 01:43:09,487
Pride.

1503
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,522
I know that you did your best.

1504
01:43:11,556 --> 01:43:12,991
And you're doing it for yourself.

1505
01:43:13,024 --> 01:43:17,862
Not for me, not for your father's memory,
not for you.

1506
01:43:17,896 --> 01:43:19,998
I can see in your eyes...

1507
01:43:20,031 --> 01:43:22,333
you're gonna do it.

1508
01:43:23,134 --> 01:43:24,869
Let's go now.

1509
01:43:24,903 --> 01:43:26,738
Padman.

1510
01:43:29,874 --> 01:43:31,709
Fight's right here.

1511
01:43:34,212 --> 01:43:35,313
Let's go.

1512
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,985
Yeah.

1513
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:43,154
Left hook combination, go!

1514
01:43:44,956 --> 01:43:46,391
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

1515
01:43:46,424 --> 01:43:47,892
Go up top.

1516
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,931
All right, guys, it's time.
Let's go win a championship!

1517
01:43:52,964 --> 01:43:55,600
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

1518
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,905
Come on, man.

1519
01:44:06,044 --> 01:44:08,513
Let's go.

1520
01:44:25,129 --> 01:44:27,632
I'd always get nervous during times
like this...

1521
01:44:27,665 --> 01:44:30,935
but that's normal
and it's gonna give you energy.

1522
01:44:30,969 --> 01:44:33,738
Very normal. Very normal.

1523
01:45:35,867 --> 01:45:38,770
Go up there
and show him who you are!

1524
01:46:02,927 --> 01:46:06,130
This is what you wanted,
and what you got.

1525
01:46:06,164 --> 01:46:09,434
And I want you to enjoy it, okay?
Do that.

1526
01:46:12,136 --> 01:46:17,575
Conlan! Conlan!

1527
01:47:27,078 --> 01:47:30,014
<i>Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.</i>

1528
01:47:30,048 --> 01:47:33,651
<i>100,000 on their feet
for what may conceivably be...</i>

1529
01:47:33,685 --> 01:47:36,321
<i>his fast walk to the ring
for a professional fight.</i>

1530
01:47:36,387 --> 01:47:40,124
<i>Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?</i>

1531
01:47:40,191 --> 01:47:42,560
<i>He's got the name.
That's why he's here tonight.</i>

1532
01:47:42,594 --> 01:47:44,529
<i>Does he have the game?</i>

1533
01:47:44,562 --> 01:47:47,732
<i>He's Apollo Creed's son
he's got Rocky Balboa in his corner.</i>

1534
01:47:47,765 --> 01:47:49,834
<i>But all the legends in the world...</i>

1535
01:47:49,868 --> 01:47:52,403
<i>can't help him tonight
if he can't fight.</i>

1536
01:47:52,437 --> 01:47:56,507
<i>The question is can he fight?</i>

1537
01:48:19,163 --> 01:48:22,834
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park...</i>

1538
01:48:22,867 --> 01:48:24,869
<i>here in Liverpool, England...</i>

1539
01:48:24,903 --> 01:48:27,972
<i>where tonight
this is the main event.</i>

1540
01:48:28,072 --> 01:48:29,841
<i>12 rounds of boxing...</i>

1541
01:48:29,874 --> 01:48:33,278
<i>for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.</i>

1542
01:48:33,344 --> 01:48:38,550
<i>For the thousands in attendance and the
millions watching around the world...</i>

1543
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:39,951

1544
01:48:39,984 --> 01:48:42,854
<i>let's get ready to rumble!</i>

1545
01:48:47,025 --> 01:48:50,061
<i>In the red corner,
wearing the stars and stripes...</i>

1546
01:48:50,094 --> 01:48:54,499
<i>his professional record,
16 fights, 16 victories...</i>

1547
01:48:54,532 --> 01:48:55,800
<i>the challenger...</i>

1548
01:48:55,833 --> 01:49:01,539
<i>Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!</i>

1549
01:49:01,573 --> 01:49:05,743
<i>And fighting out of the blue corner,

1550
01:49:05,777 --> 01:49:07,812
<i>with 36 fights...</i>

1551

1553
01:49:14,619 --> 01:49:19,958
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

1554
01:49:25,630 --> 01:49:27,832
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1555
01:49:32,837 --> 01:49:34,973
<i>How you doing, lads?
You known what I expect of you both.</i>

1556
01:49:35,006 --> 01:49:37,976
<i>We talked about it in the locker rooms.
I want you protect yourselves...</i>

1557
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:41,679
<i>No low blows, no silly business.</i>

1558
01:49:41,713 --> 01:49:43,848
<i>Keep it clean, will you?
Understand?</i>

1559
01:49:43,882 --> 01:49:45,483
<i>Touch gloves.</i>

1560
01:49:45,517 --> 01:49:47,185
Nice shorts, boy.

1561
01:49:47,218 --> 01:49:49,187
Too bad your daddy ain't here
to fight in them.

1562
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:55,860
You know what?
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1563
01:49:58,363 --> 01:50:00,131
You know what to do.

1564
01:50:00,164 --> 01:50:02,767
One step, one punch,
one round at a time.

1565
01:50:02,834 --> 01:50:04,702
You got this.

1566
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,982
<i>Round one begins.</i>

1567
01:50:18,016 --> 01:50:20,919
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan
in the black trunks...</i>

1568
01:50:20,952 --> 01:50:23,788
<i>and Adonis Creed in the red,
white and blue.</i>

1569
01:50:23,821 --> 01:50:26,858
<i>Conlan is significantly taller...</i>

1570
01:50:26,891 --> 01:50:29,561
<i>and thinks it will be easy
to use his jab...</i>

1571
01:50:29,594 --> 01:50:31,362
<i>to keep young Creed at bay.</i>

1572
01:50:31,396 --> 01:50:35,200
<i>You can see right away how much more
relaxed Conlan is. He's been there before.</i>

1573
01:50:35,233 --> 01:50:36,701
Move your leg!

1574
01:50:36,734 --> 01:50:38,136
Keep your left up!

1575
01:50:38,169 --> 01:50:40,305
<i>That kind of nervous energy
can wear you out as the fight goes on.</i>

1576
01:50:40,605 --> 01:50:42,840
<i>Hard left hook by Conlan.
Creed backs off.</i>

1577
01:50:42,874 --> 01:50:46,411
<i>It's not easy to just jump right into
the major leagues like this...</i>

1578
01:50:46,844 --> 01:50:47,845
<i>having never fought
an opponent like Conlan.</i>

1579
01:50:47,879 --> 01:50:50,148
<i>Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.</i>

1580
01:50:50,448 --> 01:50:51,816
Creed trying to get close to Conlan,
against the ropes.

1581
01:50:53,284 --> 01:50:56,020
<i>Conlan easily
puts distance between them again.</i>

1582
01:50:58,423 --> 01:51:01,993
<i>Confan fires a hard body punch,
hits him hard with a right cross...</i>

1583
01:51:02,026 --> 01:51:03,928
<i>- and backs Creed into the ropes.
- Break!</i>

1584
01:51:03,962 --> 01:51:05,630
Ref, come on!

1585
01:51:05,663 --> 01:51:06,698
Keep it clean!

1586
01:51:06,731 --> 01:51:07,498
<i>And he gets a warning
from the referee.</i>

1587
01:51:08,499 --> 01:51:10,268
<i>Creed kinds woke him up
with that shot...</i>

1588
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:12,070
<i>And Conlan really
made him pay for it.</i>

1589
01:51:12,337 --> 01:51:14,839
<i>Creed ready to let his hands go.</i>

1590
01:51:15,406 --> 01:51:18,109
<i>Creed misses and gets hit in return.</i>

1591
01:51:18,409 --> 01:51:20,979
<i>- Perfect uppercut on the inside.
- To the corner! One!</i>

1592
01:51:21,012 --> 01:51:22,614
<i>- Down goes Creed.
- Two!</i>

1593
01:51:23,481 --> 01:51:24,015
- Three! Four!
- I'm good! I'm good!

1594
01:51:24,048 --> 01:51:25,250
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

1595
01:51:25,283 --> 01:51:26,551
Shake it off!

1596
01:51:26,584 --> 01:51:28,753
<i>But already a knockdown
for Ricky Conlan.</i>

1597
01:51:28,786 --> 01:51:31,389
- Are you okay? Are you sure?
- I'm good!

1598
01:51:31,422 --> 01:51:33,024
Fight!

1599
01:51:34,659 --> 01:51:39,197
<i>Conlan lands a shot after the bell,
and round one was all Ricky Conlan.</i>

1600
01:51:39,297 --> 01:51:42,934
Real for you now, boy?
Real for you now?

1601
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,272
- How's the eye?
- Little bloody.

1602
01:51:47,338 --> 01:51:49,040
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1603
01:51:49,073 --> 01:51:52,076
- I'm gonna knock his ass out.
- Do it in the nest round. Don't wait.

1604
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:53,478
You keep making mistakes like that...

1605
01:51:53,511 --> 01:51:54,879
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1606
01:51:55,413 --> 01:51:58,249
<i>Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.</i>

1607
01:52:00,018 --> 01:52:02,086
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1608
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:05,990
Here's what I want you to do.
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1609
01:52:06,024 --> 01:52:08,793
When he leaves it out there, drop
that right hook and smash him, okay?

1610
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,928
Stay focused.

1611
01:52:09,961 --> 01:52:13,331
<i>So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.</i>

1612
01:52:13,531 --> 01:52:16,601
<i>And now, after a discussion
with Rocky Balboa between rounds...</i>

1613
01:52:16,634 --> 01:52:17,969
<i>here comes in for more.</i>

1614
01:52:18,002 --> 01:52:21,706
<i>Conlan showed his power witgh
the uppercut at the end of round one...</i>

1615
01:52:21,739 --> 01:52:24,075
<i>goes back to boxing
to begin the second.</i>

1616
01:52:24,108 --> 01:52:25,577
Be first!

1617
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:26,177
Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1618
01:52:26,211 --> 01:52:30,915
<i>Logic says Cree needs to find a way
to got inside of Conlan's long arms...</i>

1619
01:52:30,982 --> 01:52:33,251
<i>and create pressure on the inside.</i>

1620
01:52:33,451 --> 01:52:34,152
Come on!

1621
01:52:34,185 --> 01:52:36,454
So far, it's still
mostly Ricky Conlan.

1622
01:52:37,856 --> 01:52:39,490
<i>Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.</i>

1623
01:52:39,591 --> 01:52:42,160
- Keep your hands up!
- Drives Creed into the corner again.

1624
01:52:42,193 --> 01:52:43,928
Tie him up!

1625
01:52:43,995 --> 01:52:47,699
<i>Creed wraps him up and pulls turn in
to stop the onslaught.</i>

1626
01:52:47,732 --> 01:52:49,901
You the champ, right?

1627
01:52:49,934 --> 01:52:51,035
You the champ?

1628
01:52:51,069 --> 01:52:53,104
Show me. Come on!

1629
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:57,008
<i>There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!</i>

1630
01:52:57,041 --> 01:52:57,942
Yeah!

1631
01:52:57,976 --> 01:52:59,077
Yes!

1632
01:53:00,879 --> 01:53:04,582
<i>Creed misses wildly,
and they are going toe-to-toe.</i>

1633
01:53:04,616 --> 01:53:05,917
<i>Rapidly becomming a phone booth fight!</i>

1634
01:53:06,417 --> 01:53:08,052
Go! Go!

1635
01:53:08,253 --> 01:53:11,222
<i>Trading punches, right hand, left hand!
Both guys landing!</i>

1636
01:53:11,256 --> 01:53:12,457
<i>This is unbelievable action!</i>

1637
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:14,292
Doubt hook! Come on!

1638
01:53:14,325 --> 01:53:16,361
<i>Hard right hand by Creed.</i>

1639
01:53:16,794 --> 01:53:18,897
- You bleed just like me!
- Go to your corners! Come on!

1640
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:20,031
You bleed just like me!

1641
01:53:20,064 --> 01:53:22,534
Man! That ain't shit!

1642
01:53:24,002 --> 01:53:26,237
He loves it! If Conlan thought
he had a pushover, he knows better now!

1643
01:53:26,271 --> 01:53:28,540
- He bleed like me!
- You belong in here!

1644
01:53:28,573 --> 01:53:30,174
They don't know
what you've been through...

1645
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:32,176
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

1646
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:34,345
I don't want you
trading blows with him.

1647
01:53:34,379 --> 01:53:35,780
I want you to protect yourself.

1648
01:53:35,847 --> 01:53:36,814
Keep your distance!

1649
01:53:36,848 --> 01:53:38,650
I'm gonna smash this Wto bits.

1650
01:53:39,317 --> 01:53:40,351
Now he knows you're for real.

1651
01:53:40,385 --> 01:53:41,686
You gottabelieve you can do it.

1652
01:53:41,719 --> 01:53:43,788
<i>That was such a big round for Creed.</i>

1653
01:53:43,821 --> 01:53:46,791
<i>Not just on the scorecards but
psychologically going forward, Jim.</i>

1654
01:53:46,858 --> 01:53:48,526
You woke up a sleeping giant.

1655
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,461
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

1656
01:53:50,495 --> 01:53:53,631
<i>Adonis, looking more and more
confortabte against the champ...</i>

1657
01:53:54,866 --> 01:53:56,201
<i>seems to have found his rhythm.</i>

1658
01:53:56,901 --> 01:53:58,570
Go finish him off.

1659
01:54:01,239 --> 01:54:02,640
<i>- This has devolved into a slugfest!
- One punch at a time!</i>

1660
01:54:03,575 --> 01:54:05,043
Come on, D!

1661
01:54:05,076 --> 01:54:07,579
<i>Conlans trying to punish Creed
at short range.</i>

1662
01:54:07,612 --> 01:54:08,780
Finnish him now!

1663
01:54:08,813 --> 01:54:11,749
<i>Big combination to end
the third by Conlan...</i>

1664
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:13,484
<i>and Creed does not know where he is,
walking to the wrong corner there.</i>

1665
01:54:13,518 --> 01:54:16,287
His arm is long.

1666
01:54:16,354 --> 01:54:18,556
Because you're playing
his game, Donnie.

1667
01:54:18,623 --> 01:54:19,757
Be patient.

1668
01:54:19,791 --> 01:54:21,926
One step, one punch...

1669
01:54:22,126 --> 01:54:23,194
- One round at a time.
- There you.

1670
01:54:23,228 --> 01:54:24,429
<i>One step...</i>

1671
01:54:24,462 --> 01:54:25,897
<i>one punch...</i>

1672
01:54:26,197 --> 01:54:27,198
<i>one round at a time.</i>

1673
01:54:27,232 --> 01:54:28,533
<i>Round five of a scheduled 12...</i>

1674
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,369
<i>and already it's a far different fight
than most experts expected.</i>

1675
01:54:31,402 --> 01:54:32,770
He's just a pretender.

1676
01:54:33,004 --> 01:54:34,505
He's lucky to be in the same ring
with you hitting him.

1677
01:54:34,539 --> 01:54:36,140
Remember that.

1678
01:54:36,574 --> 01:54:40,712
<i>Adonis Creed has succeed in pressuring
Ricky Conlan and making him fight.</i>

1679
01:55:03,101 --> 01:55:07,071
<i>Creed has proven plenty in this fight
He's taken it, he's given it back.</i>

1680
01:55:07,105 --> 01:55:08,506
<i>But he does not
look like a match...</i>

1681
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,808
<i>for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.</i>

1682
01:55:10,842 --> 01:55:12,277
You're going throgh hell out there...

1683
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,679
but you're hurting him too.
I can see it in his eyes.

1684
01:55:14,712 --> 01:55:16,581
You're not as far behind as you think.

1685
01:55:16,614 --> 01:55:18,616
Shorten that jab,
shorten the distance...

1686
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,252
get underneath him,
and you'll be able to rip him.

1687
01:55:21,686 --> 01:55:22,320
You gotta push him back.

1688
01:55:22,387 --> 01:55:25,557
<i>Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.</i>

1689
01:55:25,590 --> 01:55:26,991
Donnie, step under!

1690
01:55:28,326 --> 01:55:29,160
Yes!

1691
01:55:29,194 --> 01:55:30,195
Come on, Ricky!

1692
01:55:30,228 --> 01:55:32,630
<i>There are moments
when Creed is assertively taking over.</i>

1693
01:55:33,131 --> 01:55:35,867
<i>But there's a hard counter right,
drives Creed back into the corner.</i>

1694
01:55:35,934 --> 01:55:38,102
<i>Just when it appears
Creed might be taking control...</i>

1695
01:55:38,136 --> 01:55:40,405
<i>Conlan comes close
to knocking him down.</i>

1696
01:55:40,438 --> 01:55:42,707
Use that pressure. You are the one
that's in the driving seat.

1697
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,676
He's not used to this level, all right?

1698
01:55:47,312 --> 01:55:47,745
Get 'em on the rope!
Deep breath.

1699
01:55:47,812 --> 01:55:48,680
Boy's fast.

1700
01:55:48,746 --> 01:55:51,683
Hey! It's you against you.

1701
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:52,750
- Me again me.
- That's right.

1702
01:55:52,817 --> 01:55:54,419
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

1703
01:55:54,485 --> 01:55:55,687
Get in out of the way! Let's go!

1704
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,856
<i>Not only is young Adonis Creed...</i>

1705
01:55:57,956 --> 01:56:01,492
<i>still in the ring,
he may be in the fight.</i>

1706
01:56:03,595 --> 01:56:05,363
<i>Hard left hand by Creed.</i>

1707
01:56:05,396 --> 01:56:07,699
<i>Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite...</i>

1708
01:56:07,732 --> 01:56:12,170
<i>pounding young Creed with right hands
as you saw right there.</i>

1709
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:16,307
Bring back everything
that's ever hurt you.

1710
01:56:16,374 --> 01:56:19,644
Al the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.

1711
01:56:19,677 --> 01:56:23,915
Put it in both fists, and I want you
to drive it through his body...

1712
01:56:23,948 --> 01:56:26,851
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1713
01:56:26,885 --> 01:56:30,121
<i>We're into the part of the fight where
all your instincts come into play.</i>

1714
01:56:30,154 --> 01:56:34,692
<i>Most experts expected that Conlan
would avoid trading shots with Creed...</i>

1715
01:56:34,926 --> 01:56:36,494
<i>but he's trading willingly.</i>

1716
01:56:36,528 --> 01:56:37,929
<i>Creed fires a hard body punch.</i>

1717
01:56:37,962 --> 01:56:39,764
<i>Conlan in trouble!</i>

1718
01:56:39,998 --> 01:56:42,233
<i>Hard left hand to the body.</i>

1719
01:56:42,333 --> 01:56:44,302
The champ is in bad shape, Jim.

1720
01:56:44,335 --> 01:56:49,107
Creed realized he has a better chance of
hurting Conlan to the body than to the head!

1721
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,309
- What an uppercut!
- No!

1722
01:56:51,709 --> 01:56:53,711
<i>And Creed staggers back.</i>

1723
01:56:53,745 --> 01:56:55,413
Body! Body!

1724
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,448
<i>To the body, trading shots!</i>

1725
01:56:57,482 --> 01:56:59,817
<i>Pawing with his jab,
Creed looks to land one big shot.</i>

1726
01:56:59,851 --> 01:57:01,886
Move your legs!

1727
01:57:28,313 --> 01:57:29,747
Donnie, get up!

1728
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:33,017
Get up, D!

1729
01:57:34,385 --> 01:57:35,920
Come on, baby.

1730
01:57:42,961 --> 01:57:44,729
Stitch!

1731
01:57:51,736 --> 01:57:53,671
<i>Creed just got up
like a man possessed.</i>

1732
01:57:53,705 --> 01:57:54,973
You okay? Look at me!

1733
01:57:55,006 --> 01:57:56,007
<i>- He was out!
- Donnie!</i>

1734
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:56,908
<i>Down but not out.</i>

1735
01:57:56,941 --> 01:57:58,276
<i>Conlan thinks he's celebrating
a knockout...</i>

1736
01:57:58,309 --> 01:58:00,378
Get down!
He's getting up!

1737
01:58:00,445 --> 01:58:02,614
<i>But the referee is dusting
Creed's gloves.</i>

1738
01:58:02,647 --> 01:58:03,848
You're good.

1739
01:58:03,882 --> 01:58:07,752
<i>Creed beats the count
and the action begins again.</i>

1740
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:08,953
<i>That's the heart of a champion.</i>

1741
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:11,256
<i>He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.</i>

1742
01:58:11,556 --> 01:58:11,789
Donnie, be ready!

1743
01:58:11,823 --> 01:58:15,326
<i>More work to do for Conlan.
Body shot. Body dhot.</i>

1744
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,462
<i>Trying to set Creed up one more time.</i>

1745
01:58:17,495 --> 01:58:19,697
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

1746
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:24,435
<i>Stitch has done a great job
over that right eye...</i>

1747
01:58:24,469 --> 01:58:27,038
<i>but now the left eye
looks like it's almost shut.</i>

1748
01:58:27,071 --> 01:58:28,773
<i>Closing up.</i>

1749
01:58:28,873 --> 01:58:30,375
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to your...

1750
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:31,943
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

1751
01:58:31,976 --> 01:58:33,811
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

1752
01:58:33,845 --> 01:58:35,313
I'm good.

1753
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,314
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

1754
01:58:36,347 --> 01:58:37,549
- You sure febout that?
- I am. I'm good.

1755
01:58:37,582 --> 01:58:40,318
<i>He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.</i>

1756
01:58:40,351 --> 01:58:42,453
Left eye completely closed.

1757
01:58:42,987 --> 01:58:43,454
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

1758
01:58:43,488 --> 01:58:45,323
Let me see the eye.

1759
01:58:45,356 --> 01:58:47,692
Time! Doc, give him a look!

1760
01:58:47,725 --> 01:58:49,761
All right. Show me your eye.

1761
01:58:49,794 --> 01:58:51,563
Show me your eye, Adonis!

1762
01:58:51,596 --> 01:58:53,331
How many fingers?

1763
01:58:53,364 --> 01:58:54,999
How many fingers?

1764
01:58:55,033 --> 01:58:56,301
How many, Adonis?

1765
01:58:56,334 --> 01:58:57,135
Four.

1766
01:58:57,168 --> 01:58:58,736
And again.

1767
01:58:59,204 --> 01:59:00,905
Two.

1768
01:59:01,506 --> 01:59:02,307
Time in!

1769
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:06,244
All right. Breathe through your mouth.
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

1770
01:59:06,277 --> 01:59:08,746
You are up on the cards, you're
winning this. You are gonna win this!

1771
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:10,515
But just keep smart
and keep away from him.

1772
01:59:10,548 --> 01:59:12,917
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

1773
01:59:12,951 --> 01:59:14,752
I should've stopped the fight
with your father.

1774
01:59:14,786 --> 01:59:15,687
I'm stopping this one now.

1775
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,056
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

1776
01:59:18,089 --> 01:59:20,158
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

1777
01:59:20,191 --> 01:59:23,027
I'm not a mistake.

1778
01:59:26,564 --> 01:59:27,298
Look at me.

1779
01:59:27,365 --> 01:59:31,302
I never got a chance to thank Apollo
for helping me out after Mickey died.

1780
01:59:31,336 --> 01:59:33,638
But it's nothing
compared to what you've done.

1781
01:59:33,671 --> 01:59:35,173
You taught me how to fight again...

1782
01:59:35,206 --> 01:59:37,242
and I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna fight this thing.

1783
01:59:37,275 --> 01:59:39,310
Buit if I fight
I want you to fight, too.

1784
01:59:39,344 --> 01:59:41,379
I want you to go across this ring...

1785
01:59:41,412 --> 01:59:44,582
and knock that son of a bitch down.
Can you do it?

1786
01:59:45,016 --> 01:59:45,917
Say it.

1787
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:47,519
I'm gonna knock that
son of a bitch down.

1788
01:59:47,552 --> 01:59:50,688
I know you are. You know why?

1789
01:59:50,722 --> 01:59:51,055
Because you're a Creed
and I love you, kid.

1790
01:59:51,089 --> 01:59:52,357
- I love you too.
- Go on.

1791
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,225
All right baby, let's go.

1792
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:59,163
Go get him, Donnie!

1793
02:00:02,367 --> 02:00:04,168
<i>Round 12 begins.</i>

1794
02:00:04,235 --> 02:00:08,039
<i>Virtually no one outside of Adonis Creed's
family and group of friends...</i>

1795
02:00:08,072 --> 02:00:12,644
<i>would ever have expected to see him in a
12th round against "Pretty" Ricky Conlan...</i>

1796
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:15,914
<i>and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.</i>

1797
02:00:16,714 --> 02:00:19,184
<i>And there's a hard left hook upstairs.</i>

1798
02:00:19,284 --> 02:00:20,752
Yeah!

1799
02:00:20,852 --> 02:00:23,054
<i>Every time you wanna say
it's die beginning of the end...</i>

1800
02:00:23,087 --> 02:00:26,958
<i>the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.</i>

1801
02:00:27,158 --> 02:00:28,726
<i>Hard right hand by Conlan.</i>

1802
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:30,795
Come on! Don't sit there!

1803
02:00:30,828 --> 02:00:34,399
<i>They're trading shots
in the kind of back and forth action...</i>

1804
02:00:34,432 --> 02:00:37,669
<i>that most of us didn't expect to see.</i>

1805
02:00:39,604 --> 02:00:41,272
<i>Creed getting hit
with some hard shots...</i>

1806
02:00:41,339 --> 02:00:45,243
<i>but landing some of his own,
and Adonis is firing back!</i>

1807
02:00:45,276 --> 02:00:47,178
<i>Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.</i>

1808
02:00:47,212 --> 02:00:48,112
Ricky, nail him!

1809
02:00:48,146 --> 02:00:49,714
Come on, kid!

1810
02:00:51,249 --> 02:00:53,685
<i>Creed spins,
puts the champ in the corner!</i>

1811
02:00:53,718 --> 02:00:55,286
Body!

1812
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:58,223
<i>Throwing body shots
like he's Rocky Balboa!</i>

1813
02:00:58,256 --> 02:01:00,625
<i>Going upstairs
like he's Apollo Creed.</i>

1814
02:01:00,658 --> 02:01:01,626
Knock his ass out!

1815
02:01:01,693 --> 02:01:04,295
<i>Closing seconds of the fight!</i>

1816
02:01:04,329 --> 02:01:05,897
Ricky!

1817
02:01:06,497 --> 02:01:08,166
That's what I'm talking about!

1818
02:01:08,199 --> 02:01:09,601
Conlan is down!

1819
02:01:09,634 --> 02:01:13,137
<i>That is the first time in his career
he's been on the canvas.</i>

1820
02:01:13,171 --> 02:01:17,442
<i>You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.</i>

1821
02:01:17,675 --> 02:01:18,510
Ricky, get up!

1822
02:01:18,543 --> 02:01:19,611
Stay down!

1823
02:01:19,644 --> 02:01:20,478
Stay down!

1824
02:01:20,512 --> 02:01:21,980
Six!

1825
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,581
<i>- Dramatic count in Liverpool.
- Seven! Eight!</i>

1826
02:01:23,615 --> 02:01:25,083
<i>He must get up to preserve his chance
to win the fight.</i>

1827
02:01:25,116 --> 02:01:26,251
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

1828
02:01:26,284 --> 02:01:28,152
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

1829
02:01:28,186 --> 02:01:28,820
- He's up!
- What?

1830
02:01:28,853 --> 02:01:32,190
<i>The bell sounds, so Conlan
survives the 12th round!</i>

1831
02:01:32,223 --> 02:01:33,958
<i>What a finish!</i>

1832
02:01:33,992 --> 02:01:37,428
<i>If that round goes another 30 seconds,
we may have a new champion.</i>

1833
02:01:37,462 --> 02:01:40,732
<i>An unforgettable fight
on an unforgettable night!</i>

1834
02:01:40,765 --> 02:01:43,034
<i>He's no longer
just the namesake of...</i>

1835
02:01:43,067 --> 02:01:45,503
<i>Apollo Creed,
he's the living embodiment.</i>

1836
02:01:45,537 --> 02:01:49,174
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a round of applause...</i>

1837
02:01:49,207 --> 02:01:51,576
<i>for these two warriors in the ring!</i>

1838
02:01:51,709 --> 02:01:55,079
<i>To the winner by split decision...</i>

1839
02:01:56,114 --> 02:01:59,184
<i>and still the undefeated
champion of the world...</i>

1840
02:01:59,217 --> 02:02:00,785
You did great, kid.

1841
02:02:00,818 --> 02:02:02,353
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

1842
02:02:02,387 --> 02:02:03,821
Donnie, you were robbed.

1843
02:02:03,855 --> 02:02:06,491
If this fight had been
10 seconds longer...

1844
02:02:06,524 --> 02:02:07,926
10 seconds longer...

1845
02:02:07,959 --> 02:02:09,727
Creed.

1846
02:02:12,797 --> 02:02:15,900
You go and get it, chum.
You the future of this division.

1847
02:02:15,934 --> 02:02:17,535
You wear that name with pride.

1848
02:02:17,569 --> 02:02:19,470
Respect.

1849
02:02:19,537 --> 02:02:23,107
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

1850
02:02:23,141 --> 02:02:25,710
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

1851
02:02:25,743 --> 02:02:27,412
Even though I know she's mad at me
for doing this.

1852
02:02:27,445 --> 02:02:29,147
<i>Hopefully I made her proud.</i>

1853
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,649
You almost gave me a heart attack
but I'm proud of you.

1854
02:02:31,683 --> 02:02:33,051
I got my family right.

1855
02:02:33,084 --> 02:02:35,854
Without them none of this
would've been possible.

1856
02:02:36,421 --> 02:02:37,055
Rocky...

1857
02:02:37,088 --> 02:02:38,756
Apollo Creed's son...

1858
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:40,325
looks at you and says family.

1859
02:02:40,358 --> 02:02:41,626
What does that mean to you?

1860
02:02:41,693 --> 02:02:45,363
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

1861
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:49,167
He's a real fighter, and he's
helping me fight a new things...

1862
02:02:49,234 --> 02:02:51,603
so I appreciate it. I really do.

1863
02:02:51,636 --> 02:02:54,506
Adonis, I know you
never met your father.

1864
02:02:54,539 --> 02:02:57,876
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

1865
02:03:01,212 --> 02:03:04,349
I'll just tell him I love him...

1866
02:03:04,382 --> 02:03:07,418
and I know he didn't leave me
on purpose.

1867
02:03:07,519 --> 02:03:11,222
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

1868
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:17,295
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations
on a sensational performance. Jim.

1869
02:03:18,963 --> 02:03:22,066
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1870
02:03:24,802 --> 02:03:25,904
Go on.

1871
02:03:25,937 --> 02:03:28,840
Talk to them. Go on!

1872
02:03:49,994 --> 02:03:54,465
<i>This crowd is up on its feet.
No one wants to leave the arena.</i>

1873
02:03:54,499 --> 02:03:57,969
<i>Everyone in here knows
they've seen something special.</i>

1874
02:03:58,002 --> 02:03:59,771
<i>A fight they will never forget.</i>

1875
02:03:59,804 --> 02:04:02,040
<i>Ricky Conlan wins the fight.</i>

1876
02:04:02,073 --> 02:04:05,443
<i>Adonis Creed wins the night.</i>

1877
02:04:24,796 --> 02:04:26,564
This is it?

1878
02:04:26,965 --> 02:04:28,766
Yeah.

1879
02:04:32,170 --> 02:04:34,539
I just wanna see
if I can get up these steps.

1880
02:04:34,572 --> 02:04:36,374
When's the first time you came here?

1881
02:04:36,407 --> 02:04:38,476
I was 12.

1882
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:42,313
I think it's my favorite place.

1883
02:04:47,552 --> 02:04:49,921
When you get to the top...

1884
02:04:50,655 --> 02:04:52,790
you think you can fly.

1885
02:05:11,075 --> 02:05:12,877
Almost there.

1886
02:05:13,378 --> 02:05:15,346
You got this.

1887
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,555
Come on, young man.

1888
02:05:23,588 --> 02:05:24,822
Just let me catch my breath.

1889
02:05:24,856 --> 02:05:26,958
Come on, no breaks.
We rest at the top.

1890
02:05:26,991 --> 02:05:28,826
Just a minute.

1891
02:05:28,927 --> 02:05:30,962
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

1892
02:05:30,995 --> 02:05:33,364
Lets go. One step at a time.

1893
02:05:34,065 --> 02:05:36,167
Yeah.

1894
02:05:36,835 --> 02:05:38,469
Come on.

1895
02:05:40,004 --> 02:05:43,875
One step at a time.
Who told you that?

1896
02:05:43,908 --> 02:05:45,610
Some old guy.

1897
02:05:45,677 --> 02:05:48,279
You know I meant that for you,
not for me.

1898
02:05:50,782 --> 02:05:54,018
I think they added a few more steps.

1899
02:05:54,052 --> 02:05:55,620
I don't know.

1900
02:05:55,687 --> 02:05:56,688
Almost there.

1901
02:05:56,721 --> 02:05:58,323
I'm gonna take these last two.

1902
02:05:58,356 --> 02:05:59,791
One more step.

1903
02:06:00,158 --> 02:06:01,726
How you feeling?

1904
02:06:01,793 --> 02:06:04,229
Good. Really good.

1905
02:06:09,667 --> 02:06:12,737
- You all right there, old man?
- Yeah.

1906
02:06:13,204 --> 02:06:15,106
Nice view.

1907
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:22,847
If you look hard enough, you can see
your whole life from up here.

1908
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:24,649
How does it look?

1909
02:06:24,682 --> 02:06:28,052
Not bad at all. And you?

1910
02:06:28,086 --> 02:06:30,488
Not bad at all.

1911
02:06:30,512 --> 02:06:46,512
