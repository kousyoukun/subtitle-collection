这升职可是很难得的机会

64
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,970
他们给你请了助理吗

谢谢  真为你自豪

66
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,740
打他  打他的身体
Take it to him. Take it to the body.

67
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,740
就这样
There you go!

68

那是酒吧打架而已

74
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,630
不管怎么样我都要打
Well, I'm all in anyway.

75
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,900
所以我觉得我们在外地开始只是取得我们的势头...
So I figure we start out local, just to get our momentum going...

76
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,270
然后我们就可以去我们想去的地方
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

77
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,930
"我们"  我是觉得...

杀人或被杀  人死在那里

81
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,810
你爸爸死在擂台上  这不是开玩笑
Your daddy died in the ring. This ain't no joke.

82
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,080

I don't know him. Ain't got nothing to do with me.

All you gotta do is land one clean head shot...

96
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
我要它来干什么

怕死吗  你是专业选手  对吧
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

98
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,560
不...
No, no, no.

99
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,330
你会被打到屁滚尿流的

你不需要跟我证明些什么
You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.

101
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,330
最好听你家人的话吧  孩子

I'm gonna be fighting fulltime now.

142
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,250
所以我想当面告诉你
So I wanted to tell you facetoface.

143
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,980
你是你父亲的儿子...
You are your father's son...

144
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,020
你是他的一部分
and you're part of him.

145
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,890
但不代表你一定要成为他那样
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

146
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,260
我会打电话给你的
I'm gonna call you.

147
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,300
听着  你要上擂台...
Listen, you want to be in somebody's ring...

148
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,700
你就别打电话给我了
you don't have to call me.

149
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,050
好了  茄子
All right, smile!

150
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,490
你好吗
How you doing?

151
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,200
这是在首战的第十回合拍的  对吧
This was taken from the 10th round of the first fight, right?

152
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,370
没错
Good call.

153
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,340
你怎么知道的
How'd you know that?

154
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,840
我听说完场后你和阿波罗之间...
I heard about a third fight between you and Apollo...

155
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,970
有一场第三战
behind closed doors.

156
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,880
是真的吗
That true?

157
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,840
你哪里听说的
How'd you hear about that?

158
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,810
谁赢了
Who won?

159
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,380
这算是个秘密  你之前说你叫什么名
Its kind of a secret. What'd you say your name was?

160
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,990
唐尼
Donnie.

161
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,520
女孩说你想谈些事
The girl said you wanted to talk about something.

162
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,290
是的  我想跟你谈谈训练我的事
Yeah, I want to talk to you about training me.

163
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,130
训练你
Training you.

164
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,130
我不再训练人了  很抱歉
I don't do that stuff no more. Sorry about that.

165
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,300
听着  现在很晚了  所以我要关门了
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid. So I'm gonna dose up.

166
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,030
他有多厉害
How good was he?

167
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,600
谁  阿波罗  他很厉害
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

168
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,140
他是个完美的拳击手  没有人更甚
He's a perfect fighter. Ain't nobody ever better.

169
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,680
那么你是怎么打倒他的
So how'd you beat him?

170
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,880
是时间打倒了他
Time beat him.

171
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,410
时间带走所有人  是无敌的
Time takes everybody out, it's undefeated.

172
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,820
不管怎么样  我要关门了
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

173
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,680
当米奇死的时候他来跟你谈过  对吧
When Mickey died, he came and talked to you, right?

174
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,250
叫你别放弃
Talked you out of quitting?

175
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,160
带你去洛杉矶  训练你...
Took you to L.A., trained you...

176
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,960
让你重新振作
brought you back.

177
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,200
你怎么知道这些事的  你觉得呢
How do you know all this? How do you think?

178
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,110
你是什么人  亲戚吗  他是我父亲
What are you, like a cousin? He's my father.

179
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,650
不  才不是  我不相信你
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

180
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,810
打给玛丽  安妮啊
Call Mary Anne.

181
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,220
玛丽  安妮  他的妻子
Mary Anne. His wife.

182
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,880
家庭电话没有变
The house number still works.

183
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,990
是哦  你自从葬礼后就没跟她谈过了
Oh, that's right. You haven't talked to her since the funeral.

184
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,790
虽然她说你说了一段很好的演讲
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

185
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,340
是啊
Yeah.

186
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,910
很好的演讲
Nice speech.

187
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,840
我要你训练我
I want you to train me.

188
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,850
我需要一个可靠的人而还有哪个更好的
I need somebody solid and who else better to go to?

189
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,380
这是你欠我的
You at least owe me that.

190
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,820
我看你说话你是个文化人
I can tell the way you talk, you been to school.

191
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,590
所以我以为你挺聪明的
So I figure you got some brains.

192
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,160
为什么你要选择一个拳击手的人生...
Why would you want to pick a fighter's life...

193
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,690
而当你没这个必要
when you don't have to?

194
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,500
如果阿波罗还活着他也会这么跟你说
If Apollo was around, he would tell you that, too.

195
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,930
但他不在了
Well he ain't around.

196
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,040
我一生都在打拼  我没有选择
I been fighting my whole life. I ain't got a choice.

197
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,870
这总是关于一个选择
It's always about a choice.

198
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,370
我以前在擂台上
I was in the ring.

199
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,610
我看到是什么下场  那场比赛应该停止的
I saw how it went down. That fight should've been stopped.

200
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
我应该阻止它
I should have stopped it.

201
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,980
也许他想像一个拳击手的死去
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

202
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,150
也许你做的完全是他所想的
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

203
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,820
我觉得他了宁愿在这里跟你聊天
I think he'd rather be here, talking with you.

204
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,970
你们很相似
There is a resemblance.

205
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,510
我一般都在这里...
I'm usually here all the time...

206
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,480
所以如果你在附近想过来...
so if you're ever in the neighborhood, come by...

207
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,780
如果你需要什么
if you need something.

208
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,650
我明天会在米奇的拳击馆
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

209
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,720
我不去那里的  我没去那里很久了
I don't go there.I haven't been there in a long time.

210
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,930
既然我们像家人一样...
Since we're pretty much like family...

211
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,460
第三场比赛谁赢了
who won the third fight?

212
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,170
他赢了
He did.

213
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,800
在拳击里...
In boxing...

214
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,370
拳击手的起点是...
fighters' origins can endure as the most...

215
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,470
他们形象最神圣的要素...
sacred element of their identity...

216
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,300
一个选择可以永远改变他们的人生
shaping choices that can change their lives forever.

217
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
"漂亮"  瑞奇康兰是英格兰利物浦出身
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan is a faithful son of Liverpool, England...

218
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,510
是一个人们在传说中的英雄...
a place where people find hope...

219
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,880
寻找希望的地方
in the tales of their heroes.

220
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,680
但对于世界上不败最强的同等级重量拳击手来讲...
But for the undefeated best poundforpound boxer in the world...

221
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,220
未来是充满不确定性的...
the future is filled with uncertainty...

222
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,490
随着一个监禁七年的判决逼近
with a sevenyear prison sentence looming.

223
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,560
我不打算在监房里浪费我的全盛时期
I didn't plan on spending me prime years in a prison cell.

224
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,330
我讨厌让我的家人失望
I hate letting me family down.

225

现在在家等着他的最后比赛会是什么...
Now what could be his final bout awaits him at home...

226
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,300

in one of his city's most hallowed sporting temples.

227
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,410
这里  他会迎接一位同样从没被击败过的对手...
Here, he'll welcome an opponent who's also never been beaten...

228
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,180
一个以他的方式从加利福利亚街头...
and who's boxed his way from California streets...

229
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,650
打到成为美国巨星

230
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,420
从著名的特尔斐拳击学院出来...

我甚至从来没被击倒过而这也不会改变
I've never even been knocked down, and that's not gonna change.

236

一个在黑暗和非凡窘况中的冠军
A champion in a dark and extraordinary predicament.

237
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,080
一个对英雄送别很冷漠的挑战者

你好吗
How you doing?

278
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,900
你刚叫我"大叔"吗
Did you call me "Unc"?

279
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,370
是的  或OG
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

280
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,140
什么是"OG"
What's an "O.G."?

281
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,170
老家伙
Oldass gangster.

282
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,040
"大叔"  就好了
"Unc" is good.

283
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,580
我可以搬  没关系
I can do that. It's all good.

284
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,610
那么你为什么过来  你饿了吗
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

285
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,880
不  我刚练完拳  想过来看看
No, I just wrapped up at the gym. Figured I'd stop by.

286
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,390
好吧
Okay.

287
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,860
可以问你个问题  当然  这些我都可以搬
Can I ask you a question. Sure. I can do all this.

288
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,960
我可以做些什么训练来提高我的手速
What are some drills I can do to get my hand speed up?

289
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,930
那里的有些人我想他们可以帮到你
Some guys up there, I bet they can help you.

290
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,030
哪里有个叫彼得的家伙  他是个不错的教练
There's a guy there named Pete. He's a pretty good trainer.

291
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,940
但他大部分时间都跟他的拳手一起
Yeah, but he's with his fighter most of the time.

292
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,570
我基本上只是自己训练
I mostly just train myself.

293
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,210
他们知道你是奎迪的后代吗
They know you're a Creed?

294
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,050
我不用那一套  我要自己打出名堂
I don't go by that. I'm trying to make it on my own.

295
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,150

另外让生活更轻松

298
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,760
再加上  如果你训练我...
Plus, if you train me...

299
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,600
周围没人认识我  我们可以秘密进行
nobody around knows me. We could fly under the radar.

300
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,030
他们永远都不会知道  好吧
They'd never know. Yeah.

301
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
我之前就跟你说了...
I told you before...

302
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,710
我只是不想做  孩子
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

303
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,210
没关系  但也许你可以给我些训练
Tha's cool, but maybe you could just give me some drills.

304
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,250
训练  是的  一些我可以自己做的训练
Drills? Yeah, things I could do on my own.

305
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,820
你就是不罢休  是吧  你就像一只啄木鸟
You don't stop, do you? You're like a woodpecker.

306
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,790
天啊
My God.

307
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,030
好吧  我有些训练
All right. I got a few.

308
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,570
但到此为止  好吧  没问题
But that's it. Okay? Of course.

当你打重的沙包...
When you get to the heavy bag...

312
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,510
不要只顾着挥动你的双手  因为你会受伤的
just don't keep throwing your hands because you can hurt them.

313
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,350
同时也要用你的双脚  好吧

已经传上云端了
It's already up in the cloud.

329
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,870

335
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,950
我想听你的近况...
I wanna hear from you...

336
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,950
所以你有空就回我电话吧  就这样
so call me back when you get a chance. All right.

337
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,440
干嘛  很吵吗
What, it's too loud?

338
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,070
不  我只是听到你在这下面工作
No, I just heard you down here working.

339
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,640
看看你想不想休息一下
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

340

也许吃点东西
Maybe get some food?

341
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,950
你是从里来的  唐尼  我从洛杉矶来的
Where you from, Donnie? I'm from L.A.

342
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,720
所以你在洛杉矶是这样跟女性搭讪的
So is this how y'all ask females out in L.A.?

343
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
只是看看你肚子饿不饿

I was hoping you could tell me. You're from Philly, right?

351
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,920

371
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,810
这不是

372
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,240
我们在哪里吃  里面

So I heard you back there, "jawn" this, "jawn" that.

374
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,250
什么是"玩意"  这是个名词
What's a "jawn"? It's a noun.

我们坐的这餐厅是一间玩意  你是一个玩意

演出什么的  是的

我下个月要去电厂音乐会

383
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,570
那是什么  是这里很大的一个馆
What's that? It's a big venue out here.

384
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,340
很多人都是从那开始的  吉尔  传奇乐队  根乐队
A lot of people got their start. Jill, Legend, the Roots.

385
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,780
不赖啊
That's wassup.

386
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,510
我可以问你些私人的问题吗
Can I ask you something personal?

387
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,990
我有慢性听力受损
I got progressive hearing loss.

388
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,960
我去年开始戴这些
Just started wearing these this past year.

389
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,730
但我只会在很嘈杂的地方需要他们
But I only need them in places with a lot of background noise.

390
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,260
目前
For now.

391
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,570
这是慢性的  所以最后...
So it's progressive, so eventually...

392
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,470
是的
Yeah.

393
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,100
没错
Yeah.

394
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,740
我只是在给它做准备
I'm just getting ready for it.

395
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,080
就像习惯这些  我在学手语什么的
Like I'm getting used to these, I'm learning sign language and stuff.

396
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,510
但我真的只能记住粗口
But I really can only remember bad words.

397
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,120
一些没什么用的  就像...
Ones that aren't that useful like...

398
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,550
这是什么
The fuck's that?

399
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,590
你看不出来吗  这是瞎  目字  这是...
You cant tell? This is the bull, the horns, this is...

400
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,130
对  这是瞎扯
Yeah, this is bullshit.

401
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,200
这是你最爱说的话
That's your favorite?

402
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,630
我看你不太像个拳手
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

403
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,430
你身材很好还有很多像  但...
You're in shape and all but...

404
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,140
我也说不清  不像大部分拳手...
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

405
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,070
像什么  像小混混
Like what? Like street.

406
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,180
我不是说你是个正直的人什么的...
I'm not saying you're a square or anything...

407
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,680
但我只是很好奇是什么让你想打拳击
but I'm just curious, what made you wanna fight?

408
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,310
我老爸是一个拳手
My pop was a fighter.

409
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,410
好吧  这说得过去
Right. That makes sense.

410
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,980
他是职业拳手吗
Did he fight pro?

411
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,150
差不多吧
Something like that.

412
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,850
他训练你吗
Does he train you?

413
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:23,020
我老爸在我出生前就死了

414
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,730
听到这我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

415
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,900
那么是什么让你想唱歌
So what made you wanna sing?

416
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,880
这让我感到有活力
It makes me feel alive.

417
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,780
你下一场演出在哪
Where's your next show?

418
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,250

421
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,760
我想来  支持下你

我考虑下吧
Let me think on it.

423
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:33,190

429
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,280
艾德里安  我亲爱的
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

430
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,180
精英中的精英
The best of the best.

431
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,090
我跟你说  艾德里安  天啊
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

432
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,460
走上来这小山是越来越难了  这意味着什么
It's getting harder to walk up this hill. What does that mean?

433
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,260
不管则么样今天是个好日子  没烦恼的好日子
Anyway, it's a good day today. It's a good day, got no problems.

434
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,930
账单都付清了
Bills are paid.

435
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,400
唯一的是有时候晚上很难睡觉  我的背
Only thing is, it's tough to sleep at night sometimes. My back.

436
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,710
不管你怎么做都一样痛
No matter what you do, it catches up to you.

437
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,910
不管怎么样我们看看今天世界有什么新闻吧
Anyway, shall we see what's new in the world today?

438
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,360

冠军  彼得  怎么了

Didn't know you were coming by. I didn't either.

449
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,310
我只是刚好在附近  你这里干得不错啊
I was just in the neighborhood. You've done nice here.

450
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,880
地方看起来不错  新装修一切都是新的
Place is looking good, new paint and everything.

Very good, very nice. I do what I can.

452
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,550
还记得我的儿子利奥吗  当然
Remember my son, Leo? Of course I do.

453
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,520
自从你上次见他后大个头很多了
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

454
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,290
没错  非常大  洛奇...
Yeah, very big. Rocky...

455
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,190
他赢了17次0败

456
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,990
我们真的很顺利
Things are really opening up for us.

457
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,860
利奥

458
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,030
洛奇  如果你想加入还是可以的
Rocky, option's still open if you wanna get involved.

459
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,200
做点小培训  来点激情
Little training, little motivation.

460
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,100
让我考虑下吧  当然
Let me think about it. Sure, sure.

461
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,070
你好吗  孩子  很荣幸见到你  冠军
How you doing, kid? It's an honor to meet you, champ.

Nice to meet you, too. 17 and 0, very good.

463
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,110
我本来应该跟瑞奇  康兰打的...
Yeah, I was supposed to fight under Ricky Conlan's card...

464
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,740
但被取消了  大叔
but it got cancelled. Hey, Unc!

465
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,180
大叔
Unc.

466
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,280
他在叫你吗  我想是吧
He talking to you? Yeah. I think so Yeah.

467
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,580
你来了啊  是的
You made it. Yeah.

468
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,350
只是顺路过来
Just walked by. Here I am.

469
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,520
你怎么认识好莱坞的  我们在餐厅认识的
How you know Hollywood? We met at the restaurant.

470
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,960
正是
That's it.

471
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,260
好吧  洛奇  好吧
Okay, Rock. Okay.

472
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,930
你需要什么就叫我
You need anything, you let me know.

473
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,940
好的  衷心的祝你幸运  孩子  谢谢
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously. Thanks.

474
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,170
17赢0败  这孩子很有前途  很彪悍
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

475
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,340
我可以跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you a minute?

476
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,320
我不知道我来这里干什么
I don't even know what I'm doing here

477
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,590
因为我的生活有其他打算...
because I got other plans for my life...

478
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,250
而这不是那的一部分
and this wasn't part of it.

479
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,220
你父亲很特别
Your father was special.

480
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,530
跟你说实话  我不知道你特不特别
Tell you the truth, I don't know if you're special.

481
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,830
只有在时机成熟你才会知道
Only you gonna know that when the time is right.

482
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,500
这不会在一夜之间达成
It ain't gonna come overnight.

483
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,300
你要不断的打  你要做这些训练...
You're gonna take a beating, you're gonna take this...

484
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,230
你会被击倒  你要爬起来...
you're gonna get knocked down, you're gonna get up...

485
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,370
然后如果你做对了你就会明白
and you're gonna see if you got the right thing.

486
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,370
但你必须努力
But, you gotta work hard.

487
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,580
我向天发誓  如果你不努力我就不干了
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it, I'm out.

488
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,010
我击出的每一拳都是靠我自己的
Every punch I've ever thrown has been on my own.

489
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,920
没有人教我该怎么做
Nobody showed me how to do this.

490
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,680
我准备好了
I'm ready.

491
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,320
来吧  我们开始吧
Come on. Let's do this.

492
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,960
到我的办公室
Step into my office.

493
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,930
你认真的吗
You serious?

494
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,090
我认真的  这是老方法
I am serious. This is old school.

495
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,960
你应该有能力抓到这些鸟的其中一只
You should be able to grab one of these birds.

496
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
三十秒内  没错  做梦吧
30 seconds? Yeah, in your dreams.

497
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,700
快点  你这也叫快吗
Come on! You call that fast?

498
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,750
不  再来
No! Again.

499
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,420
我还以为你很快呢
I thought you were fast.

500
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,080
过来
Come here!

501
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,620
预测他们的动向
Get them legs moving!

502
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,420
努力点  跑快点
Little harder, little faster!

503
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,430
跟上节奏  继续跑
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

504
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,840
控制你的节奏然后慢慢加速
Control your tempo then build slowly.

505
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,910
快点
More.

506
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,010
加速
Build, build, build.

507
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,610
快
Go!

508
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,690
这铃声不是说放学了  唐尼  继续跳
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie. Keep going.

509
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,330
这铃声代表累死你
That bell means hell.

510
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,130
快去抓那只鸡  这没多难
Just go get the chicken. It's not that big a deal.

511
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,730
过来啊  该死的
Come here! God damn it!

512
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,700
我的天
Oh, my God!

513
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,310
这很好  鸡都跑累了
That's pretty good. Chickens are slowing down.

514
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,310
好了  唐尼  摆好你的站姿
All right, Donnie, get into your stance.

515
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,980
做一个小目标  反向对着  好吧
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

516
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,580
你看到这家伙凝视着你吗
You see this guy here staring back at you?

517
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,380
是的
Yeah.

518
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,190
这就是你最难对付的对手
That's your toughest opponent.

519
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,890
每次你上到擂台这就是你的对手
Every time you get into the ring, that's who you're going against.

520
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,530
在拳击里我是这样想而在生活里我也是这么想  好吧
I believe that in boxing and I do believe that in life, okay?

521
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,600
现在往下巴来一击刺拳
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

522
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,360
好了  一击到肚子
All right, one to the gut.

523
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,000
每次你对这家伙出拳  他会怎么做
Now, every time you punch this guy, what's he doing?

524
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,540
他会还我一击  没错
He's throwing one back at me. That's right.

525
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,640
所以你要么格挡它或者避开它  开始
So either you block it, slip it or get out of the way. Go.

526
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,680
我让你们慢慢练了
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

527
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,550
加油
Good luck.

528
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,130
怎么了  进来没问题
What's up? Is it cool?

529
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,560
可以
Yes.

530
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,730
这里挺香啊
Smells good in here.

531
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,140
我不知道拳手喝什么的  你喝茶吗
I don't even know what fighters drink. Do you drink tea?

532
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,970
茶很好  谢谢
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

533
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,610
没问题
Yeah.

534
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,810
那么这就是你的家  就这样
So this is the house. This is it.

535
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,050
你在做什么
What you working on?

536
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,830
这是你们从洛杉矶到费城的唐尼
This your boy Donnie From L.A. to Philly

537
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,930
费城  奶酪碎牛肉的发源地
Philly, the home of the cheesesteaks

538
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,770
我想来个奶酪碎牛肉
Oh, I want a cheesesteak

539
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,900
我很饥饿  这歌就叫饥饿
I'm so hungry Hungry for the title

540
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,240
我会吃个芝士蛋糕
I'll settle for a cheesecake

541
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,710
芝士蛋糕  你做的蛋糕  你有的蛋糕
Cheesecake, the cake that you make The cake that you got

542
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,380
伴奏呢  抱歉
Where the beat go? Sorry.

543
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,850
你听听
Hey, check you out.

544
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,230
一  二  三
One, two, three.

545
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,730
不错  非常好
I like that. Very good.

546
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,870
保持协调  继续
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

547
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,240
唐尼  起来  你得继续
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

548
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,880
这很困难但你得继续  你还不够彪悍
It's tough but you gotta do it. You get a "B" in tough.

549
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,010
这孩子状态不错啊  冠军
Kid's looking good, champ!

550

对  他越来越好了
Yeah, he's getting there.

551
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,290
好莱坞  你现在多重
Hey, Hollywood, what do you weigh right now?

552
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,690
我不知道  大概180磅吧
I don't know, probably like 180.

553
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,760
干嘛
Why?

554
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,430
如果你有兴趣  降到175磅我们来场比赛
Get down to a buck 75, we'll make something happen, if you're interested.

555
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,630
求之不得  我有兴趣  不
Hell yeah, I'm interested. No.

556
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,370
我负责说话  好吧  你负责打
I do the talking, okay? You do the fighting.

557
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,540
175磅  这是你儿子的体重
175? That's your boy's weight.

558
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,540
你好吗  利奥
How you doing, Leo?

559
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,280
怎么样  洛奇  好
What's up, Rock? Yeah.

560
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,840
他可以用一场比赛来保持知名度
He could use a fight to keep warm.

561
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,650
知名度  我不打算骗你
Warm? I'm not gonna lie to you.

562
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,910
人们会愿意来看你再出现在比赛  冠军
People will come out to see you in the corner again, champ.

563
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,020
我们会搞得像以前一样  全城都聚集在那
We'll make it like the old days. Get the whole city there.

564
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,690
给大家赚点钱
Make a few bucks for everybody.

565
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,820
不  我很明白
No, I understand that.

566
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,360
但我现在才刚开始训练这孩子
But I'm just getting used to this kid right now,

567
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,260
而他是越来越好...
and he's getting better every day...

568
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,030
但他还要练一段时间
but he's gonna take a while.

569
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,030
他很饥饿了
He's hungry.

570
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,830
你得满足他  你知道的
You gotta feed him every now and again. You know that.

571
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,200
谢谢  我很感谢  大师傅  我们没关系的
Thanks. I appreciate it, chef. We'll be okay. Thanks.

572
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,970
考虑下吧  我会考虑的
Think about it. I'll think about it.

573
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,540
洛奇  我们训练为的是什么
Rock, what we training for?

574
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,810
我们训练为的是什么
Yeah, what are we training for?

575
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,540
我们训练是为了赢  不被杀  你还没准备好
We're training to win, not get killed. You're not ready yet.

576
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,380
我可以减5磅  我可以就这样减5磅
I can lose five pounds. I can lose five pounds like that.

577
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,910
这没什么  很容易
It's nothing, It's easy.

578
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,080
打沙包
Hit the bag.

579
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,190
打吧
Come on.

580
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,490
这孩子就像一个彪悍的费城斗士
This kid's like a tough Philadelphia fighter.

581
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,490
我以前从没见过你比赛
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

582
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,390
但我一直有看他  而我很相信他跟不上我的滑板鞋
Yeah, but I've watching him, and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

583
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,560
什么是滑板鞋  我可以打倒他
What's a fade? I could take him out.

584
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,900
好吧  好了  听着
Okay. All right, listen.

585
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,270
我给你提个你无法拒绝的提议吧
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

586
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,170
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

587
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,570
不  我认真的  这样  我们接受比赛
No, I'm serious, man. Look, we take the match.

588
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,200
好
Right.

589
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,610
我有六周时间训练  六周里我愿意付出任何代价
I got six weeks to get in shape. Six weeks, I'll do whatever it takes.

590
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,710
在六周后你觉得不行  就取消
At the end of the six weeks, you don't think it's right, call it off.

591
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,410
真的吗
Really?

592
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,480
这就是我来这的目的  对吗  我会全天候为了这目标
This is what I'm here for, all right? I'll go 24/7 with this shit.

593
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,950
事实上我们现在可以去拿我的东西
Matter of fact, we can go get my stuff right now.

594
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,250
拿东西干嘛  那么我可以搬进你的家啊
For what? So I can move into your spot.

595
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,390
开始训练营  老方法  还记得吗
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

596
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,220
不  很久没有人来过我家住了...
No, no one's been in my house in a long time...

597
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,090
而且我觉得你在那里会很不舒服
and I don't think you'd be comfortable there.

598
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,890
什么  你裸体满屋跑吗
What, you walk around naked?

599
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,230
没有
No.

600
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,030
那就没问题了
We're good then.

601
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,210
你最好也别裸体满屋跑
You better not walk around naked either.

602
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,480
不然你就死定了
That's for sure.

603
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,590
最后一件  对  这是全部行李了
Last one? Yeah, that's all of it.

604
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,060
你要搬走
You're moving?

605
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,700
对  今天太疯狂了  我还没来得及告诉你...
Yeah, today's been crazy. I didn't get a chance to tell you...

606
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,670
但我要去跟我叔叔住一段时间...
but I'm gonna be living with my uncle for a while,

607
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,670
为了接下来的比赛训练
training for the next fight.

608
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,970
那是你的叔叔
That's your uncle?

609
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,370
他是白人啊
He's white.

610
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,670
远亲
Yeah, a long time.

611
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:25,080
他会跟我住  当我们没有训练...
He's gonna be staying with me, and when we ain't training...

612
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,250
很欢迎你过来
you're welcome to come on over.

613
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,020
很好  谢谢  很高兴认识你
Cool, thank you. I'ts nice to meet you.

614
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,760
为什么你这样看着我
Why you giving me that look?

615
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,130
你什么时候会告诉我你叔叔是洛奇  巴尔博亚
When were you gonna tell me that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

616
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,390
我会打电话给你的
I'm gonna call you.

617
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,100
好吧  我可不会等你电话的
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

618
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,740
这个比安卡女孩看起来不错啊
That Bianca girl looks kind of nice.

619
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,710
你喜欢她
You like her?

620
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,540
她很不错  这间吗
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

621
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,740
没错
Yeah.

622
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,010
女人会令你腿软  你知道我什么意思吗
Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

623
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,550
我的脚没事  这曾经是谁的房间
My legs work just fine. Whose room was this?

624
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,520
是保利的房间  保利
It's Paulie's room. Paulie.

625
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,250
保利是我最好的朋友  虽然他不是很友好
Paulie was my best friend even though he wasn't so friendly.

626
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,350
他怎么了
What happened to him?

627
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,390
去世了  我很抱歉
Passed away. I'm sorry.

628
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,890
有点乱  我们会整理到很晚
Kind of a mess. We'll straighten it up later.

629
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,190
这会挺舒服的
It'll be comfortable.

630
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,960
这是张旧照片  这是你儿子
Oh, man, this is a dope pic! That's your boy?

631
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,500
这是我的孩子  罗伯特
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

632
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,470
你也训练他  我试过...
Did you train him, too? I tried...

633
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,580
但他就是不喜欢拳击  学不好
but he just didn't like fighting, didn't take to it.

634
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,080
他还在城里吗
He still around here?

635
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,720
不  他跟他女朋友搬到一个叫温哥华的地方
No, he moved to a place called Vancouver with his girlfriend.

636
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,590
我想他们在那过得很不错...
I think they're having a grand old time up there...

637
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,790
我现在有听到他的消息了...
and I hear from him now and then...

638
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,960
但以前他住在费城挺艰难的
but it was tough for him to live in Philadelphia.

639
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,430
我还有所有的事...洛奇之子
Me and all that stuff... Rocky's son.

640
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,330
他很开心  我为他感到很高兴
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

641
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,510
要不你收拾行李吧  当自己家就好了
Why don't you unpack, all right? Make yourself comfortable.

642
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,840
而我会去餐厅  我晚上回来
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant and I'll be back.

643
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,010
然后我们早上开始训练  好吧
Then we start first thing in the morning, all right?

644
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,710
没问题
You got it.

645
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,570
好吧  保利
All right, Paulie!

646
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,230
宝贝爱你哟
Baby love you.

647
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,360
是时候训练了  这就是你如何开始
Hey, it' s time to train. This is how you start.

648
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,070
让你充满活力
Get your engine going.

649
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,940
我要带你去的这个地方叫
I'm gonna take you to this place called

650
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,710
前街拳馆  在费城北部
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

651
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,180
那很不错  好吧
It's pretty good. Okay.

652
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,110
你会在那里训练
You're gonna train there,

653
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,050
因为我不想你在对手...
because I don't want you to train in the same place...

654
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,290
同样的地方训练
as the guy that you're gonna be fighting, right?

655
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,520
这有道理
Yeah, that makes sense.

656
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,190
唐  别上车  我要你跟车跑
Don, don't get in. I want you to run alongside.

657
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,820
我有点老古董  对吧  没错
I'm kinda antique, right? Yeah.

658
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,290
那么我开车你尽量跟紧
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

659
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,500
那有多近  够近的了
How close is it? It's close enough.

660
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,230
好吧
All right.

661
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,970
等等  让我先热身
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.

662
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,120
你做到了
You made it. Hey.

663
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,930
我以为你说很近啊
I tought you said it was close.

664
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,530
没那么近  这里是弗兰克福  强者之地
Not that close. This is Frankford. Tough place.

665
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,100
你要成为费城斗士  这就是该去的地方
You wanna be a Philly fighter, is the place to go.

666
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,770
费城斗士  我认为他们是世界上最彪悍的人
Philly fighters, I think they're the toughest guys in the world.

667
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,980
在很多方面  也许是在水里  我也说不清...
In a lot of ways. Maybe it's in the water, I don't know...

668
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,880
但是个好地方
but great place though.

669
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,580
怎么那么多摩托车  这是费城特色
What's up with all these bikes? It's a Philly thing.

670
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,650
这些家伙玩特技和制造噪音
These guys are popping wheelies and making noise,

671
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,850
在街上跑来跑去
going up and down the street.

672
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,120
你骑摩托吗
Do you ride?

673
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,130
不  我有过一台哈雷但我摔下来了
No. I had a Harley once but I fell off,

674
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,620
所以我决定坐11路
so I decided to use my feet.

675
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,360
这孩子  斯皮诺  他有些特别
Now, this kid, Sporino, he got something special.

676
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,100
他没那么简单打倒所以你要下点功夫  明白我意思吗
He's no pushover, so you're gonna have to work, you know what I mean?

677
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
你觉得怎么样

我还不够快  就这样
I can't pivot fast enough. Yeah, just turn it.

709
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,480
这是你的力量
That's your power.

00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,210
要快  出拳要快
Fast, pop it fast.

711
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,150
我尽我能力的快了
I'm popping as fast as I can.

712
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,980
我尽量像你跟我说那样后退撑着
I'm trying to push off my back foot like you told me.

713
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,550
唐尼  过来
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

714
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,320
但我来是跟你学的
I came out hew to work with you, though.

715
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,790
我就是这样教的  好吗  有些事我做不了
This is how I work, okay? There's some things I can't do.

716
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,530
我做不了体力活了  我不能再像这样拿着垫子
I can't do this anymore. I can never hold the pads like that.

717
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,660
但我看着你  我是在教你
But I'm looking at you. I m working with you.

718
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,330
我用头脑来教
I'm working with this.

719
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,900
听好了
Lighten it up.

720
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,300
我跟他们说真打了吗
Am I still taking them real shots?

721
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,140
缓着点
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

722
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,610
就这样
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

723
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,540
这很简单
This easy work, Pop.

724
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,080
必须保持移动  就这样
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

725
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,150
时间到  铃声
Time! Bell! Bell!

726
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,350
给点力啊
Taking real shots thought!

727
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,980
你什么意思
What you mean?

728
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,580
到此为止  马上把手套脱了
Cut it out! Take those gloves off right now!

729
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,890
这是我的拳馆  把手套脱了
This my gym! Take the glove off right now!

730
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,620
你个渣渣滚回洛杉矶吧  你还是个垃圾  这是我的拳馆
Take your soft ass back to L.A.! You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

731
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,690
去你的拳馆
Fuck this gym!

732
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,530
这是学习阶段...不行
Called a learning curve... Ain't no way.

733
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,660
你知道吗
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

734
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,570
当你在说话你学不了任何东西  这是事实
You can't learn anything when you're talking. That's a fact of life.

735
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,700
只要你在说话你就没有在听
As long as you're talking, you're not listening.

736
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,810
去道歉  你们是同一阵线的  好吗
Go apologize. You guys are on the same damn team, okay?

737
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,380
这就对了  很好  你很好  没关系
There you go. Good. You good. It's okay.

738
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,580
好了  继续吧
All right. Now let's go to work!

739
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,480
双刺拳
Double jab. Yup.

740
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,980
上面
Go ahead over the top.

741
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,220
右勾拳这里  在这里
Right hook here. Over here.

742
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,450
一次一步  一次出一拳...
One step at a time, one punch at a time...

743
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,560
这样重复
one round at a time.

744
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,490
一次一步  一次出一拳...
One step at a time, one punch at a time...

745
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,590
这样重复  右转

746
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,730
来吧  继续
Come on, let's go.

747
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,060
快点  出拳快点
Fast, pop it fast.

748
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,310
很好
Good.

749
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,440
我要你全力以赴
I want you to let it all out.

750
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,080
这里
Now right here.

751
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,480
曾经有人人尊重你  看着他们
Everyone's ever disrespected you, see them.

752
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,680
一切你曾经想要的...
Anything you ever wanted...

753
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,650
追寻它
go after it.

754
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,060
你是时候发威了  摆出架势
Now's your time! Make a statement!

755
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,330
一步

一拳
One punch!

757
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,700
一步一步来
One round at a time!

758
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,140
好了
There it is.

759
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:10,440
你出猫
You cheated!

760
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,830
洛奇  你好吗  彼得
Rock. Hey, how you doing, Pete?

761
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,700
有问题吗
Something wrong?

762
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,300
洛奇  我知道  我知道这孩子有点猫腻
Rock, I knew. I knew there was something with this kid.

763
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,610
洛奇  我一直叫你回来跟我们一起做教练很多年
Rocky, I have been trying for years to get you to come work with us.

764
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,310
没关系
It's okay.

765
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,080
突然间这从好莱坞来的孩子
All of a sudden, this kid from Hollywood

766
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,280
把你从阴影中拉了出来
gets you out of the shadows.

767
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,140
不  没有阴影
No. No shadows.

768
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,680
我只是不想再拳馆做事  仅此而已
I just didn't want to do nothing in the gym, that's all.

769
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,650
洛奇  我打了电话去洛杉矶
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

770
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,890
这孩子叫阿多尼斯  是奎迪的后代
Kid's name is Adonis. Kid has Creed's blood.

771
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,060
现在这场拳击会变得史前轰动
Now this fight just got big time.

772
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,230
我很抱歉
I apologize.

773
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,560
帮我个忙  我们可以保守这个秘密吗
Do me a favor.Can we keep this between ourselves?

774
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,660
不是吧  不
Come on. No.

775
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,200
我是在请求你帮忙
I'm asking you as a favor.

776
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,700
我想他闯出自己的名堂
I want him to make a name on his own.

777
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,540
来嘛  彼得
Come on, Pete.

778
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,210
我会保守秘密的  洛奇
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

779
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,380
我很感谢
I appreciate it.

780
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,590
保持状态  你状态很好
Keep going. You're looking good.

781
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,060
动起来
Go on, get moving.

782
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,150
大家今晚感觉怎么样
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

783
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,620
我要说下美国广播公司的规则和州管理规则
I'm about to go over the ABC rules and the rules governed by the state.

784
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,420
没有三次击倒规则  没有站立数八下规则
No three knockdown rule. No standing eightcount.

785
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,530
拳手不能被铃声所救
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

786
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,690
我们说的"没有三次击倒规则"  是什么意思呢...
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"...

787
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,660
基本上就是裁判认为任何适合比赛
is basically whatever the referee sees fit for competition.

788
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,210
大叔  脱掉我的手套
Unc, cut my gloves off.

789
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,370
怎么了  我的手套  快把它脱了
What's wrong? My gloves, just cut 'em off!

790
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,940
我不能脱  你准备上场了
I can't cut 'em off, you're ready to go fight.

791
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,980
它们太紧了吗
Are they too tight?

792
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,580
我现在紧张死了  我要去拉屎
I'm freaking out right now! I gotta take a shit!

793
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,920
有人跟我擦屁股吗
Somebody gonna wipe my ass for me?

794
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,780
妈的  脱掉我的手套  大叔
Oh, shit! Cut my gloves off, Unc!

795
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,520
好了  轻松点
All right, relax.

796
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,290
我现在把你的手套脱了
I'll cut you out of these gloves. It happens.

797
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,090
裁判  我这有点麻烦
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

798
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,360
唐  我到外面去  是的
D, I'm gonna be right outside. That's right.

799
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,190
你可以拖延十分钟吗
Can you just stall for 10 minutes or something?

800
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,260
我要把拳头戴回去
I gotta put the gloves back on.

801
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,830
好吧  我在外面等  洛奇
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

802
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:44,960
我很感谢你  非常谢谢
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

803
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,330
没问题  你有十分钟时间
It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.

804
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:46,930
这是我的首次
First for me.

805
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,700
好了  没问题的
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

806
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,540
有点紧张吗
A little nervous?

807
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,010
紧张
Nerves?

808
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,310
快点啊
Hurry up!

809
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,750
蓝方  红方
Blue corner, red corner.

810
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,480
好了  你们都在更衣室听了规则了
All right, fellows, y'all had your intructions in the dressing room.

899
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,850
你也许没有  你告诉我你爸爸是个拳手
You might as well have. You told me that your dad was some fighter.

900
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,750
你没说他是个最出名的拳手
You didn't say he was the most famous fighter ever lived.

901
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,620
当他们知道后大家看我就不同了
People look at me differently when they know.

是啊  唐尼  但我不是那些人

我不在乎那些事
I don't care about that shit.

905
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,960
但我很在乎你隐瞒我
I do care about you keeping it 100% with me, though.

906

听着  你是对的  好吗
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

908
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,800
现在开始不隐瞒任何事
100% honesty from here on out.

909
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:13,810
好吧  那他的...他的妻子是你的妈妈吗
All right. So his... His wife, tht's not your mom?

910
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,240
阿波罗跟我妈妈有婚外情
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

911
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,550
好了吗  她在我小时候就死了
All right? She died when I was young.

912
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:23,820
几年来我一直被寄养
I bounced around foster care for a couple years.

913
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,590
在少管所经常出入
In and out of juvie.

914
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,420
然后玛丽  安妮找到我  把我收养了
Then Mary Anne tracked me down and took me in.

915
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,260
还有问题吗
Anything else?

916
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,660
问我吧
Ask me.

917
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,800
在我之前你跟过几个女孩子一起
How many females have you been with before me?

918
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:40,900
还有其他吗

当我在你身边我感觉就像知道你是我的生命
When I'm around you I feel like I know you my whole life.

922
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,910
告诉我你跟我没有同样的感觉
Tell me you don't feel the same way about me.

923
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,080
随便吧  这是激情  这是热恋  这会过去的
Whatever. That's in passion. That's infatuation. That fades.

924
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,380
我可看不出来  为什么看不出
I can't see that happening. Why not?

925
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,650
你激励我  好吧  所以我只是你的动机
You motivate me. Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

926
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,120
你是不是要把我的话全都找茬
Are you gonna find a problem with everything I say?

927
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,150
不  我要找出你说的话真实的部分
No, I'm gonna find the real in what you're saying.

928
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,330
别担心  没关系  也许你也是只是我的动机
Don't worry, it's cool. Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

929
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,060
是吗
Oh, really?

930
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,430
我不介意
I don't mind that.

931
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,030
干嘛
What?

932
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:19,770
但你真的很像他  我的天  我讨厌死了
You do look like him, though. Oh, my God. I hate that!

933
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,740

01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,950
让我们说回以前  阿波罗  奎迪的小历史回顾
Let's go back for a second. A little history on Apollo Creed.

947
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:04,420
我很确定他在生的时候也许是最强的
I certainly have him right up there, as maybe the best of all time.

948
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,450
讨论结束
End of discussion.

949
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,250
他失算了  他犯错了就像很多人一样
He slipped. He made a mistake, like a lot of people.

950
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,760
这不会是拳击界首次特别大的事
This isn't gonna be the first, particularly in the boxing world!

951
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,390
是的
Yeah.

952
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:12,560
但我不会说这会抹杀了他的传奇
But I'm not gonna say it's gonna kill his legacy!

953
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,290
我觉得这是件难堪的事...
I think it's an embarrassment...

954
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,800
而且我认为他的家庭一定感到很尴尬...
and I think the family must have felt this embarrassment...

955
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,030
因为他们保守秘密这么长时间
because they kept it under wraps for so long.

956
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,870
但我有一个问题  什么
But I really have one question. What?

957
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,500
这孩子有他老爸那么厉害吗
Can the kid fight as well as the old man?

958
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,840
这太扯了
That's a stretch.

959
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,510
我找到我们下一个招财猫
I found us our next payday.

960
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,180
看看吧
Check it out.

961
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,580
奎迪之子  没错
Creed's son? Yeah.

962
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,220
你跟我开玩笑吗  不
Are you kidding me? No.

963
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,620
他只打了一场比赛
He's got one fight under his belt.

964
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:43,860
没错  我知道  但他有巴尔博亚做教练
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know. But he's got Balboa in his corner.

965
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:46,790
没有人会在乎巴尔博亚了
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

966
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,500
选这小孩就因为一个名字
Kid's here because of a name alone.

967
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,030
你要去打
You're gonna do it.

968
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,630
这家伙不值得比赛
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

969
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:55,670
给我听好  这不是在商讨  好吧
Listen to me. This is not a negotiation, all right?

970
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,940
你只是个拿着枪在
You're the idiot that ran around

971
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,870
托克斯泰斯到处跑的白痴  你还记得吗
Toxteth with a gun. Do you remember that?

972
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:03,710
而且你是一个无法控制自己赛前体重的小丑...
And you are the clown who couldn't control himself at a weighin...

973
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,410
还在赌博中输了我们数百万  是几百万  所以再看一次
and lost us millions in the process. Millions, okay? So look at it again.

974
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,650
我不想这样名留青史  我不在乎你怎么被记住
I don't wanna be remembered like this. I don't care how you're remembered.

975
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,220
我在乎的是当你赢了后你的小孩有瓦遮顶
I care about your kids having a roof over their head when you're done.

976
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,160
你明白了吗
Do you understand?

977
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,040
你好
Hello?

978
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:33,370
我是汤米  霍利戴  我瑞奇  康兰的代理人
It's Tommy Holiday. I look after Ricky Conlan.

979
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,680
你好吗  听着
Yeah, how you doing? Listen.

980
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,310
那孩子的事是真的吗
Is it true about the kid?

981
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,050
那孩子的事
About the kid?

982
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,190
你和那孩子有三十分钟时间谈谈吗
Think you and the kid have got 30 minutes for a business meeting?

983
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:56,900
好吧  如果你能过来这里当然可以
All right, I'll tell you what. Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

984
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:01,570
我们会跟你谈谈  但必须要快因为我们在训练
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta be fast because we're training.

985
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,440
我几天后可以过去  好吧
I can be there. Couple of days. Yeah.

986
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,900
保持联络
I'll be in touch.

987
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,640
好的
Okay.

988
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,050
天啊
Oh, man.

989
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,050
谢谢你们的时间  我就直接说了
Thanks for taking the time. I'll be right to it.

990
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,690
我的人需要在接下来的六个月里打一场...
My guy needs to fight in the next six months...

991
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,660
而我们已经击败了所有人
and we've beaten everybody.

992
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,590
你想我跟康兰打
You want me to fight Conlan?

993
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,690
我觉得这是一个很明智的选择
I think it would be a very wise move.

994
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,130
你在墨西哥做过职业拳手
You've been down in Mexico doing pro fights?

995
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:32,330
我看到你在那15赢0败
I've got you as 150 down there.

996
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,770
而加上斯皮诺那一场  你就是16赢0败了
And with the Sporino fight, that makes you 160.

997
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,440
现在没有人想知道那些无名拳手的  是吧
Now, nobody needs to know these fights on some hole in the wall, do they?

998
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,310
你觉得我可以吗
You think I'm ready?

999
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:48,110
唐尼  这男人来是因为他知道你很安全
Donnie, this man came here because he knows you're a sure thing.

1000
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,350
是吧  这是稳稳的胜利  不是这样的
Right? It's a sure victory. That is not true.

1001
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,850
就是这样
Yeah, it is.

1002
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,730
好了  听着
Okay, listen.

1003
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,430
好吧
All right.

1004
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:04,300
这可能是我的人最后一场比赛了
This could be my guy's last fight.

1005
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:07,700
我想把它搞得有所期待  在那报纸上...
And I wanna make it count. Now, on that note...

1006
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:11,840
我们需要你把姓改成奎迪  这只是一种形式
We would need you to change your name to Creed. It's just a formality.

1007
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,050
那如果我说不呢
And what if I say no?

1008
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,320
那...就没有比赛  不改名就没有比赛
Well, then... there's no fight. Without the name, there's no fight.

1009
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:26,220
太默默无名了
It's a nonstarter.

1010
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,020
好吧
Okay. Okay.

1011
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:32,630
要不你们用一天时间考虑...
Why don't you both take a day, talk about it...

1012
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,930
我们再看你怎么样吧  好吗
and we'll see what you say, okay?

1013
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,530
这是笔好交易
It's a good deal.

1014
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,900
做不到  这不是我的名字
Can't do it. Nah, it's not my name.

1015
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,340
而且我想这是出于我的自身价值
And plus, I wanna make it on my own merit anyway.

1016
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,070
是吗  是的
Yeah? Yeah.

1017
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,680
你可以用搞笑的方式来表现出来
You got a funny way of showing it.

1018
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,010
那是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

1019
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,610
阿波罗和洛奇不是像最好的朋友吗
I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky like best friends?

1020
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,180
这感觉就像你在挖掘他留下的什么
It feels like you're trying to tap into whatever it is he left behind.

1021
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,490
我不认为这又什么可耻的  你明白吗
I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of, you know?

1022
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,060
你害怕什么  你害怕什么
What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of?

1023
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,590
我不知道
I don't know.

1024
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:09,560
我意思是这听力的问题没有让你害怕吗
I mean this hearing shit don't scare you?

1025
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,970
我一直知道最终的结果...
I always knew it would happen eventually...

1026
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,170
所以我总是计划...
so my plan has always just been...

1027
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:20,140
尽可能的做我喜欢做的事
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1028
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,810
我认为这是我们的本能
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1029
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,950
那么你害怕什么
So, what are you afraid of?

1030
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,590
我害怕拿起这名字又失去了
I'm afraid of taking on the name and losing.

1031
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,690
他们会叫我骗子  假奎迪
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1032
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,230
为什么你不想想事实是什么
Why don't you think about what's true?

1033
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,890
你很喜欢拳击  对吧
You love to fight, right?

1034
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,400
它让你很开心  对吧  没错
Yeah, it makes you happy, right? Yeah.

1035
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:50,140
而且你是阿波罗  奎迪的儿子  对吧
Yeah, and you are Apollo Creed's son, right?

1036
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:55,340
是的  那就用这名字啊
Yes. So then use the name.

1037
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,340
这是你的名字
It's yours.

1038
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:15,560
大叔  你在下面吗  是的
Hey, Unc, you down there? Yeah.

1039
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,640
我知道你不想我去打这场比赛  对吧
I know you don't want me to do this, right?

1040
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,180
我可以想到什么是最好的  唐尼
I can think of better things to do, Donnie.

1041
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,080
但如果我们要去打...
But if we did do it...

1042
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,220
我们要怎么才能赢
how we get it done?

1043
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:55,470
他比你高  他手比你长
He's taller than you. He has a reach on you.

1044
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,340
经验肯定比你丰富
Definitely has a lot more experience than you.

1045
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:02,210
他比你速度快  他是冠军
And he's faster than you are. He's the champion.

1046
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,810
而且自从他是冠军后...
And since he's the champion...

1047
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,950
你得向他挑战  就像我以前一样
you gotta bring the fight to him, like I did.

1048
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:12,250
你得打近身  而你这样做...
You gotta go to the body. Dig. And in doing that...

1049
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:17,220
你会非常危险  因为你有可能被击倒
you're in a very dangerous place because you can get laid out.

1050
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,930
要我在你这处境也不容易啊  小孩
It ain't easy for me to be in your corner, kid.

1051
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:25,970
我不知道你准备好没有  我不知道我准备好没有
I don't know if you're ready for it. I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1052
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,540
但我会按你想的做
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1053
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,410
如果是其他人做我教练...
If it was anybody else in my corner...

1054
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,270
我就不会打了
I wouldn't do it.

1055
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,780
但我有你
But I got you.

1056
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,020
所以下决定吧
So make the call.

1057
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,850
好吧
All right.

1058
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,330
我要跟瑞奇  康兰打了
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1059
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,000
我要跟"漂亮"  瑞奇  康兰打了
I'm fighting "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1060
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,780
别累坏他了  洛奇  好的
Don't work him too hard, Rock. Yeah.

1061
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,080
他还是只小狗
He's still a puppy.

1062
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,880
来吧
Come on, come on.

1063
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,420
近距离  就这样
Close the distance. That's it.

1064
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,860
很好
Good.

1065
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,760
来吧  打身体  这里
Come on. Body, come here.

1066
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,560
这一击不错
Yeah. Got a good hit.

1067
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,830
好了
Okay.

1068
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,970
来吧
Come on.

1069
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,800
用力  打身体  很好
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

1070
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,210
你可以继续吗
You up to moving around?

1071
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,010
休息下
Take a break.

1072
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,220
大叔  你没事吧
Hey, Unc, you all right?

1073
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,090
我没事  你还好吗
I'm all right. You okay?

1074
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,250
我没事  吐出来了
I'm all right. It's out.

1075
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,420
我没事  好吧
I'm all right. All right.

1076
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,260
让我缓缓
Just let me walk.

1077
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,690
我没事
Just... I'm good.

1078
01:14:58,730 --> 01:14:59,790
确定  没事
Sure? Yeah.

1079
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,330
你是怎么了
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1080
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,270
我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

1081
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,300
我扶你
Come here.

1082
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,900
让我走走
Just let me walk.

1083
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:11,370
不  我们要叫人给你找医生  好吗
No, we got to call someone and get you to the doctor, okay?

1084
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,770
好的  好了  来吧
Okay. All right, come on.

1085
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,610
下擂台  我帮你  别紧张
Off the rope. Come on, I got you. Easy.

1086
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,180
史迪奇
Hey, Stitch!

1087
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,740
我很抱歉  不  不  什么
I'm sorry. No, no. What?

1088
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,580
不  我真的...
No, I'm really...

1089
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:20,110
来人帮忙啊
Hey, somebody help!

1090
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,960
你好
Hi.

1091
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,220
你好  唐尼
Hi. Donnie.

1092
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,090
凯瑟里医生
Dr. Kathari.

1093
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,330
巴尔博亚先生  你感觉怎么样
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1094
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,600
我感觉很好  真的很好  我现在可以走了
I'm feeling good, real good. I could go now.

1095
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,800
听说你倒下了  这是你第一次倒下吗
Heard you fell down. Was that the first time you've fallen?

1096
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,630
第一次不是被击倒的
Well, without being punched.

1097
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,100
我会给你些液体  这应该会让你感觉好点
I'm gonna give you some more fluids. That should help you feel better.

1098
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,170
我们早上回给你做些检测然后让你离开
And we're gonna run some tests in the morning and get you out of here.

1099
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,640
你可以做快点吗  因为我们有很多事情做
Can you do this fast? Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1100
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:50,440
轻松点  好吗  睡觉吧
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

1101
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,780
我稍后再来看你
I'll check on you later.

1102
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:52,780
谢谢
Thank you.

1103
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:55,350
必须要快  我们必须...
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

1104
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,020
唐尼  我们还要训练  睡觉吧
Donnie, we gotta train. Yeah, go to sleep.

1105
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,760
你们需要帮忙吗
You guys need any more help?

1106
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,760
不  我们很好  不  我们很好  谢谢
No! We're good. No, we're good, thank you!

1107
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,400
你行吗  你需要什么  我以为你早拿出来了
You got it? What you need? Thought you got lost for a minute.

1108
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,570
没有
Nothing, nothing.

1109
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,840
我在这房子从来没见过像这样的食物
I have not seen food look like this in this house ever.

1110
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:18,740
是吗
Yeah?

1111
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:23,610
是的  通常我有的都是酱汁或酱菜什么的
Yes. You know, usually everything I have has sauce or something on it.

1112
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,180
来点这些羽衣甘蓝
Get some of these collard greens.

1113
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,480
好吧  你就...
All right. Yo just...

1114
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:28,180
就来一点  来一点
Just a little bit? Yeah, a little bit.

1115
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:30,750
比安卡  你很漂亮...
Bianca, you're beautiful...

1116
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:33,190
而且我认为你会成为一个很棒的歌手
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1117
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,160
我觉得你会成为一个很棒的冠军  像你父亲一样
I think you're gonna be a great champ, like your father.

1118
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,790
也许甚至更好
Maybe even better.

1119
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,390
而我很幸运可以认识你们俩
And for me, who's lucky enough to be knowing both of you guys.

1120
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,300
来干杯  百年好合  一百年
Here we go. Cent'anni. 100 years.

1121
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,300
我很荣幸  我真幸运
I'm honored. Lucky me.

1122
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,340
继续练铲勾拳
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1123
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,740
对  就这样
Right, that's it.

1124
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,140
在同一边挥出勾拳
Now, wanna throw the hook on the same side.

1125
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:59,080
那么你从左边上你就出右拳
So you come up on the right, you throw on the right.

1126
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,450
非常好
Very good.

1127
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,180
要凶猛一点  有力一些
A little more vicious than that, little more power.

1128
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,650
重复做  非常好
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1129
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:08,790
洛奇
Hey, Rock.

1130
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:10,660
是
Yeah.

1131
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,390
很好  你干得不错
Good. You're looking good.

1132
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,400
你在吃醋吗  有一点
Are you getting jealous? Yeah, a little.

1133
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,400
你的电话  谢谢
It's for you. Thanks.

1134
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,170
你好  是吗  是的
Hello? Yeah? Yeah.

1135
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:30,480
是的  好的
Yeah, okay.

1136
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,480
好的  谢谢
All right, thanks.

1137
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,890
巴尔博亚先生
Mr. Balboa.

1138
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,630
谢谢你赶时间过来
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

1139
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,700
我们看了你的检测结果...
Well, we went through your test results...

1140
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:57,400
你的活检显示大细胞非霍奇金淋巴瘤
and your biopsy came back showing signs of large cell nonHodgkin's lymphoma.

1141
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:00,310
这是什么
What's that do?

1142
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:03,280
这是一种癌症
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1143
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,090
我知道这听起来很恐怖  但好消息是我们及早发现它了
I know that sounds scary, but the good news is we caught it early.

1144
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,820
然而我们必须切除在你淋巴结...
However, we will have to remove the tumor...

1145
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:22,000
的肿瘤和立即开始化疗
in your lymph nodes and start chemotherapy immediately.

1146
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,830
我妻子试过了
My wife tried that.

1147
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,870
巴尔博亚现在  目前的治疗选择...
Mr. Balboa, as far as options for treatment...

1148
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,370
这是最好的方法了
this is the best plan of action.

1149
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,470
不  我明白  但我的妻子试过了...
No, I understand, but my wife tried that...

1150
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,740
而我认为我不想这样做
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1151
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,010
结果不怎么好  但没关系
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1152
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,310
有治疗  你还是有很大机会痊愈的
With treatment, you'll still have a very good chance of recovery.

1153
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,520
没有治疗的话...
Without it...

1154
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,160
我没关系  真的  起码把这些拿去
I'm okay with it, really. Well, at least take these.

1155
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:54,130
这有你的诊断和治疗方案的信息
It has information on your diagnosis and options for treatment.

1156
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,700
我们可以先从...非常感谢
We can start... Thank you very much.

1157
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,100
听着  如果你不跟别人说我会很感激你的  好吧
Listen, I'd appreciate if you wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?

1158
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,040
塞车塞死了  说你也不相信
Oh, man! There's so much traffic, you wouldn't believe it.

1159
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,050
老年人专用公交晚点了  对吧
That senior bus was running late, huh?

1160
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,550
这笑话很低俗
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1161
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:16,050
这是事实  上擂台
It's the truth. Get in the ring.

1162
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,080
快点准备好  我已经准备好了
Hurry up and get ready. I've been ready.

1163
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,120
很好
Good.

1164
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,890
我一直在等你
I've been waiting on you.

1165
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,820
来吧  带上你的拳套别说那么多废话
Come on, just put your gloves on and stop talking so much.

1166
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:39,470
我们有几件事要做  都是关于你的
We got a few things to do. It's all about you.

1167
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,580
我已经有我的事业了  我做得很好
I already had my career. I did okay.

1168
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,140
你的借口是什么  你没有借口
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

1169
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:49,020
现在是时候你升到那个场合了
Now is the time for you to rise to the occasion there.

1170
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,420
只是要戴上我的...我来帮你
Just gonna put my... I can do it.

1171
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:52,890
好了
Okay, all right.

1172
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,050
现在...
Now...

1173
01:19:55,790 --> 01:20:00,260
我要你一直首先重视你自己
I want you to always, always, always pay attention to yourself first.

1174
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:03,500
如果我不在这里就自己先练
If I'm not here to start with, just start moving around.

1175
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,630
好吧  牙套  知道我什么意思吗
All right. Mouthpiece. Know what I'm saying?

1176
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,900
头被打太多拳了  对吧
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1177
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,140
随便吧  教练
Yeah, whatever, coach.

1178
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,040
好了  上场吧  冠军
All right, get going there, champ.

1179
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,270
贝尔
Bell.

1180
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,040
来吧  奎迪
Come on, Creed!

1181
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,920
做第一  唐尼  快
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1182
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:30,590
回见  阿米尔
All right, Amir.

1183
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:33,090
回见  冠军  别累坏了
All right, champ. Don't work too hard.

1184
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,720
这是真的吗
This shit for real?

1185
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:00,790
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

1186
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,420
你应该想的是比赛日快要到了
What you should be thinking about is that fight coming up.

1187
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,930
这是你唯一应该放在心上的事  没其他了
That's the only thing that should be on your mind, nothing else.

1188
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,230
你说不要想这个是什么意思  你什么时候开始治疗
What you mean, don't think about this? When you starting treatment?

1189
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,630
我不做化疗  不
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1190
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:17,540
如果你不快点做你很快就会死的
If you don't jump on this quick, you're gonna end up dying.

1191
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,010
我知道
I know.

1192
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,210
而你没关系
And you're all right with that?

1193
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,280
是的
I am.

1194
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:27,110
天啊  你听起来是疯了
Man, you sound crazy, man.

1195
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:28,720
把钥匙给我  我马上带你去医院
Give me the keys. I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1196
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,020
我没有疯
I'm not crazy at all.

1197
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,590
如果我以前可以把一切东西...
If I could take everything that was good...

1198
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:35,050
放到碗里或什么的...
and put it into a bowl or something...

1199
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:39,560
然后说"这里  我想给我妻子多买一天时间"...
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to buy one more day with my wife"...

1200
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,030
我也愿意
I'd do it.

1201
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:44,560
那我死也是个开心的男人
I would die a happy man, right then.

1202
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:46,830
不可能的
Not gonna happen.

1203
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,640
所以...
So...

1204
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:55,070
我能做的只是向前进而我还在
everything I got has moved on and I'm here.

1205
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,280
但你知道什么吗  这没关系
But you know what? It's okay.

1206
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,890
因为我对自己说"如果我要死了
Because I said to myself, "If I break,

1207
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,650
如果我受伤了  不管了
if I'm hurt, whatever.

1208
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,990
我不会去解决  为什么要自寻烦恼"
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

1209
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,360
而我只是住在你的小床的流浪汉  什么也不是
And I'm just some bum just living in your crib, just nothing.

1210
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,190
你是个好孩子  好拳手
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1211
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,990
你前面还有大把前途
But you got your whole future ahead of you.

1212
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,600
我呢
Mine?

1213
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:21,170
在后面  像他们那样在墙上
Back there, like all them guys on that wall.

1214
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,370
在后面  在过去
In the back, in the past.

1215
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,540
我们没有未来了
We re going nowhere.

1216
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,110
我对你来说只是个老教练
I am to you just an old trainer.

1217
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:32,510
这是我们一起的原因  你明白吗
That's what brought us together. You know?

1218
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,710
我们不是真的家人
We're not a real family.

1219
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:42,520
那只是说气话而已  孩子
That was just in our heads, kid.

1220
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:54,530
你做了什么
What'd you do? What'd you do?

1221
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:05,380
你为什么这么说
Why did you say that?

1222
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,900
怎么了  小奎迪
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1223
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,840
很好
It's good.

1224
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:34,670
嘿  怎么了  兄弟
Oh, hey! What's up, bro?

1225
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,280
嘿  你好吗
Hey! What up?

1226
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,050
你还好吗
You okay?

1227
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,250
你怎么样  你好吗
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

1228
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,350
我很好  我有点紧张
Yeah, I'm good I'm a little nervous.

1229
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:47,520
只是有很多人在这  不都是我的粉丝
There's just a lot of people here. not really my crowd, you know?

1230
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,690
我明白
Yeah, I can see.

1231
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:50,790
看  这是打拳男孩  小阿波罗  奎迪
Look, it's the boxing boy. Lil Apollo Creed.

1232
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,330
我认识他的女朋友
I know his girl.

1233
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,590
你好吗  比安卡  嘿
What's up, Bianca? Hey.

1234
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,000
你不认识我了吗
You don't know nobody no more?

1235
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,330
不  我经过的时候跟你打招呼了
Nah, I said hello to you when I walked past.

1236
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,200
你没回应我
You didn't say nothing to me.

1237
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,300
我猜你有的  别再学白人那一套了
Yeah, I bet you did. Stop acting lightskinned.

1238
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:01,430
要不你过来这里...
Hey, man, why don't you come over here...

1239
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,300
跟我一起和拍个照
and grab this pic with me real quick for the 'Gram?

1240
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,000
没问题
Yeah, that's cool.

1241
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,370
快点  你知道他忙
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

1242
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:09,180
欢迎来到我的城市  冠军
Welcome to my city, champ.

1243
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:13,180
好了  阿比  好的
There it is, Abbie. Believe dat.

1244
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,710
看好你  婴儿奎迪
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1245
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,320
别这么叫我
Don't call me that.

1246
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:17,920
别这么叫你  别叫你什么
Don't call you that? Don't call you what?

1247
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,950
你刚叫我"婴儿奎迪"  我说了别这么叫我
You just called me "Baby Creed". I said, don't call me that.

1248
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,990
我是对你客气
Hey, fam, dig this. I was showing you love, man.

1249
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,320
你没必要这么啊
You ain't got to come off like that.

1250
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,030
没关系  客气而已
Yo, that's cool, that's all love.

1251
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,430
我知道没关系  你肯定没关系啊
I know it's cool. You definitely know it's cool.

1252
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,260
当你跟我说话  你好像很屌的样子啊
When you talking to me, you talking real tough, you feel me?

1253
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,170
最好跟你的小帅哥男朋友说说
Better talk to your little pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1254
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,930
拿个贵宾通行卡到你的房间  这样跟我说话
Get a VIP pass next to your pop, talking to me like that.

1255
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,070
不
No!

1256
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,440
别激动  黑鬼
Hold up, nigga!

1257
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:40,140
唐尼
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1258
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:44,180
唐尼  别打了
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1259
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:45,410
我会宰了你
I'll kill your ass!

1260
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,910
唐尼
Donnie! Donnie!

1261
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,850
他怎么样了  他现在没事了
How's he doing? He's all right now.

1262
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,580
你知道怎么回事吗  我们要把他隔离
You know what happened? We had to separate him.

1263
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,050
他跟另一些囚犯打架
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1264
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:54,450
不  有人受伤了吗
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1265
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,860
没有  没有生命危险
Nah, nothing lifethreatening.

1266
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,660
好的  谢谢  没问题  冠军
All right, thank you. No problem, champ.

1267
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:58,990
好的
Yeah.

1268
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:01,730
唐尼
Hey, Donnie.

1269
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:08,370
你怎么样了  儿子
How you doing, son?

1270
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,240
我知道有很多警察说"你的朋友被锁了"
I know a lot of cops and they said, "Your friend's locked up."

1271
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:16,680
朋友  你对我来说只是教练  对吧
Friends? You're just a trainer to me, right?

1272
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,450
我很抱歉之前在拳馆我对你说的话
I'm sorry about what I said to you, back at the gym.

1273
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,080
那只是我自言自语  我不是那个意思
That was just me talking. I didn't mean it.

1274
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:25,120
你离我远点
You just stay away from me.

1275
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,420
听着  唐尼...
Listen, Donnie...

1276
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:29,320
别碰我  别这样...
Man, don't touch me. Come on, what...

1277
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,620
放开你的手  老家伙
Get your hands off me, old man!

1278
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,330
你快滚出去
Get your sick ass out of here!

1279
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,660
离开
Leave!

1280
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,330
你来这里装到好像我家人似的
You here talking like you my family!

1281
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,430
你害死了我真正的家人
You got my real family killed!

1282
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:55,480
我不会离开...直到我把心里的话告诉你
I ain't leaving... till I tell you what's on my mind.

1283
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,450
你讨厌我  就是这样
You hate me, that's what it is.

1284
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:02,690
或者也许你对某个不在这的人  唐尼...
Or maybe you're mad with somebody who ain't here, Donnie...

1285
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,760
一个不能为自己辩护的人
who can't defend himself.

1286
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,530
你知道吗
You know?

1287
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,230
我明白你在经历什么  年轻人  我也经历过
Now, I understand what you're going through, young man. I've been there.

1288
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,970
我知道被遗弃是什么感觉...
And I know what it's like to feel abandoned...

1289
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,430
对一切都很愤怒
to be mad at everything.

1290
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:17,040
而你是比那更好的人
And you're a better person than that.

1291
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:21,610
原谅他吧  因为对他什么也做不了
Forgive him. Because there's nothing you can do about it.

1292
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,640
这影响了你
It's taking a toll on you.

1293
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,850
你还在追寻他的背影
You're still caught in his shadow.

1294
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,660
你得向前看  唐尼  快离开
You got to move, Donnie. Just leave, man.

1295
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
走吧  约翰逊
Let's go, Johnson.

1296
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,900
比安卡
Bianca!

1297
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,530
你别再像警察那样敲我的门了
Yol Stop knocking on my door like the police.

1298
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,970
你能起码让我道歉吗  不  没有用的
Can you at least let me apologize? No, it doesn't work like that.

1299
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,170
当你把饮料洒到别人身上道歉  可以
You apologize when you spill a drink on someone, sure.

1300
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:01,640
但你袭击去我表演的嘉宾...
But you assaulted the headliner to my show...

1301
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:03,580
一个我很努力争取回来的演出机会
a show I worked really hard to get.

1302
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,710
如果我去你比赛耍流氓呢
What if I came to your fight acting like an ass?

1303
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,710
你会没意见吗
Would that be cool with you?

1304
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,680
不  我不认为
Nah, I didn't think so.

1305
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,550
后来你怎么样  你取消了吗
How'd you do though? You kill it?

1306
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:16,760
我们演出得很好
Yeah, we did good.

1307
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,090
我搞砸了我是活该的  好吧
I messed that up and I gotta live with that, all right?

1308
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,460
但我从没想让你失望
But I never meant to let you down.

1309
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:24,900
那你是什么意思  自负吗
Then what did you mean to do, D? Just have a little ego contest?

1310
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,340
洛奇病了
Rocky's sick.

1311
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,380
他有癌症
He's got cancer.

1312
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,050
我不是想为我所做的找借口...
I ain't trying to make excuses for anything that I did...

1313
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:49,020
但我刚在你演出前发现了
but I found out right before your show.

1314
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,390
有多严重
How bad is it?

1315
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:54,390
他们想让他开始化疗  但你知道他太臭脾气不去做
They want him to start chemo but, you know, he's too macho to do that.

1316
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,730
天啊
Jesus.

1317
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,640
也许你可以劝他去
Well, maybe you can talk some sense into him.

1318
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,640
我不认为他想听我说
I don't think he'd wanna hear anything I got to say.

1319
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:14,280
替我向他问好
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1320
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:17,520
比安卡  现在别拒我门外
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

1321
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,190
听着  我们现在都有很多事在进行...
Look, we both got a lot going on right now...

1322
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,920
所以我想你应该专注在你的事业而我专注我的
so I think you should focus on yours and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1323
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,430
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1324
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,830
这什么意思
What's that mean?

1325
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,760
我明白我搞砸了
I get it, I messed up.

1326
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,670
我相信你  能请你别拒我门外吗
I trusted you! Can you please not shut me out?

1327
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,510
我很抱歉  好吗
I'm sorry, okay?

1328
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:44,180
我现在需要你
I need you right now.

1329
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:20,750
黑鬼  怎么了
Nigga, what's up?

1330
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,820
你好吗
What's up?

1331
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,650
我听说你是阿波罗  奎迪的儿子
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1332
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:30,320
没错
Yeah.

1333
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,530
那很屌
That's what up.

1334
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,970
你看起来瘦了五磅  你应该坐下来吃饭了
Look like you lost five pounds. You ought to sit down and eat.

1335
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,360
我像什么
I mean, what I look like?

1336
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,490
让你训练我的同时你在等死
Letting you train me while you sit around and die?

1337
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,930
就像其他比赛一样
Just like any other fight.

1338
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:51,370
这场比赛  我以前见过
This fight? I seen it before.

1339
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:55,280
这会越来越糟糕...
It gets as bad as it can get...

1340
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:58,510
而且大多时候你赢不了
and most of the time, you don't win it.

1341
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:59,750
但我不在乎
Yeah, but I don't care.

1342
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:02,350
如果你不接受治疗我就不训练
I ain't training if you don't get the treatment.

1343
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,180
所以我战  你也战
So if I fight, you fight.

1344
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,350
嘿  怎么样
Hey. What's up?

1345
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,560
你去拳馆了  不  我一直在这
You been to the gym? Nah, I've been here.

1346
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:45,890
好了  记得这个吗
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

1347
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,790
起来
Get up.

1348
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,330
准备好了吗  这是...
Ready? What's...

1349
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,930
我要你做拳击训练
I want you to shadow box.

1350
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,100
这房间不错  我们在这训练吧
This is a nice room, let's see you move around.

1351
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:54,400
你认真的吗
You're serious?

1352
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,340
要我替你做吗  不  没问题
Want me to do it for you? No. It's all good.

1353
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,340
准备好了吗  来吧
Yeah, ready? Come on.

1354
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,170
计时
Time!

1355
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,440
就这样
There you go.

1356
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,080
我们以前是单手做的
We used to do that with one hand.

1357
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,850
但我就不说什么了
I don't wanna say anything though.

1358
01:33:19,190 --> 01:33:21,230
别打那位小姐
Don't hit the lady.

1359
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,130
她可能会打倒你的
She'll probably drop you.

1360
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:36,310
好了撑住  快到了
All right.Come on, almost there.

1361
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,410
坚持住  大叔
Come on, Unc.

1362
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,590
天啊
Oh, God.

1363
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,190
就这样
That's your thing, yes!

1364
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,860
用力
More! Yes!

1365
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,270
一片还是两片  医生说两片的
One. Two? The deal was two!

1366
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,230
我不能  不
I can't, no.

1367
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,770
我头晕
I'm dizzy.

1368
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:47,150
双刺拳
Double jab.

1369
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:48,920
打到这里
Step on right under there.

1370
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:56,620
很好
Good.

1371
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:58,560
起码我们有进步
At least we got the speed.

1372
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:03,000
我们只需要他坐下那么当他出击  他就打破它
We just need him to sit down so when he hits something, he breaks it.

1373
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,170
很好
Good.

1374
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,340
贴紧它  你必须贴紧它  来呀
Step with it, you gotta step with it. Come on!

1375
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:11,700
再贴紧点
Little bit more.

1376
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,040
再贴紧点  用力  很好
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

1377
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:15,710
很好  保持这样
Good. Keep it right.

1378
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,210
看  他在做同样的事  没错  看来是这样的
Look, he's doing the same thing. Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1379
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:24,420
但我认为他给你准备了些什么
But I think he's got something up his sleeve for you.

1380
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,070
漂亮
Wow, beautiful.

1381
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:42,500
你在去看洛奇吗  没错  走吧
Yo, you going to see Rock? Yeah, let's go!

1382
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,370
我们挺你  走吧

What up? Come on y'all! Let's ride! Come on!

1385
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,510
我就喜欢这样
That's what I like, man!

1386
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:56,650
我们去前街看洛奇  跟我走
Let's go see Rock on Front Street! Ride with me!

1387
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:47,490
你想打招呼吗
You wanna say hello?

1388
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:52,130
这地方看起来像教堂  感觉像艺术博物馆
Place looks like a church. Yeah, fell like an art museum.

1389
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,670
很漂亮
Yeah, beautiful.

1390
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:56,800
拳击明星在两分钟内进来
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1391
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,070
只要他一出现他就会从你那开始
As soon as he shows up, he's gonna start on you.

1392
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,310
好的
Okay.

1393
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,760
别让他耍到你
Don't let him get to you.

1394
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:21,090
感谢你们的到来  我们直接开始问答环节
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming. Let's get straight into questions.

1395
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:23,600
左边的那位年轻小姐
Young lady to the left.

1396
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:26,970
康兰  我们能期待在赛前称重又出问题吗
Conlan, can we expect any more fireworks at the weighin?

1397
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:29,070
我一直有去做愤怒管理...
I've been doing some anger management classes...

1398
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,640
尽量控制我的脾气
and trying to control temper of mine.

1399
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,110
我只是会确保他会在星期六晚上被遗忘掉
I just gonna make sure he forgets it all by Saturday night.

1400
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:36,880
好了  下一个问题
Okay, next question.

1401
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:38,440
戴眼镜的年轻男子
Young man in the glasses.

1402
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,680
你们之间的差异是什么
What about the contrast between you two?

1403
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:44,350
你一夜成名与康兰白手起家的背景
You, the overnight success versus Conlan's rags to riches background.

1404
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:46,920
那一夜没任何变化  我一直奋斗...
Nothing happened overnight. I've been fighting for some time now...

1405
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,320
那正是这个家伙
That's exactly how it happened for this guy.

1406
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:51,930
他是一个一夜成名的人  从来没有梦想要打拼
He's an overnight success, never had a damn fight in his life.

1407
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,530
他有这次机会是因为他用上了这名字
He's got this shot because he found that name last night.

1408
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,260
再一个问题  有很多人说这场拳赛是传奇之战
One more. There's a lot of talk about legacy in this fight.

1409
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,730
约翰逊  你有什么感想
Johnson, can you speak to that?

1410
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:00,970
我一直想做出属于我自己的传奇
Yeah, I've been working on trying to build my own legacy.

1411
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:01,870
传奇
Legacy?

1412
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,670
我们不是开玩笑吧
Are we at some kind of comedy club?

1413
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:06,940
在他旁边的家伙  这才是我们说的传奇
The guy next to him, now that's what we're talking about legacy.

1414
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:08,370
而我就是继承人  别管他
And I'm cut from that cloth. Don't fall for it.

1415
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:09,680
我父亲在码头工作
My father worked on the docks.

1416
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:12,480
他的父亲是世界重量级冠军
His father was heavyweight champion of the world.

1417
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:15,580
想那里银汤匙的人...你一点也不了解我
People like silver spoon over there... You don't know nothing about me.

1418
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:16,720
我够了解你的
I know enough about you.

1419
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,180
我在这里了  你是自己过来的
I'm here now though. I'm here now. You found yourself here.

1420
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,420
你是假奎迪
You a false Creed.

1421
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:21,150
好吧  我现在就给你看看  我老爸不在这里
All right, I'll show you right now. My pops ain't here.

1422
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:21,960
坐下
Sit down!

1423
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:23,560
你想在这打  我一于奉陪
You wanna fight here? I'll do it right now!

1424
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:26,190
我可以现在来  婊子  我们可以现在来打
I can do it right now, bitch! We can do it right now!

1425
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,530
奎迪个屁
"Creed" my asshole!

1426
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,270
你没事吧  我没事
Yo, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right.

1427
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,130
好吧  你走着瞧
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1428
01:39:34,330 --> 01:39:37,200
我会揍死你的
I'm gonna knock that smile off your face.

1429
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:45,250
唐尼  是洛奇
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

1430
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,950
大叔  你没事吧
Unc, you okay?

1431
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:53,320
我没事  只是睡不着

1433
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:57,320
我可以坐下来吗  当然
Is it okay I sit down? Course.

1434
01:39:58,090 --> 01:39:59,730
唐尼...
Donnie...

1435
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:03,360
当比赛完后我想你帮我个忙
I'd like you to do me a favor when all this is over.

1436
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,130
没问题  任何事  好的  很好
Yeah, anything. Okay, good.

1437
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,670
这不是很重要但我只是想把它收好  好吗
It's not important but I just wanna lock it in, okay?

1438
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:12,070

1442

1443

1448
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,480
脚软  好吧  这很重要

01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,160
一个周末来说还不够多惊喜吗
Didn't we have enough surprises for one weekend?

1457
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,030
与我无关
That's not me.

1458
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:51,030
创出你自己的传奇  妈妈上

1459

颜色很好看
Very nice colors.

1460
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,900

唐尼  我为你自豪

这会带给他运气的
That's gonna bring him luck.

1465
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:56,140
你以前从没在这么多人面前  对吧
You never been in front of this many people before, right?

1466
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,640
这不重要
That don't matter.

1467
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:59,970
你从来没离家这么远
You're never been this far away from home.

1468
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:01,440
这不重要
That don't matter.

1469
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:06,680
重要的是你在擂台留下了什么和你带走了什么
What matters is what you leave in that ring and what you take back with you.

1470
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,350
你知道是什么吗
You know what that is?

1471
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,480
骄傲
Pride.

1472
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,520
我知道你尽力了

而你要为了你自己奋斗
And you're doing it for yourself.

1474
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:17,860
不是为了我  不是为了你父亲的往事  是为了你
Not for me, not for your father's memory, but for you.

1475
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,990
我能从你的眼里看出...
I can see in your eyes...

1476
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:22,330
你会做得到的

我总是在这种时候紧张...

我们在更衣室就说明了
We talked about it in the locker rooms.

1527
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,970
我要你们时刻保护自己

1528
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:41,670

1530

碰拳
Touch gloves.

1531
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:47,180
裤子不错啊  男孩

Too bad your daddy ain't here to fight in them.

1533
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:55,860
你知道什么吗  你会关上他的臭嘴的  好吗
You know what? You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1534
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:00,130
你知道怎么做的

1536
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:04,700
你可以的

1537
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,980
第一回合开始

and Adonis Creed in the red, white and blue.

1540
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:26,850
康兰很明显更高...
Conlan is significantly taller...

1541
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:29,560
而这会让他更容易用他的刺拳...
and thinks it will be easy to use his jab...

1542
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,360
使年轻的奎迪陷入困境
to keep young Creed at bay.

1543
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,290
你现在就可以看到康兰有多轻松
You can see right away how much more relaxed Conlan is.

1544
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:35,200
他很有经验
He's been there before.

1545
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:36,700
脚动起来
Move your leg!

1546
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,130
把左手抬起来
Keep your left up!

1547
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,300
这种紧张的力量可以让你一直打下去
That kind of nervous energy can wear you out as the fight goes on.

1548
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,840
康兰左勾拳  奎迪后退
Hard left hook by Conlan. Creed backs off.

1549
01:50:42,870 --> 01:50:46,410
从来没打过像康兰这样的对手...
It's not easy to just jump right into the major leagues like this...

1550
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,840
要进入到这样的大联盟可不容易...
having never fought an opponent like Conlan.

1551
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:50,140
当然  像康兰这样的拳手可不多
Of course, there aren't many fighters like Conlan.

1552
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,810
奎迪想靠近康兰  破网而出
Creed trying to get close to Conlan, against the ropes.

1553

康兰打出了一击重拳  重击了他的右眉角...
Confan fires a hard body punch, hits him hard with a right cross...

1555
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,920
把奎迪逼到绳边  分开
and backs Creed into the ropes. Break!

1556
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,630
裁判  不是吧
Ref, come on!

1557
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,690
别耍花样
Keep it clean!

1558
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,490
而他被裁判警告
And he gets a warning from the referee.

1559
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:10,260
奎迪好像被那一击给唤醒了...
Creed kinds woke him up with that shot...

1560
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,070
而康兰让他付出了代价
And Conlan really made him pay for it.

1561
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:14,830
奎迪试图攻击
Creed ready to let his hands go.

1562
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:18,100
奎迪没击中而马上被反击
Creed misses and gets hit in return.

1563
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,970
完美的内上勾拳  到边上  一
Perfect uppercut on the inside. To the corner! One!

1564
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,610
奎迪跪下来了  二
Down goes Creed. Two!

1565
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:24,010
三  四  我没事
Three! Four! I'm good! I'm good!

1566
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,250
五  六  我没事
Five! Six! I'm good!

1567
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,550
抖身子
Shake it off!

1568
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:28,750
但瑞奇  康兰已经有一个击倒了
But already a knockdown for Ricky Conlan.

1569
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,380
你还好吗  你确定吗  我没事
Are you okay? Are you sure? I'm good!

1570
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,020
开打
Fight!

1571
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:36,660
康兰一轮打击后铃声响
Conlan lands a shot after the bell,

1572
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:39,190
而第一回合都是瑞奇  康兰得分
and round one was all Ricky Conlan.

1573
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:42,930
面对现实了吗  孩子  面对现实了吗
Real for you now, boy? Real for you now?

1574
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,270
眼睛怎么样  有点血
How's the eye? Little bloody.

1575
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:49,040
听着  不要慌张
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1576
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:52,070
我会打到他屁滚尿流的  下回合就上  别等了
I'm gonna knock his ass out. Do it in the nest round. Don't wait.

1577
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:53,470
你继续像这样犯错...
You keep making mistakes like that...

1578
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:54,870
我们就要用尸袋来带你走了  好吗
we're gonna pick you up with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1579
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:58,240
阿多尼斯很幸运刚那回合没多三十秒
Adonis was lucky there wasn't another 30 seconds in that round.

1580
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:02,080
加油啊  你在干什么
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1581
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:05,990
这是我要你做的  他会出右刺拳
Here's what I want you to do. He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1582
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,790
当他收拳的时候出右勾拳粉碎他  好吗
When he leaves it out there, drop that right hook and smash him, okay?

1583
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,920
保持专注
Stay focused.

1584
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:13,330
那么第一回合对年轻的阿多尼斯  奎迪是一个可怕的体验
So round one was a forbidding experience for young Adonis Creed.

1585
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:16,600
现在  在跟洛奇  巴尔博亚讨论之后...
And now, after a discussion with Rocky Balboa between rounds...

1586
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:17,960
接下来又更多招

康兰在第一回合的结尾显示了他的力量...

1590
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:26,170
继续压他  瑞奇
Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1591
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:30,910
从逻辑上说奎迪需要找方法到康兰的长手臂内...
Logic says Cree needs to find a way to got inside of Conlan's long arms...

1592
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:33,250
而且在内部产生压力
and create pressure on the inside.

1593
01:52:33,450 --> 01:52:34,150
来呀
Come on!

1594
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:36,450
目前为止还是瑞奇  康兰占优
So far, it's still mostly Ricky Conlan.

1595
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,490
康兰重左勾拳  上勾拳
Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.

1596
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:42,160
防守啊  又再把奎迪逼到角落
Keep your hands up! Drives Creed into the corner again.

1597
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:43,920
抱住他
Tie him up!

1598
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:47,690
奎迪抱住他把他推开阻止了这轮攻击
Creed wraps him up and pulls turn in to stop the onslaught.

1599
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:49,900
你是冠军  对吧
You the champ, right?

1600
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,030
你是冠军
You the champ?

1601
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:53,100
打给我看看啊  来呀

1602

奎迪击中了完美的右勾拳

1604
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,070
漂亮

1605
01:53:00,870 --> 01:53:04,580
奎迪疯了而他们在互殴
Creed misses wildly, and they are going toetotoe.

1606
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:05,910
迅速的成为一个电话亭之战
Rapidly becomming a phone booth fight!

1607
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:08,050
上啊
Go! Go!

1608
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:11,220
你一拳我一拳  右手  左手  两个都屌爆了
Trading punches, right hand, left hand! Both guys landing!

1609
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:12,450
这一幕太不可思议了
This is unbelievable action!

1610
01:53:12,490 --> 01:53:14,290
勾拳  加油
Doubt hook! Come on!

1611
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,360
奎迪一击右重勾拳
Hard right hand by Creed.

1612
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,890
你跟我一样在流血  回到你们的角上  快
You bleed just like me! Go to your corners! Come on!

1613
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:20,030
你跟我一样在流血
You bleed just like me!

1614
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:22,530
这什么都不是
Man! That ain't shit!

1615
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,230
如果康兰认为他的对手很容易击败  他现在该醒醒了
He loves it! If Conlan thought he had a pushover, he knows better now!

1616
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:28,540
他跟我一样在流血  你是属于这里的
He bleed like me! You belong in here!

1617
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:30,170
他们不知道你经历了什么...
They don't know what you've been through...

1618
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,170
而且他们也不知道我们经历了什么
and they sure don't know what we've been through.

1619
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:34,340
我不想你跟他两败躯伤
I don't want you trading blows with him.

1620
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:35,780
我要你保护自己
I want you to protect yourself.

1621
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,810
保持你的距离
Keep your distance!

1622
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,650
我要粉碎这个渣渣
I'm gonna smash this Wto bits.

1623
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:40,350
现在他知道你是真材实料了
Now he knows you're for real.

1624
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,680
你要相信你可以做到的
You gotta believe you can do it.

1625
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,780
刚那回合对奎迪很重要
That was such a big round for Creed.

1626
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,790
不只是在记分板上而是在心理上有很大的跃进  吉姆
Not just on the scorecards but psychologically going forward, Jim.

1627
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,520
你唤醒了一个沉睡中的巨人
You woke up a sleeping giant.

1628
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,460
他会使出全力来对付你的
He's gonna come after you with everything he's got.

1629
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:53,630
阿多尼斯面对冠军看起来越来越自信...
Adonis, looking more and more confortabte against the champ...

1630
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,200
似乎找到他的节奏
seems to have found his rhythm.

1631
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,570
出去结束他
Go finish him off.

1632
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:03,340
这已经演变成一场激战  一次一拳
This has devolved into a slugfest! One punch at a time!

1633
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:05,040
加油  唐
Come on, D!

1634
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:07,570
康兰想短时间内了结奎迪
Conlans trying to punish Creed at short range.

1635
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:08,780
现在结束他
Finnish him now!

1636
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:11,740
康兰一鼓作气的结束第三回合...
Big combination to end the third by Conlan...

1637
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:13,480
而奎迪神志不清走错了角落
and Creed does not know where he is, walking to the wrong corner there.

1638
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:16,280
他的手很长
His arm is long.

1639
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:18,550
因为你被牵着鼻子走  唐尼
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

1640
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:19,750
要忍耐
Be patient.

1641
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:21,920
一步  一拳
One step, one punch...

1642
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:23,190
一步一步来  就这样
One round at a time. There you.

1643
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,420
一步...
One step...

1644
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,890
一拳...
one punch...

1645
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:27,190
一步一步来
one round at a time.

1646
01:54:27,230 --> 01:54:28,530
12回合制第五回合...
Round five of a scheduled 12...

1647
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,360
与早前大多数专家预计的有很大区别
and already it's a far different fight than most experts expected.

1648
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,770
他只是个冒牌
He's just a pretender.

1649
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,500
他很幸运可以在同一个擂台上被你打
He's lucky to be in the same ring with you hitting him.

1650
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:36,140
记住这一点
Remember that.

1651
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:40,710
阿多尼斯  奎恩很成功迫使瑞奇  康兰使出全力
Adonis Creed has succeed in pressuring Ricky Conlan and making him fight.

1652
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:07,070
奎恩在这场拳赛充分的证明他不是好欺负的
Creed has proven plenty in this fight He's taken it, he's given it back.

1653
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,500
但他不像一场...
But he does not look like a match...

1654
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,800
最好同等级的世界拳赛
for the best poundforpound fighter in the world.

1655
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,270
你在那里很难熬...
You're going throgh hell out there...

1656
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,670
但你也在给他打击  我可以从他眼里看得出
but you're hurting him too. I can see it in his eyes.

1657
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,580
你没有你想的落后那么多
You're not as far behind as you think.

1658
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:18,610
短距离打刺拳  缩短距离...
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance...

1659
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:21,250
到他的下面你就能揍死他了
get underneath him, and you'll be able to rip him.

1660
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,320
你要压回他
You gotta push him back.

1661
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:25,550
大多数评论家没想到奎迪可以熬这么久
Most critics didn't think Creed could make it this far.

1662
01:55:25,590 --> 01:55:26,990
唐尼  后退往下避开
Donnie, step under!

1663
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,160
漂亮
Yes!

1664
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:30,190
加油  瑞奇
Come on, Ricky!

1665
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,630
有一刻奎恩控制了局势
There are moments when Creed is assertively taking over.

1666
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:35,860
但马上被狠狠的反击迫使奎迪回到角落
But there's a hard counter right, drives Creed back into the corner.

1667
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:38,100
就在奎恩刚有机会控制局势...
Just when it appears Creed might be taking control...

1668
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:40,400
康兰近身打到他毫无反击之力
Conlan comes close to knocking him down.

1669
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:42,700
施加压力  你才是控制局势的那个人
Use that pressure. You are the one that's in the driving seat.

1670
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:44,670
他不是你这个等级的  好吗
He's not used to this level, all right?

1671
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:47,740
双手放绳子上  深呼吸
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

1672
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:48,680
他速度很快
Boy's fast.

1673
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:51,680
是你对你自己
Hey! It's you against you.

1674
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:52,750
我对我自己  这就对了
Me again me. That's right.

1675
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:54,410
他只是挡着你的路  明白
He's just in your way. Got it.

1676
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,680
走你自己的路  加油吧
Get in out of the way! Let's go!

1677
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,850
年轻的阿多尼斯  奎迪...
Not only is young Adonis Creed...

1678
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:01,490
不只还在擂台上  他可能还可以打
still in the ring, he may be in the fight.

1679
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,360
奎迪一击重左拳
Hard left hand by Creed.

1680
01:56:05,390 --> 01:56:07,690
康兰是一个压倒性的大热门...
Conlan was an overwhelmingly heavy favorite...

1681
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:12,170
现在双手连续重击年轻的奎恩
pounding young Creed with right hands as you saw right there.

1682
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:16,300
把一切伤害过你的拿回来
Bring back everything that's ever hurt you.

1683
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:19,640
所有你的痛  包括你以前所有的东西
Al the pain you had inside, everything that held you back.

1684
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:23,910
把它放在两个拳头里  我要你打到他的身体...
Put it in both fists, and I want you to drive it through his body...

1685
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:26,850
我向你保证他会倒下的
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1686
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,120
我们进入到了本能发挥作用的阶段了
We're into the part of the fight where all your instincts come into play.

1687
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:34,690
大部分专家预计康兰会避免跟奎迪互殴...
Most experts expected that Conlan would avoid trading shots with Creed...

1688
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:36,490
但他很乐意互殴
but he's trading willingly.

1689
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:37,920
奎迪打出了重拳
Creed fires a hard body punch.

1690
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,760
康兰麻烦了
Conlan in trouble!

1691
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:42,230
左重拳打到身体
Hard left hand to the body.

1692
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,300
冠军很难受啊  吉姆
The champ is in bad shape, Jim.

1693
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:47,190
奎迪意识到他打康兰的身体
Creed realized he has a better chance of hurting Conlan

1694
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:49,100
比头有更大的机会
to the body than to the head!

1695
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,300
好勾拳  不
What an uppercut! No!

1696
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:53,710
而奎迪摇摇晃晃的
And Creed staggers back.

1697
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,410
打身体
Body! Body!

1698
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,440
打身体  彼此攻击
To the body, trading shots!

1699
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,810
靠着他的刺拳奎迪看起来有一个很大的机会
Pawing with his jab, Creed looks to land one big shot.

1700
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:01,880
脚动起来
Move your legs!

1701
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:29,740
唐尼  起来
Donnie, get up!

1702
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:33,010
起来  唐
Get up, D!

1703
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,920
加油啊  宝贝
Come on, baby.

1704
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,720
史迪奇
Stitch!

1705
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,670
奎迪刚像个着了魔的人起来了
Creed just got up like a man possessed.

1706
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,970
你还好吗  看着我
You okay? Look at me!

1707
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
他刚晕倒了  唐尼
He was out! Donnie!

1708
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:56,900
倒下但没晕过去
Down but not out.

1709
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,270
康兰以为他在庆祝一个击倒...
Conlan thinks he's celebrating a knockout...

1710
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,370
下来  他站起来了
Get down! He's getting up!

1711
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,610
但裁判握着奎迪的拳套
but the referee is dusting Creed's gloves.

1712
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,840
你没事
You're good.

1713
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:07,750
奎迪战胜了倒数又再次行动
Creed beats the count and the action begins again.

1714
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:08,950
那就是冠军的心
That's the heart of a champion.

1715
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:11,250
我会告诉你他有他爸爸的心
He has his daddy's heart, I'll tell you that much.

1716
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:11,780
唐尼  准备好
Donnie, be ready!

1717
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:15,320
康兰又要继续  身体攻击
More work to do for Conlan. Body shot. Body dhot.

1718
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,460
想让奎迪再次击倒
Trying to set Creed up one more time.

1719
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:19,690
抱住他
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

1720
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:24,430
史迪奇给右眼护理得很好...
Stitch has done a great job over that right eye...

1721
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:27,030
但现在左眼看起来像几乎闭上了
but now the left eye looks like it's almost shut.

1722
01:58:27,070 --> 01:58:28,770
闭上眼
Closing up.

1723
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:30,370
洛奇  他还好吗  你得回到你的...
Rock, is he okay? You have to go back to your...

1724
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,940
呆在那  比安卡  他没事
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

1725
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:33,810
我没激动
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

1726
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,310
我没事
I'm good.

1727
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,310
你没事  是的  好吧
You're good? Yeah, man, all right?

1728
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:37,540
你确定吗  我没事
You sure febout that? I am. I'm good.

1729
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:40,310
他的身体和头都承受了很多的伤害
He's taken a lot of punishment to both the body and the head.

1730
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,450
左眼完全闭上了
Left eye completely closed.

1731
01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:43,450
我要终止比赛  不
I'm gonna stop this thing. No!

1732
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,320
让我看看你的眼睛
Let me see the eye.

1733
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:47,690
时间到了  医生来给他看看
Time! Doc, give him a look!

1734
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:49,760
好了  给我看看你的眼睛
All right. Show me your eye.

1735
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,560
给我看看你的眼睛  阿多尼斯
Show me your eye, Adonis!

1736
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:53,330
有多少只手指
How many fingers?

1737
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,990
有多少只手指
How many fingers?

1738
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:56,300
有多少  阿多尼斯
How many, Adonis?

1739
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:57,130
四只
Four.

1740
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,730
再来
And again.

1741
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,900
二只
Two.

1742
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,300
时间到
Time in!

1743
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:06,240
用口吸气  深呼吸
All right. Breathe through your mouth. Deep breaths, kid, deep.

1744
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:08,740
你是王牌  你在占优  你会赢这场比赛的
You are up on the cards, you're winning this. You are gonna win this!

1745
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:10,510
但要聪明点跟他保持距离
But just keep smart and keep away from him.

1746
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:12,910
他这次会晕倒的  他这回合就不行了
He's going to sleep this time. He's going out this round.

1747
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,750
我应该替你父亲终止这场比赛
I should've stopped the fight with your father.

1748
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:15,680
我现在就终止比赛
I'm stopping this one now.

1749
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,050
不要  好吗  让我打到最后
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

1750
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,150
我要证明  证明什么
I gotta prove it. Prove what?

1751
01:59:20,190 --> 01:59:23,020
我不是一个错误
I'm not a mistake.

1752
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,290
看着我
Look at me.

1753
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,300
我从来没有机会感谢阿波罗在米奇死后帮我渡过难关
I never got a chance to thank Apollo for helping me out after Mickey died.

1754
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:33,630
但那对你做的没什么可比的
But it's nothing compared to what you've done.

1755
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,170
你教了我怎么再去战斗...
You taught me how to fight again...

1756
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,240
而我会回家跟癌症战斗
and I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna fight this thing.

1757
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:39,310
但如果我战斗我要你也要战斗
But if I fight I want you to fight, too.

1758
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:41,370
我要你进到擂台...
I want you to go across this ring...

1759
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:44,580
把这狗娘养的揍死  你能做到了
and knock that son of a bitch down. Can you do it?

1760
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:45,910
说出来
Say it.

1761
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:47,510
我会揍死那个狗娘养的
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

1762
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:48,780
我知道你会的  你知道为什么吗
I know you are. You know why?

1763
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:51,050
因为你是奎迪的后代而且我爱你  孩子
Because you're a Creed and I love you, kid.

1764
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,350
我也爱你  继续吧
I love you too. Go on.

1765
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:54,220
好了  上场吧
All right baby, let's go.

1766
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:59,160
上啊  唐尼
Go get him, Donnie!

1767
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:04,160
第12回合开始
Round 12 begins.

1768
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:05,490
事实上场外没有一个
Virtually no one outside of

1769
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:08,030
阿多尼斯  奎迪的家人或朋友在...
Adonis Creed's family and group of friends...

1770
02:00:08,070 --> 02:00:10,100
会预料到他跟"漂亮"
would ever have expected to see him

1771
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:12,640
瑞奇  康兰打到12回合...
in a 12th round against "Pretty" Ricky Conlan...

1772
02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:15,910
互殴来到这最后的三分钟
and trading shots as they come to these last three minutes.

1773
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,180
那是击很重的左勾拳
And there's a hard left hook upstairs.

1774
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,750
好样的
Yeah!

1775
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:23,050
每次你想说这是终结的开始...
Every time you wanna say it's die beginning of the end...

1776
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:26,950
另一个人都会让你意想不到的熬过去
the other guy comes through with a shot you can't believe.

1777
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:28,720
康兰一击重右拳
Hard right hand by Conlan.

1778
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:30,790
加油  别发呆
Come on! Don't sit there!

1779
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:34,390
他们有来有回的互殴...
They're trading shots in the kind of back and forth action...

1780
02:00:34,430 --> 02:00:37,660
而我们大部分人都没预想到
that most of us didn't expect to see.

1781
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,270
奎迪被连续重拳攻击...
Creed getting hit with some hard shots...

1782
02:00:41,330 --> 02:00:45,240
但他自己站稳了  而且阿多尼斯反击了
but landing some of his own, and Adonis is firing back!

1783
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:47,170
两个战士间的另一种较量
Another pitched battle between the two warriors.

1784
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:48,110
瑞奇  结束他
Ricky, nail him!

1785
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:49,710
加油啊  孩子
Come on, kid!

1786
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,680
奎迪转身  把冠军逼到了角落
Creed spins, puts the champ in the corner!

1787
02:00:53,710 --> 02:00:55,280
打身体
Body!

1788
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:58,220
他就像洛奇  巴尔博亚挥动身体攻击
Throwing body shots like he's Rocky Balboa!

1789
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:00,620
他就像阿波罗  奎迪一样攻击上面
Going upstairs like he's Apollo Creed.

1790
02:01:00,650 --> 02:01:01,620
揍死他
Knock his ass out!

1791
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:04,290
比赛快结束了
Closing seconds of the fight!

1792
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,890
瑞奇
Ricky!

1793
02:01:06,490 --> 02:01:08,160
这才像样啊
That's what I'm talking about!

1794
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:09,600
康兰倒下了
Conlan is down!

1795
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:13,130
这是他职业生涯首次倒地
That is the first time in his career he's been on the canvas.

1796
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:17,440
你不能在最后一回合靠铃声所救
You cannot be saved by the bell in the 12th and final round.

1797
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:18,510
瑞奇  起来
Ricky, get up!

1798
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,610
别起来
Stay down!

1799
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:20,470
别起来
Stay down!

1800
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:21,980
六
Six!

1801
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:23,580
在利物浦激动人心的倒数  七  八
Dramatic count in Liverpool. Seven! Eight!

1802
02:01:23,610 --> 02:01:25,080
他必须要起来才能有机会赢这场比赛
He must get up to preserve his chance to win the fight.

1803
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,250
你还好吗  我没事
Are you all right? I'm okay.

1804
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:28,150
看着我  我没事
Look at me! I'm all right!

1805
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:28,820
他起来了  什么
He's up! What?

1806
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:32,190
铃声响起  所以康兰在最终回合活下来了
The bell sounds, so Conlan survives the 12th round!

1807
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:33,950
真精彩
What a finish!

1808
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:37,420
如果那回合再多三十秒我们可能就有新冠军了
If that round goes another 30 seconds, we may have a new champion.

1809
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:40,730
在一个难忘的晚上的一场难忘的拳赛
An unforgettable fight on an unforgettable night!

1810
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:43,030
他不再只是一个跟阿波罗  奎迪的同姓人...
He's no longer just the namesake of Apollo Creed,...

1811
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,500
他是一个活着的化身
he's the living embodiment.

1812
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,170
女士们和先生们  来点掌声...
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause...

1813
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,570
给擂台上的这两位战士
for these two warriors in the ring!

1814
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:55,070
由得分决定的胜者...
To the winner by split decision...

1815
02:01:56,110 --> 02:01:59,180
仍然是不败的世界冠军...
and still the undefeated champion of the world...

1816
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:00,780
你做得很好  孩子
You did great, kid.

1817
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:02,350
"漂亮"  瑞奇  康兰
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1818
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:03,820
唐尼  你是输在时间上
Donnie, you were robbed.

1819
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:06,490
如果还多十秒钟...
If this fight had been 10 seconds longer...

1820
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,920
多十秒钟...
10 seconds longer...

1821
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,720
奎迪
Creed.

1822
02:02:12,790 --> 02:02:15,900
你继续努力  朋友  你是拳坛的未来
You go and get it, chum. You the future of this division.

1823
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:17,530
你带着骄傲配得上这名字
You wear that name with pride.

1824
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,470
感谢
Respect.

1825
02:02:19,530 --> 02:02:23,100
恭喜你  阿多尼斯  不懈的努力
Congratulations, Adonis, on a sensational effort.

1826
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:25,710
我只是想感谢我的母亲  她在家里  我爱你
I just wanna thank my mom. She's at home. I love you.

1827
02:02:25,740 --> 02:02:27,410
虽然我知道她对我打拳很生气
Even though I know she's mad at me for doing this.

1828
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,140
希望我会让你觉得骄傲吧
Hopefully I made her proud.

1829
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,640
你差点让我心脏病发作了  但我很为你骄傲
You almost gave me a heart attack but I'm proud of you.

1830
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:33,050
我有我的家人在
I got my family right.

1831
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,850
没有他们就没有我在这的可能
Without them none of this would've been possible.

1832
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,050
洛奇...
Rocky...

1833
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,750
阿波罗  奎迪的儿子...
Apollo Creed's son...

1834
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:40,320
看着你说家人
looks at you and says family.

1835
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:41,620
这对你有什么意义
What does that mean to you?

1836
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:45,360
这意味着我很幸运  我还能说什么  对吧
It means I'm a lucky guy. What can I say, right, kid?

1837
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:49,160
他是一个真正的斗士  而且他在帮我面对新的挑战...
He's a real fighter, and he's helping me fight a new things...

1838
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:51,600
所以我很感激  真的
so I appreciate it. I really do.

1839
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:54,500
阿多尼斯  我知道你从没见过你父亲
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

1840
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:57,870
但如果他今晚在这里  你会想对他说什么
But if he was here tonight, what would you wanna say to him?

1841
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:04,340
我只是想告诉他我爱他...
I'll just tell him I love him...

1842
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:07,410
而且我知道他不是故意丢下我的
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

1843
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:11,220
还有我很骄傲能成为一个奎迪
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

1844
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:16,690
谢谢  还有为你极好的表现表示祝贺  吉姆
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations on a sensational performance. Jim.

1845
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,060
奎迪
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1846
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,900
来啊
Go on.

1847
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:28,840
跟他们说说话
Talk to them. Go on!

1848
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:54,460
观众们都热情高涨  没有一个想离开竞技场
This crowd is up on its feet. No one wants to leave the arena.

1849
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:57,960
每个在这里的人都知道他们看到些很特别的东西
Everyone in here knows they've seen something special.

1850
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,770
一场他们永不会忘的拳赛
A fight they will never forget.

1851
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:02,040
瑞奇  康兰赢了比赛
Ricky Conlan wins the fight.

1852
02:04:02,070 --> 02:04:05,440
阿多尼斯  奎恩赢了这个晚上
Adonis Creed wins the night.

1853
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,560
就这里
This is it?

1854
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,760
没错
Yeah.

1855
02:04:32,170 --> 02:04:34,530
我只是想看看我能不能爬这些楼梯
I just wanna see if I can get up these steps.

1856
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:36,370
你第一次过来是什么时候
When's the first time you came here?

1857
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,470
我当时12岁
I was 12.

1858
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:42,310
我想这是我最喜欢的地方
I think it's my favorite place.

1859
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,920
当你登到顶端...
When you get to the top...

1860
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:52,790
你会觉得你可以飞
you think you can fly.

1861
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,870
快到了
Almost there.

1862
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:15,340
你很轻松
You got this.

1863
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,550
来吧  年轻人
Come on, young man.

1864
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:24,820
让我喘口气
Just let me catch my breath.

1865
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:26,950
快点  别休息  我们到顶端休息
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

1866
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:28,820
就一会
Just a minute.

1867
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,960
不  这是你要求的  对吧
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

1868
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:33,360
我们走吧  一步一步来
Lets go. One step at a time.

1869
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:36,160
没错
Yeah.

1870
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:38,460
来吧
Come on.

1871
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,870
一步一步来  谁告诉你的
One step at a time. Who told you that?

1872
02:05:43,900 --> 02:05:45,610
一个老家伙
Some old guy.

1873
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:48,270
你知道我是说你  不是说我
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

1874
