3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,402
Boys, let's go.

4
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:06,070
Come on, tighten up.

5
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:08,040
Single file, gentlemen.

6
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,075
Center of the hall.

7
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:11,676
- Come on, tighten it up.
<i>- Condition unit one!</i>

8
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:13,313
Condition unit one, copy that.

9
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,881
On the ground. Show me hands, let's go.

10
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,182
Hands!

11
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:20,720
<i>Code blue! Fight in progress!</i>

12
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:46,210
Come on, let's fight, man! Let him go!

13
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:49,550
At least let me get my shoes.

14
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,328
Mary Anne.

15
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,397
Hello.

16
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,434
Thank you.

17
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,203
Adonis got into a fight today,

18
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,804
and he's in holding.

19
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:16,241
If you wanna see him, we're
gonna have to go up there.

20
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:18,910
He's a good kid, he just...

21
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:21,480
Fights.

22
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:24,085
All the time.

23
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,827
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,264
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

25
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,514
Johnson, got a visitor.

26
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,020
Adonis.

27
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,959
Come on in.

28
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,828
I'd like you to meet Mrs...

29
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,363
Uh...

30
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,968
Could we have a moment, please?

31
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,702
Sure.

32
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:19,640
I'll be right outside.

33
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:32,720
Why were you fighting?

34
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:37,223
I'm not going to another group home.

35
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:40,358
I'm not from a group home.

36
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
You a social worker?

37
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:44,130
No.

38
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:47,468
I am not a social worker.

39
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,544
Nigga said something about
my ma so I beat his ass.

40
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm sorry about your mother.

41
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:05,553
I know what it's like to lose someone.

42
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:10,989
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

43
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,160
I hurt myself, pushed family away.

44
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,529
I don't have no father.

45
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:17,897
What did you say?

46
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,199
I said I don't have no father.

47
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,070
That's not true.

48
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:29,143
He passed before you were
born, but you had a father.

49
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,346
You knew him?

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,786
He was my husband.

51
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,320
Adonis, I would like it very much

52
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:45,291
if you would come and stay with me.

53
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:51,432
Do you think you'd wanna do that?

54
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:05,646
What was his name?

55
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,450
Hey, James.

56
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:01,387
Don, sit down.

57
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,860
What you got there?

58
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,800
You're joking, right?

59
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:18,036
You get a promotion and you're quitting?

60
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:20,805
Look, this career just ain't for me.

61
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:23,043
What are you gonna do?

62
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:28,081
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

63
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,697
<i>Just wanna talk
to you about my job.</i>

64
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,900
- You see your new office?
- Hmm.

65
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:51,236
Yeah. But, um...

66
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,072
Well, what's it like?

67
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,308
This is a big deal, this promotion.

68
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,512
Did they hire your assistant?

69
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:04,283
Thank you.

70
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,254
Very proud of you.

71
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,071
<i>Superfight Two with
Rocky Balboa, the challenger</i>

72
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,907
<i>and, of course, Apollo
Creed, the world champion.</i>

73
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,542
<i>And there's the bell.</i>

74
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:30,875
<i>Comes over in a hurry now.</i>

75
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:32,879
<i>He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.</i>

76
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,947
<i>He starts to take command early here</i>

77
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,149
<i>and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.</i>

78
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:39,684
<i>A good right hand thrown at him.</i>

79
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:42,188
<i>Another right and another
right thrown by the champion.</i>

80
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,621
<i>Creed is going for the knockout.</i>

81
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,058
<i>Just holding that right hand
and he's just waiting for that</i>

82
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,359
<i>precise moment that he wants...</i>

83
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,696
<i>There it is! He unloaded
that. But here comes Balboa!</i>

84
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:52,831
<i>Got him in that corner, and
there's lefts and rights.</i>

85
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,399
<i>Here comes Balboa coming back out.</i>

86
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,800
<i>A left and a right to the head.</i>

87
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,635
<i>But now it is Creed coming back.</i>

88
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,572
<i>Creed with the left hand.</i>

89
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:03,343
<i>Balboa appears to be
getting hit often.</i>

90
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:14,787
Take it to him.
Take it to the body.

91
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,855
There you go!

92
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,223
Make your time count, baby.

93
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:23,095
You know what's coming up. There you go.

94
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:25,563
Check it out.

95
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,366
What you doing here, man?

96
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:29,735
15 and 0, 15 knockouts.

97
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:33,105
In Tijuana? No, bro.

98
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,939
That's barroom brawling.

99
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:36,641
Well, I'm all in anyway.

100
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:37,909
So I figure we start out local,

101
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:39,043
just to get our momentum going,

102
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,345
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

103
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,048
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

104
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,583
Adonis, these boys come in
here, this how they survive.

105
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:47,052
They gotta fight for life.

106
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,788
Kill or be killed. People die in there.

107
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,523
Your daddy died in the ring.

108
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,924
This ain't no joke.

109
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,192
I don't know him.

110
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,194
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

111
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,931
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

112
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,933
Nah, I ain't training you.

113
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,936
You know I ain't training
you. Nobody training you.

114
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,139
I'm gonna make sure about that.

115
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,409
We making champs in the Delphi Gym!

116
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,610
We not dancing!

117
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:13,645
We not singing! We fighting!

118
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:16,314
You struggle every day,
you fight for something.

119
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,351
You damn right!

120
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,254
Hey, listen up!

121
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,590
Adonis.

122
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:26,457
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

123
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:27,726
Adonis, get out the ring!

124
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,494
All you gotta do is
land one clean head shot.

125
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,999
What I gotta put up for it?

126
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,470
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

127
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,705
No, no, no.

128
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,241
You gonna get the shit knocked out of you.

129
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,208
You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.

130
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,512
Better listen to your family, boy.

131
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:49,715
Oh, my God.

132
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:52,217
At least put on your head gear.

133
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,519
- No head gear?
- Mmm-hmm.

134
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:56,255
It's on you.

135
00:11:57,824 --> 00:11:59,356
Killer, right?

136
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:02,193
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

137
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,395
Where were you at when I
was in group homes, huh?

138
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:05,764
You miss a meal?

139
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,865
Nah!

140
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,399
Which one of your killers in here next?

141
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:10,803
You pick him! You pick who's next!

142
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,140
I'm next.

143
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,851
Hey, I just need one round, bro.

144
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,653
All right, you wanna warm up?

145
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,524
I don't need no warm-up. Get my stuff.

146
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,160
I see you got
your head gear on. Good job.

147
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,967
Nah.

148
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,510
Don't run.

149
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,538
Told you I'd win, man.

150
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,005
I told you.

151
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,374
I tried to
tell you something, bro.

152
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:23,774
You don't wanna listen.

153
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,510
You don't wanna listen.

154
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,179
You wanna learn things the hard way, huh?

155
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

156
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,728
How you doing?

157
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,230
Doing good.

158
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,133
I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.

159
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:49,467
Yeah?

160
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:52,837
I quit my job.

161
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,840
Yeah. No...

162
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,114
Where did you get this? Mexico?

163
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,282
It's not that bad.

164
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:06,650
"It's not that bad."

165
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,587
I ought to knock you out myself.

166
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,222
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs

167
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:13,558
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

168
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,793
How many times I had to wipe his ass

169
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,162
because he couldn't use his hands?

170
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,530
Is that what you want? No.

171
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:22,167
You want brain damage. Yeah, you do.

172
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,403
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

173
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,603
I can get hurt doing anything.

174
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,572
Apollo didn't get hurt, he got killed!

175
00:14:27,574 --> 00:14:29,674
People get killed!

176
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:32,443
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

177
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,413
You're better than this.

178
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,650
I'm leaving soon.

179
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:43,521
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

180
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,859
So I wanted to tell
you face-to-face.

181
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:51,263
You are your father's son

182
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,366
and you're part of him.

183
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:58,338
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

184
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,007
I'm gonna call you.

185
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:08,048
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

186
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,319
You don't have to call me.

187
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,696
All right, smile!

188
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,307
How you doing?

189
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,976
This was taken from the 10th
round of the first fight, right?

190
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:48,013
Good call.

191
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:50,448
How'd you know that?

192
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,485
I heard about a third fight
between you and Apollo,

193
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,653
behind closed doors.

194
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,489
That true?

195
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:59,758
How'd you hear about that?

196
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,693
Who won?

197
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:05,964
It's kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

198
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,365
Donnie.

199
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,767
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

200
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,468
Yeah, I want to talk to
you about training me.

201
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,805
Training you.

202
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:16,307
I don't do that stuff no
more. Sorry about that.

203
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:17,943
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.

204
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,379
So I'm gonna close up.

205
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,581
How good was he?

206
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,583
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

207
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,986
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

208
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:29,588
So how'd you beat him?

209
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,788
Time beat him.

210
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,359
Time, you know, takes
everybody out, it's undefeated.

211
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,727
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

212
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,196
When Mickey died, he came
and talked to you, right?

213
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:40,165
Talked you out of quitting?

214
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,334
Took you to L.A., trained you.

215
00:17:43,336 --> 00:17:45,537
Brought you back.

216
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,178
How do you know all this?

217
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,748
How do you think?

218
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:01,585
What are you, like a cousin?

219
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,288
He's my father.

220
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,623
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

221
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,891
Call Mary Anne.

222
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:09,259
Mary Anne. His wife.

223
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,230
The house number still works.

224
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:14,132
Oh, that's right.

225
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,900
You haven't talked to
her since the funeral.

226
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:19,171
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

227
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,751
Yeah.

228
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:35,486
Nice speech.

229
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,755
I want you to train me.

230
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,859
All right? I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

231
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:44,329
You at least owe me that.

232
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,766
I can tell the way you
talk, you been to school.

233
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:51,636
So I figure you got some brains.

234
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:54,438
Why would you want to pick a fighter's life

235
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,573
when you don't have to?

236
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,443
If Apollo was around, he
would tell you that, too.

237
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,811
Well, he ain't around.

238
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:03,247
I been fighting my whole
life. I ain't got a choice.

239
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:05,950
It's always about a choice.

240
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,318
I was in the ring.

241
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,687
I saw how it went down.

242
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,255
That fight should've been stopped.

243
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:11,890
I should have stopped it.

244
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,860
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

245
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,762
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

246
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:22,135
I think he'd rather be
here, talking with you.

247
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:38,485
There is a resemblance.

248
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,324
I'm usually here all the time,

249
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:48,392
so if you're ever in the
neighborhood, come by,

250
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:49,695
if you need something.

251
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:51,662
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

252
00:19:51,664 --> 00:19:55,200
I don't go there. I haven't
been there in a long time.

253
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:00,338
Since we're pretty much like family

254
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,809
who won the third fight?

255
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,646
He did.

256
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,507
<i>In boxing,</i>

00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:38,409

259

262
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,228
<i>But for the undefeated best

with uncertainty,</i>

264
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:05,035
<i>with a seven-year
prison sentence looming.</i>

265
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:08,305
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

266
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,374
<i>I hate letting me family down.</i>

Conlan's going away for a long time.

277

I've never lost.

I've never even been knocked
down, and that's not gonna change.

00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:38,063
No respect, man.

285

I'm Donnie.

286
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:04,255
Yeah?

287
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,957
And I just moved in upstairs.

288
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,092
Okay. What do you want, Donnie? It's late.

289
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:09,427
I can hear your music.

290
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,028
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

291
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,098
Well, it is, all right?

292
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,699
I gotta wake up early and work out.

293
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:16,400
Oh. Oh, got you.

294
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:20,772
You gotta wake up early
and do your, uh, jawns.

295
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,140
Keep your body tight. Cool.

296
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:25,209
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

297
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,412
Thanks...

298
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:24,603

Hey.

302
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,059
Can I help you?

303
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:49,628

305
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,297
Hollywood!

306
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,199
Which gym? I know all those guys.

307
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:58,836
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

308
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:00,839
Self-taught?

309
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,674
You know Balboa?

310
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,243
Yes, we grew up together.

311

Conlan and Danny Wheeler.

Hey, Unc!

340
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,407
Unc!

341
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,543
How you doing?

342
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,145
Did you call me "Unc"?

343
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:22,647
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

344
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,416
What's an "O.G."?

345
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:26,818
Old-ass gangster.

346
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,285
"Unc" is good.

347
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:29,820
I can do that.

348
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,922
It's all good.

349
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:33,890
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

350
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,793
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

351
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:37,160
Figured I'd stop by.

352
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:39,898
Okay.

353
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,265
Maybe ask you a question.

354
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:45,503
Sure. I can do all this.

355
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,736
Uh...

356
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:49,239
What are some drills I can
do to get my hand speed up?

357
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:51,175
Some guys up there, I
bet they can help you.

358
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:52,610
There's a guy there named Pete.

359
00:27:52,612 --> 00:27:54,312
He's a pretty good trainer.

360
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:57,247
Yeah, but he's with his
fighter most of the time.

361
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:00,318
I mostly just train myself.

362
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,888
They know you're a Creed?

363
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,956
I don't go by that.

364
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,190
I'm trying to make it on my own.

365
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:08,391
Name's Johnson.

366
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:10,794
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

367
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:14,197
Plus, just makes life easier.

368
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,201
Uh-huh.

369
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,038
Plus, you know, if you train me

370
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,339
ain't nobody around here knows me.

371
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,310
We could fly under the radar.

372
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,812
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

373
00:28:27,814 --> 00:28:29,246
I told you before,

374
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:32,450
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

375
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,220
That's cool, but maybe you could just

376
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:38,822
give me some drills.

377
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:42,526
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

378
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:46,264
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

379
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
My God.

380
00:28:54,673 --> 00:28:57,574
All right. I got a few.

381
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,576
But that's it. Okay?

382
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:00,645
Of course.

383
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:04,716
Five rounds of jumping rope.

384
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:09,219
Three rounds on each of the bags...

385
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,688
When you get to the heavy bag,

386
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,189
just don't keep throwing your hands

387
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:13,824
because you can hurt them.

388
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,660
It's also about using your legs, all right?

389
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:21,666
And then five rounds of...

390
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,333
Shadow...

391
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,502
O-W.

392
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,603
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

393
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,274
And that's it.

394
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,207
- All right?
- Yeah.

395
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,877
Okay, here you go.

396
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,043
Oh, that is perfect.

397
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:36,880
Good luck with that.

398
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:41,519
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

399
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,295
All right, man.

400
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,230
Wait, don't you want this?

401
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,430
I got it right here.

402
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:56,266
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

403
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:59,337
It's already up in the cloud.

404
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,744
What cloud? What cloud?

405
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:08,946
Hey, Ma, it's me.

406
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:11,881
I was just calling to let
you know I'm doing good

407
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:13,784
and I got an apartment.

408
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:16,754
<i>It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.</i>

409
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:18,656
<i>I miss you.</i>

410
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,257
<i>I wanna hear from you,</i>

411
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,762
so call me back when you
get a chance. All right.

412
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:44,716
What, it's too loud?

413
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,486
No, I just heard you down here working.

414
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:51,188
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

415
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,556
Maybe get some food?

416
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:53,757
Where you from, Donnie?

417
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,359
I'm from L.A.

418
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:58,329
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

419
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,031
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

420
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,365
Not a date.

421
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,368
Right.

422
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:07,438
You know what? It's all good.

423
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,305
It's okay.

424
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,175
Hey, yo.

425
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:13,646
I am hungry.

426
00:31:18,817 --> 00:31:21,518
I only have an hour. Do
you know where you wanna go?

427
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,553
I was hoping you could tell me.

428
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:25,790
You're from Philly, right?

429
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:30,662
Okay.

430
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:37,369
Good luck, man.

431
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:51,415
So where are we?

432
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,882
North Philly.

433
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:54,217
So this is Max's.

434
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:56,853
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

435
00:31:56,855 --> 00:31:58,421
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

436
00:31:58,423 --> 00:31:59,989
You looking wonderful as always.

437
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:01,426
Thank you.

438
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:02,860
How you doing there, my friend?

439
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:05,161
This my neighbor and he's a West Coast boy.

440
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:06,429
Ain't never had a steak before.

441
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:08,365
Listen, I'm gonna treat
him like he was my neighbor.

442
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,101
That's how good we gonna take care of you.

443
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,502
- You like pickles?
- Nah.

444
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:12,903
Okay, mayonnaise.

445
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:15,238
Put extra peppers on that jawn, both kinds.

446
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,374
Ketchup, extra cheese.

447
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:19,409
- How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

448
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:21,111
No, let me get these.

449
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,280
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

450
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,582
You said it wasn't a date, though.

451
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,018
It's not.

452
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,085
Where we eating at?

453
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,553
Right there.

454
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:32,855
<i>So I heard you back
there, "jawn" this, "jawn" that.</i>

455
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:33,925
<i>What's a "jawn"?</i>

456
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,626
It's a noun.

457
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:38,763
See, these is jawns.

458
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:40,230
This is a jawn.

459
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:42,367
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

460
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,101
You got a jawn?

461
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,703
Like, a dude?

462
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:47,470
No.

463
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:49,540
I got too much going on right now.

464
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,774
Shows and stuff?

465
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,043
Yeah.

466
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:54,478
I'm opening at Electric Factory next month.

467
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,646
What's that?

468
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,980
It's a big venue out here.

469
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:58,649
A lot of people got their start.

470
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:01,386
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

471
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:03,756
That's wassup.

472
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,457
Can I ask you something personal?

473
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,594
Mmm-hmm.

474
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:16,467
I got progressive hearing loss.

475
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:18,303
Just started wearing these this past year.

476
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:21,138
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

477
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,239
For now.

478
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:26,009
So it's progressive, so eventually...

479
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:28,845
Yeah.

480
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,581
Yeah.

481
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:32,114
I'm just getting ready for it.

482
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:33,350
Like I'm getting used to these,

483
00:33:33,352 --> 00:33:36,453
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

484
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:40,858
But I really can only remember bad words.

485
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,063
Ones that aren't that useful like...

486
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:47,965
The fuck's that?

487
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:52,203
You can't tell? This is the
bull, the horns, this is...

488
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,538
Yeah, this is bullshit.

489
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,706
That's your favorite?

490
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,640
Uh-huh.

491
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,177
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

492
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,513
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

493
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:04,581
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

494
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,484
- Like what?
- Like street.

495
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,686
I'm not saying you're a square or anything,

496
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,387
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

497
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,689
My pop was a fighter.

498
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,892
Oh, right. That makes sense.

499
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:16,961
Did he fight pro?

500
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:19,128
Something like that.

501
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,064
Does he train you?

502
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,969
My pop died before I was born.

503
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:29,673
I'm sorry to hear that.

504
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:33,278
So what made you wanna sing?

505
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,885
Uh...

506
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,923
It makes me feel alive.

507
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,526
Where's your next show?

508
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,762
That place that you saw
me at, Johnny Brenda's.

509
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:56,434
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

510
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:01,370
Can I roll with you?

511
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:05,077
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

512
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,914
Let me think on it.

513
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:33,736
Okay.

514
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:37,407
Here we go, Paulie.

515
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:41,579
Happy birthday, my friend.

516
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,481
I didn't forget ya.

517
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:46,883
Your favorite.

518
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:49,753
Miss ya, pal.

519
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:54,323
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

520
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:57,262
The best of the best.

521
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:01,831
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

522
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:06,235
It's getting harder to walk up
this hill. What does that mean?

523
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:08,405
Anyway, it's a good day today.

524
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:10,673
It's a good day, got no problems.

525
00:36:10,675 --> 00:36:12,409
Bills are paid.

526
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,577
Only thing is, it's tough to

527
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,948
sleep at night sometimes. My back.

528
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,517
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

529
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,590
Anyway, shall we see what's
new in the world today?

530
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,597
Whoa.

531
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,764
Hey, Rocky!

532
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,999
Hey, how you doing?

533
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,834
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

534
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:12,736
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

535
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,572
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

536
00:37:14,574 --> 00:37:16,073
Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.

537
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,374
How you doing?

538
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:18,876
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

539
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:20,077
Welcome back, man. It's been a while.

540
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,144
Yeah, thank you very much.

541
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,213
- How do you feel?
- Good.

542
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:24,081
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

543
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,916
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

544
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,017
Didn't know you were coming by.

545
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,251
I didn't either.

546
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:30,320
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

547
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,588
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

548
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,023
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

549
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,626
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

550
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,093
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

551
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:38,961
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky,

552
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,664
he's 17 and 0.

553
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,733
Things are really opening up for us.

554
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:45,302
Leo! Come.

555
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:49,673
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

556
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,809
Little training, little motivation.

557
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,244
Let me think about it.

558
00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:54,311
Sure, sure.

559
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,412
How you doing, kid?

560
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:56,514
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

561
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,548
Nice to meet you,
too. 17 and 0, very good.

562
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,651
Yeah, I was supposed to
fight on the Ricky Conlan's card...

563
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,555
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

564
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:05,856
Unc.

565
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:07,890
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

566
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:09,360
- You made it.
- Yeah.

567
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,396
Just walked by. Here I am.

568
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:13,764
How you know Hollywood?

569
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:16,733
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

570
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:19,070
That's it.

571
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:23,807
Okay, Rock. Okay.

572
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,443
You need anything, you let me know.

573
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,311
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

574
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,579
Thanks.

575
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,916
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

576
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:36,587
Can I talk to you a minute?

577
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:43,827
I don't really know what I'm doing here

578
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,095
because I got other plans for my life

579
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:47,764
and this wasn't part of it.

580
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,767
Your father was special.

581
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,102
Tell you the truth, I don't
know if you're special.

582
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:54,572
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

583
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,173
It ain't gonna come overnight.

584
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:57,874
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

585
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:59,943
you're gonna get knocked
down, you're gonna get up

586
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,046
and you're gonna see if
you got the right thing.

587
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,680
But, you gotta work hard.

588
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:07,483
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

589
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:09,952
I'm out.

590
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,689
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

591
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:16,193
Nobody showed me how to do this.

592
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,830
I'm ready.

593
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:23,034
Come on. Let's do this.

594
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:25,503
Step into my office.

595
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:26,570
You serious?

596
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,405
I am serious. This is old school.

597
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,273
You should be able to
grab one of these birds.

598
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,640
30 seconds?

599
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:35,211
Yeah, in your dreams.

600
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,815
Come on! You call that fast?

601
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:47,390
No! Again.

602
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:49,160
I thought you were fast.

603
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:50,894
Come here!

604
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,762
Get them legs moving!

605
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:55,532
Little harder, little faster!

606
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:59,503
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

607
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:12,215
Control your tempo then build slowly.

608
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:13,383
More.

609
00:40:13,385 --> 00:40:15,751
Build, build, build.

610
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:17,755
Go!

611
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:31,702
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

612
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,704
Keep going.

613
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:36,273
That bell means hell.

614
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,709
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

615
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:39,876
Come here! God damn it!

616
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,880
Oh, my God!

617
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:48,385
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

618
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:51,120
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

619
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:54,724
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

620
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:56,892
You see this guy here staring back at you?

621
00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:57,961
Yeah.

622
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,764
That's your toughest opponent.

623
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,631
Every time you get into the ring,

624
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,465
that's who you're going against.

625
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:08,104
I believe that in boxing and I
do believe that in life, okay?

626
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,106
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

627
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,941
All right, one to the gut.

628
00:41:11,943 --> 00:41:14,544
Now, every time you punch
this guy, what's he doing?

629
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,113
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

630
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:20,719
So either you block it, slip
it or get out of the way. Go.

631
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,291
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

632
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:30,628
Good luck.

633
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:40,369
- Hey.
- Yo.

634
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,439
What's up? Is it cool?

635
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,506
Yes.

636
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:48,044
Smells good in here.

637
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:50,713
I don't even
know what fighters drink.

638
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:52,015
Do you drink tea?

639
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:54,017
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

640
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:56,153
Yeah.

641
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:58,088
So this is the house.

642
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,392
This is it.

643
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,726
What you working on?

644
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,930
Uh...

645
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:08,764

00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,497
Hey, check you out.

659
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,233
Whoo.

660
00:42:44,235 --> 00:42:46,704
Yeah!

661
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:19,903
One, two, three.

662
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:23,941
I like that. Very good.

663
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:29,079
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

664
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:33,349
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

665
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:35,519
It's tough but you gotta do it.

666
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:36,919
You get a "B" in tough.

667
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:39,823
Kid's looking good, champ!

668
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,858
Yeah, he's getting there.

669
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,697
Hey, Hollywood, what
do you weigh right now?

670
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:50,367
I don't know, probably like 180.

671
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:52,370
Why?

672
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,807
Get down to a buck 75,

673
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,575
we'll make something
happen, if you're interested.

674
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:00,811
- Hell, yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

675
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:04,046
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

676
00:44:04,048 --> 00:44:07,517
175? That's your boy's
weight. How you doing, Leo?

677
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,352
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

678
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:10,986
He could use a fight to keep warm.

679
00:44:10,988 --> 00:44:12,555
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

680
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:14,858
People will come out to see
you in the corner again, champ.

681
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,061
We'll make it like the old
days. Get the whole city there.

682
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:19,361
Make a few bucks for everybody.

683
00:44:19,363 --> 00:44:20,831
No, I understand that.

684
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,166
But I'm just getting used
to this kid right now,

685
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:25,334
and, you know, he's
getting better every day

686
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:27,003
but he's gonna take a while.

687
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:28,171
He's hungry.

688
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:31,675
You gotta feed him every
now and again. You know that.

689
00:44:31,677 --> 00:44:34,343
Thanks. I appreciate it,
chef. We'll be okay. Thanks.

690
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:37,680
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

691
00:44:37,682 --> 00:44:39,648
Rock, what we training for?

692
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,983
Yeah, what are we training for?

693
00:44:40,985 --> 00:44:43,586
We're training to win, not get
killed. You're not ready yet.

694
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:45,588
I can lose five pounds. I can
lose five pounds like that.

695
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,323
It's nothing, it's easy.

696
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:49,728
Hit the bag.

697
00:44:50,996 --> 00:44:53,463
Come on.

698
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:55,765
This kid's like a tough
Philadelphia fighter.

699
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,668
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

700
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,001
Yeah, but I've been watching him,

701
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:00,704
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

702
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:02,838
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

703
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,907
Oh, okay.

704
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,041
All right, listen.

705
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:07,510
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

706
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:08,611
Are you crazy?

707
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,648
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

708
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,849
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

709
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:15,485
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it
takes. At the end of the six weeks,

710
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:16,586
you don't think it's right, call it off.

711
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,653
Really?

712
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:19,722
Look, this is what I'm here for, all right?

713
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:21,457
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

714
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:23,860
Matter of fact, we can
go get my stuff right now.

715
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:24,927
For what?

716
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:26,128
So I can move into your spot.

717
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,465
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

718
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:30,265
No, no one's been in
my house in a long time

719
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:31,901
and I don't think you'd
be comfortable there.

720
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:34,171
What, you walk around naked?

721
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:35,305
No.

722
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,575
We're good then.

723
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:52,389
You better not walk around naked either.

724
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:53,756
That's for sure.

725
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,802
- Last one?
- Yeah, that's all of it.

726
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,669
Hey!

727
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:08,738
Hey!

728
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,240
You're moving?

729
00:46:10,242 --> 00:46:11,774
Yeah, today's been crazy.

730
00:46:11,776 --> 00:46:13,677
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

731
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,579
but I'm gonna be living
with my uncle for a while,

732
00:46:15,581 --> 00:46:16,646
training for the next fight.

733
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,981
That's your uncle?

734
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,948
He's white.

735
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,184
Yeah, a long time.

736
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:25,189
He's gonna be staying with
me, and when we ain't training

737
00:46:25,191 --> 00:46:27,356
you're welcome to come on over.

738
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:30,594
Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

739
00:46:34,398 --> 00:46:35,731
Why you giving me that look?

740
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:40,102
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

741
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:41,370
I'm gonna call you.

742
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:44,675
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

743
00:46:50,983 --> 00:46:52,849
<i>That Bianca girl
looks kind of nice.</i>

744
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,950
You like her?

745
00:46:53,952 --> 00:46:55,584
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

746
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:56,887
Yeah.

747
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,954
Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

748
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:01,524
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

749
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:03,425
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

750
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:06,329
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

751
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:08,463
What happened to him?

752
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,332
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

753
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:11,901
Kind of a mess. We'll
straighten it up later.

754
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:14,338
It'll be comfortable.

755
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,008
Oh, man, this is a dope
pic! That's your boy?

756
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,979
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

757
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:25,481
Did you train him, too?

758
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:30,287
I tried, but he just didn't
like fighting, didn't take to it.

759
00:47:31,722 --> 00:47:33,389
He still around here?

760
00:47:33,391 --> 00:47:36,860
No, he moved to a place called
Vancouver with his girlfriend.

761
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:39,695
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

762
00:47:39,697 --> 00:47:41,898
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

763
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,101
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

764
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:49,005
Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.

765
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:52,309
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

766
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:58,914
Why don't you unpack, all right?

767
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:00,584
Make yourself comfortable.

768
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,153
And I'm gonna go to the
restaurant and I'll be back.

769
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:06,189
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

770
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:08,426
You got it.

771
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:27,444
All right, Paulie!

772
00:48:28,479 --> 00:48:30,682
Ooh.

773
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,575
Hey, it's time to train.
This is how you start.

774
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:01,746
Get your engine going.

775
00:49:09,354 --> 00:49:10,954
I'm gonna take you to this place called

776
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:12,954
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

777
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:14,258
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

778
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,791
You're gonna train there,
because I don't want you

779
00:49:15,793 --> 00:49:17,193
to train in the same place

780
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:19,495
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

781
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:20,697
Yeah, that makes sense.

782
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:23,133
Don, don't get in. I
want you to run alongside.

783
00:49:23,135 --> 00:49:24,968
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

784
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,269
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

785
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:28,570
How close is it?

786
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:31,006
It's close enough.

787
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:33,043
All right.

788
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:38,615
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.

789
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:58,901
You made it. Hey.

790
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:00,503
I thought you said it was close.

791
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:02,137
Not that close.

792
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:06,343
This is Frankford. Tough place.

793
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:09,711
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
this is the place to go.

794
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:11,648
Philly fighters, you know,

795
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,316
I think they're the
toughest guys in the world.

796
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:15,885
In a lot of ways.

797
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:19,389
Maybe it's in the water, I don't
know, but great place though.

798
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,756
What's up with all these bikes?

799
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:21,890
It's a Philly thing.

800
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:23,892
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

801
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:25,427
going up and down the street.

802
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,896
Do you ride?

803
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:31,367
No. I had a Harley once but I fell
off, so I decided to use my feet.

804
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:33,903
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

805
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,271
He's no pushover, so you're gonna

806
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:38,273
have to work, you know what I mean?

807
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:40,577
What do you think?

808
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,778
Not bad, huh?

809
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,113
Not bad at all.

810
00:50:43,115 --> 00:50:48,017
Yeah. This'll get the
job done. Really will.

811
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,452
Uh...

812
00:50:49,454 --> 00:50:50,954
Look at these guys!

813
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:53,756
Hey! The gang's all here!

814
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:56,892
Donnie, look at this.

815
00:50:56,894 --> 00:50:58,827
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

816
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,296
Hey, Padman. Good to see you.

817
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:01,698
Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

818
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,166
This guy is so good with the mitts,

819
00:51:03,168 --> 00:51:04,633
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

820
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:08,236
He's got a lot of knowledge. And
Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.

821
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:09,305
Hope we don't need him.

822
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:10,740
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

823
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:11,907
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work with you.

824
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:13,209
And over here is Elvis Grant.

825
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:14,477
He makes the best gloves in the world.

826
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:15,811
Uh-huh.

827
00:51:15,813 --> 00:51:18,081
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot...

828
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,347
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

829
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:20,715
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves

830
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:22,617
so that your hands don't get so bad as me.

831
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,220
What? Is that coffee I smell in there?

832
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,287
Yeah, that's coffee.

833
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:26,823
All right, you guys get to know each other.

834
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:28,057
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

835
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:29,626
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

836
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,660
Let me introduce you to my
son. This is my son, Amir.

837
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:33,030
That's the one you're
gonna be sparring with.

838
00:51:33,032 --> 00:51:35,264
- Amir.
- Donnie. Nice to meet you.

839
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:42,771
Mmm-hmm.

840
00:51:42,773 --> 00:51:44,106
Right hand fast.

841
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:47,276
Let it go, let it go.

842
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:49,811
Push off that back foot.

843
00:51:49,813 --> 00:51:51,146
Come on, Donnie, a little quicker.

844
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:52,448
Come on, Donnie. Back it up.

845
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,249
No, just like he's doing. Yeah.

846
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:56,352
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

847
00:51:56,354 --> 00:51:58,454
That's your power.

848
00:51:58,456 --> 00:51:59,789
Fast, pop it fast.

849
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,122
I'm popping as fast as I can.

850
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:02,624
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

851
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:05,896
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

852
00:52:05,898 --> 00:52:07,530
I came out here to work with you, though.

853
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,265
This is how I work, okay?

854
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:11,166
There's some things I can't do.

855
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:12,434
I can't do this anymore.

856
00:52:12,436 --> 00:52:14,169
I can never hold the pads like that.

857
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:16,305
But I'm looking at you.
I'm working with you.

858
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:17,907
I'm working with this.

859
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:19,541
Lighten it up.

860
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:21,910
Am I still taking them real shots?

861
00:52:21,912 --> 00:52:23,813
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

862
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:26,215
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

863
00:52:26,217 --> 00:52:29,184
This easy work, Pop.

864
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:31,387
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

865
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:33,722
Time! Bell! Bell.

866
00:52:33,724 --> 00:52:34,791
Huh!

867
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:35,992
Taking real shots though!

868
00:52:35,994 --> 00:52:38,026
- What you mean?
- Cut it out!

869
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:39,229
Take those gloves off right now!

870
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:40,497
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

871
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:41,831
Take your soft ass back to L.A.!

872
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,200
You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

873
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,269
Fuck this gym!

874
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:48,137
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no learning.

875
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:50,307
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

876
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:52,041
You can't learn anything
when you're talking.

877
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,209
That's a fact of life.

878
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,177
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

879
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:59,682
Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?

880
00:52:59,684 --> 00:53:01,149
There you go. Good.

881
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:02,584
You good. It's okay.

882
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:04,921
All right. Now let's go to work!

883
00:53:04,923 --> 00:53:06,789
Double jab. Yup.

884
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:08,657
Go ahead over the top.

885
00:53:08,659 --> 00:53:11,395
Right hook here. Over here.

886
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,698
One step at a time, one punch at a time,

887
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,999
one round at a time.

888
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:18,001
One step at a time, one punch at a time,

889
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:20,705
one round at a time. Turn right.

890
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:24,407
Come on, let's go.

891
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,608
Fast, pop it fast.

892
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,177
Right upper cut. Right up top.

893
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:32,082
Boom. Boom.

894
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,918
Good.

895
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,486
I want you to let it all out.

896
00:53:37,488 --> 00:53:38,688
Now go right here.

897
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:41,523
Everyone's ever disrespected you, see them.

898
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:43,727
Anything you ever wanted

899
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:46,497
go after it.

900
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:50,735
Now's your time! Make a statement!

901
00:53:52,704 --> 00:53:55,070
One step!

902
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:57,639
One punch!

903
00:53:57,641 --> 00:53:59,810
One round at a time!

904
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:08,617
There it is.

905
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:12,655
Ah! You cheated!

906
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:24,166
Rock.

907
00:54:24,168 --> 00:54:26,903
Hey, how you doing, Pete?

908
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:32,842
Something wrong?

909
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:34,510
Rock, I knew.

910
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:36,813
I knew there was something with this kid.

911
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,715
Rocky, I have been trying for years

912
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:40,050
to get you to come work with us.

913
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:41,517
Aw. It's okay.

914
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,952
All of a sudden, this kid from
Hollywood gets you out of the shadows.

915
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:45,521
No. No shadows.

916
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:48,124
I just didn't want to do
nothing in the gym, that's all.

917
00:54:48,126 --> 00:54:51,160
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

918
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,861
Kid's name is Adonis.

919
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:54,497
Kid has Creed's blood.

920
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:58,869
Now this fight just got big time.

921
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:01,369
I apologize.

922
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:03,972
Do me a favor. Can we keep
this between ourselves?

923
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:05,340
- Oh, come on.
- No.

924
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:09,345
I'm asking you as a favor. I want
him to make a name on his own.

925
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,619
Come on, Pete.

926
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:20,056
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

927
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,295
I appreciate it.

928
00:55:31,903 --> 00:55:34,803
Keep going. You're looking good.

929
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,074
Go on, get moving.

930
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:57,593
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

931
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:59,427
I'm about to go over the ABC rules

932
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:01,198
and the rules governed by the state.

933
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,932
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

934
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:06,068
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

935
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,204
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"

936
00:56:08,206 --> 00:56:09,704
is basically whatever the referee

937
00:56:09,706 --> 00:56:12,140
sees fit for competition...

938
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,448
Unc, cut my gloves off.

939
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,550
What's wrong?

940
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:21,816
My gloves, just cut 'em off!

941
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:23,352
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

942
00:56:23,354 --> 00:56:24,454
Are they too tight?

943
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:26,923
I'm freaking out right
now! I gotta take a shit!

944
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,425
Somebody gonna wipe my ass for me?

945
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,260
- Shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

946
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,961
All right, relax.

947
00:56:32,963 --> 00:56:34,796
I'll cut you out of
these gloves. It happens.

948
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:36,631
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

949
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,168
D, I'm gonna be right outside.

950
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,702
That's right.

951
00:56:39,704 --> 00:56:41,436
Can you just stall for
10 minutes or something?

952
00:56:41,438 --> 00:56:42,805
I gotta put the gloves back on.

953
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,139
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

954
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:45,374
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

955
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:46,476
It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.

956
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:47,543
First for me, man.

957
00:56:47,545 --> 00:56:49,177
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

958
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,378
Yeah.

959
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,381
A little nervous?

960
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:55,186
- Nerves?
- Hurry up!

961
00:56:58,555 --> 00:57:01,756
Blue corner, red corner.

962
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:02,825
All right, fellas,

963
00:57:02,827 --> 00:57:04,794
y'all had your instructions
in the dressing room.

964
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,197
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

965
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,831
Any questions from the blue corner?

966
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,468
Questions from the red corner?

967
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,602
Touch them up. Be ready on seconds out.

968
00:57:13,604 --> 00:57:15,037
Right. It's about you.

969
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:16,238
Yep. Yep.

970
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,707
It's all about you. Now, you wanted this.

971
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:20,943
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

972
00:57:20,945 --> 00:57:22,044
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

973
00:57:22,046 --> 00:57:24,046
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

974
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:26,449
Let's go, Unc.

975
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:30,519
It's all about today!

976
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:33,822
There is no tomorrow! Let's go!

977
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:36,159
Nice!

978
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,160
Move and target, move and target!

979
00:57:39,162 --> 00:57:42,164
Jab! It's the jab!

980
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,635
His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?

981
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:52,008
Hands up. Hands up, kid.

982
00:57:59,016 --> 00:58:01,551
Breathe, kid, breathe!

983
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:08,724
Let's go, boy! Let's go, boy!

984
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,860
Way to get out of there.

985
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,961
Keep moving, Donnie!

986
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:14,930
Move your head! That's it.

987
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:17,434
Get on him! Get on him!

988
00:58:20,737 --> 00:58:23,506
Break! My break!

989
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:25,407
Let's go, boy!

990
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:28,077
There you go! There you go! Good.

991
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,278
Back off.

992
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,648
Leo! Leo! Leo!

993
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,151
One punch on top.

994
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:42,258
Keep moving. That's
right. Block left. Block left.

995
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,863
Relax.

996
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:51,034
Let's go, boy! Come get
this shit! Come get it!

997
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:52,501
You're doing good, kid!

998
00:58:52,503 --> 00:58:53,802
Keep the pressure up!

999
00:58:59,342 --> 00:59:00,443
Break!

1000
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:01,910
Let's go, Leo!

1001
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:02,979
Come on!

1002
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:04,079
Let's go.

1003
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,349
Keep moving! Keep coming forward!

1004
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:08,452
Great shot!

1005
00:59:09,753 --> 00:59:12,222
Come on, Donnie!

1006
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:16,457
What are you doing?

1007
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:18,160
Time!

1008
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:20,997
Yeah.

1009
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:24,332
Okay! All right.

1010
00:59:24,334 --> 00:59:25,968
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

1011
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,169
Through your lungs.
Deep breath. Deep breath.

1012
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:29,372
Look at me.

1013
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:31,106
I like what you're doing
out there, all right?

1014
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:32,274
You're a little tight.

1015
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:33,608
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

1016
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,177
Here's what I want you to do.

1017
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,313
I want you to throw your
left under the radar.

1018
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:38,948
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

1019
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,048
You're gonna see an opening,

1020
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,617
put it right on his
chin, that'll drop him...

1021
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:44,552
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

1022
00:59:44,554 --> 00:59:47,055
Your old man did
that to me. It worked.

1023
00:59:47,057 --> 00:59:50,191
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

1024
00:59:50,193 --> 00:59:54,764
Leo! Leo! Leo!

1025
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:04,641
Come on!

1026
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:16,387
Come on!

1027
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:30,265
Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!

1028
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:32,867
Break!

1029
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:34,904
Come on!

1030
01:00:36,273 --> 01:00:40,077
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

1031
01:00:42,914 --> 01:00:43,979
Get up! Get up!

1032
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:45,046
Come on, kid! Come on!

1033
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:46,849
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

1034
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,149
Three! Four!

1035
01:00:48,151 --> 01:00:49,385
We got him, Rock!

1036
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:51,086
Five! Six!

1037
01:00:51,088 --> 01:00:52,787
Seven! Eight!

1038
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:54,722
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

1039
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:55,890
That's it, baby!

1040
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:58,760
We got one, Rock! Whoo!

1041
01:00:58,762 --> 01:01:00,461
We got one! Yeah, we got one!

1042
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:01,564
Unbelievable!

1043
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:03,164
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

1044
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:06,635
Come on, man! You did it.

1045
01:01:06,637 --> 01:01:07,702
You okay?

1046
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:09,070
Give him some room. Rock. Rock. Rock.

1047
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:10,472
Lucky shot.

1048
01:01:10,474 --> 01:01:14,410
Come on in! Bianca! Bianca! Come in!

1049
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:15,577
Sorry! Sorry!

1050
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:17,079
I'm all good.

1051
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:19,314
You didn't say you had hands like that!

1052
01:01:19,316 --> 01:01:21,851
Why didn't you say you had
hands like that, though?

1053
01:01:21,853 --> 01:01:24,787
Well, but girl, I'm square
though. I'm square though.

1054
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:26,689
You good? What we doing after this?

1055
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:27,756
Let's go for it.

1056
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:30,227
- Let's go tear the city up!
- Okay.

1057
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,490
- Hey.
- Hmm.

1058
01:02:00,492 --> 01:02:03,327
I made something for you.

1059
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,874
- Keep 'em closed.
- Mmm-hmm.

1060
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:47,171
Come listen with me.

1061
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:19,836
- What about your uncle?
- Huh.

1062
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:22,405
He's asleep.

1063
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,941
He old, man.

1064
01:04:01,077 --> 01:04:02,343
There he is.

1065
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:03,713
- What's up, Unc?
- Hey, how you feeling?

1066
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:08,217
I'm good. I'm a little
sore, but I'm all right.

1067
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,885
- You want some toast?
- Okay.

1068
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:13,222
So you cooking or you watching?

1069
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,389
No, I'm looking you up.

1070
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:15,925
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

1071
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:17,287
No, don't do that. I'm right here.

1072
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,902
Mmm.

1073
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:30,037
What's up?

1074
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,575
You got something you wanna tell me?

1075
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,287
I didn't lie.

1076
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:46,389
You might as well have.

1077
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:47,789
You told me that your dad was some fighter.

1078
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,858
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

1079
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,794
People look at me
differently when they know.

1080
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:53,128
They look at Apollo differently, too.

1081
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,063
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

1082
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:56,432
I don't care about that shit.

1083
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,267
I do care about you keeping
it 100 with me, though.

1084
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:01,970
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

1085
01:05:01,972 --> 01:05:05,974
No, seriously, look. You...

1086
01:05:05,976 --> 01:05:09,278
100% honesty from here on out.

1087
01:05:10,648 --> 01:05:14,818
All right. So his... His
wife, that's not your mom?

1088
01:05:15,985 --> 01:05:18,387
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

1089
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:20,990
All right? She died when I was young.

1090
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:24,427
I bounced around foster
care for a couple years.

1091
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:26,928
In and out of juvie.

1092
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,499
Then Mary Anne tracked
me down and took me in.

1093
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:32,835
Anything else?

1094
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,438
Ask me.

1095
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,439
How many females have
you been with before me?

1096
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:41,276
Anything else?

1097
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:43,278
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

1098
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,479
How?

1099
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:46,914
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

1100
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,284
Mmm-hmm.

1101
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:49,852
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

1102
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:52,019
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

1103
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:53,454
I can't see that happening.

1104
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:55,423
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

1105
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:56,825
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

1106
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,227
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

1107
01:05:58,229 --> 01:06:01,098
No, I'm gonna find the
real in what you're saying.

1108
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:03,999
Don't worry, it's cool.

1109
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,367
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

1110
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:08,671
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1111
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,974
I don't mind that.

1112
01:06:12,943 --> 01:06:14,945
What?

1113
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,713
You do look like him, though.

1114
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:19,414
Oh, my God. I hate that!

1115
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:22,552
Just to get on my nerves!

1116

1123
01:06:46,543 --> 01:06:48,644
<i>A fact that was kept under
wraps because Johnson</i>

1124
01:06:48,646 --> 01:06:50,646
<i>was the product of
Creed's infidelity.</i>

1125

<i>The boxing world is excited to

01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:17,372
<i>and I think the family must
have felt this embarrassment</i>

1137
01:07:17,374 --> 01:07:19,474
<i>because they kept it
under wraps for so long.</i>

1138
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:21,443
<i>- But I really have one question.
- What?</i>

1139
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:23,912
<i>Can the kid fight as
well as the old man?</i>

1140
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,949
<i>That's a stretch.</i>

1141
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,554
I found us our next payday.

1142
01:07:31,988 --> 01:07:34,289
Check it out.

1143
01:07:35,892 --> 01:07:37,258
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

1144
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,894
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1145
01:07:38,896 --> 01:07:40,262
He's got one fight under his belt.

1146
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1147
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,198
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

1148
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,302
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

1149
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:50,171
Kid's here because of a name alone.

1150
01:07:50,173 --> 01:07:51,573
You're gonna do it.

1151
01:07:51,575 --> 01:07:53,309
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

1152
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:56,345
Listen to me. This is not
a negotiation, all right?

1153
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:58,747
You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.

1154
01:07:58,749 --> 01:08:00,816
Do you remember that?

1155
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:04,119
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in

1156
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,188
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

1157
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:09,457
So look at it again.

1158
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:13,162
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

1159
01:08:13,164 --> 01:08:15,296
I don't care how you're remembered.

1160
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:16,798
I care about your kids having a roof

1161
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,700
over their head when you're done.

1162
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:21,070
Do you understand?

1163
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:30,545
Hello?

1164
01:08:30,547 --> 01:08:34,451
It's Tommy Holiday. I
look after Ricky Conlan.

1165
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,452
- Yeah, how you doing?
- <i>Listen.</i>

1166
01:08:38,454 --> 01:08:41,324
Is it true about the kid?

1167
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:45,228
About the kid?

1168
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:48,629
Uh...

1169
01:08:48,631 --> 01:08:52,201
Think you and the kid have got
30 minutes for a business meeting?

1170
01:08:54,003 --> 01:08:55,470
All right, I'll tell you what.

1171
01:08:55,472 --> 01:08:57,372
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

1172
01:08:57,374 --> 01:09:00,008
We'll talk with you, but it's gotta be fast

1173
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,044
because we're training.

1174
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:03,478
<i>I can be there. Couple of days.</i>

1175
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,347
- Yeah.
- <i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1176
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,417
Okay.

1177
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:14,255
Oh, man.

1178
01:09:14,257 --> 01:09:16,424
Thanks for taking the time.
I'll get right to it.

1179
01:09:16,426 --> 01:09:20,862
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

1180
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,999
and we've beaten everybody.

1181
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:26,101
You want me to fight Conlan?

1182
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:28,336
I think it would be a very wise move.

1183
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:30,339
You've been down in
Mexico doing pro fights, eh?

1184
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:32,741
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

1185
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,242
And with the Sporino
fight, that makes you 16-0.

1186
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:37,612
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

1187
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:41,450
were in some hole in the wall, do they, eh?

1188
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:45,754
You think I'm ready?

1189
01:09:45,756 --> 01:09:48,557
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

1190
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,657
Right? It's a sure victory.

1191
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:52,194
That is not true.

1192
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:55,765
Yeah, it is.

1193
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,034
Okay, listen.

1194
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:01,568
All right.

1195
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:04,772
This could be my guy's last fight.

1196
01:10:04,774 --> 01:10:06,741
And I wanna make it count.

1197
01:10:06,743 --> 01:10:07,875
Now, on that note,

1198
01:10:07,877 --> 01:10:10,445
we would need you to
change your name to Creed.

1199
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:12,783
It's just a formality.

1200
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,755
And what if I say no?

1201
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:23,392
Well, then there's no fight.

1202
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:24,759
Without the name, there's no fight.

1203
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:28,062
It's a non-starter.

1204
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:29,365
Okay. Okay.

1205
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:33,067
Why don't you both take
a day, talk about it

1206
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:36,738
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

1207
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,008
It's a good deal.

1208
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,576
Can't do it.

1209
01:10:40,578 --> 01:10:43,512
Nah, it's not my name.

1210
01:10:43,514 --> 01:10:47,081
And plus, I wanna make
it on my own merit anyway.

1211
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,483
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1212
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:51,253
You got a funny way of showing it.

1213
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:52,621
What's that supposed to mean?

1214
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,990
I mean, weren't Apollo and
Rocky like best friends?

1215
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:58,626
It feels like you're trying to tap
into whatever it is he left behind.

1216
01:10:58,628 --> 01:11:01,929
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

1217
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:03,031
What are you afraid of?

1218
01:11:03,033 --> 01:11:05,968
Uh, what are you afraid of?

1219
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,035
I don't know.

1220
01:11:07,037 --> 01:11:09,437
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

1221
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,439
Uh...

1222
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,809
I always knew it would happen eventually

1223
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:17,879
so my plan has always just been

1224
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:21,849
to do what I love for as long as I can.

1225
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:26,019
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

1226
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:29,592
So, what are you afraid of?

1227
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,396
I'm afraid of taking
on the name and losing.

1228
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:37,131
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

1229
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:40,134
Why don't you think about what's true?

1230
01:11:40,136 --> 01:11:43,139
You love to fight, right?

1231
01:11:44,173 --> 01:11:45,941
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

1232
01:11:45,943 --> 01:11:47,009
Yeah.

1233
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:51,148
Yeah, and you are Apollo
Creed's son, right?

1234
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,481
Yes.

1235
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:56,751
So then use the name.

1236
01:11:56,753 --> 01:11:59,322
It's yours.

1237
01:12:13,104 --> 01:12:14,870
Hey, Unc, you down there?

1238
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,873
Yeah.

1239
01:12:26,449 --> 01:12:29,684
I know you don't want me to do this, right?

1240
01:12:29,686 --> 01:12:32,620
I can think of better things to do, Donnie.

1241
01:12:32,622 --> 01:12:35,924
But if we did do it

1242
01:12:35,926 --> 01:12:38,094
how we get it done?

1243
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:44,000
Mmm.

1244
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:48,270
Well...

1245
01:12:51,641 --> 01:12:55,876
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

1246
01:12:55,878 --> 01:12:58,746
Definitely has a lot
more experience than you.

1247
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:01,081
And he's faster than you are.

1248
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,584
He's the champion.

1249
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:05,219
And since he's the champion,

1250
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:08,322
you gotta bring the
fight to him, like I did.

1251
01:13:08,324 --> 01:13:13,695
You gotta go to the body.
Dig. And in doing that

1252
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:15,463
you're in a very dangerous place

1253
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:18,232
because you can get laid out.

1254
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:21,970
It ain't easy for me to
be in your corner, kid.

1255
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:23,972
I don't know if you're ready for it.

1256
01:13:23,974 --> 01:13:27,642
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

1257
01:13:27,644 --> 01:13:29,911
But I'll do what you wanna do.

1258
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:32,647
If it was anybody else in my corner

1259
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:35,951
I wouldn't do it.

1260
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,588
But I got you.

1261
01:13:41,323 --> 01:13:43,859
So make the call.

1262
01:13:45,328 --> 01:13:47,496
All right.

1263
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:58,173
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

1264
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:05,881
I'm fighting
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

1265
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:12,719
Don't work him too hard, Rock.

1266
01:14:12,721 --> 01:14:14,522
- Yeah.
- He's still a puppy.

1267
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:15,590
Come on, come on.

1268
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:18,626
Close the distance. That's it.

1269
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:20,228
Yeah. One, two.

1270
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:23,264
Good.

1271
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:25,133
Come on. Body, come here.

1272
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:27,637
Oh, yeah. Got a good hit.

1273
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:30,804
Okay.

1274
01:14:30,806 --> 01:14:32,906
Come on.

1275
01:14:32,908 --> 01:14:36,477
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

1276
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:41,616
You up to moving around?

1277
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:43,820
Take a break.

1278
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:51,159
Oh. Hey, Unc, you all right?

1279
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,326
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

1280
01:14:52,328 --> 01:14:53,495
I'm all right. It's out.

1281
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:54,662
I'm all right.

1282
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:55,729
All right.

1283
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:57,631
Just let me walk.

1284
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:59,034
Just... I'm good.

1285
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,402
- Sure?
- Yeah.

1286
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,772
Hey. What's wrong with you?

1287
01:15:03,774 --> 01:15:05,540
I don't know. I don't know.

1288
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,741
Come here.

1289
01:15:06,743 --> 01:15:08,309
Just let me walk.

1290
01:15:08,311 --> 01:15:11,713
No, we got to call someone and
get you to the doctor, okay?

1291
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:12,946
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

1292
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:14,148
- Off the rope.
- Easy.

1293
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,518
Come on, I got you. Hey, Stitch!

1294
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,052
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

1295
01:15:18,054 --> 01:15:20,888
- No, I'm really...
- Hey, somebody help!

1296
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,298
Hi.

1297
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,432
- Hi.
- Donnie.

1298
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:32,799
Dr. Kathari.

1299
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:34,670
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

1300
01:15:34,672 --> 01:15:36,838
I'm feeling good, real
good. I could go now.

1301
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,073
Heard you fell down. Was that
the first time you've fallen?

1302
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:41,009
Well, without being punched.

1303
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:42,344
I'm gonna give you some more fluids.

1304
01:15:42,346 --> 01:15:43,612
That should help you feel better.

1305
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:44,912
And we're gonna run
some tests in the morning

1306
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:46,481
- and get you out of here.
- Can you do this fast?

1307
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:48,015
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1308
01:15:48,017 --> 01:15:50,852
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

1309
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,021
- I'll check on you later.
- Thank you.

1310
01:15:53,023 --> 01:15:56,090
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

1311
01:15:56,092 --> 01:15:57,392
Donnie, we gotta train.

1312
01:15:57,394 --> 01:16:00,295
Yeah, go to sleep.

1313
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:09,103
You guys need any more help?

1314
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:10,871
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

1315
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:12,072
- You got it? What you need?
- Nothing.

1316
01:16:12,074 --> 01:16:13,808
Thought you got lost for a minute.

1317
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:18,179
I have not seen food that look
like this in this house ever.

1318
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:19,281
Yeah?

1319
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,616
Yes. You know, usually everything

1320
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,018
I have has sauce or something on it.

1321
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,320
Get some of these collard greens.

1322
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:26,854
All right. You just...

1323
01:16:26,856 --> 01:16:28,455
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

1324
01:16:28,457 --> 01:16:31,058
Bianca, you're beautiful

1325
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,461
and I think you'll be a great singer.

1326
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,531
I think you're gonna be a
great champ, like your father.

1327
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:38,133
Maybe even better.

1328
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:41,768
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

1329
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,705
Here we go. <i>Cent'anni.</i> 100 years.

1330
01:16:44,707 --> 01:16:45,941
I'm honored.

1331
01:16:45,943 --> 01:16:48,043
Lucky me.

1332
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,412
Keep working on that shovel hook.

1333
01:16:51,414 --> 01:16:52,714
Ah.

1334
01:16:52,716 --> 01:16:53,915
Right, that's it.

1335
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:56,485
Now, I wanna throw the
hook on the same side.

1336
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:59,153
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

1337
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:02,290
Very good.

1338
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:04,659
A little more vicious than
that, little more power.

1339
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:07,830
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

1340
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,863
Hey, Rock.

1341
01:17:09,865 --> 01:17:11,133
Yeah.

1342
01:17:11,135 --> 01:17:12,733
Good. You're looking good.

1343
01:17:12,735 --> 01:17:14,001
Are you getting jealous?

1344
01:17:14,003 --> 01:17:16,972
Yeah, a little.

1345
01:17:18,774 --> 01:17:21,610
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

1346
01:17:21,612 --> 01:17:23,311
Hello? Yeah?

1347
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:25,315
Yeah.

1348
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:30,951
Yeah, okay.

1349
01:17:30,953 --> 01:17:33,522
All right, thanks.

1350
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:41,931
Mr. Balboa.

1351
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:48,202
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

1352
01:17:49,672 --> 01:17:51,938
Well, we went through your test results

1353
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,041
and your biopsy came back showing signs

1354
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:58,612
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

1355
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:00,682
What's that do?

1356
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:03,920
Well, it's a form of cancer.

1357
01:18:12,128 --> 01:18:13,695
I know that sounds scary,

1358
01:18:13,697 --> 01:18:16,263
but the good news is we caught it early.

1359
01:18:16,265 --> 01:18:19,233
However, we will have to remove
the tumor in your lymph nodes

1360
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:23,638
and start chemotherapy immediately.

1361
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,640
My wife tried that.

1362
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:29,277
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

1363
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:30,711
this is the best plan of action.

1364
01:18:30,713 --> 01:18:33,048
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

1365
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:36,049
and I don't think I wanna do it.

1366
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:38,352
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

1367
01:18:38,354 --> 01:18:39,787
With treatment, you'll still have

1368
01:18:39,789 --> 01:18:42,023
a very good chance of recovery.

1369
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:44,293
Without it...

1370
01:18:46,063 --> 01:18:48,562
I'm okay with it, really.

1371
01:18:48,564 --> 01:18:50,397
Well, at least take these.

1372
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,168
It has information on your
diagnosis and options for treatment.

1373
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,071
- We can start...
- Thank you very much.

1374
01:18:57,073 --> 01:19:01,677
Listen, I'd appreciate if you
wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?

1375
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:10,352
Oh, man! There's so much
traffic, you wouldn't believe it.

1376
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:12,254
That senior bus was running late, huh?

1377
01:19:12,256 --> 01:19:15,055
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

1378
01:19:15,057 --> 01:19:16,357
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

1379
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:18,259
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

1380
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:19,361
Good.

1381
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:20,829
I've been waiting on you.

1382
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:25,435
Oh, come on, just put your gloves
on and stop talking so much.

1383
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,643
We got a few things to do.

1384
01:19:37,713 --> 01:19:39,080
It's all about you.

1385
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:40,380
Mmm-hmm.

1386
01:19:40,382 --> 01:19:42,916
I already had my career. I did okay.

1387
01:19:42,918 --> 01:19:45,420
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

1388
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:49,256
Now is the time for you to
rise to the occasion there.

1389
01:19:49,258 --> 01:19:50,724
- Just gonna put my...
- I can do it.

1390
01:19:50,726 --> 01:19:53,829
Okay, all right.

1391
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,098
Now...

1392
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,599
I want you to always, always, always

1393
01:19:58,601 --> 01:20:00,067
pay attention to yourself first.

1394
01:20:00,069 --> 01:20:01,268
Right.

1395
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:03,804
If I'm not here to start
with, just start moving around.

1396
01:20:03,806 --> 01:20:05,106
All right. Mouthpiece.

1397
01:20:05,108 --> 01:20:07,476
Know what I'm saying?

1398
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:10,245
Too many punches to the head, huh?

1399
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:11,411
Yeah, whatever, Coach.

1400
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:13,348
All right, get going there, champ.

1401
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,581
Bell.

1402
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,985
Come on, Creed!

1403
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:27,697
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

1404
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:30,965
All right, Amir.

1405
01:20:30,967 --> 01:20:34,170
All right, champ.
Don't work too hard.

1406
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:56,492
This shit for real?

1407
01:20:59,395 --> 01:21:01,795
Doesn't matter.

1408
01:21:01,797 --> 01:21:04,497
What you should be thinking
about is that fight coming up.

1409
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:06,768
That's the only thing that should
be on your mind, nothing else.

1410
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:09,972
What you mean, don't think about
this? When you starting treatment?

1411
01:21:11,007 --> 01:21:15,009
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

1412
01:21:15,011 --> 01:21:18,679
If you don't jump on this
quick, you're gonna end up dying.

1413
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:20,214
I know.

1414
01:21:20,216 --> 01:21:23,651
And you're all right with that?

1415
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:25,620
I am.

1416
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:27,789
Man, you sound
crazy, man. Give me the keys.

1417
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:29,089
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

1418
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:30,258
I'm not crazy at all.

1419
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,661
If I could take everything that was good

1420
01:21:32,663 --> 01:21:35,296
and put it into a bowl or something

1421
01:21:35,298 --> 01:21:37,232
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to

1422
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:40,166
"buy one more day with my wife,"

1423
01:21:40,168 --> 01:21:41,402
I'd do it.

1424
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:45,238
I would die a happy man, right then.

1425
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,976
Not gonna happen.

1426
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:56,418
So, everything I got has
moved on and I'm here.

1427
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,620
But you know what? It's okay.

1428
01:21:59,622 --> 01:22:01,155
Because I said to myself,

1429
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:04,024
"If I break, if I'm hurt, whatever.

1430
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:06,193
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

1431
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:08,429
And I'm just some bum
just living in your crib,

1432
01:22:08,431 --> 01:22:09,796
just nothing.

1433
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:11,965
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

1434
01:22:11,967 --> 01:22:14,434
But you got your whole future ahead of you.

1435
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:16,439
Mine?

1436
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:21,442
Back there, like all
them guys on that wall.

1437
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:24,844
In the back, in the past.

1438
01:22:24,846 --> 01:22:26,880
We're going nowhere.

1439
01:22:26,882 --> 01:22:29,450
I am to you just an old trainer.

1440
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:33,086
That's what brought us together. You know?

1441
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,557
We're not a real family.

1442
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:42,062
That was just in our heads, kid.

1443
01:22:51,306 --> 01:22:55,277
Oh, what'd you do? What'd you do?

1444
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:06,087
Why'd you say that?

1445
01:23:24,506 --> 01:23:27,342
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

1446
01:23:27,344 --> 01:23:29,444
It's good.

1447
01:23:33,283 --> 01:23:34,883
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

1448
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,183
- Hey!
- What up?

1449
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:38,987
Hi!

1450
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:40,821
You okay?

1451
01:23:40,823 --> 01:23:43,491
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

1452
01:23:43,493 --> 01:23:45,293
Yeah, I'm good. I'm a little nervous.

1453
01:23:45,295 --> 01:23:47,795
There's just a lot of people here,
not really my crowd, you know?

1454
01:23:47,797 --> 01:23:48,897
Yeah, I can see.

1455
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,999
Look, it's the boxing
boy, Lil Apollo Creed.

1456
01:23:51,001 --> 01:23:52,532
I know his girl.

1457
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:53,768
What's up, Bianca?

1458
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:54,835
Hey.

1459
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:56,204
You don't know nobody no more?

1460
01:23:56,206 --> 01:23:57,470
Nah, I said hello to
you when I walked past.

1461
01:23:57,472 --> 01:23:58,606
You didn't say nothing to me.

1462
01:23:58,608 --> 01:24:00,474
Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.

1463
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:02,277
Hey, man, why don't you come
over here and grab this pic

1464
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:03,678
with me real quick for the 'Gram?

1465
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,780
Yeah, that's cool.

1466
01:24:05,782 --> 01:24:07,714
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

1467
01:24:07,716 --> 01:24:09,985
Welcome to my city, champ.

1468
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,387
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

1469
01:24:13,389 --> 01:24:14,888
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

1470
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,290
Don't call me that.

1471
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:18,058
Don't call you that? Don't call you what?

1472
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,263
You just called me "Baby Creed."
I said, don't call me that.

1473
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,231
Hey, fam, dig this. I
was showing you love, man.

1474
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:24,499
You ain't got to come off like that.

1475
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah, that's cool, that's
cool, that's all love.

1476
01:24:26,002 --> 01:24:28,669
I know it's cool. You
definitely know it's cool.

1477
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:30,871
When you talking to me, you
talking real tough, you feel me?

1478
01:24:30,873 --> 01:24:32,639
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

1479
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:35,210
Get a VIP pass next to your
pop, talking to me like that.

1480
01:24:35,212 --> 01:24:36,309
No!

1481
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:37,612
Hold up, nigga!

1482
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,348
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

1483
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:44,218
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1484
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,452
I'll kill your ass!

1485
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:47,487
Donnie! Donnie!

1486
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:48,923
How's he doing?

1487
01:24:48,925 --> 01:24:50,090
He's all right now.

1488
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:51,858
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

1489
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,259
He was fighting with the other inmates.

1490
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:54,629
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

1491
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,097
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

1492
01:24:56,099 --> 01:24:58,133
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

1493
01:24:58,135 --> 01:25:00,101
Yeah.

1494
01:25:00,103 --> 01:25:02,404
Hey, Donnie.

1495
01:25:06,475 --> 01:25:09,610
How you doing, son?

1496
01:25:09,612 --> 01:25:11,946
I know a lot of cops and they said,

1497
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:13,548
"Your friend's locked up."

1498
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:17,286
Friends? You're just
a trainer to me, right?

1499
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:21,656
I'm sorry about what I said
to you, back at the gym.

1500
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:23,357
That was just me talking. I didn't mean it.

1501
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:26,561
You just stay away from me.

1502
01:25:26,563 --> 01:25:27,628
Listen, Donnie...

1503
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,597
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what...

1504
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:31,866
Get your hands off me, old man!

1505
01:25:31,868 --> 01:25:36,003
Get your sick ass out of here!

1506
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,438
Leave!

1507
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,142
You here talking like you my family!
You got my real family killed!

1508
01:25:50,453 --> 01:25:52,987
I ain't leaving

1509
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:56,357
till I tell you what's on my mind.

1510
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,593
You hate me, that's what it is.

1511
01:25:58,595 --> 01:26:00,428
Or maybe you're mad with somebody

1512
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:05,265
who ain't here, Donnie,
who can't defend himself.

1513
01:26:05,267 --> 01:26:06,668
You know?

1514
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:08,937
Now, I understand what you're
going through, young man.

1515
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:10,138
I've been there.

1516
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,572
And I know what it's
like to feel abandoned,

1517
01:26:12,574 --> 01:26:14,674
and be mad at everything.

1518
01:26:14,676 --> 01:26:18,379
And you're a better person than that.

1519
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:21,816
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

1520
01:26:21,818 --> 01:26:25,219
It's taking a toll on you.

1521
01:26:27,355 --> 01:26:31,524
You're still caught in his shadow.

1522
01:26:31,526 --> 01:26:33,928
You got to move, Donnie.

1523
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,332
Just leave, man.

1524
01:27:22,145 --> 01:27:24,947
Let's go, Johnson.

1525
01:27:49,672 --> 01:27:52,572
Bianca!

1526
01:27:52,574 --> 01:27:54,707
Yo! Stop knocking on
my door like the police.

1527
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:55,942
Can you at least let me apologize?

1528
01:27:55,944 --> 01:27:57,277
No, it doesn't work like that.

1529
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:59,246
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone's shirt.

1530
01:27:59,248 --> 01:28:01,348
But you assaulted the headliner to my show,

1531
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,784
a show I worked really hard to get.

1532
01:28:03,786 --> 01:28:05,920
What if I came to your
fight acting like an ass?

1533
01:28:05,922 --> 01:28:08,289
Would that be cool with you?

1534
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:10,391
Nah, I didn't think so.

1535
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:15,095
How'd you do though? You kill it?

1536
01:28:15,097 --> 01:28:16,897
Yeah, we did good.

1537
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:19,232
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

1538
01:28:19,234 --> 01:28:20,634
But I never meant to let you down.

1539
01:28:20,636 --> 01:28:22,702
Then what did you mean to do, D?

1540
01:28:22,704 --> 01:28:25,608
Just have a little ego contest?

1541
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:33,015
Rocky's sick.

1542
01:28:43,158 --> 01:28:44,390
He's got cancer.

1543
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:46,960
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did,

1544
01:28:46,962 --> 01:28:49,129
but I found out right before your show.

1545
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:50,731
How bad is it?

1546
01:28:50,733 --> 01:28:55,371
They want him to start chemo but,
you know, he's too macho to do that.

1547
01:28:56,506 --> 01:28:58,541
Jesus.

1548
01:29:01,677 --> 01:29:05,914
Well, maybe you can
talk some sense into him.

1549
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:09,251
I don't think he'd wanna
hear anything I got to say.

1550
01:29:11,753 --> 01:29:14,488
Yeah, well, give him my love.

1551
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:18,194
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

1552
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,295
Look, we both got a lot going on right now

1553
01:29:21,297 --> 01:29:22,863
so I think you should focus on yours

1554
01:29:22,865 --> 01:29:23,930
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

1555
01:29:23,932 --> 01:29:26,334
I'm sorry.

1556
01:29:26,336 --> 01:29:28,602
What's that mean?

1557
01:29:28,604 --> 01:29:32,339
I get it, I messed up.

1558
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:36,143
I trusted you! Can you
please not shut me out?

1559
01:29:38,614 --> 01:29:42,148
I'm sorry, okay?

1560
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,787
I need you right now.

1561
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:21,121
Nigga, what's up?

1562
01:30:21,123 --> 01:30:23,057
What's up?

1563
01:30:23,059 --> 01:30:26,161
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

1564
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:31,732
Yeah.

1565
01:30:31,734 --> 01:30:34,002
That's what's up.

1566
01:31:17,145 --> 01:31:18,845
Look like you lost five pounds.

1567
01:31:18,847 --> 01:31:21,582
You ought to sit down and eat.

1568
01:31:34,596 --> 01:31:36,429
I mean, what I look like?

1569
01:31:36,431 --> 01:31:40,336
Letting you train me while
you sit around and die?

1570
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:47,107
Just like any other fight.

1571
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:52,246
This fight? I seen it before.

1572
01:31:52,248 --> 01:31:56,116
It gets as bad as it can get

1573
01:31:56,118 --> 01:31:58,684
and most of the time, you don't win it.

1574
01:31:58,686 --> 01:32:00,021
Yeah, but I don't care.

1575
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:02,423
I ain't training if you
don't get the treatment.

1576
01:32:02,425 --> 01:32:05,461
So if I fight, you fight.

1577
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:39,427
- Hey.
- What's up?

1578
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:41,262
You been to the gym?

1579
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,662
Nah, I've been here.

1580
01:32:42,664 --> 01:32:46,000
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

1581
01:32:46,002 --> 01:32:48,168
Get up.

1582
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,469
- Ready?
- What's...

1583
01:32:49,471 --> 01:32:51,037
I want you to shadow box.

1584
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:53,374
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

1585
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,508
You're serious?

1586
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:55,576
Want me to do it for you?

1587
01:32:55,578 --> 01:32:56,643
No. It's all good.

1588
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:58,411
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

1589
01:32:58,413 --> 01:33:00,881
Time!

1590
01:33:00,883 --> 01:33:03,185
There you go.

1591
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:11,058
We used to do that with one hand.

1592
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:15,094
I don't wanna say
anything though.

1593
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:17,430
Two...

1594
01:33:19,301 --> 01:33:20,500
Don't hit the lady.

1595
01:33:21,604 --> 01:33:23,771
She'll probably drop you.

1596
01:33:33,882 --> 01:33:35,482
All right. Come on, almost there.

1597
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:39,020
Come on, Unc.

1598
01:33:43,928 --> 01:33:46,220
Oh, God.

1599
01:34:18,594 --> 01:34:21,065
Come on, let's go.

1600
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,539
Yeah, yes!

1601
01:34:25,538 --> 01:34:28,562
That's your thing, yes! More! Yes!

1602
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:32,244
One. Two? The deal was two!

1603
01:34:32,245 --> 01:34:33,302
I can't, no.

1604
01:34:33,306 --> 01:34:35,575
I'm dizzy.

1605
01:34:45,523 --> 01:34:46,680
Double jab.

1606
01:34:46,689 --> 01:34:48,923
Step on right under there.

1607
01:34:55,498 --> 01:34:56,996
Good.

1608
01:34:56,998 --> 01:34:58,531
At least we got the speed.

1609
01:34:58,533 --> 01:35:03,471
We just need him to sit down so
when he hits something, he breaks it.

1610
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,006
Good.

1611
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:10,710
Step with it, you gotta
step with it. Come on!

1612
01:35:10,712 --> 01:35:12,012
Little bit more.

1613
01:35:12,014 --> 01:35:14,048
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

1614
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,883
Good. Keep it right.

1615
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:18,451
Yes!

1616
01:35:18,453 --> 01:35:19,620
Look, he's doing the same thing.

1617
01:35:19,622 --> 01:35:21,220
Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

1618
01:35:21,222 --> 01:35:24,859
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

1619
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:39,673
Wow, beautiful.

1620
01:35:39,675 --> 01:35:41,375
Yo, you going to see Rock?

1621
01:35:41,377 --> 01:35:43,509
Yeah, let's go!
We got you! Let's go!

1622
01:35:43,511 --> 01:35:46,380
Make history, Creed! Let's go!

1623
01:35:49,217 --> 01:35:52,251
What up? Come on, y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

1624
01:35:52,253 --> 01:35:53,519
That's what I like, man!

1625
01:35:53,521 --> 01:35:57,492
Let's go see Rock on
Front Street! Ride with me!

1626
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,002
You wanna say hello?

1627
01:37:49,038 --> 01:37:50,670
Place looks like a church.

1628
01:37:50,672 --> 01:37:52,205
Yeah, feel like an art museum.

1629
01:37:52,207 --> 01:37:54,407
Yeah, beautiful.

1630
01:37:54,409 --> 01:37:56,811
The fight starts in about two minutes.

1631
01:37:56,813 --> 01:37:58,911
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

1632
01:37:58,913 --> 01:38:01,915
Okay.

1633
01:38:15,163 --> 01:38:16,763
Don't let him get to you.

1634
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:18,732
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming.

1635
01:38:18,734 --> 01:38:21,434
Let's get straight into questions.

1636
01:38:21,436 --> 01:38:23,603
Uh, young lady to the left.

1637
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:26,572
Conlan, can we expect any
more fireworks at the weigh-in?

1638
01:38:26,574 --> 01:38:28,375
I've been doing some
anger management classes

1639
01:38:28,377 --> 01:38:30,477
and trying to control that temper of mine.

1640
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:32,799
I just gotta make sure he
forgets it all by Saturday night.

1641
01:38:35,417 --> 01:38:36,950
Okay, next question.

1642
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:38,418
Young man in the glasses.

1643
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,687
What about the contrast between you two?

1644
01:38:40,689 --> 01:38:42,388
You, the overnight success versus

1645
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:44,457
Conlan's rags to riches background.

1646
01:38:44,459 --> 01:38:45,625
Nothing happened overnight.

1647
01:38:45,627 --> 01:38:46,994
I've been fighting for some time now...

1648
01:38:46,996 --> 01:38:48,762
That's exactly how
it happened for this guy.

1649
01:38:48,764 --> 01:38:51,964
He's an overnight success, never
had a damn fight in his life.

1650
01:38:51,966 --> 01:38:54,534
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

1651
01:38:54,536 --> 01:38:57,269
One more. There's a lot of
talk about legacy in this fight.

1652
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:58,839
Johnson, can you speak to that?

1653
01:38:58,841 --> 01:39:01,008
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

1654
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:03,610
Legacy? Are we at
some kind of comedy club?

1655
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:04,777
The guy next to him,

1656
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:06,847
now that's what we're talking about legacy.

1657
01:39:06,849 --> 01:39:08,314
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

1658
01:39:08,316 --> 01:39:10,384
My father worked on the docks.

1659
01:39:10,386 --> 01:39:12,486
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

1660
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,219
People like Silver Spoon over there...

1661
01:39:14,221 --> 01:39:15,522
You don't know nothing about me.

1662
01:39:15,524 --> 01:39:16,790
I know enough about you.

1663
01:39:16,792 --> 01:39:18,058
- I'm here now though.
- You found yourself here.

1664
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,326
- I'm here now.
- You a false Creed.

1665
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,027
All right, I'll show you
right now. My pops ain't here.

1666
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:22,161
Sit down!

1667
01:39:22,163 --> 01:39:23,530
You wanna fight here? I'll do it right now!

1668
01:39:23,532 --> 01:39:25,799
I can do it right now,
bitch! We can do it right now!

1669
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:28,469
"Creed" my asshole!

1670
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:29,568
Keep it down!

1671
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:30,970
Yo, you okay? Good?

1672
01:39:30,972 --> 01:39:32,305
Yeah, I'm all right.

1673
01:39:32,307 --> 01:39:34,374
Okay, we'll see what's up.

1674
01:39:34,376 --> 01:39:37,878
I'm gonna knock
that smile off your face.

1675
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:46,054
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

1676
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,924
Unc, you okay?

1677
01:39:50,926 --> 01:39:53,360
Yeah, I'm good. Just couldn't sleep.

1678
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:54,494
Yeah, me either.

1679
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,829
Is it okay I sit down?

1680
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:58,098
Course.

1681
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:00,200
Donnie...

1682
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:03,402
I'd like you to do me a
favor when all this is over.

1683
01:40:03,404 --> 01:40:05,138
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

1684
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,040
It's not important but just...

1685
01:40:07,042 --> 01:40:08,709
I wanna lock it in, okay?

1686
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,244
Yeah, you got it.

1687
01:40:10,246 --> 01:40:12,379
There you go.

1688
01:40:14,917 --> 01:40:16,383
You okay, huh?

1689
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:19,119
Yeah, why?

1690
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:21,088
No, you keep looking at the door.

1691
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:23,589
No!

1692
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:26,026
Mmm-mmm.

1693
01:40:28,063 --> 01:40:30,062
Do you hear something?

1694
01:40:30,064 --> 01:40:31,564
No.

1695
01:40:33,802 --> 01:40:35,468
Who is that?

1696
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:37,905
I don't know.

1697
01:40:43,244 --> 01:40:45,912
How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?

1698
01:40:45,914 --> 01:40:47,013
Y'all two are killing me.

1699
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:53,487
Oh, and listen. Would you guys just keep...

1700
01:40:53,489 --> 01:40:54,787
We know.

1701
01:40:54,789 --> 01:40:56,055
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

1702
01:40:56,057 --> 01:40:57,558
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

1703
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,724
Got you.

1704
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,832
You wanna come in?

1705
01:41:05,834 --> 01:41:07,299
Yeah.

1706
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:09,470
Please.

1707
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:25,018
- I got it.
- Good.

1708
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:28,155
All right.

1709
01:41:28,157 --> 01:41:30,324
All right.

1710
01:41:33,561 --> 01:41:35,629
A lot of room.

1711
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:38,531
Didn't we have enough
surprises for one weekend?

1712
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:40,969
That's not me.

1713
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:15,102
Very nice colors.

1714
01:42:15,104 --> 01:42:19,272
Why don't you take 'em into the
other room and see how well they fit.

1715
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:23,311
Yeah.

1716
01:42:24,646 --> 01:42:25,978
Hey, champ.

1717
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,848
All right, Donnie. I'm proud of you.

1718
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:31,652
That's gonna bring him luck.

1719
01:42:53,608 --> 01:42:56,276
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

1720
01:42:56,278 --> 01:42:57,610
That don't matter.

1721
01:42:57,612 --> 01:42:59,912
You've never been this far away from home.

1722
01:42:59,914 --> 01:43:01,348
That don't matter.

1723
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:04,584
What matters is what you leave in that ring

1724
01:43:04,586 --> 01:43:06,753
and what you take back with you.

1725
01:43:06,755 --> 01:43:08,388
You know what that is?

1726
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:11,323
Pride. And knowing that you did your best.

1727
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:13,293
And you're doing it for yourself.

1728
01:43:13,295 --> 01:43:17,863
Not for me, not your
father's memory, but for you.

1729
01:43:17,865 --> 01:43:20,032
I can see in your eyes

1730
01:43:20,034 --> 01:43:23,469
you're gonna do it.

1731
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:24,771
Let's go now.

1732
01:43:24,773 --> 01:43:27,374
Padman.

1733
01:43:29,944 --> 01:43:32,479
Fight's right here.

1734
01:43:34,483 --> 01:43:36,650
Let's go.

1735
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:41,054
Yeah.

1736
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,358
Left hook combination.

1737
01:43:44,993 --> 01:43:46,460
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

1738
01:43:46,462 --> 01:43:49,228
Go up top.

1739
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:51,063
All right, guys, it's time.

1740
01:43:51,065 --> 01:43:52,965
Let's go win a championship!

1741
01:43:52,967 --> 01:43:56,003
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

1742
01:43:59,007 --> 01:44:01,242
Come on, man.

1743
01:44:06,614 --> 01:44:08,849
Let's go.

1744
01:44:25,499 --> 01:44:27,834
I'd always get nervous
during times like this,

1745
01:44:27,836 --> 01:44:31,004
but that's normal, and
it's gonna give you energy.

1746
01:44:31,006 --> 01:44:34,142
Pretty normal. Very normal.

1747
01:45:35,936 --> 01:45:39,073
Go up there and show him who you are!

1748
01:45:42,877 --> 01:45:45,413
Conlan!

1749
01:46:03,431 --> 01:46:05,999
This is what you wanted, and what you got.

1750
01:46:06,001 --> 01:46:09,637
And I want you to enjoy it, okay? Do that.

1751
01:46:12,207 --> 01:46:17,512
Conlan! Conlan!

1752
01:47:26,681 --> 01:47:29,816
<i>Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.</i>

1753
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:33,385
<i>100,000 on their feet for
what may conceivably be</i>

1754
01:47:33,387 --> 01:47:36,187
<i>his last walk to the ring
for a professional fight.</i>

1755
01:47:36,189 --> 01:47:40,026
<i>Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?</i>

1756
01:47:40,028 --> 01:47:42,562
<i>He's got the name.
That's why he's here tonight.</i>

1757
01:47:42,564 --> 01:47:44,330
<i>Does he have the game?</i>

1758
01:47:44,332 --> 01:47:47,534
<i>He's Apollo Creed's son, he's
got Rocky Balboa in his corner.</i>

1759
01:47:47,536 --> 01:47:49,369
<i>But all the legends in the world</i>

1760
01:47:49,371 --> 01:47:52,339
<i>can't help him tonight
if he can't fight.</i>

1761
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:56,977
<i>The question is, can he fight?</i>

1762
01:48:18,932 --> 01:48:21,934
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park</i>

1763
01:48:21,936 --> 01:48:24,437
<i>here in Liverpool, England,</i>

1764
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:27,540
<i>where tonight this
is the main event.</i>

1765
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:29,674
<i>Twelve rounds of boxing</i>

1766
01:48:29,676 --> 01:48:33,112
<i>for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.</i>

1767
01:48:33,114 --> 01:48:35,381
<i>For the thousands in attendance</i>

1768
01:48:35,383 --> 01:48:38,351
<i>and the millions watching
around the world,</i>

1769
01:48:38,353 --> 01:48:39,818
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1770
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:43,291
<i>let's get ready to rumble!</i>

1771
01:48:46,862 --> 01:48:49,963
<i>In the red corner, wearing
the stars and stripes,</i>

1772
01:48:49,965 --> 01:48:54,299
<i>his professional record,
16 fights 16 victories.</i>

1773
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:55,701
<i>The challenger,</i>

1774
01:48:55,703 --> 01:49:01,374
<i>Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!</i>

1775
01:49:01,376 --> 01:49:03,875
<i>And fighting out of the blue corner,</i>

1776
01:49:03,877 --> 01:49:05,612
<i>wearing black with blue,</i>

1777
01:49:05,614 --> 01:49:07,647
<i>with 36 fights,</i>

1778
01:49:07,649 --> 01:49:09,316
<i>28 KOs,</i>

1779
01:49:09,318 --> 01:49:12,617
<i>he's the light heavyweight
champion of the world,</i>

1780
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:20,094
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

1781
01:49:25,499 --> 01:49:28,101
- Okay, let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

1782
01:49:32,707 --> 01:49:34,874
<i>How you doing, lads? You know
what I expect of you both.</i>

1783
01:49:34,876 --> 01:49:36,409
<i>We talked about it
in the locker rooms.</i>

1784
01:49:36,411 --> 01:49:37,576
<i>I want you to protect yourselves</i>

1785
01:49:37,578 --> 01:49:39,345
<i>and obey my commands at all times.</i>

1786
01:49:39,347 --> 01:49:41,414
<i>No low blows, no silly business.</i>

1787
01:49:41,416 --> 01:49:43,683
<i>Keep it clean, will you? Understand?</i>

1788
01:49:43,685 --> 01:49:45,518
<i>Touch gloves.</i>

1789
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,852
Nice shorts, boy.

1790
01:49:46,854 --> 01:49:50,689
Too bad your daddy ain't
here to fight in them.

1791
01:49:50,691 --> 01:49:52,191
You know what?

1792
01:49:52,193 --> 01:49:55,896
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

1793
01:49:58,199 --> 01:49:59,765
- You know what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

1794
01:49:59,767 --> 01:50:02,701
One step, one punch, one round at a time.

1795
01:50:02,703 --> 01:50:04,838
You got this.

1796
01:50:16,251 --> 01:50:18,049
<i>Round one begins.</i>

1797
01:50:18,051 --> 01:50:20,519
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan
in the black trunks,</i>

1798
01:50:20,521 --> 01:50:23,923
<i>and Adonis Creed in the
red, white and blue.</i>

1799
01:50:23,925 --> 01:50:26,826
<i>Conlan is significantly taller</i>

1800
01:50:26,828 --> 01:50:29,362
<i>and thinks it will be
easy to use his jab</i>

1801
01:50:29,364 --> 01:50:31,263
<i>to keep young Creed at bay.</i>

1802
01:50:31,265 --> 01:50:32,631
<i>You can
see right away, Jim,</i>

1803
01:50:32,633 --> 01:50:34,901
<i>how much more relaxed Conlan
is. He's been there before.</i>

1804
01:50:34,903 --> 01:50:36,434
Move your head!

1805
01:50:36,436 --> 01:50:37,737
Keep your left up!

1806
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:39,071
<i>That kind
of nervous energy</i>

1807
01:50:39,073 --> 01:50:40,705
<i>can wear you out as
the fight goes on.</i>

1808
01:50:40,707 --> 01:50:42,575
<i>Hard left hook by
Conlan. Creed backs off.</i>

1809
01:50:42,577 --> 01:50:44,343
<i>It's not easy
to just jump right into</i>

1810
01:50:44,345 --> 01:50:45,911
<i>the major leagues like this,</i>

1811
01:50:45,913 --> 01:50:47,680
<i>having never fought an
opponent like Conlan.</i>

1812
01:50:47,682 --> 01:50:50,049
<i>Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.</i>

1813
01:50:50,051 --> 01:50:52,885
<i>Creed trying to get close to
Conlan, against the ropes.</i>

1814
01:50:52,887 --> 01:50:56,054
<i>Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.</i>

1815
01:50:56,056 --> 01:50:58,456
<i>Creed lands a jab,
Conlan grins at it.</i>

1816
01:50:58,458 --> 01:51:00,125
<i>Conlan fires a hard body punch,</i>

1817
01:51:00,127 --> 01:51:01,693
<i>hits him hard with a right cross</i>

1818
01:51:01,695 --> 01:51:03,496
<i>and backs Creed into the ropes.</i>

1819
01:51:03,498 --> 01:51:05,197
- Break!
- Ref, come on!

1820
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:06,531
Keep it clean!

1821
01:51:06,533 --> 01:51:07,967
<i>And he gets a
warning from the referee.</i>

1822
01:51:07,969 --> 01:51:09,902
<i>Creed kinda
woke him up with that shot</i>

1823
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:12,304
<i>and Conlan really
made him pay for it.</i>

1824
01:51:12,306 --> 01:51:15,442
<i>Creed ready
to let his hands go.</i>

1825
01:51:15,444 --> 01:51:17,376
<i>Creed misses and gets hit in return.</i>

1826
01:51:17,378 --> 01:51:19,379
To your corner! One!

1827
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:20,780
<i>Perfect uppercut on the inside.</i>

1828
01:51:20,782 --> 01:51:21,981
- <i>Down goes Creed.</i>
- Two!

1829
01:51:21,983 --> 01:51:23,482
- Three! Four!
- I'm good. I'm good!

1830
01:51:23,484 --> 01:51:25,384
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

1831
01:51:25,386 --> 01:51:26,852
Shake it off!

1832
01:51:26,854 --> 01:51:28,720
<i>But already a
knockdown for Ricky Conlan.</i>

1833
01:51:28,722 --> 01:51:29,789
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1834
01:51:29,791 --> 01:51:30,889
- Are you sure?
- I'm good!

1835
01:51:30,891 --> 01:51:32,892
Fight!

1836
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:36,728
<i>Conlan lands
a shot after the bell,</i>

1837
01:51:36,730 --> 01:51:38,764
<i>and round one was all Ricky Conlan.</i>

1838
01:51:38,766 --> 01:51:42,602
Real for you now, boy? Real for you now?

1839
01:51:45,506 --> 01:51:47,106
- How's the eye?
- Little bloody.

1840
01:51:47,108 --> 01:51:48,773
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

1841
01:51:48,775 --> 01:51:50,142
I'm gonna knock his ass out.

1842
01:51:50,144 --> 01:51:51,678
Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

1843
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,112
You keep making mistakes like that,

1844
01:51:53,114 --> 01:51:55,214
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

1845
01:51:55,216 --> 01:51:58,586
<i>Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.</i>

1846
01:51:59,886 --> 01:52:01,787
Come on, baby. What you doing?

1847
01:52:01,789 --> 01:52:03,656
Here's what I want you to do.

1848
01:52:03,658 --> 01:52:05,790
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

1849
01:52:05,792 --> 01:52:08,728
When he leaves it out there, drop
that right hook and smash him, okay?

1850
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,396
Stay focused.

1851
01:52:10,398 --> 01:52:13,232
<i>So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.</i>

1852
01:52:13,234 --> 01:52:16,434
<i>And now, after a discussion with
Rocky Balboa between rounds,</i>

1853
01:52:16,436 --> 01:52:18,170
<i>he comes in for more.</i>

1854
01:52:18,172 --> 01:52:21,540
<i>Conlan showed his power with the
uppercut at the end of round one,</i>

1855
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:24,110
<i>goes back to boxing
to begin the second.</i>

1856
01:52:24,112 --> 01:52:25,245
Be first!

1857
01:52:25,247 --> 01:52:26,412
Keep the pressure on, Rick!

1858
01:52:26,414 --> 01:52:28,513
<i>Logic says
Creed needs to find</i>

1859
01:52:28,515 --> 01:52:30,649
<i>a way to get inside
of Conlan's long arms</i>

1860
01:52:30,651 --> 01:52:32,684
<i>and create pressure on the inside.</i>

1861
01:52:32,686 --> 01:52:33,952
Come on! Come on!

1862
01:52:33,954 --> 01:52:37,322
<i>So far, it's
still mostly Ricky Conlan.</i>

1863
01:52:37,324 --> 01:52:39,024
<i>Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.</i>

1864
01:52:39,026 --> 01:52:40,259
Keep your hands up!

1865
01:52:40,261 --> 01:52:41,695
<i>Drives Creed into the corner again.</i>

1866
01:52:41,697 --> 01:52:43,996
Tie him up!

1867
01:52:43,998 --> 01:52:47,433
<i>Creed wraps him up and
pulls him in to stop the onslaught.</i>

1868
01:52:47,435 --> 01:52:49,369
You the champ, right, huh?

1869
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:50,769
You the champ?

1870
01:52:50,771 --> 01:52:52,805
Show me. Come on!

1871
01:52:54,274 --> 01:52:56,642
<i>There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!</i>

1872
01:52:56,644 --> 01:52:59,079
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1873
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,215
<i>Creed misses wildly,
and they are going toe-to-toe.</i>

1874
01:53:04,217 --> 01:53:06,219
<i>Rapidly becoming
a phone booth fight!</i>

1875
01:53:06,221 --> 01:53:07,519
Go! Go!

1876
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:09,555
<i>Trading punches,
right hand, left hand!</i>

1877
01:53:09,557 --> 01:53:10,822
<i>Both guys landing!</i>

1878
01:53:10,824 --> 01:53:12,390
<i>This is unbelievable action!</i>

1879
01:53:12,392 --> 01:53:13,893
Double hook! Come on!

1880
01:53:13,895 --> 01:53:16,027
<i>Hard right hand by Creed.</i>

1881
01:53:16,029 --> 01:53:17,295
You bleed just like me!

1882
01:53:17,297 --> 01:53:18,531
Go to your corners! Come on!

1883
01:53:18,533 --> 01:53:19,698
You bleed just like me!

1884
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,934
Man! That ain't shit!

1885
01:53:21,936 --> 01:53:23,969
<i>He loves
it! If Conlan thought</i>

1886
01:53:23,971 --> 01:53:25,905
<i>he had a pushover,
he knows better now!</i>

1887
01:53:25,907 --> 01:53:27,138
He bleed like me!

1888
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,340
You belong in here!

1889
01:53:28,342 --> 01:53:30,143
They don't know what you've been through

1890
01:53:30,145 --> 01:53:31,978
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

1891
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,545
I don't want you trading blows with him.

1892
01:53:33,547 --> 01:53:35,481
I want you to protect yourself.

1893
01:53:35,483 --> 01:53:36,714
Keep your distance!

1894
01:53:36,716 --> 01:53:38,050
I'm gonna smash this kid to bits.

1895
01:53:38,052 --> 01:53:40,186
Now he knows you're for real.

1896
01:53:40,188 --> 01:53:41,521
You gotta believe you can do it.

1897
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,656
<i>That was such a big round for Creed.</i>

1898
01:53:43,658 --> 01:53:46,558
<i>Not just on the scorecards but
psychologically going forward, Jim.</i>

1899
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,059
You woke up a sleeping giant.

1900
01:53:48,061 --> 01:53:50,095
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

1901
01:53:50,097 --> 01:53:52,865
<i>Adonis, looking more and
more comfortable against the champ</i>

1902
01:53:52,867 --> 01:53:56,235
<i>seems to have found his rhythm.</i>

1903
01:53:56,237 --> 01:53:58,605
Go finish him off.

1904
01:54:00,707 --> 01:54:02,241
<i>This has
devolved into a slugfest!</i>

1905
01:54:02,243 --> 01:54:03,343
One punch at a time!

1906
01:54:03,345 --> 01:54:04,677
Come on, D!

1907
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:07,412
<i>Conlan trying to
punish Creed at short range.</i>

1908
01:54:07,414 --> 01:54:08,615
Finish him now!

1909
01:54:08,617 --> 01:54:11,416
<i>Big combination
to end the third by Conlan</i>

1910
01:54:11,418 --> 01:54:13,018
<i>and Creed does not know where he is,</i>

1911
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,821
<i>walking to the wrong corner there.</i>

1912
01:54:14,823 --> 01:54:16,022
His arm is long.

1913
01:54:16,024 --> 01:54:18,390
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

1914
01:54:18,392 --> 01:54:19,457
Be patient.

1915
01:54:19,459 --> 01:54:21,427
One step, one punch.

1916
01:54:21,429 --> 01:54:23,062
- One round at a time.
- There you go.

1917
01:54:23,064 --> 01:54:24,964
<i>One step, one punch,</i>

1918
01:54:24,966 --> 01:54:26,933
<i>one round at a time.</i>

1919
01:54:26,935 --> 01:54:29,701
<i>Round five of a scheduled 12 and
already it's a far different fight</i>

1920
01:54:29,703 --> 01:54:31,170
<i>than most experts expected.</i>

1921
01:54:31,172 --> 01:54:32,338
He's just a pretender.

1922
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:34,205
He's lucky to be in the same
ring with you hitting him.

1923
01:54:34,207 --> 01:54:35,273
Remember that.

1924
01:54:35,275 --> 01:54:36,842
<i>Adonis Creed has succeeded in</i>

1925
01:54:36,844 --> 01:54:40,847
<i>pressuring Ricky Conlan
and making him fight.</i>

1926
01:55:02,837 --> 01:55:04,836
<i>Creed has proven
plenty in this fight.</i>

1927
01:55:04,838 --> 01:55:06,839
<i>He's taken it, he's given it back.</i>

1928
01:55:06,841 --> 01:55:08,808
<i>But he does not look like a match</i>

1929
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,643
<i>for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.</i>

1930
01:55:10,645 --> 01:55:12,111
You're going through hell out there

1931
01:55:12,113 --> 01:55:13,278
but you're hurting him, too.

1932
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,647
I can see it in his eyes.

1933
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:16,314
You're not as far behind as you think.

1934
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:18,351
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

1935
01:55:18,353 --> 01:55:20,518
get underneath him, and
you'll be able to rip him.

1936
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,987
You gotta push him back.

1937
01:55:21,989 --> 01:55:25,023
<i>Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.</i>

1938
01:55:25,025 --> 01:55:27,060
Donnie, step under!

1939
01:55:28,329 --> 01:55:30,028
- Yes!
- Come on, Ricky!

1940
01:55:30,030 --> 01:55:32,598
<i>There are moments when
Creed is assertively taking over.</i>

1941
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,133
<i>But there's a hard counter right,</i>

1942
01:55:34,135 --> 01:55:35,768
<i>drives Creed back into the corner.</i>

1943
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:37,769
<i>Just when it appears Creed
might be taking control</i>

1944
01:55:37,771 --> 01:55:40,005
<i>Conlan comes close
to knocking him down.</i>

1945
01:55:40,007 --> 01:55:41,139
Use that pressure.

1946
01:55:41,141 --> 01:55:42,575
You are the one that's in the driving seat.

1947
01:55:42,577 --> 01:55:44,043
He's not used to this level, all right?

1948
01:55:44,045 --> 01:55:45,611
Get 'em on the rope.

1949
01:55:45,613 --> 01:55:47,412
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

1950
01:55:47,414 --> 01:55:48,548
Boy's fast.

1951
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,983
Hey! It's you against you.

1952
01:55:50,985 --> 01:55:52,552
- Me against me.
- That's right.

1953
01:55:52,554 --> 01:55:53,952
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

1954
01:55:53,954 --> 01:55:55,454
Get him out of the way! Let's go!

1955
01:55:55,456 --> 01:55:58,857
<i>Not only is young
Adonis Creed still in the ring,</i>

1956
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:01,862
<i>he may be in the fight.</i>

1957
01:56:02,963 --> 01:56:05,296
<i>Hard left hand by Creed.</i>

1958
01:56:05,298 --> 01:56:07,767
<i>Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite</i>

1959
01:56:07,769 --> 01:56:11,504
<i>pounding young Creed with right
hands as you saw right there.</i>

1960
01:56:14,508 --> 01:56:16,207
Bring back everything that's ever hurt you.

1961
01:56:16,209 --> 01:56:19,445
All the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.

1962
01:56:19,447 --> 01:56:23,648
Put it in both fists, and I want
you to drive it through his body

1963
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:26,085
and I promise you, his head will fall.

1964
01:56:26,087 --> 01:56:27,652
<i>We're into
the part of the fight</i>

1965
01:56:27,654 --> 01:56:29,888
<i>where all your instincts
come into play.</i>

1966
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:32,023
<i>Most experts expected that Conlan</i>

1967
01:56:32,025 --> 01:56:34,058
<i>would avoid trading shots with Creed</i>

1968
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:35,195
<i>but he's trading willingly.</i>

1969
01:56:36,297 --> 01:56:37,830
<i>Creed fires
a hard body punch.</i>

1970
01:56:37,832 --> 01:56:39,732
<i>Conlan in trouble!</i>

1971
01:56:39,734 --> 01:56:42,268
- <i>Hard left hand to the body.</i>
- Oh, yeah!

1972
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:44,070
<i>The champ
is in bad shape, Jim.</i>

1973
01:56:44,072 --> 01:56:46,237
<i>Creed realized
he has a better chance</i>

1974
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:49,409
<i>of hurting Conlan to the
body than to the head!</i>

1975
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:51,544
<i>- What an uppercut!</i>
- No!

1976
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:53,545
<i>And Creed staggers back.</i>

1977
01:56:53,547 --> 01:56:55,313
Body! Body!

1978
01:56:55,315 --> 01:56:57,282
<i>To the
body, trading shots!</i>

1979
01:56:57,284 --> 01:56:58,483
<i>Pawing with his jab,</i>

1980
01:56:58,485 --> 01:56:59,818
<i>Creed looks to land one big shot.</i>

1981
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:01,620
Move your legs!

1982
01:57:27,981 --> 01:57:30,251
Donnie, get up!

1983
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:34,152
Get up, D!

1984
01:57:34,154 --> 01:57:36,322
Come on, baby.

1985
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:44,998
Stitch!

1986
01:57:51,739 --> 01:57:53,339
<i>Creed just got up</i>

1987
01:57:53,341 --> 01:57:54,772
- <i>like a man possessed.</i>
- You okay? Look at me!

1988
01:57:54,774 --> 01:57:56,409
<i>- He was out!</i>
- Donnie!

1989
01:57:56,411 --> 01:57:58,811
<i>Down but not out. Conlan
thinks he's celebrating a knockout.</i>

1990
01:57:58,813 --> 01:58:00,246
Get down! He's getting up!

1991
01:58:00,248 --> 01:58:02,548
<i>But the referee
is dusting Creed's gloves.</i>

1992
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,948
You're good.

1993
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:07,219
<i>Creed beats the count
and the action begins again.</i>

1994
01:58:07,221 --> 01:58:08,854
<i>That's the
heart of a champion.</i>

1995
01:58:08,856 --> 01:58:10,622
<i>He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.</i>

1996
01:58:10,624 --> 01:58:12,023
Donnie, be ready!

1997
01:58:12,025 --> 01:58:14,994
<i>More work to do for
Conlan. Body shot. Body shot.</i>

1998
01:58:14,996 --> 01:58:16,963
<i>Trying to set Creed
up one more time.</i>

1999
01:58:16,965 --> 01:58:19,867
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

2000
01:58:21,769 --> 01:58:24,402
<i>Stitch has done a
great job over that right eye</i>

2001
01:58:24,404 --> 01:58:26,938
<i>but now the left eye looks
like it's almost shut.</i>

2002
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:28,706
<i>Closing up.</i>

2003
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:30,241
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to...

2004
01:58:30,243 --> 01:58:31,742
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

2005
01:58:31,744 --> 01:58:34,080
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

2006
01:58:34,082 --> 01:58:35,147
I'm good.

2007
01:58:35,149 --> 01:58:36,281
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

2008
01:58:36,283 --> 01:58:38,084
- You sure about that?
- I am. I'm good.

2009
01:58:38,086 --> 01:58:40,251
<i>He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.</i>

2010
01:58:40,253 --> 01:58:41,853
<i>Left eye completely closed.</i>

2011
01:58:41,855 --> 01:58:43,287
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

2012
01:58:43,289 --> 01:58:45,090
Let me see the eye.

2013
01:58:45,092 --> 01:58:46,424
Time! Doc, give him a look!

2014
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:49,562
All right. Show me your eye.

2015
01:58:49,564 --> 01:58:51,464
Show me your eye, Adonis!

2016
01:58:51,466 --> 01:58:53,299
How many fingers?

2017
01:58:53,301 --> 01:58:54,800
How many fingers?

2018
01:58:54,802 --> 01:58:56,268
How many, Adonis?

2019
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:59,071
- Four.
- And again.

2020
01:58:59,073 --> 01:59:01,273
Two.

2021
01:59:01,275 --> 01:59:02,407
Time in!

2022
01:59:02,409 --> 01:59:04,009
All right. Breathe through your mouth.

2023
01:59:04,011 --> 01:59:06,012
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

2024
01:59:06,014 --> 01:59:07,579
You are up on the cards,
you're winning this.

2025
01:59:07,581 --> 01:59:08,781
You are gonna win this!

2026
01:59:08,783 --> 01:59:10,348
But just keep smart and keep away from him.

2027
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:12,652
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

2028
01:59:12,654 --> 01:59:14,253
I should've stopped the
fight with your father.

2029
01:59:14,255 --> 01:59:15,554
I'm stopping this one now.

2030
01:59:15,556 --> 01:59:17,956
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

2031
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:20,793
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

2032
01:59:20,795 --> 01:59:22,962
I'm not a mistake.

2033
01:59:26,234 --> 01:59:28,933
Look at me. I never got
a chance to thank Apollo

2034
01:59:28,935 --> 01:59:31,202
for helping me out after Mickey died.

2035
01:59:31,204 --> 01:59:33,406
But it's nothing compared
to what you've done.

2036
01:59:33,408 --> 01:59:35,107
You taught me how to fight again

2037
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:37,041
and I'm gonna go home and
I'm gonna fight this thing.

2038
01:59:37,043 --> 01:59:39,245
But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.

2039
01:59:39,247 --> 01:59:41,246
I want you to go across this ring

2040
01:59:41,248 --> 01:59:42,814
and knock that son of a bitch down.

2041
01:59:42,816 --> 01:59:44,683
Can you do it?

2042
01:59:44,685 --> 01:59:45,884
Say it.

2043
01:59:45,886 --> 01:59:47,451
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

2044
01:59:47,453 --> 01:59:48,887
I know you are. You know why?

2045
01:59:48,889 --> 01:59:50,789
Because you're a Creed and I love you, kid.

2046
01:59:50,791 --> 01:59:52,023
- I love you too.
- Go on.

2047
01:59:52,025 --> 01:59:54,461
All right, baby, let's go.

2048
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:59,333
Go get him, Donnie!

2049
02:00:02,036 --> 02:00:03,936
<i>Round 12 begins.</i>

2050
02:00:03,938 --> 02:00:07,740
<i>Virtually no one outside of Adonis
Creed's family and group of friends</i>

2051
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,508
<i>would ever have expected to see him</i>

2052
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:12,577
<i>in a 12th round against
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan</i>

2053
02:00:12,579 --> 02:00:16,482
<i>and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.</i>

2054
02:00:16,484 --> 02:00:19,085
<i>And there's a
hard left hook upstairs.</i>

2055
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:20,553
Yeah!

2056
02:00:20,555 --> 02:00:22,920
<i>Every time you wanna
say it's the beginning of the end</i>

2057
02:00:22,922 --> 02:00:26,924
<i>the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.</i>

2058
02:00:26,926 --> 02:00:28,460
<i>Hard right hand by Conlan.</i>

2059
02:00:28,462 --> 02:00:30,495
Come on! Don't sit there!

2060
02:00:30,497 --> 02:00:32,430
<i>They're trading shots</i>

2061
02:00:32,432 --> 02:00:34,299
<i>in the kind of back and forth action</i>

2062
02:00:34,301 --> 02:00:37,738
<i>that most of us
didn't expect to see.</i>

2063
02:00:38,972 --> 02:00:40,171
<i>Creed getting hit</i>

2064
02:00:40,173 --> 02:00:42,808
<i>with some hard shots but
landing some of his own,</i>

2065
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:44,977
<i>and Adonis is firing back!</i>

2066
02:00:44,979 --> 02:00:46,978
<i>Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.</i>

2067
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:48,814
- Ricky, nail him!
- Come on, kid!

2068
02:00:50,952 --> 02:00:53,518
<i>Creed spins, puts
the champ in the corner!</i>

2069
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,987
Body! Body!

2070
02:00:54,989 --> 02:00:57,656
<i>Throwing body
shots like he's Rocky Balboa!</i>

2071
02:00:57,658 --> 02:01:00,259
<i>Going upstairs like
he's Apollo Creed!</i>

2072
02:01:00,261 --> 02:01:01,427
Knock his ass out!

2073
02:01:01,429 --> 02:01:03,829
<i>Closing
seconds of the fight!</i>

2074
02:01:03,831 --> 02:01:06,330
Ricky!

2075
02:01:06,332 --> 02:01:07,866
That's what I'm talking about!

2076
02:01:07,868 --> 02:01:09,434
<i>Conlan is down!</i>

2077
02:01:09,436 --> 02:01:13,039
<i>That is the first time in his
career he's been on the canvas.</i>

2078
02:01:13,041 --> 02:01:17,375
<i>You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.</i>

2079
02:01:17,377 --> 02:01:19,210
- Ricky, get up!
- Stay down!

2080
02:01:19,212 --> 02:01:21,046
- Stay down!
- Six!

2081
02:01:21,048 --> 02:01:22,714
<i>- Dramatic count in Liverpool.</i>
- Seven! Eight!

2082
02:01:22,716 --> 02:01:25,017
<i>He must get up to
preserve his chance to win the fight.</i>

2083
02:01:25,019 --> 02:01:26,085
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

2084
02:01:26,087 --> 02:01:27,451
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

2085
02:01:27,453 --> 02:01:28,620
- He's up!
- What?

2086
02:01:28,622 --> 02:01:29,821
<i>The bell sounds,</i>

2087
02:01:29,823 --> 02:01:32,156
<i>so Conlan survives the 12th round!</i>

2088
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:33,726
<i>What a finish!</i>

2089
02:01:33,728 --> 02:01:37,295
<i>If that round goes another 30
seconds, we may have a new champion.</i>

2090
02:01:37,297 --> 02:01:40,631
<i>An unforgettable fight
on an unforgettable night!</i>

2091
02:01:40,633 --> 02:01:43,434
<i>He's no longer just the
namesake of Apollo Creed,</i>

2092
02:01:43,436 --> 02:01:45,237
<i>he's the living embodiment.</i>

2093
02:01:45,239 --> 02:01:46,571
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2094
02:01:46,573 --> 02:01:51,477
<i>a round of applause for these
two warriors in the ring!</i>

2095
02:01:51,479 --> 02:01:55,915
<i>To the winner by split decision</i>

2096
02:01:55,917 --> 02:01:58,918
<i>and still the undefeated
champion of the world...</i>

2097
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,485
You did great, kid.

2098
02:02:00,487 --> 02:02:02,219
<i>"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!</i>

2099
02:02:02,221 --> 02:02:03,354
Donnie, you were robbed.

2100
02:02:03,356 --> 02:02:06,358
If this fight had been 10 seconds longer...

2101
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:07,759
10 seconds longer...

2102
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:09,762
Creed.

2103
02:02:12,666 --> 02:02:14,032
You go and get it, chum.

2104
02:02:14,034 --> 02:02:15,666
You the future of this division.

2105
02:02:15,668 --> 02:02:17,503
You wear that name with pride.

2106
02:02:17,505 --> 02:02:19,437
Respect.

2107
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:22,506
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

2108
02:02:22,508 --> 02:02:25,544
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

2109
02:02:25,546 --> 02:02:27,112
Even though I know she's
mad at me for doing this.

2110
02:02:27,114 --> 02:02:28,847
<i>Hopefully I made her proud.</i>

2111
02:02:28,849 --> 02:02:31,549
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

2112
02:02:31,551 --> 02:02:32,750
I got my family right here.

2113
02:02:32,752 --> 02:02:36,088
Without them, none of this
would've been possible.

2114
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:40,125
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

2115
02:02:40,127 --> 02:02:41,294
What does that mean to you?

2116
02:02:41,296 --> 02:02:44,728
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

2117
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:48,899
He's a real fighter, and he's
helping me fight a few things,

2118
02:02:48,901 --> 02:02:51,303
so I appreciate it. I really do.

2119
02:02:51,305 --> 02:02:54,305
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

2120
02:02:54,307 --> 02:02:57,844
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

2121
02:03:01,148 --> 02:03:04,082
I'll just tell him that I love him

2122
02:03:04,084 --> 02:03:07,219
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

2123
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:11,024
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

2124
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:13,826
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations

2125
02:03:13,828 --> 02:03:16,661
on a sensational performance. Jim.

2126
02:03:16,663 --> 02:03:20,901
Creed! Creed! Creed!

2127
02:03:24,271 --> 02:03:25,336
Go on.

2128
02:03:25,338 --> 02:03:28,607
Talk to them. Go on!

2129
02:03:49,797 --> 02:03:52,129
<i>This crowd
is up on its feet.</i>

2130
02:03:52,131 --> 02:03:54,198
<i>No one wants to leave the arena.</i>

2131
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:57,736
<i>Everyone in here knows they've
seen something special.</i>

2132
02:03:57,738 --> 02:03:59,536
<i>A fight they'll never forget.</i>

2133
02:03:59,538 --> 02:04:01,839
<i>Ricky Conlan wins the fight.</i>

2134
02:04:01,841 --> 02:04:05,378
<i>Adonis Creed wins the night.</i>

2135
02:04:24,465 --> 02:04:26,697
This is it?

2136
02:04:26,699 --> 02:04:28,734
Yeah.

2137
02:04:31,838 --> 02:04:34,238
I just wanna see if I
can get up these steps.

2138
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,941
When's the first time you came here?

2139
02:04:35,943 --> 02:04:38,878
I was 12.

2140
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,315
I think it's my favorite place.

2141
02:04:47,186 --> 02:04:50,321
When you get to the top

2142
02:04:50,323 --> 02:04:52,992
you think you can fly.

2143
02:05:10,711 --> 02:05:13,044
Almost there.

2144
02:05:13,046 --> 02:05:15,515
You got this.

2145
02:05:22,155 --> 02:05:23,222
Come on, young man.

2146
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:24,455
Just let me catch my breath.

2147
02:05:24,457 --> 02:05:26,625
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

2148
02:05:26,627 --> 02:05:28,559
Just a minute.

2149
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:30,629
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

2150
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:33,933
Let's go. One step at a time.

2151
02:05:33,935 --> 02:05:36,468
Yeah.

2152
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:39,638
Come on.

2153
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:43,541
One step at a time. Who told you that?

2154
02:05:43,543 --> 02:05:44,776
Some old guy.

2155
02:05:44,778 --> 02:05:47,246
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

2156
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:53,652
I think they added a few more steps.

2157
02:05:53,654 --> 02:05:54,853
I don't know.

2158
02:05:54,855 --> 02:05:56,021
Almost there.

2159
02:05:56,023 --> 02:05:57,923
I'm gonna take these last two.

2160
02:05:57,925 --> 02:05:59,724
One more step.

2161
02:05:59,726 --> 02:06:00,893
How you feeling?

2162
02:06:00,895 --> 02:06:04,197
Oh, good. Really good.

2163
02:06:09,269 --> 02:06:10,568
You all right there, old man?

2164
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:12,771
Yeah.

2165
02:06:12,773 --> 02:06:15,275
Nice view.

2166
02:06:18,444 --> 02:06:22,580
If you look hard enough, you can
see your whole life from up here.

2167
02:06:22,582 --> 02:06:24,281
How does it look?

2168
02:06:24,283 --> 02:06:27,751
Not bad at all. And you?

2169
02:06:27,753 --> 02:06:30,423
Not bad at all.
